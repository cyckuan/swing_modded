EDITORIAL: DIPLOMATIC PRINCIPLES FOR KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, April 8:
</P>
<P>
   As Serbian forces continue to advance across Kosovo in a brutal
campaign of ethnic cleansing, talking about the terms of a
political settlement may seem premature. But with diplomatic
activity stirring and NATO's air strikes starting to undercut
Slobodan Milosevic's military base, it is not too early for the
Clinton administration to start thinking about the broad shape of
an acceptable peace deal. President Clinton has led the way this
week by forcefully enunciating some core principles that are likely
to be at the center of discussions between the United States,
Russia and other nations now pursuing a diplomatic track.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's idea of a reasonable resolution is deformed but
cunning. In recent days Belgrade has tried to create the illusion
that the conflict is winding down by saying that refugees can
return safely to their homes, that Serbia can work with ethnic
Albanian leaders to develop their own plan for political autonomy
in Kosovo and that three captured American soldiers may soon be
freed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO cannot accept on trust such Serbian assurances. It must, as
Clinton has said, aim for an outcome that effectively insures the
security of Kosovo, shields the resettlement of the hundreds of
thousands of ethnic Albanians who have been evicted and guarantees
a high degree of autonomy for Kosovo. Montenegro, another part of
Yugoslavia, should also be assured that its autonomy and democratic
government will not become the next target of Serbian aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely how those objectives can be achieved will depend in
large part on how much damage NATO can inflict on the Serbian
military before a cease-fire is put in place. The greater the
damage, the more leverage NATO will have in negotiations. Given the
uncertainties on the military front, it would be unwise for
Washington and its allies to spell out a detailed peace plan in
advance of negotiations. If Russia is to play a productive role in
ending the conflict, something the White House is now wisely
encouraging, Clinton will have to persuade Moscow to accept NATO's
conditions, or a close approximation.
</P>
<P>
   With his murderous assault on Kosovo, Milosevic has shown that
in the future Kosovo should be democratically self-governed and
free of Serbian intimidation. But it ought not to be an independent
country. Though many of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians might prefer
outright independence, the creation by NATO of a sovereign nation
in Kosovo would invite further conflict there by humiliating the
Serbs. It would also create an unrealistic and potentially
dangerous model for resolving ethnic disputes elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Whether autonomy comes through partition, the creation of a NATO
or United Nations protectorate or some other arrangement remains
uncertain. But it is abundantly clear that a substantial
international peacekeeping force will be needed to insure that
autonomy is preserved and Serbian forces cannot again terrorize the
people of Kosovo. To make such a force more acceptable to Serbia,
it ought to include Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian political and military leaders should be held
accountable in some fashion for the killing they sanctioned in
Kosovo. If international investigators confirm refugee accounts
that Serbian forces have executed thousands of ethnic Albanians,
the men responsible for these atrocities should be indicted by the
war crimes tribunal in The Hague and eventually brought to justice.
The Serbian government should help pay for the reconstruction of
villages burned by Milosevic's forces. This war may not end any
time soon, but when it does, Serbia must give up its destructive
role in the Balkans.

EDITORIAL: POLITICS AND THE WATERSHED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, April 8:
</P>
<P>
   There is no higher environmental priority for New York City than
protection of the watershed around the upstate reservoirs that
supply 10 million people with high-quality drinking water at
remarkably low prices. But in recent months there have been
disturbing signs that the city's devotion to this vital task is not
as strong as it ought to be. There have also been charges from the
environmental community that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has allowed his
statewide political ambitions to compromise his commitment to
watershed protection.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's people insist that his interest has not wavered, and
we hope they are right. Whatever happens to him politically,
Giuliani will surely not want to be remembered as the mayor who
betrayed a historic opportunity to preserve one of the city's great
assets. Nor will he wish to be remembered as the mayor whose
inattentiveness or ambition saddled the taxpayers with a $6 billion
filtration plant that the city will be required to build if it does
not keep the watershed clean.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one recent decision is profoundly suspicious. Late last year
a deputy commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental
Protection, Dr. William Stasiuk, asked the Army Corps of Engineers
to help the city prevent development on thousands of acres of small
wetlands that are vital to the health of the watershed. After
various upstate officials and developers complained, Stasiuk's
boss, Commissioner Joel Miele, withdrew the request, saying that
the watershed needed no special protections. His decision
astonished the Corps and the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Miele says that politics was not involved and that his
department has sufficient powers to protect small wetlands. But his
and the state's authority over wetlands under 12.4 acres is very
shaky. Only the Corps can block the destruction of these smaller
wetlands, where a lot of development and damage to the watershed
actually occurs.
</P>
<P>
   A historic 1997 agreement to save the watershed empowered the
city to regulate its development. In exchange the city had to
provide funds to upgrade sewage treatment plants in the watershed,
repair many of the region's 128,000 septic tanks, acquire thousands
of acres for buffer zones around the reservoirs and underwrite
innovative conservation programs. There has been progress on many
fronts.
</P>
<P>
   But there have also been glitches. The EPA was distressed to
learn last fall that the city had allowed developers to build
septic tanks on steeply sloping hills, contrary to its own rules.
An environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, has
accused the city of not moving aggressively enough to protect the
Kensico Reservoir, a vital basin near White Plains that funnels 90
percent of the water from upstate to the city. Now comes the city's
rebuff to the Corps of Engineers on the wetlands question. If these
concessions keep adding up, the watershed could be lost, and with
it a legacy that Giuliani should be proud to leave.

EDITORIAL: A BIG LOSS FOR THE NRA

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, April 8:
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association poured $3.8 million into its bid
to win passage of a ballot referendum in Missouri that would have
lifted the state's longstanding prohibition against carrying a
concealed weapon _ at least three times the amount spent by the
other side. But Missouri voters proved too sensible to be swayed.
On Tuesday they defeated the ``right to carry'' referendum, and the
idea of looser gun laws, by a 52-to-48 percent margin.
</P>
<P>
   Although a majority of state legislatures have passed
concealed-weapons laws at the behest of NRA lobbyists, this is the
first time the matter has been put before voters. For the NRA,
which grandly billed the showdown over the Missouri referendum as
``the last great gun battle of the 20th century,'' the outcome was
a major defeat that can only add to the momentum for reasonable gun
control. The Clinton administration, particularly Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who taped an effective message pointing out the proposal's
dangers, can justly take pride in the outcome. So can Missouri's
Democratic governor, Mel Carnahan, who strongly opposed the ballot
measure. Sen. John Ashcroft, a Republican, actively supported the
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   The national Republican Party, if it is smart, will heed this
week's loud message from the nation's heartland. This is an apt
moment to consider declaring independence from the NRA. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Aprill 8:
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization, which is supposed to be the key
element of an open and fair international trading system, faces
major challenges just as it is on the verge of being leaderless.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO handed down a reasonable ruling this week allowing the
United States to raise tariffs on European goods in retaliation for
Europe's failure to abide by previous WTO rulings that its banana
regime wrongly discriminates against bananas imported by American
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than promise to comply, European officials are talking
about an appeal of the ruling, although it is final under the WTO
system. Instead, Europe should move to comply with the rules in
bananas as well as in beef, where it has also failed to carry out a
W.T.O. panel decision.
</P>
<P>
   The prime mover in making the WTO function effectively must be
its director general, who needs to be able to negotiate and arrange
compromises at the same time he makes clear that rules must be
followed. Renato Ruggiero, who steps down at the end of this month
as director general, has done a reasonable job, but as the beef and
banana controversies illustrate, his successor will face a
formidable task.
</P>
<P>
   Either of the two candidates _ Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's
deputy prime minister, or Michael Moore, a former prime minister of
New Zealand _ might be able to do the job. But there appears to be
a deadlock in choosing a leader. The United States is backing
Moore, but has said it would not block Supachai. Europe is split
between the two. It is imperative that a new leader be chosen
before Ruggiero leaves.

GIULIANI AND SAFIR TRY TO PUSH POLITENESS CARDS AT A ROLL-CALL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir went to a roll call at a Harlem station house Wednesday
morning to bring their campaign for a more polite police force to
officers on the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   As a platoon of officers from the 32nd Precinct stood at
attention at 7 a.m., the mayor and the police commissioner
explained their plan to try to improve relations between the police
and the public, which have been strained since the fatal shooting
of Amadou Diallo on Feb. 4. Under the initiative, all officers are
being given wallet-sized cue cards reminding them to call people
``Sir'' or ``Ma'am,'' and to say ``Hello'' and ``Thank You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not meant to insult you; it's not meant to tell you that
you don't know how to say `Sir' or `Ma'am' and to say, `Thank
you,''' Safir said. He said the cards would remind officers that
``as you're doing your job and a lot of things are going on and
people are losing their heads, you need to keep yours.''
</P>
<P>
   The police officers listened politely, in the way that members
of paramilitary organizations are obliged to listen when their
commanders speak: They stood at attention, ramrod straight with
chins up, shoes polished to a shine.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that the plan was a simple one. ``I think on
purpose it's a very, very transparent campaign,'' he told the
officers. ``We want you to go the extra mile to act nicer; we want
you to go the extra mile to act more respectful. Go out of your way
so people can see that. Because we want to get them to do the same
thing with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the cards _ much like the ones officers now get to
remind them of the Miranda warnings _ has not exactly been popular
with officers on the beat. Interviews with a half-dozen officers
yielded polite, but off-the-record, criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has got to carry a card to deal with the public
shouldn't be on the job,'' said one Brooklyn detective with 18
years of experience. ``You've got to give respect to get respect.''
</P>
<P>
   A police officer in Manhattan joked about the new insistence on
honorific titles: ``You mean I can't say, `Hey mope, get over here'
anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor's and the police commissioner's visit to the
station house had another purpose: to heighten the department's
morale, which has sagged in the two months since the shooting of
Diallo led to intense scrutiny _ and criticism _ of the Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the job of the mayor is described as the second
toughest job in America,'' Giuliani told them. ``It isn't. In fact,
your job is more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor told the officers that when he had to make a decision,
he usually had the luxury of time and a team of advisers to help
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can think about it,'' he said. ``I can reflect on it. But
even with all that, as you read in the newspapers, a fair number of
times I make the wrong decision. You've got to make decisions on
the spur of the moment and it's difficult. And very, very often
it's under circumstances that most people don't have to face in
their entire lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the mayor, the police commissioner and the assembled
commanders left the small muster room to the more routine aspects
of a morning roll call. A lieutenant took attendance and gave the
officers their daily instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Then the officers were sent out to pick up their radios and hit
the streets.

NOT GUILTY OF MURDER DUE TO INSANITY, KILLER SEEKS RELEASE FROM
MENTAL HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. _ During the years he has spent in state
psychiatric hospitals, Albert Fentress has been a model patient,
his lawyer says.
</P>
<P>
   He teaches desktop publishing to other patients and helps run a
small business. He has made hundreds of supervised trips to
museums, ball games and picnics. His doctors even let him roam the
hospital grounds unescorted.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another Albert Fentress _ or at least there once
was.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors remember the man who, as a high school teacher
in Poughkeepsie, tortured, killed and cannibalized an 18-year-old
youth who wandered into his backyard. And they are now trying to
persuade a state Supreme Court jury of six men and women here to
keep Fentress confined to a psychiatric hospital in Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   Fentress, 57, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity in
1980 for the killing of Paul Masters, is contesting the latest in a
series of decisions by state judges to extend his confinement at
Pilgrim State Hospital in Brentwood. If he wins, he could be
transferred to a halfway house with little supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Under New York criminal law, patients are allowed to ask for a
rehearing before another judge or for a jury trial. Only a handful
have ever chosen to be tried by a jury, state officials say, and
none were on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeding, which began on Tuesday, has placed participants
on each side in unusual positions. The state's lawyers _ two from
the attorney general's office, representing the Office of Mental
Health, and a prosecutor from the Dutchess County district
attorney's office _ are arguing that the state's treatment has
completely failed Fentress. They must prove that Fentress remains
mentally ill and that, if released, he would be a danger to the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Fentress' lawyer, Kim L. Darrow, of the state's Mental Hygiene
Legal Service, is expected to call members of Fentress' treatment
team at the hospital, including at least two doctors and others who
have worked with him, so they will be cross-examined by lawyers for
their employer, the state Office of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   In Darrow's view, his client has been a real success story at
Pilgrim: His desktop publishing students now sell their work to
community groups. His therapists think enough of him to let him
walk freely about the grounds, which are not bounded by walls or
barbed wire. And until his father died last year, Fentress made
day-long visits to him at his home in Melville in Suffolk County as
often as once a week, driven there in a van by a hospital aide, as
he is now for his appearances in court.
</P>
<P>
   But in testimony Wednesday, a psychiatrist hired by the mental
health agency, Frederic L. Gannon, said Fentress remained as ill as
he was when he killed Masters. ``For 18 years there's been no
change,'' said Gannon, of Brooklyn, who interviewed Fentress in
December. ``He hasn't made any movement yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gannon warned that Fentress _ who scowled, his lips pursed,
throughout the doctor's testimony _ showed the symptoms of a
``classic case for suicide.'' That creates an even greater danger
to others, he said. ``Based on his rigidity about himself, his
obsessive-compulsiveness, his high standards for himself, the
scenario of suicide would be for him to repeat the act of his
crime,'' killing someone else to justify his suicide, Gannon said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing Dutchess County, the assistant district
attorney, Wayne R. Witherwax, is a former eighth-grade student of
Fentress' and the son of the detective who was the lead
investigator in the Masters killing. He was a college sophomore
home on summer break when his father was summoned to the crime
scene.

BRYANT SAYS HE'S `FINE' WITH BEING BENCHED TUESDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ If it hadn't already happened twice to Shaquille
O'Neal, it might have been a surprise to see Kobe Bryant lifted in
the fourth quarter of a close game Tuesday night. But Los Angeles
Lakers coach Kurt Rambis is showing no hesitancy to remove his
stars if it's the right move, and in this case, Bryant knew exactly
why he was called to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz forward Shandon Anderson, Bryant's defensive assignment,
had just rattled off three layups while Bryant strayed from the
game plan. The Lakers fell to a double-digit deficit and then a
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple bad decisions, bad judgment on my part and a couple
of other players,'' Bryant said Wednesday. ``I just made a couple
mistakes, and that's it. They were huge mistakes. It's good to get
them out of the way now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Bryant was the only culprit, and not that those were
his only mistakes. The coach also pulled him in the first half
after Bryant got a little out of control on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine with it,'' Bryant said. ``I told Kurt, I continuously
tell him, `I'm with you. Whatever decision you want to make, I'm
with you.' Obviously, I don't like being taken out of games at any
point, because you always wanna play. But I'm always with Kurt
whatever he wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rambis doesn't bother lecturing Bryant on why he pulled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Bryant said sheepishly, ``he pretty much knows that I
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ty's time?: Tyronn Lue thrilled the Lakers faithful and
teammates alike with his 12-point debut against Utah, but Rambis
won't say yet if the rookie point guard will have a continuing role
in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens,'' Rambis said. ``I didn't do it (play
Lue) for any other reason than a feel-thing, pick up the tempo a
little bit and see how the game goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lue ended up playing 23 minutes, more than starter Derek Harper
or ailing backup Derek Fisher. That wasn't necessarily the plan,
but Rambis said he planned to play Lue even before Fisher's knee
tendinitis flared up and sidelined him.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, for one, wouldn't mind a regular dose of Lue in the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not? The more he plays, the more his confidence is gonna
go up and the better he's gonna play,'' Bryant said. And his play
Tuesday? ``Loved it, loved it, loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Fisher recovered from his tendinitis Wednesday and
played the majority of the first half in relief of Harper against
Sacramento.

HOPE LIFTS POW'S EX-NEIGHBORS, FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA AND LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After seven anguish-filled days since Serbians
captured her son, Vivian Ramirez clung to a message of hope
Wednesday that he could be freed shortly with two other American
POWs.
</P>
<P>
   Word that the acting president of Cyprus could win the soldiers'
release as soon as today raced through Ramirez's East Los Angeles
neighborhood, as hundreds added signed cards to the growing tribute
of yellow flowers, candles and balloons outside his home.
</P>
<P>
   With the possibility that her son, Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez,
could be released soon, Vivian Ramirez prepared to fly to Cyprus to
meet him. Still, she expressed cautious optimism that the days of
prayer might be over for her and for the mothers of Spc. Steven M.
Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas; and Staff Sgt. Christopher J.
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mother, I can only share with you the deep concern I have
not only for my son, but the other two mothers and how they feel
about their sons as well,'' Vivian Ramirez said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely hopeful the negotiations will begin immediately
and the entire world will join in praying for peace and the release
of our POWs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense and the U.S. Army were ready to escort
Ramirez's mother to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's actually in very good spirits,'' said Dina
Tank-Schoettlin, an aide to Bob Archuleta, Los Angeles County
commissioner for military and veteran affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's hopeful that she'll be joining Andrew soon. She
expressed her deep gratitude to the nation for not forgetting the
POWs.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the Ramirez family and concerned strangers alike
gathered outside the East Los Angeles home to offer their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mother, I understand how hard it must be and I wouldn't
wish this on my worst enemy,'' said Leticia Mendoza, a Montebello
resident who last year moved away from Andrew Ramirez's block, but
returned Wednesday to try to talk to the family. ``We're with them
in spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ramirez's cousin, Olivia Rodriguez, said the family
understands the obstacles that stand in the way of a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully the president will do what he's capable of doing.
But he's dealing with unrealistic people. The people you're dealing
with are the same ones exiling their own people,'' Rodriguez said
from the family's St. Alphonsus Church in East Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said President Clinton called the soldier's mother,
Vivian Ramirez on Easter to console her. Vice President Al Gore
called Ramirez on Tuesday to wish her well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave her optimism that (Andy's) going to return ...
Basically, he told her to hold on and to have faith and continue
her prayers,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the sergeant's parents are in contact with Pentagon
officials and are on standby to travel to Germany. If efforts
succeed, that's where they would meet their son, who would travel
through the Mediterranean island nation of Cyprus upon his release,
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, family members keep updated with the latest news
reports, poring over newspapers, checking the Internet and flipping
through TV channels for newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just waiting to see if it's true,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad Perez Garcia, who once baby-sat Andrew Ramirez when he
was a youngster, said she was saddened by the news of his capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God that soon all of this will be resolved,'' said Perez
Garcia, who tied a yellow ribbon and U.S. flag to her front porch.
``I go to Mass and pray to God for him and his family because we're
all family.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Rios, a longtime Ramirez family friend, said she plans to
organize the neighborhood's first block party when Ramirez is
released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been just heartbroken and very worried because he's so
far away, and how do we know that he has not been mistreated?''
said Rios, who was pleased to learn of his possible release. ``It's
good news, but at the same time ... I won't believe it until I see
it. We've never had a block party before, but it will be the first
and hopefully the biggest.'' &QL;

DIAMONDBACKS STILL RATTLED BY BRUSHBACK PITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson doesn't
know what the Arizona Diamondbacks' beef is with the pitch Chan Ho
Park threw Tuesday behind Matt Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona right-hander Todd Stottlemyre, who opposed Park, was
lamenting on his decision not to bean any of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day after the benches cleared in Tuesday's sixth
inning, but nothing had calmed down. In fact, Stottlemyre talked
about a sleepless night he experienced after not brushing back, or
plunking, one of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to look in Matt Williams' eyes,'' Stottlemyre said
before the teams completed their three-game series Wednesday. ``It
still keeps me up all night. These are the guys, in the locker
room, you go to war with, they become part of your family. What
upsets me is you have a decision to make and you have to be real
responsible for the decision you make, and what keeps you up all
night is, does Matt Williams know I'm going to get his back.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams homered earlier in the game, then hit a long foul ball
off Park. The next pitched sailed behind Williams, but Park
maintained it was unintentional. Johnson, as expected, backed up
his pitcher, saying there was no reason to hit a batter late in a
tie game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Diamondbacks are emphatic in their belief that the pitch
was thrown with purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Park) can say it slipped,'' Stottlemyre said. ``I just know I
never threw a ball behind a person when I wasn't trying to. What
kills me is Davey said we shouldn't take it that way. I guess we
should take our (butt) kickin' and like it.... We took it
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson also said the incident may not be over, especially
since the teams meet Monday in Phoenix to begin a four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything to retaliate,'' Johnson said.
``If they blatantly try to drill one of my guys, I don't think our
guys are going to react to that with kid gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Speaking of beanballs: &UR; !off! &LR;  While he was on the topic
of brushback pitches and the such, Johnson talked about former
Dodgers right-hander Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The all-time head-hunter is now in Boston. Pedro Martinez,''
Johnson said. ``He was the worst. He had a no-hitter in Montreal
and hit Reggie (Sanders) twice. It wasn't with leg shots, it was
high up.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!HR king's anniversary: &UR; !off! &LR;  It was 25 years ago tonight
Hank Aaron hit his 715th career homer off L.A.'s Al Downing to
break Babe Ruth's home run record. Johnson was Aaron's teammate on
the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the memories I have are of the man, not so much the
event,'' Johnson said. ``Once you got to know him, you just knew it
was inevitable. When he wanted it to happen, it was going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what a great individual. All through it, he did everything
he could to lessen the media hype because he didn't want it to
affect the team. He was adamant about that the whole time, that it
was an individual accomplishment, but what was important is the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Johnson was also a teammate of Sadaharu Oh with the
Yomiuri Giants when Oh hit his 715th career homer.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Extra innings: &UR; !off! &LR;  Todd Hundley caught his third
straight game, but was moved from second to fifth in the Dodgers
lineup while Devon White was moved from fifth to second. Hundley
was 1 for his first 10 at the plate, and Johnson said Paul Lo Duca
will make his first start of the season today.... Right-hander
Antonio Osuna (right elbow soreness) will begin a rehab assignment
with Single-A San Bernardino on Saturday against Lake Elsinore....
The Dodgers had six stolen bases in seven attempts through their
first two games. They recorded their sixth stolen base last year in
their sixth game. &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

MILK PRICES DECLINE AS GROCERY CHAINS PASS ALONG SAVINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Even as gasoline prices soar, the cost of one
semiprecious fluid has dropped dramatically this week.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a state-mandated cut in prices charged by California
dairies, the retail price for a gallon of milk has fallen by about
50 cents at the state's largest grocery chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just reflects the price decrease we're getting from
suppliers,'' Terry O'Neil, a spokesman for Ralphs Grocery Co., said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ralphs has reduced the price of its milk by 50 cents per gallon
across the board, O'Neil said. At Lucky stores, prices have dropped
between 35 cents and 55 cents per gallon, with whole milk
experiencing the biggest decline to $3.44 per gallon. A Vons
spokesman said his chain has cut prices by up to 57 cents per
gallon, with a half-gallon of whole milk currently on sale for 99
cents.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread cuts originated with the state Department of Food
and Agriculture, which April 1 trimmed a record 50 cents per gallon
off the regulated minimum paid to state dairy farmers -- from $1.71
per gallon to $1.21 per gallon. Department officials cited a
nationwide increase in the supply of milk for the drop.
</P>
<P>
   While the state intervened to reduce wholesale prices, it's up
to retailers to pass on the savings to consumers. And for the most
part, that appears to be happening. Even smaller mom-and-pop stores
have cut prices. At Dale's Junior Store in Sherman Oaks, for
example, manager Don Plautz said the market has cut its price for
one gallon of whole milk by 40 cents to $3.59.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it awesome?'' said Myrlys Williams, a spokeswoman for
the California Department of Food and Agriculture. While prices
typically drop in early spring, the current decline is the biggest
in the state's history, Williams said. ``And we owe it all to the
very kind-hearted and gracious retailers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   California, the nation's biggest milk producer, also has the
most expensive milk, which critics blame on a combination of state
price regulations, higher quality standards and alleged gouging by
big grocery chains. State agricultural officials and dairy farmers
counter that the price is higher because state law requires milk to
be fortified with vitamins, driving up costs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the high cost of California milk is a separate state
law that mandates that the product can't be sold for less than it
cost to produce. In other states, retailers often sell milk as a
``loss leader,'' hoping it will draw in shoppers who end up buying
other groceries. A state senator from San Francisco recently
introduced a bill in the Legislature that would allow retailers to
sell milk below what it cost to make.
</P>
<P>
   Mad About Milk, a group of out-of-state dairies lobbying for
access to the California market, claims that because of
protectionist barriers against milk imports, California consumers
pay $650 million more per year than their counterparts in
neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   The group is trying to get state lawmakers to lower California's
standards for milk to meet the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
nutritional guidelines used by the country's 49 other states.

WITH VAUGHN OUT, WHO'S ON FIRST?

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mo Vaughn's tumble into the Cleveland Indians'
dugout Tuesday left the Anaheim Angels' $80-million first baseman
limping on a sprained left ankle, forcing some shifts in the Angels
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad, who did not play a single inning at first base
during spring training, started Wednesday night in Vaughn's place.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Palmeiro gave up his seat on the bench to play Erstad's
spot in left field and bat leadoff. Erstad last played first base
during the final week of last season against the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like riding a bike. You don't forget,'' Collins said of
Erstad. ``I watched him take ground balls today. He'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad wasn't so sure about how he'd do after being away from
first. ``I don't know ... we'll find out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Railing removed: The Indians offered no help for Vaughn as he
approached the top of the dugout steps. He never looked down to see
where he was for fear of losing sight of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame anybody in that situation,'' Vaughn said. ``It's
my responsibility to take care of myself.
</P>
<P>
   When Anaheim Stadium was renovated and became Edison Field in
1997, the dugouts initially had railing about three feet high with
netting, separating the playing field from the dugout. But manager
Terry Collins asked that the railing be removed because ``I didn't
like 'em. But I never felt we were going to have an $80 million
first baseman either.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoulder worries Edmonds: Center fielder Jim Edmonds plans to be
ready to come off the disabled list when he's eligible Wednesday.
His biggest problem now is not the strained groin, but the cyst
buried in the muscle of his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds has had a sore shoulder going back to last season, but
he aggravated the condition lifting weights last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like if Gary (DiSarcina) didn't show up to spring
training early, he'd be in the lineup right now,'' Edmonds said.
``And if I had a lazy Saturday afternoon and didn't work out, I'd
be in the lineup. (Stuff) happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds said it hasn't been determined if he'll have the cyst
drained or will allow it to heal on its own.

Control belongs to Cubs
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The Astros never got the fuse lit on their explosive offense, and
the pitching staff was a time bomb waiting to detonate.
</P>
<P>
   The undesirable combination of poor pitching and scarce hitting
caused the Astros to implode en route to a 9-2 loss against the
Chicago Cubs on Wednesday night at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd all like to think we could get everything out of our
system and it only cost us one loss in the standings,'' Astros
manager Larry Dierker said. ``Hopefully, we'll find out (today)
that it really is out of our system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly had enough things go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of it occurring on the pitcher's mound, where the Astros
issued nine walks and hit two batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the hardest thing to watch,'' Dierker said. ``It's
frustrating when you don't even give your fielders a chance. The
two things you can't defend are walks and home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Starter Mike Hampton avoided the home-run portion of that
equation; not so the walks. Hampton struggled with his location,
walking five batters in a brief 3-inning stint that forced an early
appearance by the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My (pitches) were moving like I wanted them to, but my
location just wasn't there, and I never got into a rhythm,'' said
Hampton, who allowed seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just disappointed that I put us in a hole so early and put
our backs against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros trailed 4-1 when Hampton left, and it was painfully
obvious the offense was not in the comeback mode that defined the
team's success in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs starter Kevin Tapani had quite a bit to do with the
inefficiency Wednesday, holding the Astros to four hits in six
innings. Tapani, who won 19 games in 1998, got plenty of support
from his offense, which banged out 12 hits _ five for extra bases.
</P>
<P>
   Astros killer Glenallen Hill had four RBIs and Mickey Morandini
had three despite sitting out the first four innings in favor of
Jeff Blauser, who started at second base.
</P>
<P>
   The first five hitters in the Cubs lineup produced eight of the
12 hits and drove in all nine runs. The Astros scratched out five
hits _ none coming from the top three spots in the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those games where Tapani was on and we were
off,'' said Astros right fielder Derek Bell, who hits second _
sandwiched between Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani was stingy with the hits, but he did give the Astros a
few breaks, walking five batters in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, you can't get away with that kind of stuff,'' Tapani
said. ``I was hoping to get out of there before they did get to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took a 1-0 lead in the second inning on a single by
rookie catcher Mitch Meluskey, who collected his first career RBI.
Richard Hidalgo and Bill Spiers also had hits for the Astros in the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Little did they know that would represent 60 percent of their
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of (the second) inning, we never put
anything together,'' Spiers said. ``You usually don't see a pitcher
be on like Tapani was this early in the season, but he was. Any
time you don't put any hits together, you know the pitcher is on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (0-1) struck out three of the first nine batters he
faced, but the Cubs struck back in the third inning, scoring three
runs on five hits, two on a single by Hill. Sammy Sosa had a RBI
double in the inning on his first hit of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs pushed the lead to 4-1 in the fourth when Tapani scored
on Mark Grace's sacrifice fly. Hampton issued three walks in the
inning, the last of them prompting Dierker to summon Brian Williams
from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs were 1-for-9 against Hampton on their first trip
through the order and 6-for-13 in their subsequent at-bats against
the Astros lefthander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you one thing,'' Hampton said. ``I've got to challenge
the hitters a lot more than I did. I've got to take it to them
rather than letting them take it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams bailed Hampton out of trouble in the fourth but created
a bit of chaos in the fifth when he hit two batters, threw a wild
pitch and issued a walk. Williams managed to limit the damage to
one run; Benito Santiago scored when Williams hit Morandini with
the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``My adrenalin was flowing,'' Williams said. ``The thing that
frustrated me was hitting the guy after I had got ahead in the
count. I got a little upset with myself after that, but I still
feel like I kept us in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros pulled within three in the fifth when Bell scored on
a two-out single by Carl Everett. But it was only a tease. The Cubs
scored two runs in each of the last two innings, courtesy of a
two-run homer by Hill and a two-run triple by Morandini.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who feasts on Astros pitching, put the game out of reach
with his blast off reliever Doug Henry. Hill has a .299 career
batting average with nine homers and 28 RBIs against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Henry's conclusion: ``It was just an ugly game all around.''

Nothing to salvage from Astros debacle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that the stadium formerly known as the Ballpark at Union
Station has a new name _ Enron Field _ sooner or later we're going
to have to change the Killer B's nickname to something more
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it will be the Gashouse Gang _ Y2K version.
</P>
<P>
   But after Wednesday night's 9-2 Astros debacle at the hands of
the free-swinging Chicago Cubs, obviously it's going to have to be
later. By any name, this one stunk.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it was one night. Just one night out of 162.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night the Astros surely will be able to forget, and
apparently many fans forgot even before the first pitch was thrown
_ just 23,381 fans showed up after the 51,000-plus crowd of opening
night.
</P>
<P>
   But the B's, the Astros pitching and the game were anything but
a gas, gas, gas, unless you count the kind that usually begins with
all-you-can-eat hot wings and ends with plop-plop, fizz-fizz.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those games,'' said Astros second-baseman Craig Biggio,
who was hitless for the second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to talk about anything negative,'' outfielder
Derek Bell said, pausing long after making that pledge as if
searching for something good to cull from the night.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's silence was perhaps the best thing you could say about
this sluggish, sloppy night, on which the B's went 0-for-10,
starter Mike Hampton struggled to find the plate, and the Cubs
played wall ball from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   A purging performance
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us would like to think we can get everything
out of our system and only take one loss from it,'' Astros skipper
Larry Dierker said. ``We got a lot of bad things out of our system
tonight. It was an off night.''
</P>
<P>
   On the hill, Astros pitchers walked nine batters and hit a pair,
including Mickey Morandini by Brian Williams in the fifth inning to
bring in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton never found the plate, and relievers Williams and Doug
Henry were not nearly as sharp as they showed in the spring. The
only 1-2-3 inning for Astros pitchers came in the seventh, after
the Cubs already had comfortable control.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't even give your fielders a chance when you walk that
many,'' Dierker said. ``Compared to last night, it was a dull
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was at the plate where the usually dependable Astros
bats went silent against Cubs starter Kevin Tapani.
</P>
<P>
   The best dribblers in the house proved to be not the various San
Antonio Spurs and Rockets players who showed up for Wednesday's
game, but the Astros batters. For the second night in a row, the
best Astros offense came only from the players with the most to
prove _ Carl Everett, Richard Hidalgo and rookie Mitch Meluskey.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the ball just dribbled off Astros bats. The Killer
B's were not in midseason form, or even preseason form. It was more
like postseason form, like a cross between Atlanta two seasons ago
and San Diego last year.
</P>
<P>
   Counting Tuesday night, the B's now are 2-for-21.
</P>
<P>
   Two out of three are bad
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a lot of guys on base and took advantage, and we
didn't swing the bats very well,'' Biggio said. ``We didn't do two
of the three most important aspects of the game. Hitting and
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   And really, Astros fielding got the gold star on this night only
by default.
</P>
<P>
   The scorebook said the Astros committed only one error, an
eventual two-run blunder by Ricky Gutierrez in the ninth. But all
night there were plays that on most nights, normal nights, the
Astros would have made.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo sailed a throw to the plate trying to throw out Sammy
Sosa that not even David Robinson, seated behind home plate, could
have reached.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell could have saved at least one run with a tailor-made
double-play line drive by the Cubs' Mark Grace, but could not
convert. Bagwell later ho-hummed a grounder down the first-base
line that looked foul, but was called fair and wound up being a
two-run triple by Morandini.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have games like that,'' Bell said. ``Tapani
was on and we were off.''
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed panicked over it all and, really, why should they?
It's a long season, another title could be on the way and a year
from now at the Gashouse, when the gang is slamming doubles and
triples all over the place, Wednesday night's misery will be a
distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   But it was indeed miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad night,'' Dierker said. ``Just throw it out.''

TEEN FELONS GET RICH ON PAPER WITH INVESTING GAME 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time for the Stock Market Game at Black Canyon School, and
student teacher Charlotte Scott is prodding students to put some
thought into their picks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of buying stocks just because they went up the day
before, she suggests they zero in on hot trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss, we haven't been out in a while,'' piped up 16-year-old
Janie. ``I don't know what's popular.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules are a little different when teenage criminals play the
popular investing game.
</P>
<P>
   Black Canyon is a juvenile detention center in north Phoenix, a
last resort for judges who run out of patience and options for the
most troubled kids.
</P>
<P>
   Janie, who's from Mesa, has been here for 11 months for
violation of probation and drug abuse. She sits next to Melissa, a
16-year-old from Phoenix in the third month of her second stint,
this time for violating parole.
</P>
<P>
   They are on one of two Black Canyon teams playing the game, in a
class not called economics or math, but life management. The game's
been played in tough places before, schools in gang havens and
slums, but this is believed to be the first instance of players who
must be escorted to class and locked up at night.
</P>
<P>
   The streets most of these kids grew up on couldn't be farther
from Wall Street, but they've mastered the game on their first try.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the Black Canyon School boys' team had the
fattest portfolio of the 835 teams in the state. The team still is
in the running to win its division, ranking second after seven
weeks. The girls' team is poised to place in its division, sitting
in fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so excited,'' said Toni Erman, the Black Canyon
teacher who brought the game to campus and directs the winning
teams.
</P>
<P>
   There are already plans for a party if the students prevail,
with David Gaspar, director of the Arizona Department of Juvenile
Corrections, on the guest list and non-institutional food on the
menu. The students won't be able to go to the official awards party
at Ed Debevic's diner in Phoenix because they can't leave Black
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Erman heard about the Stock Market Game a couple years ago and
waded through the state bureaucracy to get the OK to play it at the
school because she thought it would teach valuable lessons to the
troubled kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're figuring out they can earn money in an honest way,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some kids resisted, arguing they could earn more selling drugs,
but many have come to like the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's risky _ and they like risk,'' Erman said.
</P>
<P>
   That the boys have turned $100,000 into $151,000, the girls into
$141,960 _ 51 percent and 42 percent returns, respectively, in
seven weeks _ would seem to suggest some stockpicking secrets, but
the inmates play the game much like other students.
</P>
<P>
   The goal: gun for gains. The competition, which uses play money,
lasts 10 weeks, so the emphasis is on quick hits, not long-term
successes.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy, one of the boys' first picks, wasn't moving up, so they
quickly dumped it.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year or so, the way to riches in the national game
has been Internet stocks, which often move more in a day than most
stocks move in a year.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper article tacked to a bulletin board in Erman's
classroom talks about how Yahoo!, America Online and other ``.com''
wonders propelled students to the top places in last fall's contest
in Arizona. So that's where the Black Canyon kids _ who share one
computer with Internet access, outside Erman's classroom _ started.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' and girls' teams each bought Amazon.com, AOL and
Yahoo!.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just all looked at what was going up. We just went from
there,'' said Brian, a lanky 17-year-old from Tucson who's been at
Black Canyon for three months for violating parole and possessing
drug paraphernalia. He dropped out of high school in 10th grade for
``lack of interest'' but is due to take the high-school equivalency
exam later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Brian is one of the team leaders, taking charge along with Karl,
a 17-year-old who used to attend Alchesay High School on the Fort
Apache Indian Reservation in Whiteriver, the school where Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar served as volunteer assistant basketball coach this
past season. Karl was sent to Black Canyon two months ago for
cocaine possession.
</P>
<P>
   Brian slides into the desk by Erman's desk the second he enters
the classroom, flipping open the newspaper's business pages to the
stock tables. He and Karl, a husky teen with a buzz cut, search the
listings for the team's stocks, not sure whether they're traded on
the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rare chance to read the paper; inmates aren't allowed to
read or listen to the news for fear of keeping up with gangs and
other trouble lurking on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of my only contacts with the outside world,'' Karl
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both say they've had some exposure to investing. Brian's
stepfather occasionally talks stocks at the dinner table and Karl's
grandfather invests in stocks and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week, Karl suggested they look into buying Pfizer,
the giant pharmaceutical company. His interest was piqued by a new
estrogen product he heard about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll see an increase in their stock price,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They ask Erman to research Pfizer and IBM on her home computer.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely they'll just end up buying more Amazon or Yahoo! or
AOL, however. When a classmate reads an article on Iridium, the
maker of the global satellite-telephone network with a beat-up
stock price, Karl suggests they can't afford a turnaround stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would maybe be a good stock to buy for the long term,''
he said. ``We've got to stick with the active stocks and see if
they do it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   With the contest drawing to a close, the girls also talk about
dumping everything else and buying more Internet stocks. Janie and
Melissa, who sit slumped in their desks in the back of the room,
recommend selling Harley-Davidson, Xylan and Ameritrade and bulking
up on Amazon, Yahoo! and AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be wasting our money on things that aren't doing
good,'' Melissa said.
</P>
<P>
   Janie has more selfish reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want first place,'' she said. ``I want a party.'' &QL;

MOVIE MAKERS LEAVING L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Movie production off studio lots in Los Angeles
County fell dramatically in the first three months of the year,
reflecting the lure of lower-cost locations such as Canada and
tighter Hollywood budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Off-lot production was down a whopping 21 percent in the first
quarter of 1999 compared with '98, according to figures released by
the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. March shoots alone
plunged 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The first-quarter decline in movie activity follows a 12.7
percent decline for all of last year. The Motion Picture
Association of America underscored the trend last month when it
reported that the average cost of a 1998 major studio film declined
1.3 percent to $52.7 million after jumping 34 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thompson, owner of the Van Nuys-based Real to Reel
location-scouting service, said Wednesday that leakage to foreign
locations has become a major concern for Hollywood's core work
force, those performing ``below-the-line'' tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense that I get is that it's a big problem because it
seems like the foreign market is really starting to boom,'' he
said. ``Canada and Australia are really doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say studios have decided it makes more
financial sense to produce modestly budgeted movies with
blockbuster potential such as ``There's Something About Mary'' than
to commit to a nine-figure movie like ``Godzilla'' that might not
live up to its hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The activity is very much as we anticipated,'' said Cody
Cluff, president of the Entertainment Industry Development Corp.
``Studios are cutting back on the number of features and the size
of budgets. The big difference is that in 1996 and 1997, we saw a
lot of $85 million and $100 million projects; now we're seeing a
lot of $40 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller budgets mean shorter production schedules, Cluff noted.
``If you're a producer, you still spend the same amount on talent,
but not as much on the bottom line,'' said Cluff, whose agency
issues about 80 percent of off-lot permits in Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson agreed. ``Budgets are getting tighter,'' he said. ``It
used to be 60 percent was spent below the line; now it's
reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same story in Orange County, normally the recipient of
spillover shooting from Hollywood. ``We're seeing a lot of
big-budget projects put on hold and a lot more lower-cost films
from independents,'' said Debi Hausdorfer, managing director of the
Orange County Film Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The squeeze on dollars also means that producers continue to
succumb to the lure of out-of-state locations, dazzled by such
come-ons as lower labor costs, tax rebates and freebie permits and
police.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Canadian province of Manitoba tripled its
production revenues to $50 million for its fiscal year ended March
31 after it instituted a stunning 35 percent rebate for use of
Canadian labor.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Vivier, Manitoba's film commissioner, predicted the
province will double that total this year. ``Our locations are
different from Los Angeles, so it's hard to say what we're taking
away,'' she added. ``We're getting two or three inquiries a day and
scouting a project a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Cluff said feature activity in Los Angeles County has picked up
recently with several prominent projects under way including ``End
of Days'' with Arnold Schwarzenegger, ``Town and Country'' with
Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton, and ``Hanging Up'' with Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent projects scheduled locally: Warner Bros.'
``Space Cowboys'' with Clint Eastwood and Tommy Lee Jones;
``Fifteen Minutes'' with Robert De Niro; ``The Next Best Thing''
with Madonna; Universal's ``For the Love of the Game'' with Kevin
Costner; Sony's ``What Planet Are You From''; and New Line's
``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cluff admitted that even an upsurge probably would leave
1999's feature activity even with last year's total at best. ``I
would expect we would track fairly closely to 1998 numbers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. said the
movie decline was mostly offset by increases in TV activity, with
overall production sliding just 2.9 percent in the first quarter.
Television, particularly one-hour episodic programs, gained 9.4
percent in the quarter as production days in March jumped from 970
to 1,280.
</P>
<P>
   However, Thompson noted, Canada appears to have supplanted Los
Angeles as the favored site for movies of the week. ``I haven't
seen an order for movie-of-the-week work in months,'' Cluff added.
</P>
<P>
   Local commercial activity, which has been erratic, also surged
in March with a 70 percent gain to 798 days. As a result, March's
overall commercial activity rose 12.1 percent after successive
declines of 10.7 percent and 10.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Orange County, overall activity fell more than 23 percent for
the first two months of the year, then picked up in March.

METS SHUT OUT MARLINS, 6-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There is a sound this time of year that Rickey Henderson
hears. It is the sound of a bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time the bell rings, we're ready to play,'' Henderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the bell first rings, it's opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It rang,'' Henderson said. ``I heard it solid.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still ringing. Henderson, who has obviously shrugged off a
dismal spring (just as he predicted he would), went 4 for 4 on
Wednesday night with two solo homers, two doubles, a walk and four
runs scored to lead the New York Mets to a 6-0 victory over the
Florida Marlins at Pro Player Stadium as Bobby Jones pitched seven
shutout innings.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's 12 total bases were one off the team record, held by
Darryl Strawberry, Claudell Washington and Jim Hickman. And for the
opening series of the season, Henderson was 6 for 11 with 3
doubles, 2 homers, 3 walks, 1 stolen base, 5 runs scored and 4 runs
batted in, as the Mets took two of three from the low-budget
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson led the way in both Mets victories, just as the team
hoped he would when it signed him during the off season to be the
leadoff hitter they never really had last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ageless,'' Mike Piazza said of the 40-year-old Henderson.
``There are very few players in the history of the game who can
dominate a game from the leadoff spot. He's one of them, if not the
only one.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the 10th time in his career that Henderson has hit two
home runs in the same game, but the first time since July 22, 1993.
When asked if he could remember having four extra-base hits in one
game, Henderson said he could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't remember half the things I do in this game,''
baseball's career stolen base leader said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Henderson's previous high
was three extra-base hits in the same game, something he has done
three times in his 20-year major league career, the last time on
July 16, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Through six innings, the Mets' lineup was 0 for 9 with runners
in scoring position, one night after it had been 7 for its first 8
with runners in scoring position in a 12-3 rout of the Marlins, two
nights after it had been 0 for 14 in a 6-2 opening-day loss.
</P>
<P>
   About the only constant was the lineup itself. Last year,
Manager Bobby Valentine did not field the same lineup in three
consecutive games until the final week of the season. This season,
Valentine has not changed a thing over the first three days.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little reason to. Not only did Edgardo Alfonzo
and Robin Ventura each extend their hitting streaks to all three
games, Henderson also seemed to be on the bases _ or circling them
_ all series long.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the Mets left fielder walked to start the
game, although he was picked off. It turned out to be the only
mistake Henderson would make on the night.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Henderson blasted his first homer as a Met, 417
feet to straightaway center field off the former Met left-hander
Jesus Sanchez. And in the fifth, after he had pulled a double to
left, Henderson evened things with Sanchez on the basepaths to
create another run. Sanchez balked.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud followed with a sacrifice fly. And the Mets were up,
2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The book on Henderson is to pitch him inside. But Henderson led
off the seventh against Brian Edmondson by pulling his second
double of the game to left. And when he later scored on Piazza's
one-out ground-ball single to left off Antonio Alfonseca, Henderson
_ who hit .130 this spring _ had scored the first game's first
three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, had a 6.30 earned run average this spring. But tonight,
the 29-year-old right-hander, who scattered five hits with one walk
and two strikeouts, looked more like the pitcher who tossed six
shutout innings on opening day a year ago than the one who went 9-9
the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is striving to be more consistent this season. On
Wednesday night he outdid last season's debut by one inning, and
departed with a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the final run belonged to Henderson, who belted his
second solo homer of the game, this time off Alfonseca, with two
out in the eighth. The ball traveled an estimated 375 feet. And
like the doubles, it too was pulled to left.

<P>
   I'm having trouble keeping my Hit lers straight.
</P>
<P>
   I work in the news business. I read the papers every day and
watch the network broadcasts every night. I can find Kosovo on a
map by drawing a line over the Adriatic Sea from above the heel on
Italy's boot.
</P>
<P>
   I understand the evils of ``ethnic cleansing'' and go along with
NATO's decision to bomb the hell out of Yugoslavia as long as its
government continues to terrorize and kill its own citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm confused by all the politi cians _ from President
Clinton on down _ who want us to think of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milo sevic as another Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, in that same part of the world,
politicians every where were calling Bosnian Serb dictator Radovan
Karadzic the next Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   That was confusing enough, particu larly since for much of the
1990s leaders of the Western world had been referring to Iraq's
Saddam Hussein as the world's most Hitler-like figure.
</P>
<P>
   Especially after he gassed the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan dictator who's not
even smart enough to elevate himself above the rank of ``colonel''?
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1980s, when President Reagan sent war planes to bomb
Gadhafi's house, we were told that Moammar was an awful lot like
Adolf.
</P>
<P>
   THEY'RE EVERYWHERE
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, politicians were making Hitler comparisons to
Chi na's Deng Xiaoping, who sent troops and tanks to kill his own
people in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago in Rwanda, when the Hutu majority started
killing thousands of men and women in the Tutsi minority, many
called it the worst example of genocide since World War II and the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that every newly de clared Hitler must run with a
crowd of newly declared Nazis, who invari ably are said to employ
``Gestapo tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 years ago, people were saying things like that about
the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Before that there was Pol Pot in Cambodia, Nicolae Ceausescu in
Romania, Augusto Pinochet in Chile, Idi Amin in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung was spoken of in the same
breath as Hitler for nearly 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   There are even alleged Hitlers that most Americans have never
heard of, like Nigerian ruler Gen. Sani Aba cha.
</P>
<P>
   And there are guys who get Hitler-like reputations although they
don't rule any country. For instance, the terrorist and billionaire
Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   None of it's true.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard the wicked SOBs of this generation try to
match him, there will never be another one.
</P>
<P>
   He was the Michael Jordan of dictators. The Babe Ruth. The Bee
thoven. The Picasso. The Shake speare. The Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   He was the perfection of evil. &QL; 
LEVEL OF ATROCITY
</P>
<P>
   But, in this age of squeamish politi cians and skittish
citizens, there's an unwritten rule that says we must convince
ourselves a miscreant has risen to Hitler's level before we try to
stop him.
</P>
<P>
   It's like saying you shouldn't consult a doctor until your body
tempera ture reaches 105. That you shouldn't call the fire
department until flames are shooting 50 feet above your roof. That
you shouldn't trip the burglar alarm until the thieves are speeding
off in the getaway car.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavian army is said to have displaced more than half a
million ethnic Albanians from their homes in only the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The White House supposedly has a document claiming the Serb
military and police have emptied and burned villages, and carried
out mass execu tions.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than heinous enough for most of us, no matter whose
name the politicians attach to it.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, our Hitler Parade is topped by Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   He's No. 1 on the charts.
</P>
<P>
   With a bullet. &QL;

HORNETS TOP KNICKS, 106-82 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ It was time to give up and usher an end to
this miserable night by turning the floor over to the Knicks'
reserves. Crestfallen and drained, Coach Jeff Van Gundy waved Larry
Johnson off the teal-trimmed court with about 7 long minutes left
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson shuffled by Van Gundy, he shook his head and
whispered, ``I let you down.'' Van Gundy patted him as he passed
and must have wondered if the rest of the players knew how much he
needed them to respond.
</P>
<P>
   So after the 18-17 Knicks lost their seventh game in 10 tries on
Wednesday night, after they watched a lower-echelon team like the
Charlotte Hornets make fun of them during their 106-82 defeat at
the Charlotte Coliseum, and after they fell to 4-12 on the road and
a half-game out of playoff position, Van Gundy made a plea to his
unraveling team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them this is my responsibility and that I also need
their help in putting more into it,'' Van Gundy said. ``I'm
disappointed in myself and in the team. It's my responsibility to
get them to play better. I haven't done my job well the last couple
of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has had the assurances of management and the support
of his players, however hollow and fleeting those may be. But after
absorbing another painful night for his team of misfit talent, he
may be driven to a career counselor _ and soon.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing he preaches is getting through. Nothing he shouts is
heard. Buried beneath the rubble of an unthinkable collapse in
front of the Hornets (13-20) _ a team that was on a five-game
losing streak _ is a confused team in total disarray.
</P>
<P>
   How else can you explain this? In desperate need of a victory, a
team that Van Gundy had said was teetering fell off the cliff in
the first quarter tonight. In 12 minutes the Knicks were down,
29-12, and had turned the ball over five times. The shock of it
didn't even rattle the Knicks, who were down by 58-38 at the half
after allowing the Hornets to hit 63.9 percent from the field.
Before the four-minute mark of the fourth quarter, the Knicks were
down by 29 points and ended the game with players like Herb
Williams and Ben Davis on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Not once did the Knicks mount a threat. Out of sorts, Sprewell
played his game of one-on-one and came up with a 5-of-16 effort and
13 points, while the shrinking Allan Houston made just 1 of 8 shots
for 5 points. Only Sprewell seemed the least bit optimistic for a
quick turnaround, though his reasoning was curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played on losing teams, whereas other guys here
haven't,'' Sprewell said. ``I know what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   He does? Sprewell failed to lead Golden State to the playoffs in
his last four seasons there. His logic aside, the Knicks are not
going to find a silver lining unless they respond to Van Gundy. He
has urged his team to defend, and yet one after another _ Charlie
Ward, Allan Houston and Chris Childs _ left his man wide open on
the perimeter while the Hornets hit 8 of 14 3-pointers. Van Gundy
had implored his team to take care of the ball, and yet Ward had 5
of the Knicks' 15 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   One turnover led to Houston's benching. With four minutes left
in the third quarter, Houston lost the ball as he pulled it up over
his head. With a hangdog look on his face and a lazy stride, he
watched as Eddie Jones took his miscue and blew by him for an
uncontested layup.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy was furious. He angrily he took a timeout and scolded
Houston, who stared straight ahead and did not look at Van Gundy.
Two plays later, after the Hornets took a 77-52 lead on two
straight jumpers, Houston was taken out and the seldom-used reserve
David Wingate replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jeff was frustrated with that,'' Houston said. ``He
should have been. I think we're getting confused over what it takes
to win. We have to find a way to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to blame others. It takes a man to stand up and take
responsibility. We can't blame Jeff. If anyone is not to blame,
it's Jeff.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy didn't have enough room for everyone to sit on the
bench as the Knicks trailed the Hornets, 79-60, after three
quarters. Everyone, with the exception of Johnson, contributed with
senseless mistakes and panicked plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a frustrating night,'' Ewing said. ``Things are not
going well for us. I have no excuse or explanation. We're letting
ourselves down.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's frustrating,'' Johnson said. ``Early on, we
would get frustrated losing close games. It would be a critical
mistake here or there. Now, we're not close.'' &QL;

DODGERS SWEEP DIAMONDBACKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Arizona Diamondbacks talked about contending
for the National League West title, and about battling with the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Next, please.
</P>
<P>
   Extra innings weren't needed on this occasion, but the Dodgers
again broke out the long ball with two homers in a five-run fifth
inning as the Dodgers swept the three-game series with a 6-4 win
Wednesday night against the Diamondbacks at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The win marked the first time since 1995, and the fourth time
since the Dodgers moved west in 1958, they have begun the season
with three straight wins.
</P>
<P>
   And like the opener, and like Tuesday's home run heroics by Gary
Sheffield, again the Dodgers overpowered Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi, who homered twice in the opener, hit a home run
off Arizona starter Andy Benes (0-1) to break a 2-2 tie in the
fifth, and catcher Todd Hundley made it back-to-back with his first
home run as a Dodger. He lined a 3-2 pitch over the right-field
fence to give the Dodgers a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The way right-hander Ismael Valdes was pitching, that was plenty
of support.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his five-year career, scouts, general managers and
front office personnel have all said Valdes has some of the best
stuff in baseball, but he labored through 10-11 and 11-10 seasons
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, coming off a magnificent spring, is trying to
re-establish his standing and turn the talk and promise into
results.
</P>
<P>
   He did that against the Diamondbacks, limiting them to two runs
on five hits in 72/3 innings. Valdes (1-0) walked one and struck
out five in becoming the first Dodgers starter to win a game this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shaw recorded the final three outs for his first save. He
was pressed into pitching when Mel Rojas surrendered back-to-back
homers to Matt Williams and Luis Gonzalez, who homered twice, to
start the ninth as Arizona pulled within 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   As was Arizona's protocol in this season-opening series, the
only way they could get to a Dodgers pitcher was via the home run.
Gonzalez hit the second pitch he saw from Valdes in the fourth
inning into the left-field stands, a two-run shot, to give the
Diamondbacks a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   All 12 runs the Diamondbacks scored in the series were produced
by homers, eight in all.
</P>
<P>
   But following Gonzalez's homer, Valdes was nearly unhittable. He
allowed a single to Bernard Gilkey, but retired the next 11
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first two games, the Dodgers didn't wait until the
last moment to rally, instead seizing control in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   It began with birthday boy Adrian Beltre (he turned 21) hustling
for a leadoff double on a liner to left-center field. Valdes
sacrificed Beltre to third and Eric Young, who had three hits,
doubled in the Dodgers' first run. Center fielder Devon White
blooped a single to short left field to score Young with the tying
run.
</P>
<P>
   After Sheffield flied out to left, Mondesi punished Benes' 1-0
pitch into the left-field stands as the Dodgers went ahead 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson said he moved Hundley from second to fifth
in the lineup to ease the offensive burden on his catcher, and the
move paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Hundley follow Mondesi's third homer of the season
with his own, but two innings later the hustle of Sheffield got
Hundley another RBI. Sheffield singled to lead off the seventh
inning, stole second and went to third when catcher Kelly
Stinnett's throw bounced off Sheffield and into left field. After
Mondesi was intentionally walked, Hundley delivered a sacrifice fly
to left to score Sheffield and give the Dodgers a 6-2 lead.

LAKERS ROUT KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ A day or two off, and maybe the Los Angeles Lakers
could have afforded a full-blown exorcism to rid themselves of the
evil spirits that haunted them in Tuesday's late collapse to the
Utah Jazz. But the NBA schedule being what it is, the Lakers had
time only to traverse the state, hold a brief team meeting and play
their third game in three nights _ against a team they had yet to
solve.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the power of the team meeting is the best mojo after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the source of inspiration, the Lakers reversed their
recent ill fortunes and trounced the Kings 104-89 at Arco Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' first win in three tries against Sacramento came
after a slow start but an impressive finish, as they outscored the
Kings 28-17 in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They took a four-point lead into the fourth, but Kobe Bryant
rattled off seven straight points, then passed off the duties to
Shaquille O'Neal, who scored eight in a row, and the Lakers had a
91-79 lead they wouldn't relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal finished with a game-high 30 points and 18 rebounds, and
Bryant overcame early offensive struggles to score 18 points and
dish out seven assists. Glen Rice also struggled with his shot but
scored 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   The bench also came through, with Derek Fisher scoring 19 points
to go along with six assists. Rick Fox added 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with an introspective team meeting in place of the
usual morning shootaround. That was more a product of the Lakers'
heavy schedule _ they played their fifth game in six days _ than
any need to rehash the mistakes of the night before. But a rehash
was in order after the fourth-quarter debacle against the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   There was no mistaking the team's mood in the morning meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were frustrated with the way that they played, and the
mistakes that they made,'' Rambis said before tipoff Wednesday. ``I
just told them to stay positive. As well as (the Jazz) played, and
all the things they did so well execution-wise, it still came down
to a four-point ballgame with four minutes to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense was the primary topic of discussion, accompanied by
lowlight film of their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same people all the time, and it's not the same
mistakes all the time, but there always seems to be a breakdown of
somebody doing something wrong sometime,'' Rambis said. ``No team
plays perfect defense ... but you learn to cover each others' backs
and cover up those mistakes. And we just have to try and minimize
our mistakes.... They knew what our game plan was. But guys were
just, `I thought I could ...' `I almost got ...' Well, that's
great, but those resulted in baskets for (Utah), a few of them at
critical times too. You can't do that. You can't arbitrarily make
up your own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure everyone stays aware of their
relationship between themselves, their man and the ball, so they're
ready to help on the weak side.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Fox, ``It was more of a pow wow on what we didn't do well.
I guess you could call it critiquing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe their next meeting should focus on those mind-numbing slow
starts. They sputtered early again Wednesday and the Kings took an
early lead, extending it to 31-22 by the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was late in the second quarter before the Lakers took the
lead back, erasing a 10-point deficit with an 18-6 run. J.R. Reid
and O'Neal scored six points in the run, and the Lakers grabbed a
43-41 lead with five minutes remaining, then held on for a 53-51
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal finished the first half with 16 points on 7-of-11
shooting. Dennis Rodman sat all but nine minutes of the first half,
but O'Neal picked up the rebounding slack, grabbing nine in 15
minutes.

ANGELS FALL TO INDIANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins says he
focuses on the players he has on the field, not in the trainer's
room. But that can be difficult when one of the walking wounded is
Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   While Collins' healthy Angels were routed by the Cleveland
Indians 9-1 Wednesday night before 21,689 at Edison Field, Vaughn
and his sprained left ankle still were the topic of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn entered the Angels clubhouse Wednesday afternoon on
crutches, causing most of his teammates to turn their heads _
albeit briefly _ from the freeway chase on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters lurked in the clubhouse, waiting for Vaughn to emerge
from the trainer's room after treatment. Vaughn had an MRI
Wednesday, which revealed a bone bruise and sprained ligaments in
the ankle. His prognosis is still day-to-day, but it seems clear
he's at least several days, if not a week or more, from returning.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Ned Bergert said Vaughn is definitely out for the next
two games, and that the next two days will give them a good idea
how long he'll be out depending on the strength and flexibility of
the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who suffered the injury Tuesday night falling into the
Indians' dugout as he tried to catch a pop-up foul, remains
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking just get the inflammation out as fast as we can
and we can get playing again,'' he said. ``As soon as I can move
around at half-speed, I'll be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he isn't concerned about the danger of coming back
too soon: ``There's danger walking down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he can play with nagging pain: ``The only thing
nagging me is sitting here when I should be on the field. It's
already nagging me and it's only been one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who wore a plastic, removable cast on the ankle and
foot, has been on the disabled list only once in his career, and
doesn't plan to make it twice with this injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there's ligament damage, it doesn't mean I won't be
able to play,'' he said. ``If it's not broken, that's a positive. I
don't know much about ligaments _ just give me some ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Ken Hill had his arm in ice a bit sooner than he
had hoped Wednesday, getting pulled from the game after 41/3
innings. He gave up four runs (two earned) and six hits while
walking four and striking out two. An error by shortstop Andy
Sheets resulted in two unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense, without Vaughn and Jim Edmonds, could do
nothing with Indians starter Dave Burba. Burba struck out 10 in six
innings, allowing one unearned run and three hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians broke the game open with a five-run eighth inning,
scoring all five runs off rookie pitcher Scott Schoeneweis, who was
making his major-league debut. Omar Vizquel led the Indians'
offense with three hits and four RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored their only run on Tim Salmon's infield single,
scoring Orlando Palmeiro from third base in the first inning.

DUVAL BRINGS MASTERS TOUCH TO SEASON'S FIRST MAJOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ America is waiting to get in, but David Duval
stands on the other side of the door, hearing the knocks, refusing
to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Although his golf game is on full display like the azaleas at
Augusta National, he keeps his personal side stuffed away in some
basement closet. Duval collects trophies and dust, and don't dare
try to buff him up.
</P>
<P>
   This is who he is, plain as Wonder Bread, the death of the
party. But no one can ignore the monotone man anymore. The
27-year-old enters the first round of the Masters Thursday as the
prohibitive favorite, Tiger Woods included, having won two straight
PGA tournaments and 11 in his last 34 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's batting .333,'' said CBS analyst David Feherty.
``Baseball players do it against one pitcher. He's doing it against
150 players. It's extraordinary. It's like he's saying: `Does
anybody have any hard games?'''
</P>
<P>
   Courses and conditions don't matter. Needing a boatload of
birdies, Duval won the Bob Hope Classic with a final-round 59,
tying the PGA record with an eagle on the 18th hole. Needing pars
and steady play, Duval won The Players Championship two weeks ago
in his hometown of Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in Atlanta last week, the four-time All-American at
Georgia Tech was just looking to warm up for the Masters but ended
up winning the BellSouth Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Three straight wins would appear incomprehensible for even
Duval, but he has accomplished that before with his first three
victories on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   He arrives at the Masters as the No. 1 attraction for curiosity
and autograph seekers, the whole scene making him uncomfortable.
Duval insists he is just a regular guy. But because of his uncommon
golf game and reclusive appearance on the course, reporters wield
shovels, attempting to unearth more about him, believing the public
wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   So they pry and prod and coax and David Duval sits there with a
bemused look, undoubtedly wanting to tell everyone to get the hell
out of his garden.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt from this week's press conference:
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: David, there's kind of a perception out there that
you're somewhat of a dullard.
</P>
<P>
   Duval: A what?
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: A dullard. Why do you think that is?
</P>
<P>
   Duval: You tell me. Is that your impression?
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Duval: I don't understand. ... If that's a perception, that's
fine.
</P>
<P>
   (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Observations, situations, nothing bothers the unflappable Duval,
who heightens the interest with a mysterious manner.
</P>
<P>
   For those who know nothing about golf, Duval is recognizable
because of his sunglasses. A few others on tour wear them, most
notably Fuzzy Zoeller. But Zoeller looks like an approachable guy
on the beach, whistling while he works on his tan.
</P>
<P>
   Duval appears cold. His Oakley wraparound shades cover his eyes
and a large part of his face. He wears a Titleist baseball cap, but
you rarely see any dimples: Duval doesn't smile much. He used to
have a goatee, creating an even more sinister and standoffish look.
His golf shirt is buttoned up tight to his neck, but he never
chokes.
</P>
<P>
   He reacts in the same way to bogeys and birdies. Duval is not
easily fazed or excited. If Ed McMahon showed up at his house to
tell him he won the Publishers Clearinghouse Sweepstakes, Duval
would say: ``Oh.''
</P>
<P>
   This is just his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to make it a stress-free round every time I tee it up,''
said Duval, who tied for second with Fred Couples in last year's
Masters. ``If you hit something in the water and get worked up, it
can harm you for an additional one, two or three holes. You have to
find the demeanor and personality under which you perform the best.
For me, that's not worrying about stuff. I can't re-hit a shot, I
can only move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   So he does, unimpeded, strolling along and gathering victories
at a faster rate than fans. At Augusta Thursday, there will be
larger galleries following Woods and Couples. ``You da man'' types
don't hang out with Duval; those who appreciate the game do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be something you're not,'' Duval said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may want to see more (expression), but I don't think
he's ever going to give it,'' Couples said. ``What he's giving is
great golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval has a fluid swing. It's not the same syrup Couples uses
but close. He is a feel player who relies little on mechanics. In
one unusual aspect, his head does not stay still, contrary to one
of golf's fundamentals; it follows the ball. Annika Sorenstam, one
of the LPGA's best players, has a similar swing and head reaction.
</P>
<P>
   A bad round for Duval is a 70. He averages 68.22. He leads the
tour in two of the most telling statistics, greens in regulation
and putting. He hits nearly three out of four greens and takes
about 30 putts a round. He also turns his little white ball into a
disappearing dot, ranking fourth in driving distance at 287.5
yards.
</P>
<P>
   It's methodical and brilliant if monotonous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes in here (media room) every week,'' Couples said.
``He's got to go in and tell you: `I'm playing well.' How many ways
can you say that. It's going to be boring no matter how you say
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it remains, then, dullard Duval retaining the
misconception. As it turns out, Duval has his reasons for turning
inward. In this week's Sports Illustrated, it was revealed that
Duval's older brother died from aplastic anemia, a bone marrow
disease, when Duval was 9 years old.
</P>
<P>
   He has several stories, but the bookshelf seems empty because of
his guarded nature.
</P>
<P>
   Duval snowboards and skis and fishes and loves to read himself.
He was once a failure, Feherty remembering when Duval did not get
his PGA Tour card at qualifying school in La Quinta, Calif., in
1993. He used to pack 235 pounds on his 6-foot frame but has since
lost 40 pounds and continues to work out. It took three years and
seven second-place finishes before he finally broke through.
</P>
<P>
   Duval is understated elegance, a work in progress. The
sunglasses protect his sensitive eyes from pollen, but maybe they
are really reflecting the glare of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   When someone referred to him as a star, Duval fidgeted. When
someone else said he was the Michael Jordan of golf, Duval
blanched.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's entirely inappropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not: David Duval has become the world's best golfer.
And this weekend, he will attempt to win his first major at the
Masters.

AUGUSTA DECEIVING FOR THE AVERAGE HACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Ever wonder how you would fare at Augusta?
Pretended like Bill Murray, fantasizing about being a Masters
champion?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's a Sam Perkins reach, but there are reasons to
believe that the average hack, the Seattleite who tees it up at
Jefferson or hits worm-burners at Jackson, could handle this
layout.
</P>
<P>
   If you can deal with initial intimidation and subsequent
embarrassment, there are possibilities for you here. Augusta is a
beast that no one tames anyway. But you just might fare better than
the professionals given the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   That's the hypothesis presented in David Owen's book, ``The
Making of the Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1930s, the course was designed to be a test for
experts, yet playable for bogey golfers. One of the designers and a
great player in his own right, Bobby Jones, wanted members and
guests to have enjoyable rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jones succeeded. And here's the most surprising thing about
Augusta: although you will watch pros struggle Thursday, remember
that duffers oddly shoot better than their handicaps here.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons? Fairways are wide open. Wherever you go off the
tee, you're laying one. That's not the case at McCormick Woods in
Port Orchard, where white stakes and red stakes lead to penalty
strokes and you can be laying five or seven by the time you finally
get one in play.
</P>
<P>
   If you end up in the trees, it's a minimal problem here. Unlike
dense Northwest firs, say at Battle Creek in Marysville, these
Georgian pines are spaced apart, making recovery shots possible.
</P>
<P>
   You're familiar with the water at 11, 12, 13 and 15. Penalty
strokes could add up on those holes. But there is no water on the
front side.
</P>
<P>
   On many holes, you can bump and run your ball to the green and
walk to the next tee with an acceptable bogey. In addition, there
are no waste areas to carry on tee shots, another terrifying hazard
to the hackers.
</P>
<P>
   The rough that concerns the pros would not bother you. It is 1]
inches high. A ball dropped in the rough on No. 1 Wednesday sat up
nicely. In fact, the rough here is easier for the high handicapper
to hit from than the fairways.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta mows its fairways down to .39 of an inch, lower than all
of the fairways in the Seattle area. For instance, Willows Run in
Redmond is currently at half an inch. When there is that little
grass, it is almost like hitting off hardpan or cart paths for
duffers, who are apt to hit fat shots.
</P>
<P>
   The greens would be a problem. There are so many undulations, as
you know. They are mowed to the nubbin, producing quick surfaces
and slick putts.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how fast they are because everything is so
secretive here. But it's believed to be a 12 or 13 on the
Stimpmeter, which translated is Formica fast.
</P>
<P>
   A Golf Digest survey also showed that Augusta's greens rate a
difficulty of 148 compared to 72 for your normal course.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the deal: if you're a bogey golfer, you have your
share of 3-putts anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta has never been officially rated or given a slope. But it
has an unofficial rating of 76.2 based on 6,985 yards from the back
tees. In comparison, Druid's Glen in Maple Valley rates 74.8 and
Harbour Pointe in Mukilteo rates 72.8.
</P>
<P>
   Now then, the pros shot down these Augusta hacker hypotheses
Wednesday, calling hogwash on the whole idea. They were questioned
about how an 18-handicapper would handle Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jones: ``If they played these greens like we play 'em,
they would face double the normal breaks. A 6-inch break turns into
a 12-inch break. They would shoot 30 percent higher than their
handicap here.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Azinger: ``They'd probably shoot 105. Most 18-handicappers
are awful on the greens. If they normally had two to three
three-putts a round, they'd have six to eight here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik: ``They would never get it in the hole, that's
the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   David Feherty, former pro and current CBS wise-guy analyst:
``The average 18-handicapper would be lucky to break 130 from the
back tees. There are more difficult shots under 100 yards than any
course in the world. There would be four-putts, five-putts,
six-putts. You may not finish. It could get dark. It's that
difficult.''

   The cigarette smoke in Radomir Diklic's cluttered Beta news

that have the ladies banging open the windows for air above Srpskih
Vladara street.
</P>

   Diklic smokes himself, of course, a small agitated man with a
potbelly and uncombed hair who breathes through his cigarette until

   ``We had our friends from the Western embassies here,'' he says.
``We had a lot of contacts and we warned them that the day the
first bomb drops, they could count on the fact that everyone will
be for the defense of their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you people _ NATO _ did a good job for Slobodan Milosevic.
It was the best present he could be given. For ordinary people,
Milosevic is now a god; when you bombed, he became a symbol of our
country _ which is awful.'' &QL;

   BELGRADE _ Instead of admitting the truth about the current
Kosovo conflict, our leaders have consistently lied to us. It has
all gone horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the initial objectives are recalled, then we have
already lost this war. And it is not only the tragedy of Biblical
proportions on the Balkan mountainsides that proves the futility of
what we have done.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two weeks ago, we thought we had gone to war to save the
Kosovo Albanians. Now it turns out that we are at war to save NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000 soldiers who were meant to look after the Kosovo
Albanians are now doing just that _ but in the wrong country,
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb civilians of Kosovo, whom they were also meant to
protect, are now being bombed by us. The destabilization of the
southern Balkans, which we went to war to prevent, is now well
underway... &QL;

   LONDON _ We pampered Westerners are all very martial as long as

<P>
   What I believe about Kosovo _ that we had little alternative but
to intervene, and that we should now begin to deploy an army
charged with winning it back for its dispossessed people _ is not
the consequence of deep strategic and military insight. It is,
rather, a product of conscience allied to a deep worry about what
would happen elsewhere were we to fail this test... &QL;

<P>
   This Friday, somewhere in the world, a historic baby will start
its journey into life. For then _ the 266 days of an average
pregnancy away from the turn of the year _ the first child of the
new millennium will be conceived.
</P>
<P>
   No one will know who or where it is, as it grows towards its
date with destiny spinning gently in its mother's womb. It may be
born rich or poor, male or female, black, brown, yellow or white _
in circumstances as diverse as the wide world itself.
</P>
<P>
   The real millennium baby is most likely to be born with no clock
in sight, with no record of its time of birth. It may not even live
long enough to be given a name. For there are nine chances in 10
that it will arrive in the Third World, rather than in the West _
and four in 10 that it will be born into extreme poverty. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ The Force is about to be with us once more, this
time in the form of a brand new ``Star Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace'' opens in the
United States on May 19, but already it feels as though it has been
with us for months. Hollywood loves a sure winner, and winners
don't come much surer than this one.
</P>
<P>
   The only real questions are whether the film will manage to earn
$100 million on its opening weekend, a feat never before achieved,
and whether its total gross receipts will hit the near-mythical
target of one billion _ that's right, folks, billion _ dollars.

SERENE TRAIL BLAZERS STEAL SONICS' STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Yet one more consequence of the NBA lockout: Without
permission, without warning, without ticket-refund offers, the two
longtime Northwest rivals switched team personas.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the Sonics: Sullen, directionless, underachieving
losers.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the Trail Blazers: Serene, driven, overachieving
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Watch tonight's game at KeyArena and see if the Blazers don't
resemble the Sonics of three and four years ago. And the Sonics,
after Wednesday's blowup at practice between Gary Payton and Vin
Baker, following a numbskull loss to Sacramento, are looking like
the disjointed Rose City failures who have lost in the first round
of the playoffs for five straight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chemistry is great,'' chirped Bob Whitsitt from Portland
Wednesday. ``The players really like each other, and their roles.''
</P>
<P>
   The phone conversation came a couple of hours before Payton and
Baker, supposedly close pals, broke up practice with a fractious
bout of accusations and name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Whitsitt would revel in the irony, or anything.
</P>
<P>
   Not Whitsitt, the Sonic president fired by owner Barry Ackerley
five years ago, only to see what was mostly Whitsitt's team make
the 1996 NBA Finals. Not Whitsitt, whose Blazers have been 5-14
against the Sonics during his tenure, including 0-4 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Not Whitsitt, the Seahawk president who recently hired perhaps
football's best coach, and works two jobs for the one of the
world's richest men.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt? Gloat? Nah. Not him.
</P>
<P>
   Not out loud to a reporter, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, there has to be a little heh-heh-heh under
construction. For now, publicly, Whitsitt offers the predictably
diplomatic patter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done anything yet,'' he said of the Blazers. ``Wait
'til we get out of the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   An NBA-best record of 27-6 is nevertheless a superlative feat to
date. Whatever happens in the playoffs, the Blazers as an
organization must be credited with a plan that survived the lockout
better than any other franchise.
</P>
<P>
   From a rapidly maturing 46-36 team a year ago, they added only
reserve guards Jimmy Jackson and Greg Anthony _ who would rather
have stayed in Seattle, but the Sonics had no salary cap room for
him _ to ride out the compressed season with more horsepower than
any other club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our run really began last year with the trade,'' Whitsitt said
of the February, 1998 deal that brought guard Damon Stoudamire and
swingman Walt Williams from Toronto in exchange for Kenny Anderson,
Gary Trent and Alvin Williams. ``After the playoffs, we sent four
staffers across the country who spent a lot of time working guys
out through June 30, right up to the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, after the lockout, with two weeks of training camp, and
the injury and fatigue factor, we figured having continuity and
depth would be an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   As with Utah and Indiana, the Blazer core stayed together and
prospered, unlike the Sonics, who had six new faces that included
three rookies, plus a new coach and system.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers also filched a vital cog from Seattle _ assistant
coach Tim Grgurich, enormously popular with players, whose presence
Wednesday at Sonic practice certainly would have helped.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was a fast start under coach Mike Dunleavy that
mitigated the Blazers' biggest potential problem _ gripes about
playing time from so many talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've sold these guys on winning first, and everything
else flows from there,'' Whitsitt said. ``If they don't get a lot
of playing time, they might be upset for a few minutes, but they
realize where the team is going, and it fades.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt's favorite example is Jackson, the shot-happy guard
with his fifth team in the last three years, who has never averaged
less than 15 points a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew the deal coming in _ he was going from 35 minutes a
game as a starter to 18 off the bench,'' Whitsitt said. ``He's put
up big numbers elsewhere, but he hasn't won. He didn't want to be a
starter on a bad team.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar sacrifice was offered by Rasheed Wallace, the 6-11
fourth-year forward who was the Blazers' No. 3 scorer last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rasheed came to Mike at the end of last season and said,
`Bring me off the bench.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that a player usually does later in his
career.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this Blazer sweetness is enough to provoke dental decay.
What isn't known yet is whether the
holding-hands-round-the-campfire business will survive a three-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   This team isn't that far removed from its Jail Blazer past that
it couldn't go postal under the right conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, a little thievery of Sonic personnel and a swiping
of a lot of Seattle swagger has made the Blazers formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Next Portland will want to steal the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   So make an offer.

   BELGRADE _ Instead of admitting the truth about the current
Kosovo conflict, our leaders have consistently lied to us. It has
all gone horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the initial objectives are recalled, then we have
already lost this war. And it is not only the tragedy of Biblical
proportions on the Balkan mountainsides that proves the futility of
what we have done.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two weeks ago, we thought we had gone to war to save the
Kosovo Albanians. Now it turns out that we are at war to save NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000 soldiers who were meant to look after the Kosovo
Albanians are now doing just that _ but in the wrong country,
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb civilians of Kosovo, whom they were also meant to
protect, are now being bombed by us. The destabilization of the
southern Balkans, which we went to war to prevent, is now well
underway... &QL;

   LONDON _ We pampered Westerners are all very martial as long as
we are only dropping ordnance from the sky.
</P>

   The air is now thick with the stink of attitudinizing. Every
columnist, reporter, letter-writer, pub bore and backbencher knows
what should have been done, and what ought to be done now.
</P>
<P>
   What I believe about Kosovo _ that we had little alternative but
to intervene, and that we should now begin to deploy an army
charged with winning it back for its dispossessed people _ is not
the consequence of deep strategic and military insight. It is,
rather, a product of conscience allied to a deep worry about what
would happen elsewhere were we to fail this test... &QL;

   This Friday, somewhere in the world, a historic baby will start
its journey into life. For then _ the 266 days of an average
pregnancy away from the turn of the year _ the first child of the
new millennium will be conceived.
</P>
<P>
   No one will know who or where it is, as it grows towards its
date with destiny spinning gently in its mother's womb. It may be
born rich or poor, male or female, black, brown, yellow or white _
in circumstances as diverse as the wide world itself.
</P>
<P>
   The real millennium baby is most likely to be born with no clock
in sight, with no record of its time of birth. It may not even live
long enough to be given a name. For there are nine chances in 10
that it will arrive in the Third World, rather than in the West _
and four in 10 that it will be born into extreme poverty. &QL;

LAKERS ROUT KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ A day or two off, and maybe the Los Angeles Lakers
could have afforded a full-blown exorcism to rid themselves of the
evil spirits that haunted them in Tuesday's late collapse to the
Utah Jazz. But the NBA schedule being what it is, the Lakers had
time only to traverse the state, hold a team meeting and play their
third game in three nights _ against a team they had yet to solve.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the power of the team meeting is the best mojo after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the source of inspiration, the Lakers reversed their
recent ill fortunes and trounced the Kings 104-89 on Wednesday at
Arco Arena.
</P>
<P>
   And after a disastrous fourth quarter one night earlier, the
Lakers played a dominant final frame Wednesday, outscoring
Sacramento 28-17 down the stretch for their first win in three
tries against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got everything ironed out in the meeting,'' said Shaquille
O'Neal, who paced the Lakers with a game-high 30 points and 18
rebounds. ``But for us to be a good team, we need to know those
things already.''
</P>
<P>
   Things like playing team defense and using consistent ball
movement to keep the offense chugging. Whether products of the
meeting or not, those elements were evident in the victory, which
gave the Lakers a 2-1 record in their three-games-in-three-nights
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice, wasn't it?'' coach Kurt Rambis said of the active
offense. ``It was really nice. I know we had a bunch of turnovers
(22), but the guys were trying to do the right thing with the
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   And doing it well for most of the game. Kobe Bryant committed a
ghastly eight turnovers, but made up for it with 18 points, a
team-high seven assists, a career-high six steals and a dominant
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers took a four-point lead into the final frame, but
Bryant rattled off seven straight points, then passed off the
duties to O'Neal, who scored eight in a row, to give the Lakers a
double-digit lead they wouldn't relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   It also banished another demon _ Sacramento was the only Western
Conference team the Lakers were winless against this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good, because you don't want to let a team feel like it
can just dominate you,'' Robert Horry said. ``Sacramento has a
funny team. They score a lot of points, and they do a lot of things
different from other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Different things, like the creative playmaking of explosive
point guard Jason Williams. For the first time, though, Williams
didn't hurt them, and Derek Fisher was the surprise hero taking
credit for that.
</P>
<P>
   Just a night earlier, Fisher sat most of the game because of
knee tendinitis and watched rookie Tyronn Lue make a stunning debut
that appeared to threaten Fisher's playing time. Fisher overcame
the injury and shrugged off everything else to score 19 points _
eight in the fourth quarter _ and played solid defense for 34
minutes against Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt disappointed that I couldn't be out there (Tuesday),''
Fisher said. ``Missing a game like that, I played eight minutes,
but that's the first one in my career (not playing due to injury).
I can't stand it. I have to be unable to walk or run to not
play....
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to reassert myself, for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's performance led a 39-point effort from the bench. Rick
Fox added 11.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with an introspective team meeting in place of the
usual morning shootaround. That was more a product of the Lakers'
heavy schedule _ they played their fifth game in six days _ than
any need to rehash the mistakes of the night before. But a rehash
was in order as well after the fourth-quarter debacle against the
Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Defense was the primary topic of discussion, accompanied by
lowlight film of their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same people all the time,'' Rambis said, ``and
it's not the same mistakes all the time, but there always seems to
be a breakdown of somebody doing something wrong sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, at least a few somethings were done right by somebody
most of the time.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins says he
focuses on the players he has on the field, not in the trainer's
room. But that can be difficult when one of the walking wounded is
Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   While Collins' healthy Angels were losing to the Cleveland
Indians 9-1 Wednesday night before 21,689 at Edison Field, Vaughn
and his sprained left ankle were the main topics of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn entered the Angels clubhouse Wednesday afternoon on
crutches, causing most of his teammates to turn their heads _
albeit briefly _ from the freeway chase on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters lurked in the clubhouse, waiting for Vaughn to emerge
from the trainer's room after treatment. Vaughn had an MRI
Wednesday, which revealed a bone bruise and sprained ligaments in
the ankle. His prognosis is officially day-to-day, but it seems
clear he's at least several days _ if not a week or more _ from
returning.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Ned Bergert said Vaughn is definitely out for the next
two games, and the next few days will allow Bergert time to test
the strength and flexibility of the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who was injured Tuesday night falling into the Indians'
dugout trying to catch a pop-up foul, remains optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking just get the inflammation out as fast as we can
and we can get playing again,'' he said. ``As soon as I can move
around at half-speed, I'll be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he isn't concerned about the danger of coming back
too soon: ``There's danger walking down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he can play with nagging pain: ``The only thing
nagging me is sitting here when I should be on the field. It's
already nagging me and it's only been one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who wore a plastic, removable cast on the ankle and
foot, has been on the disabled list only once in his career, and
doesn't plan to make it twice with this injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there's ligament damage, it doesn't mean I won't be
able to play,'' he said. ``If it's not broken, that's a positive. I
don't know much about ligaments _ just give me some ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Ken Hill (0-1) had his arm in ice sooner than he
had hoped Wednesday, getting pulled from the game after 41/3
innings. He gave up four runs (two earned) and six hits while
walking four and striking out two. An error by shortstop Andy
Sheets resulted in two unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense, without Vaughn and Jim Edmonds, could do
little with Indians starter Dave Burba (1-0). Burba struck out 10
in six innings, allowing one unearned run and three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Collins wouldn't say whether having Edmonds and Vaughn in the
lineup would have made a difference against Burba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same (without them), but there was nothing wrong
with our lineup,'' he said. ``I'll run Orlando Palmeiro out there
100 times and he won't strike out three times in a game again. It's
why I say Burba had good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Burba) was throwing his split and I don't know if he threw
one for a strike,'' said Sheets, who struck out twice. ``But we
kept swinging and check-swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheets added that the absence of Edmonds and Vaughn might have
had a subconscious effect on the hitters. ``No one really talked
about it,'' he said, ``but maybe in the back of our minds ...''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians broke the game open with a five-run eighth inning,
scoring all five runs off rookie pitcher Scott Schoeneweis, who was
making his major-league debut. Omar Vizquel led the Indians'
offense with three hits and four RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of anticipation making my debut, it's been a
long road to get here,'' Schoeneweis admitted. ``I was excited to
get in there. It can only go up from here, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored their only run on Tim Salmon's infield single,
scoring Palmeiro from third base in the first inning.

GARCIA DELIVERS IN FIRST START; GRIFFEY HOMERS IN 4-FOR-4 NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Of all the attributes listed for Freddy Garcia this
spring _ 96 mph fastball, excellent curveball, improving changeup,
solid mental makeup _ nobody mentioned this: he knows the right
time to be oblivious.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia slept comfortably Tuesday night. Then, when he got to the
Kingdome before his first major league game Wednesday, he took a
nap. A couple of hours before game time, the big right-hander
filled out the dugout doorway with his smile, appearing totally at
ease with himself as he watched his teammates warm up.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the franchise's happiest hour. The Mariners had
just learned shortstop Alex Rodriguez would be lost 4-6 weeks with
torn cartilage in his knee, and they had been blown out in the
season's first two games. Garcia was being asked to do what
veterans Jeff Fassero and Jamie Moyer couldn't: shut down the
surprisingly potent Chicago White Sox offense.
</P>
<P>
   So that's what he did, working 52/3 strong innings to lift the
M's over the White Sox, 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got poise for a young pitcher, he really does,'' manager
Lou Piniella said of Garcia. ``He's very relaxed out there,
confident. He gets the ball and throws it.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia threw it 100 times Wednesday night, allowing two runs on
seven hits and two walks. He also recorded five strikeouts _ one
against the first batter he faced, Ray Durham, and the others all
coming with runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so happy right now,'' Garcia said. ``When I'm on the
mound, I feel confident, and that's what happened right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned the ball over to his roommate, Jose Paniagua, who
preserved a 5-2 lead by striking out Mark Johnson with runners on
first and second to end the sixth. Paniagua lasted until two outs
in the eighth, when Jose Mesa retired Johnson on a fly ball to
strand two more runners.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa walked two, allowed a double and gave up a run in the
ninth, but did earn a save in his Seattle debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good game,'' Piniella said. ``I know one thing _ I'll
enjoy my off day (Thursday) a little better with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Contributing mightily to the win was Ken Griffey Jr., who had a
walk and four hits, including his second homer of the year. The
home run came in the first inning off White Sox starter John
Snyder, who also allowed Russ Davis' second homer, which led off
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The M's added another solo homer in the seventh, when Matt
Mieske delivered on his billing as slayer of all things
left-handed. Mieske, a .314 career hitter against southpaws,
drilled a pitch from Bryan Ward over the left-field wall in his
first Mariner at-bat. It was the M's first pinch-hit homer since
Paul Sorrento did it in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle also got strong defensive plays from first baseman David
Segui, plus the new double-play combination of second baseman David
Bell and shortstop Carlos Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen was the first of the three Houston Astros acquired for
Randy Johnson to make an impact with the M's, impressing in a
September call-up last year. While reliever John Halama awaits his
Mariner debut, Garcia was the second member of the trade to
deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see Carlos here, Freddy here, John Halama here,'' said
pitcher Jamie Moyer. ``Not to say you wanted to see Randy go, but
when a club makes a trade, obviously you want to see people able to
contribute and help. The three players we got in return look like
they're capable of doing that. That's important.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to lose a key part of your ballclub, especially a No.
1 starter, but what did everyone say last year when that trade was
made? Everyone ridiculed everything about it. But the
organization's going to start reaping the benefits of it.''

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Spring was great for Ismael Valdes. He was nearly
unhittable and more importantly, was unflappable. But it was still
spring, which meant it meant nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, that was something. That's what Valdes told
himself. It was to be the beginning of his transformation from a
pitcher with great stuff to great pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The first, ever-so-slight step was fine. Buoyed by a five-run
sixth inning, Valdes and the Los Angeles Dodgers swept the
three-game series from the Arizona Diamondbacks with a 6-4 win at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so confident,'' Valdes said. ``I have experience. I
have a lot more confidence in myself and my pitches. The past is
the past. I'm working for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (1-0) allowed two runs on five hits in 72/3 innings.
Right fielder Raul Mondesi hit his third homer of the season, a
two-run line drive to left that gave the Dodgers a 4-2 lead.
Catcher Todd Hundley added his first homer of the season and had
two RBI.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time since 1995, and the fourth time since the
Dodgers moved west in 1958, they have begun the season with three
straight wins. And the Dodgers did so despite surrendering eight
homers in the series, which accounted for all 12 of the
Diamondbacks' runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's that Mark McGwire disease. The balls are really
flying out,'' said Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, whose team hit
seven homers in the series. ``There wasn't much difference (between
the teams) in the series, but we persevered.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helped to get a stellar effort from Valdes, whose past
is riddled with inconsistency. After he broke through in 1996 with
a 15-7 mark and a 3.32 ERA, the 25-year-old fell into mediocrity by
going .500 the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He spent a spring talking about how different this year would be
because he had confidence, and the foresight to pitch in Mexico
during the offseason certainly helped him get ready for his debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed speeds, was hitting his spots and threw the ball
hard,'' Hundley said.
</P>
<P>
   The only magnified mistake Valdes made came on a changeup in the
fourth inning when Diamondbacks left fielder Luis Gonzalez (2 HR, 3
RBI) hit an 0-1 pitch over the left-field fence. The two-run homer
gave winless Arizona (0-3) a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Valdes had no problems after that. He gave up a single to
Bernard Gilkey and then retired the next 11 Diamondbacks before
turning it over to the bullpen, which turned interesting. Mel Rojas
yielded solo homers to Matt Williams and Gonzalez as Arizona pulled
within 6-4, but closer Jeff Shaw got three straight outs for his
100th career save.
</P>
<P>
   However, the talk was about Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can throw his breaking ball for strikes and spot his
fastball,'' Williams said. ``That's why he wins so many games. He
uses his fastball effectively and gets ahead of the count, and he
keeps you off balance with his breaking ball. Good pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Valdes needed on this night was an offensive
burst, and that came in a flash in the fifth inning off
Diamondbacks starter and loser Andy Benes.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Adrian Beltre, celebrating his 21st birthday, led
off the fifth with a hustling double on a liner to left-center
field. Eric Young (3 for 4) doubled in Beltre and center fielder
Devon White blooped a single to short left field to score Young
with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Mondesi punished Benes' 1-0 pitch into the
left-field stands as the Dodgers went ahead 4-2. Hundley followed
with a solo homer to right for the first back-to-back Dodgers
homers since last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened very fast,'' White said. ``It was one of those
things you can't really explain, but when you have the kind of
explosive lineup that we have, it doesn't surprise me.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   1. ETHNIC CLEANSING : A 20TH CENTURY PHENOMENON ``Ethnic
cleansings'' such as the Serbian campaign in Kosovo, have exploded
in this century, claiming 40 million lives, estimates the American
historian Norman Naimark. Ethnic minorities have always been at
risk, he says, but the risks have grown as nations define targeted
groups as enemies and apply modern industrial methods to kill or
expel them. The outlook for the next century is ot a hopeful one,
Naimark says. From Der Spiegel. 1,000 words. (English translation
available.) 2. NATO'S FIRST WAR IS A REVELATION NATO's 50th
anniversary party in Washington later this month is obviously going
to be a far more difficult and sobre occasion than planned. The
Kosovo issue will not be resolved by then, though it is possible
that combat operations may stop. That depends on Slobodan
Milosevic. But NATO has both to look ahead to what is sure to be a
long, difficult involvement in the region and to look back on what
it has just learned. By Flora Lewis. 800 words.
________________________________________________________ 3. ``THE
KHMER ROUGE NEVER DIE'' In Pailin, their stronghold near the Thai
border, some of the former mass-murderers of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge
now live in peace. Many run businesses and have made fortunes. Will
they be spared trial before an international tribunal? Could a
trial bring a new civil war? From Der Spiegel. 1,000 words.
(English translation available.) 4. DAN QUAYLE : STARTING OVER Dan
Quayle is back - and being left in the dust by the son of the
president he served. Why risk the humiliation again? He wants to be
taken seriously. By Melinda Henneberger. From The New York Times
Magazine. Full-length (4,800 words) + edited article available. 5.
STUDY MAY LEAD TO NEW TREATMENTS FOR DEADLY LUNG DISORDER Adult
respiratory distress syndrome is a common and often fatal
complication in seriously ill patients. The disorder is caused by
an out-of-control inflammatory reaction that destroys the lung's
ability to deliver oxygen to the bloodstream. Currently, there is
no treatment that can reverse ARDS, and doctors can only support
the patient until the reaction subsides. British researchers report
that a crucial protein in lung fluid may be being destroyed in
ARDS. The findings suggest that it may be possible to treat ARDS by
replacing the protein and giving drugs that prevent their
destruction. By Michael McCarthy. From The Lancet News Service.
1,000 words. 6. THE UNITED STATES : SHERIFF OR ROGUE? One of the
priorities of United States foreign policy is to combat what it
calls ``rogue states'' - countries whose behaviour on the
international stage is incompatible with the rules generally
accepted by the world community. The definition poses three
problems: the Americans fix the criteria themselves; they are
highly selective in the way they apply them (in what way is Cuba
less democratic than Saudi Arabia?) and, on closer inspection, the
U.S. itself could well qualify for inclusion on the list of states
that do not bother too much about rules that have been accepted by
most countries. By Pascal Boniface. From Le Monde. 800 words.
(English translation available.)
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
WHAT'S DOING IN JERUSALEM The typical tourists in Jerusalem fill
their days with official sites because, from the Yad Vashem
Holocaust memorial to the al-Aksa Mosque, there is so much history
to be seen. But the real, throbbing, conflicted city often gets
overlooked. By Deborah Sontag. From The New York Times Way To Go!
1,500 words.

IMMUNODEFICIENCY Hereditary baldness - in the form of male pattern
baldness - is very common. But one recently discovered form of
genetic baldness has tragic consequences, for the affected gene
causes not ony complete hairlessness from birth, but a crippling
defect in the immune system which leads to death in infancy unless
rapidly treated. By Eleanor Lawrence. 500 words. B. BANISHING
WASH-DAY BLUES Help may be at hand for the days when you forget to
sort the washing and end up with rainbow-coloured clothes. We might
soon be adding an enzyme from the ink-cap mushroom to the wash to
prevent such accidents. By Eleanor Lawrence. 500 words.. Please fax

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Manufacturing juvenile crime
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   How much better would you sleep at night knowing that a 15-year
old boy with the IQ of a 5-year-old was jailed for seven weeks for
snatching $2 from a classmate's pocket? No, actually, you did read
that right: $2.
</P>
<P>
   The boy is Anthony Laster, charged as an adult in West Palm
Beach, Fla., with strong-armed robbery, jailed over Christmas just
days after his mother had died and finally spared possible
imprisonment partly because the putative victim eventually said he
had not been so much scared as mad _ but mainly because CBS's ``60
Minutes'' had shown up with a camera crew.
</P>
<P>
   Even a zero-tolerance prosecutor, who apparently thinks the best
you can do with and for errant kids is to make criminal examples of
them, knows when to cut his losses.
</P>
<P>
   Expect more excesses of that sort _ though expect few of them to
attract as much outraged notice _ if legislation being pushed in
Congress prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans mean to give federal prosecutors the right, without
judicial review, to charge children as young as 14 as adults, and
they want to loosen the 25-year-old bar against incarcerating
juveniles in adult jails.
</P>
<P>
   The feds have little juvenile crime responsibility, but the idea
is to incite laggard states to follow with kid-whapping laws of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is preparing juvenile justice legislation, too,
but if President Clinton is true to form in the political bidding
against crime, he will tender pretty much the same, with a cosmetic
blush of prevention and a tick less punitiveness, and try to fob
the differences off as significant.
</P>
<P>
   From the political roar around this issue, you'd think we live
on a killing ground aprowl with child predators, when, in fact, we
just live in a nation where rare, extreme cases are sensationalized
for fun and profit. Juvenile crime actually has fallen sharply in
recent years, returning to traditional levels.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bad bump up in the '80s, when the crack turf wars
put a lot of money on the street and guns were huckstered to teens
sent out to swagger, kill and die for the big players. But teen
murders plunged 39 percent between 1993 and '97. Juvenile
property-crime arrests have declined steadily over 25 years.
Despite some notorious school shootings, school violence is not
worsening; children remain safer in school than at home.
</P>
<P>
   There are proven juvenile crime prevention strategies: prenatal
and early-childhood home visits by nurses and graduation incentive
programs, for just two. Alternative sentencing and concentrated
rehabilitation work well with the young. Incarceration, on the
other hand, increases the likelihood of repeat offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach County prosecutor charged 600-plus juveniles as
adults last year, single-handedly trying almost to double the
state's incarceration of nearly 700 juveniles, some as young as 13,
charged as adults and in some cases sent to adult lockups. In the
name of fighting a juvenile crime wave that doesn't even exist,
that virtually assures a later, adult crime wave.
</P>
<P>
   And Congress wants to take the blunder national?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE POINT OF NO (TAX) RETURN
 &HT;    For release Sunday, April 12.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An estimated 126 million individual income tax
forms will be filed with the Internal Revenue Service this year. If
you haven't prepared your own, be assured you're not alone:
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin confides that he too seeks help.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I did my own taxes, I'd certainly be out of a job, and I'd
probably be in jail,'' Rubin said as the annual April 15 deadline
approached. Having amassed a fortune on Wall Street before moving
here, Rubin stashes his non-governmental income in a blind trust.
</P>
<P>
   But most folks have more choices than Rubin, including the
option of filing their returns via the Internet. For a modest fee,
you can even get the job done on a secure Web site.
</P>
<P>
   One such service, blessed by a cyber-friendly IRS, tells
would-be users: ``Once there, just answer a series of plain-English
questions (no tax jargon!). Based on your responses, WebTurboTax
then fills out the proper tax forms and does all the math for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic tax filing has been around for years, but until
recently it could handle only the most basic returns. Things began
to change 15 months ago when Rubin recruited Charles Rossotti as
IRS commissioner, with a mandate to shake up the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, 99.9 percent of taxpayers can use it,'' Rossotti
says.
</P>
<P>
   IRS statisticians project nearly 30 million returns will arrive
electronically and be processed that way in 1999, posing no burden
on paper mills. That would mark a 21 percent jump from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Another 6.6 million filers are expected to use their touch-tone
telephones. But that option is limited to persons with incomes of
under $50,000 and without dependents.
</P>
<P>
   One likely bonus for filing online: a fast refund, usually
within two to three weeks after the last mouse click. By contrast,
paper tax returns mailed to the IRS will take from six to nine
weeks to be processed before a refund check comes back in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic filers will collect some $60 billion from their perch
at the head of the refund line. That's their ``reward'' for
granting the feds a no-interest loan.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin likes to stress the IRS' new consumer-friendly look
because he's aghast at the alternate approach that some Republicans
in Congress have in mind: a return-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has come up with a well-thought-out alternative,'' he
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, some 40 nations, including Britain, Germany and Japan,
employ a no-return system in one form or another, for most, if not
all, of their taxpayers. Such schemes usually rely on either exact
withholding, which does away with refunds, or a reconciliation by
the collection agency, which sends taxpayers a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Treasury and Congress tinker away at the margins
of tax reform, declining to make any broad changes. One such
mini-move, enacted last year, suggests taxpayers henceforth make
out their checks to the ``United States Treasury'' instead of to
the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may improve the public's awareness of the IRS as merely
the collector of revenue for the U.S. government,'' the lawmakers
noted. However, should Rubin's trustees overlook the adjustment and
write in ``IRS,'' the check will be cashed promptly anyway.

 &HT;    THE TAX MAN'S STING IS DEEPER, BUT COMPLAINTS ARE MUTED
 &HT;    For release Sunday, April 11.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans, filling out the last lines of their 1040
forms for Thursday's tax deadline, are paying the highest rate of
federal revenues in the nation's peacetime history. Of every $5
generated by the economy last year, slightly more than $1 went to
Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other time has revenue soaked up a greater share of
output, and that was at the height of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't Americans chaining themselves to IRS offices and
staging tax revolts?
</P>
<P>
   At least part of the reason is rising personal income that has
taken some of the sting out of paying income taxes in the late
1990s. At the same time, the nation's tax burden has been shifting
sharply to the richest taxpayers. And perhaps equally important in
tempering outrage, few taxpayers have any concept of how much they
actually pay.
</P>
<P>
   Add to all of that President Clinton's vow to save the surplus
collections for Social Security, and even many Republicans in
Congress have lost their zeal for reducing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly have been more receptive times for tax cuts,''
conceded Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Heritage
Foundation, who has been disappointed at lagging interest in
tossing out the tax code and replacing it with a simple flat tax
with one low rate.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional proposals for a 10 percent across-the-board cut
quickly died, replaced by a plan for unspecified reductions of $800
billion over 10 years. The president's budget, although it includes
a variety of targeted tax cuts, calls for more tax increases than
reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a windfall of revenues continues to pour in, largely
because the rich have gotten richer and paid soaring amounts of
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Among those making $1 million or more a year, federal income tax
payments doubled between 1993 and 1997, according to a
Congressional Budget Office analysis. People with an adjusted gross
income of $200,000 or more paid 37 percent of all income taxes
collected by the federal government, although this group makes up
only 1.5 percent of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients are paying through the nose,'' said Roger W. Lusby
III, an accountant with Frazier &AMP; Deeter in Atlanta. But he added
that annual tax complaints from clients in the upper brackets have
been somewhat muted by the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market's been good and the retirement accounts are
good,'' he said. He added that many are taking advantage of cuts in
the capital gains tax rate to a maximum 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the income scale, many low-income families
now receive checks from the federal government at tax time. With
the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit since 1993, working
parents with low and modest incomes can receive up to $3,756 when
they file their tax returns this year.
</P>
<P>
   For middle class households, income taxes have remained fairly
stable. This year, many can lighten their load if they fit under
income ceilings that allow them to take advantage of child credits
($400 for dependent children under age 18), college tuition credits
(up to $1,500), and other recently enacted tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   More burdensome for these households is the payroll tax for
Social Security and Medicare, levied on a salary base that rose
this year to $72,600. The combined 15.3 percent charge (including
the half paid by the employer) is widely seen as regressive, since
it hits hardest families with less discretionary income. The
payroll tax now exceeds income taxes for the overwhelming majority
of American households.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many taxpayers have only a vague idea of the total
amount they turn over to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``A high school student working his first job, thinking he's
earning $10 an hour for seven hours and should get $70, is shocked
when he sees his first paycheck'' after the government takes its
share, said Kathy Burlison, a tax research specialist for H&AMP;R
Block. As for the rest of taxpayers, she said, ``We just accept it
as part of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a family adds up the tax money withheld from paychecks,
that would tell only part of the story. Various levels of
government collect dozens of less visible taxes, assessed every
time they pull up to the gas pump, buy a soda, take a trip or make
other purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Americans recognized the high level of taxation, there
might well be a second American Revolution,'' wrote Bryan Riley of
the National Taxpayers Union Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Tax Reform, a group that urges slashing revenues,
has estimated that ``hidden'' taxes add an average 35 cents to the
cost of a $1.14 loaf of bread, 18 cents to a can of soda, and
$63.60 to a $159 airline ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Foundation, a private research group, has totaled
revenues of all kinds and come up with an average cost of nearly
$10,000 for every American last year. That's more than the average
per-person cost of housing, food and clothing combined.
</P>
<P>
   So are taxes too high? That depends on your perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington's paycheck has been growing faster than America's
paycheck,'' said Scott Hodge, at Citizens for a Sound Economy
Foundation, who favors an across-the-board tax cut. ``Tax revenues
as a percent of gross domestic product is estimated to be over 20.7
percent in 1999, the highest since 1944-45. And there's no end in
sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodge estimates that since Clinton took office, 35 cents of
every new dollar of personal income created by the economy has gone
to taxes.
</P>
<P>
   However, at the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice, tax policy
director Michael Ettlinger applauded the increase in tax
collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are doing well, they pay more taxes. That's a good
thing,'' he said. ``Now's the time to pave roads and build new
school buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, more loopholes should be closed so that the
rich pay even a bigger share. Dismissing charges that government
will waste money, he said, ``I think most of the money goes to
things that help people.''

 &HT;    East Texas district tops target list
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The seat in the Texas Senate that has the most
chance of turning over in next year's election is East Texas'
Senate District 3. The current question is whether incumbent Sen.
Drew Nixon (R-Carthage) will seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The district, which runs from north of Houston to Tyler and east
to the Louisiana line, is at the top of the Democrats' target list.
Winning it back could reverse the 16-15 majority Republicans enjoy
over Democrats _ if Sen. David Cain (D-Dallas) survives re-election
in Senate District 2, which stretches through Northeast Texas to
Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   That could determine which state senator might succeed Lt. Gov.
Rick Perry as the Senate's presiding officer, should Gov. George W.
Bush be elected president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason even the Republican establishment will be
trying to field someone other than Nixon in the general election
next year. Another is that the Texas Legislature in 2001 will
redistrict legislative and congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district's incredibly important,'' said Robert Black,
press spokesman for the Texas Republican Party. ``We have a slim,
one-seat majority in the Senate. ... We intend to maintain our
majority in the Senate _ and increase it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon gained notoriety after being arrested for soliciting a
prostitute in Austin during the 1997 legislative session. He
pleaded guilty and served out his sentence on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Several state representatives and others lined up to run if he
resigned. Nixon, 39, an accountant who also sells insurance and
real estate, had just been re-elected to a four-year term in 1996.
He decided to serve it _ though he also said he probably would not
seek re-election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past few months, Nixon, an unpredictable
conservative with an occasional populist streak, has been talking
about running again. ``We have not totally made up our mind,''
Nixon said last week. ``We've gotten an awful lot of people who
have indicated they'd like to see us run.'' He said he'll probably
decide by August.
</P>
<P>
   Three state representatives _ second-term Republicans Todd
Staples of Palestine and Wayne Christian of Center, and six-term
Athens Democrat Clyde Alexander _ are interested but will decide
after the legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Others considering the race include former state Rep. Bob Rabuck
(R-Conroe), a dentist who retired from the House last year after
four terms; Les Tarrance, a Montgomery County homebuilder and the
brother of Republican pollster Lance Tarrance; and Democrat David
Fisher of Silsbee, a grandson of U.S. District Judge Joe Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   The slightly Democratic district had been represented by
Democrat Bill Haley of Center for years. But Haley quit the Senate
to be a lobbyist after the filing deadline in 1994. After a
squabble over which Democrat would replace him on the ballot, Nixon
became the first Republican to win the district since just after
the Civil War. In 1996 he won re-election by just 387 votes of more
than 200,000 cast _ and that was before the scandal. With observers
speculating that well over $1 million will be spent by candidates
seeking the office, Nixon may decide he's better off seeking
privacy than re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``That district is totally overlapped by Democratic
congressional and state House races that will be in play,'' said Ed
Martin, a consultant and former executive director of the Texas
Democratic Party. ``There's going to be an effort to turn out every
Democratic vote we can. East Texas is going to be a war zone this
next election, no doubt about it.''

 &HT;    Unfit as foster parents?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The state of Texas has issued an all-points
appeal for foster parents. Hurry. Children are stacking up waiting
for homes.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says state Rep. Robert Talton.
</P>
<P>
   First, Talton wants to know if foster-parent applicants are gay
or straight. If they're the former, Talton says Texas doesn't need
the love they could supply to small refugees from shattered homes.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also needs more adoptive parents for children in its
custody. Many of these children have emotional problems,
disabilities and other conditions that mean they don't fit the
bouncing-baby, come-to-Papa, high-in-demand profile. They still
need loving parents, quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says state Rep. Warren Chisum. Straight or not? The
state should ask that first, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Talton (R-Pasadena) has authored a bill that would prevent
homosexuals from foster parenting. A bill by Chisum (R-Pampa) would
prohibit them from adopting children under the state's
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   They say it's in the best interests of the children. Better for
those children to hang in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the number of children in foster care has almost
doubled since the mid-'80s, from 275,000 to half a million.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has more than 5,000 children in foster care and a waiting
list of 2,028 seeking permanent adoption. Some of the latter are in
institutional settings. Some are in temporary foster settings. An
average of 638 additional children queue up for foster homes every
month. Roughly, Texas has about a third as many foster homes as it
has children who need them.
</P>
<P>
   It would have even fewer such homes if Talton's bill prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Under current state policies, being gay or lesbian does not
exclude a person from being a foster parent. State case workers
generally will attain a handle on facets of a foster parent's
personal life before assigning a child for foster care. But sexual
orientation alone will not disqualify an applicant. Nor should it.
</P>
<P>
   What matters to the caseworkers? Whether the foster parent or
parents will be home at night, whether the persons are dependable,
responsible and loving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for stable environments,'' said Marla Sheely of
the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion that a homosexual cannot meet all the state's
criteria for successful foster parenting or adoptive parenting is
bigotry most foul.
</P>
<P>
   Talton points out that sodomy is against the law in Texas (an
outrageous and unenforceable law, I'll add), and says foster
children shouldn't be in the homes of lawbreakers. This, of course,
is the essential function of the sodomy law, not to be enforced
against behavior itself but to legitimize discrimination against a
class of people.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time we had two words for this brand of lawmaking:
Jim Crow.
</P>
<P>
   Talton and Chisum will assert that their concerns are merely the
protection of the children. With considerable numbers of children
already having had gay and lesbian foster parents and adoptive
parents, I want to hear of the supposed atrocities and warped
childhoods this legislation would have prevented.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if we were to go broad-brush about sex assaults, abuse,
violence and more, we would prohibit adoption and foster parenting
by heterosexuals first, since as a class they appear to have major
problems abiding by laws and honoring the classic model of loving,
responsible, monogamous parents.
</P>
<P>
   That, in fact, is why the state is so desperate to find foster
parents. The Talton and Chisum bills would not make lives better
for any children, only place more of them in limbo.

 &HT;    NCR develops `Intelligent Bin' that can shop and sort goods
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Taking a page from George Orwell's 1984 , NCR
Corp. has developed a trash can that will keep track of what you
consume and when you throw the container away.
</P>
<P>
   This smart appliance will generate a shopping list for you and
then relay the information via the Internet to retailers who can
then tailor coupons and special offers based on your consumption
patterns. The ``Intelligent Bin'' can sort your recyclables, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't some sort of gadgety kind of thing. It's based upon
fundamental research of the future of computing, the future of
networks,'' said Stephen Emmott, director of NCR's Knowledge Lab in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall the Knowledge Lab came up with the Microwave Bank,
which comes with a touch screen monitor on the door and voice
recognition software. In addition to cooking food, it can be used
to transfer funds between accounts electronically and look up
recipes on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Emmott predicts such intelligent appliances will be introduced
to the marketplace within a year and widely available within three
years. Emmott said such appliances could go shopping for the lowest
price on the Web based on the shopping list generated off items
discarded into the Intelligent Bin.
</P>
<P>
   NCR researchers took four months to build the ``Intelligent
Bin,'' which uses motors to sort recyclables and an Internet
connection to relay info. The bin would require the widespread use
of radio frequency identification technology. Currently, most
products have bar codes to identify them. RFID uses a tiny computer
chip and antenna embedded into a label than can be slapped onto
products. RFID can carry more information than a bar code and can
be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Knowledge Lab has been focusing on kitchen appliances
because studies show people spend significant amounts of time
there, said NCR spokesman John Hourigan.

 &HT;    Creative spirit is the draw at Atlanta gallery giving the
disabled a voice in the arts
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Katie Smith cannot speak, a result of a stroke at age
15.
</P>
<P>
   But the 31-year-old Cumming resident does communicate _ through
the technology of her computer and the spirit of her art.
</P>
<P>
   A painter of large, modern abstracts with such titles as
``Enraged Abyss'' and ``Broken Wing,'' Smith has found her voice.
</P>
<P>
   And, because of a fledgling Atlanta gallery, she also has found
an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into the historic Healey Building, the Arts for All
Gallery is like many in the area: understated and quiet, with
glossy hardwood floors and warm lighting.
</P>
<P>
   But its mission is virtually unique. For the past year, it has
given disabled painters and sculptors an artistic home and a small
source of income.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The gallery) allowed me to show a large number and varied
array of my work to a diverse group of potential buyers,'' Smith
said via e-mail. ``Generally, my work adorns only my walls and
isn't seen by the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, one of the gallery's best sellers, said determined and
talented artists can make it anywhere. But a gallery show is good
for the ego, she wrote, and ``everyone needs strokes every now and
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating its first anniversary on May 10, the gallery is one
small part of Arts for All, a nonprofit group that has worked for
two decades to help disabled, disadvantaged or institutionalized
people participate in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   But the gallery has been more successful than expected, making
about $10,000 in sales largely due to walk-in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone on the board envisioned it to work so
well,'' said Larry Pollard, chairman of the group's board of
directors and a partner with Ernst &AMP; Young, an accounting firm.
``We wanted a place where we could showcase the visual arts,
something to catch the public's interest, but we never expected it
to generate this kind of revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, disabled artists, often already struggling with
medical and home health bills, have a tough time finding a venue
for their work. Their efforts often are relegated to festivals or
corporate offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the gallery allows their work to be seen by art buffs of all
stripes, without bias. Large picture windows allow passers-by to
examine the displays. It's not until they enter the gallery that
they learn about its special nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, the artists are artists first, disabled, second,'' said
Jennifer Sedlack, the gallery's director.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Spriggs, the curator of folk art at the High Museum of
Art, said the gallery's approach rightly emphasizes the art _ not
the artists' disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``An ongoing frustration in this field is that the difficulties
and challenges of (an artist's) life are sometimes emphasized more
than the art itself ... and that almost becomes an excuse for the
quality,'' she said. ``In this case, I really think it's great that
I could come in there and look at the work on its own merit and not
just because I know the people are disabled.''
</P>
<P>
   For James ``Seymour'' Lunsford, the gallery's top seller, the
location gives him another venue to display his work. He already
exhibits at Lansdell Galleries, near Brookwood Station, but likes
the purpose of Arts for All.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galleries are very particular about what they will use,'' said
Lunsford, who lost a foot in a car accident. ``If they don't think
they can sell it, they won't show it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this (gallery) gives artists who do nice stuff a place to
display,'' Lunsford, 50, said. ``Perhaps the standards aren't quite
as high, but neither are the prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Smith's pieces are priced from $50 to $700, with a
percentage going to the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery does require that all artists are professional, with
a staff scouting for suitable talent, said Sedlack.
</P>
<P>
   Lunsford, for example, used to be a freelance photographer
before becoming a painter. He earned a degree from the Art
Institute of Atlanta. Smith holds a degree in studio art from
Kennesaw State University.
</P>
<P>
   But those familiar with the artists say they also like the
artwork because of it represents an artistic testament of strength
and struggle against sickness. Smith, for example, has astigmatism
that causes her eyes to be in constant motion. She said that
condition helps her artwork because she never sees an object
``completely within the bounds of reality...so I create my own
world from my perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Terry O'Shea, an East Cobb dentist, said he bought pieces
because he thought they were not only pretty, but ``inspirational''
because they represent a triumph of the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers should probably balance such feelings with a basic art
knowledge in order to feel more comfortable purchasing from such a
specialized gallery, Spriggs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you decide to invest in artwork, the most important
thing is to educate your eyes,'' Spriggs said. ``And the only way
to do that is see what you can see in person, in books, in museums
and galleries. Over time, you'll be able to discern what you like
and why.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, she said, if you know you like an artist, find out more
about his or her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to invest in someone you don't really connect with
or don't respect as a human being?'' she said. ``Or would you enjoy
investing in somebody who you think is doing amazing things with
their life and their work?''
</P>
<P>
   Cassie Dillon, of Charlotte, N.C., said she bought from the
gallery because ``there's a spontaneous feel about it, an earthy
feel, that you don't see in some of the more well-known
galleries.'' Dillon most recently bought a large acrylic painting
by Lunsford.
</P>
<P>
   Another buyer, Nanalee Wegener, said she's purchased pieces by
Smith because she is captivated by the contrast between the
artist's physical presence and her artistic flair. ``When you see
her and meet her, you think she has such a quiet and gentle manner,
'' Wegener, of Cumming, said. ``But her artwork is so vibrant, so
different from that impression.''
</P>
<P>
   For the artists, it is one more opportunity to connect with
fellow human beings, without worrying about the barrier of physical
handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, art is created by the soul,'' Smith wrote. ``And that
in me was not touched.''

   POW-MUSEUM _ Before the $5.8 million National Prisoner of War
Museum opened a year ago today in this tiny southwest Georgia town,
most visitors to Andersonville were Civil War buffs who came to
gawk at the 12,920 marble tombstones of Union soldiers who perished
at the Confederate prison whose name has become synonymous with
cruelty. But since last April 9, it's become a hallowed mecca for
tens of thousands of veterans, most wrinkled, limping on canes or
pushed in wheelchairs by aging sons and daughters through the dark
corridors of the grim museum, full of relics that point out the
horrors of life as a POW. Attendance skyrocketed more than 20
percent in just the first six months, and Park Superintendant Fred
Boyles expects 12-month figures to show a 40 percent jump over the
previous fiscal year. And an unexpected consequence has been the
donation of a flood of 1,561 relics by ex-POWs who salvaged eating
utensils, hand-made weapons, diaries and even German and Japanese
flags that flew over their camps when they were liberated.

Confined by poor health alluded to only in the vaguest terms by her

Jackson's most hallowed resident is rarely seen these days.
Round-the-clock nurses tend her, and only close friends and
relatives visit. She is missed around town. Yet, even as she is
nowhere to be seen, Welty is everywhere in Jackson. By choosing to
stay here all her life, Welty is in the air, palpable in her old
haunts like the lingering perfume of someone who just left the
room. For Eudora Welty the woman, Jackson has been, quite simply,
home. For Eudora Welty the writer, Jackson has been what Oxford,
Miss. was to William Faulkner, a small but ample playground for her
imagination. (Konigsmark, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH

 &HT;    Playing time not a concern for Kerr
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ He had spent the entire game on the bench,
and now Steve Kerr was summoned by his coach to produce some
instant magic during the final seconds, maybe pull a three-point
shot out of his warm-up jacket sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs needed a three-pointer late in a recent
game against Toronto. Kerr never got the chance to shoot. But Kerr
believes that had he been open for even a split second with the
ball in his hands, he could have nailed the shot, despite having
come into the game cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be my role on this team _ to go in there every
once in a while and hit one shot,'' Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   Those are encouraging words for Gregg Popovich, the San Antonio
coach and general manager who signed Kerr (6 feet 3 inches, 180
pounds) in January with hopes that he could make the critical jump
shots that other Spurs missed last season. Jaren Jackson, signed by
the Spurs for his defense last season, missed important perimeter
shots at the end of playoff losses to Phoenix and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr began the season as the most accurate three-point shooter
in NBA history, having hit 47.3 percent during 11 years in the
league. Though his career average is only 6.9 points per game, Kerr
has been adept at hitting the one or two three-pointers his team,
the Chicago Bulls, needed the past five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But circumstances, particularly defensive matchups, have
dictated that Kerr receive sporadic playing time, according to
Popovich. He didn't play Monday against Golden State. Those who
watch the Spurs wonder if Kerr will be ready to make a big
three-point shot against Utah in the playoffs when Popovich could
not find playing time for him during the regular season against
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerr says he is not concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, that's what kept me in the league,'' Kerr said.
``For five seasons (mostly with Cleveland) before I got to the
Bulls, I never really played consistent minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Popovich said, ``Steve is used to playing three or 37 minutes
most of his career. He's always ready when you call on him. Steve
and I have talked about it. He's proven he can handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr scored a season-high 14 points on March 17 at Golden State
a day after he did not play at all at Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, he has struggled to find open shots
and has sometimes failed to convert the available ones. He averages
4.8 points per game. Kerr's 35.5 percent three-point accuracy is
acceptable for most players, but it's the second-lowest of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to have envisioned that Kerr would have difficulty
finding open shots when the Spurs agreed to pay him $11 million
over five years. After all, wouldn't 7-footers Tim Duncan and David
Robinson attract enough defenders near the basket that Kerr would
be wide open outside? As it turned out, opponents stick with Kerr
like a sweat-soaked jersey, taking their chances with leaving the
other Spurs open on the perimeter during defensive rotations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the league 11 years,'' Kerr said. ``Everybody
knows what I do. So I'm not going to get a lot of open shots off
double-teams, because when they double-team, they don't leave me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr was presented with a rare opportunity Saturday when the
Clippers left him open while they converged on Duncan. But Kerr
missed all five of his shots, four of them three-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a night to have my shot off,'' Kerr said. ``My first
three felt good. I thought they were in.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr had his best seasons with the Bulls, averaging between 7.5
and 8.6 points in 1994-98 while playing half a game or less.
Chicago uses the triangle offense, in which players are in constant
motion. Kerr had a knack for getting open while opponents worried
about stopping Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Kerr's most
famous shot was the game-winner he hit in game six of the 1997 NBA
finals against Utah to secure the second of his three championships
with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else runs the triangle,'' Kerr said. ``So when you get
used to playing a certain way and then you have to go to a totally
new style, there's going to be a transition period. I know we're
all (the former Bulls) going through that.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Kerr has played little in some games and not at all
in others goes beyond a lack of open shots. The Spurs already have
a small guard in the starting lineup, Avery Johnson, who is
generously listed at 5-11. So Kerr played only six minutes in a
recent game in Portland, where he would have had to defend Jimmy
Jackson (6-6, 220) or Walt Williams (6-8). Popovich usually calls
on Mario Elie (6-4) and Jaren Jackson (6-6) to guard such players.
And Elie and Jackson have hit the open three-point shots with
sufficient regularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can play against bigger guards,'' Kerr said. ``But
obviously, Jaren and Mario are much stronger than I am, so we don't
have to double-team when they're guarding those guys. And they've
both played well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the way the NBA works,'' Kerr said. ``I told him
(Popovich) a month ago, `Don't worry if you can't play me against
certain guys.' I'll be ready. I'm not taking it personally. We're
just trying to win. I'm a complementary player. Anyone who thinks
they'll win a championship because of me is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr's attitude and perspective were born of his modest
background as a player. While playing at Pacific Palisades High
School near Los Angeles, he was too small and slow to become a
coddled star. The only Division I team that wanted Kerr was
Arizona. And first-year Coach Lute Olson, who took over a 4-24 team
and needed players badly, did not offer Kerr a scholarship until
two weeks before classes started. Kerr did not come highly
recommended. Having watched Kerr play, Olson's wife, Bobbi, said,
``You've got to be kidding me.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lute Olson, ``Steve never stops reminding her of that.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Kerr averaged a decent 11 points a game for
his career. He and the Spurs' Sean Elliott are the only Arizona
players whose jerseys are retired.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr never envisioned a successful pro career, which is why, he
says, ``I pinch myself every day. I'm kind of shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Kerr believe he has lasted 11 years because he is
tougher than appearances suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll try to knock somebody's head off if you ask him,''
Popovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott has known that all along. As a junior in high school
living in Phoenix, he watched Kerr score 15 points as an Arizona
freshman two nights after his father, Malcolm, was assassinated in
Lebanon. Malcolm Kerr was president of American University in
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Arizona played at rival Arizona State, a group of
fans chanted ``PLO'' at Kerr and held a sign reading ``Where's your
father?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve went out and killed Arizona State, destroyed them,''
Elliott said. ``They paid a price. You could see this fire in
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Kerr tries to lend perspective to the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was five or 10 people yelling stuff,'' Kerr said. ``After
that I received hundreds of letters from ASU fans who couldn't have
been nicer, apologizing for the actions of those people. That's
just the way the world is. Wacko people. Maybe they had too much to
drink.''
</P>
<P>
   A man that forgiving, how can he complain about playing time?

   POW-MUSEUM _ Before the $5.8 million National Prisoner of War
Museum opened a year ago today in this tiny southwest Georgia town,
most visitors to Andersonville were Civil War buffs who came to
gawk at the 12,920 marble tombstones of Union soldiers who perished
at the Confederate prison whose name has become synonymous with
cruelty. But since last April 9, it's become a hallowed mecca for
tens of thousands of veterans, most wrinkled, limping on canes or
pushed in wheelchairs by aging sons and daughters through the dark
corridors of the grim museum, full of relics that point out the
horrors of life as a POW. Attendance skyrocketed more than 20
percent in just the first six months, and Park Superintendant Fred
Boyles expects 12-month figures to show a 40 percent jump over the
previous fiscal year. And an unexpected consequence has been the
donation of a flood of 1,561 relics by ex-POWs who salvaged eating
utensils, hand-made weapons, diaries and even German and Japanese
flags that flew over their camps when they were liberated.

American soldiers since Vietnam. In ``Black Hawk Down: A Story of
Modern War,'' Mark Bowden tells of the events on the streets of
Mogadishu on Oct. 3, 1993, in visceral detail. It's a lucid,
authoritative account of the raid that's great military history and

   EUDORA-WELTY _ On the eve of Eudora Welty's 90th birthday, which

Confined by poor health alluded to only in the vaguest terms by her
friends and family, Mississippi's grande dame of literature and
Jackson's most hallowed resident is rarely seen these days.
Round-the-clock nurses tend her, and only close friends and
relatives visit. She is missed around town. Yet, even as she is
nowhere to be seen, Welty is everywhere in Jackson. By choosing to
stay here all her life, Welty is in the air, palpable in her old
haunts like the lingering perfume of someone who just left the
room. For Eudora Welty the woman, Jackson has been, quite simply,
home. For Eudora Welty the writer, Jackson has been what Oxford,
Miss. was to William Faulkner, a small but ample playground for her
imagination. (Konigsmark, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH

built on ``X's.'' We get Xmas, exhilaration, exhaustion, excitement
and the drug called ecstasy, better known as X. The movie is
basically a picaresque plot machine that sends its characters

Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA

 &HT;    
 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    From coast to coast, a growing tide of dissatisfaction is
sweeping through the medical marketplace. Complaints against HMOs
and other health insurers are on the rise, and doctors and patients
across the country are registering their displeasure with a
managed-care system gone awry.
 &HT;    Somehow, just four years after ``Harry and Louise'' helped
trounce President Clinton's plans for healthcare reform, the public
is fuming over, well ... healthcare reform.
 &HT;    You remember Harry and Louise: the affable all-American couple
fraught with concern about the Clinton health plan and its promise
to introduce the dreaded M-word to American medicine. In a series
of national television ads, they shared their fears about the
perils of managed care with the public, cringing at the thought of
medical spending caps and a government healthcare bureaucracy.
 &HT;    The congenial pair appeared in a $17-million media campaign
funded by the Health Insurance Association of America. Their
mission was simple: to frighten the public into opposing the
Clinton plan by dwelling on the negative aspects of managed care.
 &HT;    It was an easy task. All they had to do was focus attention on
the reduction in health services that would accompany any effort to
rein in the nation's skyrocketing medical costs. Then they could
blame these sacrifices on the Clinton plan.
 &HT;    What Harry and Louise didn't mention was that some form of
restrictions -- or healthcare rationing -- was inevitable if we
were to avoid bankrupting the country. The nation simply couldn't
afford unlimited medical spending, which was already consuming
about 14 percent of our national economic output.
 &HT;    So in 1993, the president assembled some of the best minds in
the country in order to come up with a solution to the problem. The
result of their labors was the Clinton health plan.
 &HT;    Although the plan faced opposition from multiple constituencies
-- including the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association
of Manufacturers -- the HIAA, a trade group representing health
insurers, spent more on broadcast ads than any other group involved
in the debate. In the end, they succeeded in derailing the Clinton
plan, using two actors (whose names really were Harry and Louise)
to touch a chord in the American psyche.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, that chord still reverberates.
 &HT;    The irony is that the issues that rattled Harry and Louise are
the same issues that people are complaining about today. The only
difference is that now, instead of blaming the government, they're
blaming the new ``bad guys'': the HMOs. What the public is missing
in all this is the simple fact that somebody has to be the bad guy.
If we're to keep the country solvent, someone has to do the dirty
work of cutting medical expenses -- there's only so much money in
the pot, and we can't afford to pay for everything everyone wants
in terms of medical services.
 &HT;    So why are people still complaining?
 &HT;    Because when it comes to health care, the public has yet to come
to terms with a basic rule of economics: you can't spend more than
you've got. We recognize this reality in other sectors of the
economy, but medicine is often treated as if it's exempt from the
laws of economics because it deals with the sanctity of human
lives.
 &HT;    Yet even in life-and-death situations, someone has to pay the
bill. And the bill keeps getting larger.
 &HT;    This is why some form of rationing is inevitable. Indeed, we're
already rationing health care -- by denying health insurance
benefits to 40 million Americans, for example, we're greatly
reducing their access to medical services. We have the ability to
provide universal coverage, of course, but we'd have to allocate
billions of dollars to pay for it. Thus far, the nation has chosen
spend its healthcare dollars elsewhere.
 &HT;    Insured patients must also deal with the rationing of medical
services. When HMOs set limits for hospital stays, for instance,
they're rationing access to inpatient care. The same is true when
they require pre-certification for surgical procedures, allowing
coverage for some procedures and denying it for others.
 &HT;    Largely as a result of such controls, physicians and patients
are filing numerous complaints to state regulators over issues like
fee disputes and denial of care. But a more ominous sign is
emerging as well. Whereas complaints in the past tended to focus on
who would pay for a given medical service, insurance regulators
report that now it's a matter of whether the service is provided at
all.
 &HT;    While adapting to this restrictive environment, patients must
also contend with the fact that medical rationing is occurring in a
haphazard fashion. This is precisely what the Clinton
administration sought to avoid by developing a comprehensive
healthcare reform plan in 1993. It was an enormous undertaking, and
the plan represented the most significant effort undertaken so far
to reform our troubled healthcare system.
 &HT;    But it never had much of a chance, largely because it had to
reconcile the needs of too many different interest groups with
conflicting priorities.
 &HT;    Harry and Louise also did their part, misleading the public by
acting as if the hard choices could be avoided with a laissez-faire
approach to the healthcare problem. That helped kill the Clinton
plan, and it stopped the government from addressing a critical
issue.
 &HT;    Still, the situation isn't a total loss. Today, the perky couple
is probably at the head of the pack complaining about the cost
controls and spending caps imposed by their former employers in the
insurance industry.

 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    From coast to coast, a growing tide of dissatisfaction is
sweeping through the medical marketplace. Complaints against HMOs
and other health insurers are on the rise, and doctors and patients
across the country are registering their displeasure with a
managed-care system gone awry.
 &HT;    Somehow, just four years after ``Harry and Louise'' helped
trounce President Clinton's plans for healthcare reform, the public
is fuming over, well ... healthcare reform.
 &HT;    You remember Harry and Louise: the affable all-American couple
fraught with concern about the Clinton health plan and its promise
to introduce the dreaded M-word to American medicine. In a series
of national television ads, they shared their fears about the
perils of managed care with the public, cringing at the thought of
medical spending caps and a government healthcare bureaucracy.
 &HT;    The congenial pair appeared in a $17-million media campaign
funded by the Health Insurance Association of America. Their
mission was simple: to frighten the public into opposing the
Clinton plan by dwelling on the negative aspects of managed care.
 &HT;    It was an easy task. All they had to do was focus attention on
the reduction in health services that would accompany any effort to
rein in the nation's skyrocketing medical costs. Then they could
blame these sacrifices on the Clinton plan.
 &HT;    What Harry and Louise didn't mention was that some form of
restrictions -- or healthcare rationing -- was inevitable if we
were to avoid bankrupting the country. The nation simply couldn't
afford unlimited medical spending, which was already consuming
about 14 percent of our national economic output.
 &HT;    So in 1993, the president assembled some of the best minds in
the country in order to come up with a solution to the problem. The
result of their labors was the Clinton health plan.
 &HT;    Although the plan faced opposition from multiple constituencies
-- including the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association
of Manufacturers -- the HIAA, a trade group representing health
insurers, spent more on broadcast ads than any other group involved
in the debate. In the end, they succeeded in derailing the Clinton
plan, using two actors (whose names really were Harry and Louise)
to touch a chord in the American psyche.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, that chord still reverberates.
 &HT;    The irony is that the issues that rattled Harry and Louise are
the same issues that people are complaining about today. The only
difference is that now, instead of blaming the government, they're
blaming the new ``bad guys'': the HMOs. What the public is missing
in all this is the simple fact that somebody has to be the bad guy.
If we're to keep the country solvent, someone has to do the dirty
work of cutting medical expenses -- there's only so much money in
the pot, and we can't afford to pay for everything everyone wants
in terms of medical services.
 &HT;    So why are people still complaining?
 &HT;    Because when it comes to health care, the public has yet to come
to terms with a basic rule of economics: you can't spend more than
you've got. We recognize this reality in other sectors of the
economy, but medicine is often treated as if it's exempt from the
laws of economics because it deals with the sanctity of human
lives.
 &HT;    Yet even in life-and-death situations, someone has to pay the
bill. And the bill keeps getting larger.
 &HT;    This is why some form of rationing is inevitable. Indeed, we're
already rationing health care -- by denying health insurance
benefits to 40 million Americans, for example, we're greatly
reducing their access to medical services. We have the ability to
provide universal coverage, of course, but we'd have to allocate
billions of dollars to pay for it. Thus far, the nation has chosen
spend its healthcare dollars elsewhere.
 &HT;    Insured patients must also deal with the rationing of medical
services. When HMOs set limits for hospital stays, for instance,
they're rationing access to inpatient care. The same is true when
they require pre-certification for surgical procedures, allowing
coverage for some procedures and denying it for others.
 &HT;    Largely as a result of such controls, physicians and patients
are filing numerous complaints to state regulators over issues like
fee disputes and denial of care. But a more ominous sign is
emerging as well. Whereas complaints in the past tended to focus on
who would pay for a given medical service, insurance regulators
report that now it's a matter of whether the service is provided at
all.
 &HT;    While adapting to this restrictive environment, patients must
also contend with the fact that medical rationing is occurring in a
haphazard fashion. This is precisely what the Clinton
administration sought to avoid by developing a comprehensive
healthcare reform plan in 1993. It was an enormous undertaking, and
the plan represented the most significant effort undertaken so far
to reform our troubled healthcare system.
 &HT;    But it never had much of a chance, largely because it had to
reconcile the needs of too many different interest groups with
conflicting priorities.
 &HT;    Harry and Louise also did their part, misleading the public by
acting as if the hard choices could be avoided with a laissez-faire
approach to the healthcare problem. That helped kill the Clinton
plan, and it stopped the government from addressing a critical
issue.
 &HT;    Still, the situation isn't a total loss. Today, the perky couple

 &HT;    NEW RULE SPELLS TROUBLE FOR JAMAICA; ISLAND IS EXCLUDED FROM
THIS YEAR'S BIG BEE

<P>
   MIAMI -- With less than two months to go before the U.S.
spelling bee, organizers are trying to stanch a flow of negative
publicity surrounding this year's exclusion of Jamaica, home to the
current champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get the word out that we are not biased
against Jamaica in any way, shape or form,'' said Paige Kimble,
director of the National Spelling Bee.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Jody-Anne Maxwell, a 12-year-old from Jamaica, wowed
bee officials by becoming the first non-American to win the
high-profile, Washington-based event in its 73-year history.
</P>
<P>
   But a new rule disqualifies Jamaica from this year's National
Spelling Bee, June 2 and 3. That has spurred several unflattering
editorials in U.S. newspapers, as well as a controversy in Jamaica
so huge it's on par with ``Monicagate'' in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Kimble has taken a whirlwind tour of the United
States, visiting newspapers in various cities to try to repair the
bee's image.
</P>
<P>
   The bee is sponsored by Scripps Howard, part of Cincinnati based
E.W. Scripps Co., which has several media holdings.
</P>
<P>
   But Kimble's effort is likely to do little to sway Jamaicans and
African-Americans who remain convinced the company is biased
against Jamaicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is blatant and persistent racism and discrimination,''
said Maurice Thomson, owner of Phillips &AMP; Phillips Stationery
Suppliers Ltd., one of the Jamaican sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of black kids from a Third World country to win
the competition against all those white kids proved to be too much
of an embarrassment for Scripps Howard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimble said sponsors were informed three days before last year's
bee that a new rule would force entrants to qualify in contests
between Feb. 1 and April 11. That new rule would require a change
in Jamaica, which for nearly four decades has held its finals in
August and had already planned them in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Scripps Howard was forced to disqualify Jamaica this year after
it went ahead and held the finals in August in violation of the new
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Phillips &AMP; Phillips say they weren't formally
notified of the rule change until late July, too late to cancel the
finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told about the new rule over an informal brunch in
May, and there wasn't anything official said about it until late
July,'' Thomson insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Kimble said the rule was changed to create a more-level playing
field for the participants.
</P>
<P>
   She said that 80 to 90 percent of entrants qualify in March or
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a kid who qualified in April, and you're sitting
next to a Jamaican kid who qualified in August, then obviously you
would be at a disadvantage because you would have had less time to
prepare,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The national bee draws nearly 250 students from across the
United States, as well as from Mexico, the Bahamas, and the U.S.
territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jamaicans and African-Americans charge that the new rule
was implemented only to keep Jamaica out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, founded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
has complained to bee officials in a letter that the rule is
``exclusionary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jamaica -- a small Third World nation that stresses
educational excellence so much its students are introduced to
Shakespeare at age 8 -- the controversy dominates almost all
discussion shows on radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaicans say their poor island proved it could go head-to-head
with the world's richest country when Maxwell won the bee by
correctly spelling C-H-I-A-R-O-S-C-U-R-I-S-T, which means an artist
who works with shades of light.
</P>
<P>
   The win placed Maxwell in the Jamaica national spotlight
alongside Bob Marley and the country's Olympic bobsled team.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica has participated in the bee only twice, in 1997 and in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Jamaica, Jody-Anne is like a Michael Jordan,'' said O'Neil
Hamilton, a spokesman for Jamaica's embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kimble said she hopes Scripps Howard can re-admit Jamaica to the
annual competition in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But officials with the Daily Gleaner newspaper in Jamaica, which
runs Jamaica's national competition, said no final decision's been
made as to whether the date of the finals will be changed.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this year's finals are still scheduled in August.
</P>
<P>
   If the date's not changed, Scripps Howard will continue to
exclude Jamaica from the bee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't decided anything because the way the finals are set
up now fits nicely with our school curriculum,'' said Anne-Marie
Asher, a spokeswoman for the Daily Gleaner. ``But we're considering
a change because the bee means so much to the people here, and
especially the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kimble said she hopes Jamaica's absence this year
doesn't detract from the bee's significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no ill will towards Jamaica, but rules are rules,''
she said. ``It's very important to maintain the integrity of the
bee.''

 &HT;    SCIENTISTS, THEOLOGIANS TO DEBATE: DID GOD CAUSE THE BIG BANG?
 &HT;    760&AMP;add. For release Sunday, April 11.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some scientists who study the universe are
beginning to ask if Something did, after all, create everything _
not in six days of cosmic spectacle a few thousand years ago, but
in the instantaneous ``Big Bang'' billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Facts collected by instruments such as the Hubble Space
Telescope were supposed to wipe away big hunks of the remaining
uncertainty in the strictly scientific explanation of the origins
of time and space and matter.
</P>
<P>
   That has happened, but a few cosmologists say these new
explorations also have taken them to shores they did not expect to
discover. Now, they say, they think the universe may be too
intricate, too logical, too orderly to have ``just happened'' _
there may have been A Plan to it.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Weinberg of
the University of Texas at Austin, see nothing to suggest a pause
has occurred in the centuries-long assault on religious belief by
science. Weinberg has no patience with talk about the appearance of
a kind of ``common ground'' at the far edges of science and
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like science to go on making religion increasingly
marginal,'' Weinberg said, ``and I'm not sympathetic to any of this
talk of a reconciliation between science and religion.''
</P>
<P>
   But the idea has taken on sufficient intellectual standing that
this week, the American Association for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS), the world's largest and oldest scientific organization,
will sponsor a three-day symposium into the religious implications
of recent scientific discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Religious scholars and scientists, including Weinberg, will
plunge into such subjects as whether anything happened before the
``Big Bang,'' whether the universe is a planned, orderly place, and
whether intelligent life exists elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   These are among ``the most provocative questions in contemporary
cosmology and astronomy,'' the AAAS said in announcing the
symposium.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium is being supported by the North American
Montessori Teachers Association and the John Templeton Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation last month awarded the annual $1.2 million
Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion to physicist-theologian
Ian Barbour, whose writings, it said, have helped to ``set in
motion the ongoing scrutiny of areas where science and religion
might meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbour, once a teaching assistant to nuclear physics pioneer
Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago, teaches classes in
science, technology and society at Carleton College in Northfield,
Minn. Previous recipients of the prize have included Mother Teresa,
evangelist Billy Graham and Charles Colson, the former Watergate
figure who founded Prison Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence that interest in religion is growing today
among a significant minority of scientists,'' Barbour said.
``Moreover, a new interest in science can be found in portions of
the religious community today.''
</P>
<P>
   Exquisite measurements by the Hubble telescope have lent strong
evidence to the idea that the observed expansion of the universe
will continue forever, Barbour noted. Previously, scientists who
believe the galaxies and the space between them were created in a
cosmic explosion about 15 billion years ago had wondered whether
the swelling of space would eventually stop and all matter would
reverse itself, eventually converging in the same infinitesimal
point where it all began.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Big Bang'' began to stimulate religious reflection when
British cosmologist Steven Hawking calculated that if conditions at
the moment of the hypothesized burst of creation had been different
by a factor of only one in 100 quadrillion, the universe never
would have appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Such precision does not sound, even to some cosmologists, like
something that ``just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the Big Bang may have been only one in an
infinite series of big bangs, each occurring again when all the
matter reconverged. The universe, they say, developed from a Big
Bang that happened to get it right.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble data suggest that the universe ``will keep expanding,
rather than collapsing, and this does look a little bit more like
the creation story in Genesis than the other model, which offered
the idea of a succession of universes,'' Barbour said. ``This may
be providing some comfort to religious people.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Barbour said differences between religious and scientific views
about creation and control of the universe have ranged from mutual
contradiction to dialogue. There is a tendency among some
scientists to ``feel a sense of awe and wonder in response to the
universe which science has disclosed to us.'' This feeling leads to
the impression that there is a design to it all that is best
explained by the will of an ``intelligent and personal God.''
</P>
<P>
   Each body of thought can instruct the other, he says. Ethical
concerns about subjects like genetic cloning, stem cell research
and the release of nuclear energy defy scientific analysis, but can
be meaningfully approached in religious contexts.
</P>
<P>
   The AAAS symposium will begin Wednesday with discussions of the
whether the Big Bang actually happened, whether anything happened
``before'' it, and what, if anything, human beings may ever learn
about the earliest milliseconds of creation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, scientists will debate the question of whether the
universe was ``designed.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg's answer is direct: ``No.'' John Polkinghorne, former
president of Queens College in Cambridge, England, who became an
Anglican priest after a distinguished career as a physicist, will
take the other side.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium closes Friday with a session on the search for
signs of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   To Barbour's description of the range of reactions between
religion and science, Weinberg adds another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my physicist friends are not sufficiently interested
in religion to even qualify as practicing atheists,'' he said. ``I
do care about it. I talk about it, and I think religion is awful.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the symposium will take up timeless questions for
which there may never be answers, Weinberg added, ``I enjoy going
into conferences like this one, where everyone is full of good
thoughts, and playing the role of the cat among the pigeons.''

   MEXICO CITY -- Josefina Cruz sets up her produce stand on a
street here every morning before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   To see what she's doing, she plugs a long cable into a
electrical socket and clicks on a bare light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like an ordinary sequence of events, but consider this:
the socket is embedded in a street utility pole, courtesy of
electrical workers who charged Cruz to install it.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's arrangement is just one example of Mexico's patch-work
power system, where 10 percent -- maybe as much as 20 percent -- of
electricity is stolen or unaccounted for because of shoddy
infrastructure and jury-rigged hook-ups people here call ``little
devils.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackouts are common fare for jaded consumers, who regularly
offer bribes so their meters are fixed to understate energy use.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to make the system more efficient and to meet a 6
percent annual growth in demand -- mostly from a booming
manufacturing sector -- President Ernesto Zedillo has proposed
privatizing this state-owned industry.
</P>
<P>
   That would open the production and distribution of electricity
to private and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo says $25 billion is needed to expand and upgrade the
nation's electric industry. Without renovation, in as little as six
years it won't be able to generate enough electricity to meet
Mexico's growing needs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, private companies could build and invest in
plants and would be granted 30-year concessions to distribute
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The government would retain control over Mexico's transmission
network, as well as hydroelectric plants and its Laguna Verde
nuclear plant near Veracruz.
</P>
<P>
   If Zedillo's proposal is adopted, ``I believe there will be
fierce competition. It's an enormous and growing market,'' said
John Hushon, president of El Paso Energy International, a
Houston-based subsidiary of El Paso Natural Gas.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1992, Mexico allowed private companies to generate
electricity for their own consumption or to sell to two state-owned
companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the changes in 1992, El Paso Energy International
owns 40 percent of a power plant near Ciudad Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's latest proposal, Hushon said, is a ``logical next
step'' after Mexico's initial relaxation of protectionism in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But Zedillo's plan requires a constitutional amendment passed by
a two-thirds vote by Mexico's Congress. Ironically, more democracy
in Mexico -- which has accompanied economic reforms -- may torpedo
the privatization proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo is trying to sell his plan to Congress and the public as
a way to improve electricity delivery and free millions of dollars
in government funds for Mexico's desperate educational and social
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought is, `Why should we spend money on electricity when
the private sector can do it perfectly?' `` said Jonathan Heath, an
economic consultant in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in Mexico, privatization is, unfortunately, a bad word,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans are still shell-shocked from fast-track auctions of
public properties in the early 1990s that resulted in disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Fraud and mismanagement in privatized banks is costing Mexicans
$65 billion for a bailout. Companies that built some of the world's
most expensive toll highways begged Mexico's Congress for their own
$2.4 billion rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
   Caution has bred strong resistance in Mexico's Congress, which
no longer is controlled by Zedillo's party, the Revolutionary
Institutional Party, or PRI, as it has been for most of this
century.
</P>
<P>
   The left-of-center Democratic Revolutionary Party quickly
denounced Zedillo's proposal as a national sell-out. The
conservative National Action Party -- usually backers of free
market reforms -- is also leery.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo can't even count on his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Gonzalez, a PRI deputy in the lower house, said
residential fees that are heavily subsidized by the government have
to be raised to make the electricity industry more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other PRI members believe the plan must clearly
establish who in the future will pick up the tab for legions of
low-income people in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free market is never going to bring electricity to a
community of 20 houses miles away from a plant or to the urban poor
that ring cities,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is some union resistance, which is feeding on
Mexicans' nationalistic sensibilities. The Mexican Syndicate of
Electrical Workers in Mexico City has staged a number of large
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Union members are scared they'll lose jobs as state companies
are dissolved and that Mexico will be overwhelmed by foreigners
taking control of the energy industry, including oil, which
Mexicans jealously guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crisis doesn't exist in the electricity sector,'' said Ramon
Pacheco, a union leader. ``The constitution should not be touched.
All other alternatives should be explored first.''

SPORTS DRINKS ABOUND, BUT WATER MAY BE THE BEST CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As spring becomes less of a broken promise and
more a reality, weekend athletes start popping up like crocuses.
</P>
<P>
   And as every man, woman and child takes to the parks and bike
paths, they're sure to take a water bottle with them. If they've
bought the hype, they have a sports drink.
</P>
<P>
   You know what we're talking about: the want-to-be-like-Mike
drinks of champions. Gatorade, Powerade, Sportade and dozens of
lesser-known electrolyte-laden beverages, such as Z'lektra Sport
from American Quality Beverages.
</P>
<P>
   None has done a more masterful marketing job than Gatorade, a
Quaker Oats Co. product and the leader of the pack. Introduced to
the American public in 1965, Gatorade now comes in more than two
dozen flavors and seems to be part of the backdrop of every sport
you can find on television.
</P>
<P>
   The company says Gatorade is used by the following pro sports
organizations: NFL, NBA, PGA, NASCAR and Major League Baseball.
When was the last time you saw a Super Bowl end and the coach
wasn't doused with a 50-gallon bucket of Gatorade?
</P>
<P>
   All Powerade, a Coca-Cola Co. product, has to show for itself is
``the official sports drink of the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Z'lektra and the other wannabes are hoping you'll be
willing to experiment.
</P>
<P>
   But should you drink any of these sports drinks, which many
supermarkets now cram together in what they call their ``isotonic
beverages'' section? And is there any difference between Gatorade
and Powerade and the others?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are differences, and a fair rule of thumb for judging
is this: the smaller the market share, the better the product.
Consider the following: Gatorade, the Microsoft of sports drinks,
has about two-thirds of the desired calories of most of its
competitors, yet it contains more than twice the sodium.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-ounce glass of Gatorade has 50 calories (which, in the
case of sports drinks, more is better) and 110 milligrams of sodium
(which is way more than you need). By comparison, Powerade contains
70 calories and 55 milligrams of sodium.
</P>
<P>
   Z'lektra, made by a Syracuse company available primarily in the
central New York region, has no preservatives, natural colors and
both complex and simple carbohydrates, all claims Gatorade and
Powerade cannot make. It also has 40 milligrams of sodium per
eight-ounce serving.
</P>
<P>
   One nutritionist believes Adam Athlete would be better served
skipping sports drinks altogether and sticking with water.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the average person who does up to an hour or two of
exertion several times a week, the body is quite adept at
conserving chloride and sodium,'' said Jean Bigaouette, who has a
clinical nutrition practice in Albany. ``The body does a good job
of balancing itself out. You don't need the electrolytes in these
sports drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Water is the best replacement fluid,'' Bigaouette adds.
``Besides, those sports drinks don't even taste good.''

GLOBAL SUFFERING IN TODAY'S GLOBAL VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ These are the times you wish you had an on-off
switch in your brain or lived alone in a cave or somehow had
achieved the Zen ideal of ultimate detachment.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people are suffering on a biblical
scale, thousands of miles away, and you can do nothing about it but
wring your hands and write checks to relief agencies. Every
instinct in you wants to ignore them, to shove them completely out
of your consciousness _ don't you have enough problems of your own?
_ but you can't.
</P>
<P>
   You can do nothing to help, but you can't stop thinking about
how much help is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when you wake up in the middle of the night, you
swear you can hear fields of children crying. You can see their
mothers _ thousands of hunched-over shadows _ stretching for miles.
</P>
<P>
   Because you lie in a warm, soft bed, you try to imagine being
pulled from your house at midnight by men in black ski masks with
guns pointed at your face. You try to imagine recognizing the
voices of some of your neighbors behind the masks.
</P>
<P>
   You try to see yourself being told to run or die, leaving behind
everything you own and treasure. You try to imagine tearing
yourself from the arms of the man you love and knowing in your
heart that you may never see him again.
</P>
<P>
   You try, but your own face dissolves from the vision. You can't
imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Every comfort you have _ running water, hot food, a night's
sleep, a loving kiss _ feels like something you've stolen off a
corpse. You try to enjoy a Mozart concerto, a glass of good wine, a
book of poetry, a sunny day.
</P>
<P>
   The great imbalance won't allow the enjoyment to last.
</P>
<P>
   All that is happening in Kosovo, Macedonia and Albania has
invaded the air you breathe. It's eaten up much of the oxygen and
replaced it with an invisible, noxious gas that won't blow away.
</P>
<P>
   Are you obsessed? Perhaps. Or maybe you are simply learning what
it means today to be a member of the human family. Maybe cyberspace
and satellite communications really have built a global village,
and this is the natural result of living in it.
</P>
<P>
   Misery that weighs as much as this misery weighs can't help but
drag millions of bystanders down toward it. Even far-away
bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   You would feel better if this were not so, but would you be
better off? Do you really wish you could resist the weight? Shove
away all traces of that biblical-scale suffering with your Mozart
and your wine and your sunshine? Until you acquire an on-off brain
switch or live alone in a cave or achieve ultimate detachment,
isn't this the way it's supposed to be? When we cannot alleviate
unfathomable human pain, aren't we at least required to share just
some of it?

   The Kansas City Star is considering the following stories for
AMs and PMs of Friday, April 9. If you have any questions, please
call Don Munday on the Star's News Desk at (816) 234-4714.
INJUR: Children's Mercy Hospital releases Kansas City's first
neighborhood by neighborhood study of childhood injuries. Rates of
death and severe injury varied by a factor of 10 in certain
neighborhoods in the Jackson County portion of Kansas City. Guns
and automobiles were the leading causes of death. The hospital
hopes the study will be a first step toward grassroots efforts to
make neighborhoods safer for children. Graphics showing the
neighborhoods with the highest rates of child injury and death,
most frequent cases of death and injury, photo of doc who led the
study and of a playground littered with glass and syringes at
Troost Park. Alan Bavley. 35-40.
BUG: Congress and 30 legislatures, including Kansas and Missouri,
are working on laws that would provide legal immunity to businesses
with Y2K problems. That outrages consumer groups. Finn Bullers. 26.
FORCE: Kosovo on top of Iraq has meant our smaller Air Force is
being stretched. We're running low on cruise missiles and even
moving refugees has slowed things like deploying our attack
helicopters. Scott Canon. 30.
MGE: It's been two years since gas-bill shock and other troubles,
and MGE says its house is in order. Regulators and consumer groups
aren't so sure. A progress report. Steve Everly
PLANET: Planet Hollywood now appears to be an unlikely prime tenant
in the proposed Centertainment District development. Jennifer Mann

PERFORMANCES THE ESSENCE OF `METROLAND'S' CHARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Editors: Note use of italics in grafs 1 and 3.  
RATING: 3 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's nothing terribly deep or profound or even
new at the heart of ``Metroland,'' an enjoyably English comedy
about an idealist who wakes up one day and _ (ITALICS)yikes(ITALICS
END) _ realizes he has become his father.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's themes _ the sacrifice of youthful dreams for
grown-up comforts, the vexing difficulties of monogamy and the
undeniable appeal of French women to impressionable young men _
have been done to death and with better results. But ``Metroland''
isn't without its charms, chief of which is a pitch-perfect
performance from Emily Watson, reason enough to recommend this
likable movie.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Julian Barnes novel, ``Metroland'' is about two
childhood friends who have taken very different paths in life.
Chris (Christian Bale) and Toni (Lee Ross) grew up on the suburban
outskirts of London at the end of the London Underground
Metropolitan Line (the Metroland of the film's title). In the early
1960s, the two surly kids were part of the Anger Generation and
expressed complete contempt for anything that smacked of
conformity. Life, for them, was going to be
(ITALICS)different.(ITALICS END)
</P>
<P>
   And for Toni, it worked out that way. When he telephones in 1977
(after a long absence), he's writing bad poetry and jet-setting
around the globe using the credit card of his rich American
girlfriend. Their relationship is nonbinding and, best of all,
nonmonogamous.
</P>
<P>
   Chris, meanwhile, lives in Metroland with his lovely wife Marion
(Watson) and their baby daughter. He's a photographer (good) for an
advertising agency (bad). In other words, in Toni's eyes, he's sold
out. And, increasingly, during late-night, soul-searching walks
through the suburbs, Chris is starting to think that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Chris also has been fondly remembering his bohemian days in
Paris in the late '60s, highlighted by a tempestuous affair with a
beautiful French woman named Annick (Elsa Zylberstein). The
memories have caused a stirring in his loins. Sure, he loves
Marion, but it has been eight years of only Marion. And that wasn't
the way he thought his life was going to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metroland'' shifts between the present and the past, and lead
actors Bale and Ross are quite convincing playing characters that
age 15 to 20 years. The Parisian scenes are rather stock
(Francophiles will love the glowing photography) but contain an
agreeable frankness and a lovely turn by French star Zylberstein.
</P>
<P>
   As Chris struggles with Toni's barbs and his own self-contempt
about his measured, staid, oh-so English rationality, it's the
grounded housewife, Marion, who makes him see his life for what it
is. Not that she doesn't have a surprise or two up her sleeve, too.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's challenging presence gives the film its most original
and intelligent moments, playing a woman who hasn't lost her
idealism even though she has passed her 30th birthday. Dire Straits
leader Mark Knopfler adds a score that, like the film itself, isn't
particularly groundbreaking but has its small pleasures.

FILMMAKER LEAVE S `BLOOD GUTS' CALLING CARD

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like Quentin Tarantino and Billy Bob Thornton
before him, filmmaker Joe Carnahan has created a hoped-for
starmaking vehicle for himself in ``Blood Guts Bullets &AMP; Octane.''
Carnahan wrote, directed, co-produced, edited and starred in the
film, which debuted as a midnight movie at last year's Sundance
Film Festival. It's a notable if derivative first effort.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan plays Sid French, half of Bob &AMP; Sid's (B &AMP; S) Auto
Emporium in Needles, Calif. The story moves quickly from a bloody,
``El Mariachi''-style opening to a ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' satire
of used-car dealers and their tactics. Car salesmen are a pretty
fat target, but Carnahan gets some real laughs out of his character
and a competing salesman, Danny Woo (a Stetson-wearing Cal
Worthington type, played by Dan Harlan).
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's co-star and co-producer, Dan Leis, is less effective
as Bob. Leis captures the slick superficiality of predatory car
dealers (``I don't think they ever publicly referred to it as a
`time bomb,''' he assures a hapless nerd looking over an old
Pinto), but fails to really flesh out his character.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to save their crummy little business from eviction,
Bob and Sid agree to house a mysterious '63 Pontiac for a few days
in exchange for $250,000. Here, the ``Reservoir Dogs''-style tale
of a bungled crime begins.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of quick-cut flashbacks, we see some of the violent
history of the car as it makes its way to the desert. Some more of
the car's route is filled in by the FBI agents who are on the trail
of the car and a trail of killings left in its wake. What we don't
know, until the end, is the motive.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Sid and Bob immediately find themselves in over
their heads. ``Forget the car ... we are way, WAY out of our
(expletive) league,'' Bob shouts at Sid after Sid gets shot in a
dispute over the Pontiac. The ending is coolly downbeat and as
bloody as the final scene of a Shakespeare tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Largely as a cost-saving measure, Carnahan cast a number of
friends and relatives in the film. The movie lacks a known star, a
la Harvey Keitel in ``Reservoir,'' which might have given the
picture an extra kick. But despite a couple of bad miscastings of
minor characters _ whose desert white-trash accents come and go _
the cast is pretty solid. Particularly fine are Carnahan and Ken
Rudolph as the lead FBI agent on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Like Robert Rodriguez's ``El Mariachi,'' ``Blood'' was
supposedly made for only about $7,000 (it was blown up to 35mm by
Lions Gate, which acquired the film for distribution). The film is
low budget and looks it. At times this doesn't matter, as the
action holds your interest. Other times, the film looks and sounds
like a well-made but budget-strapped student film.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the antihero (who we won't name) turns out to be an
amoral sleazeball with a heart of gold. Do such characters exist in
real life? Maybe. But surely not as often as we see them in the
movies.

FILM HAS `NEVER BEEN' DUMBER

Note use of italics in two grafs.  
RATING: 2 stars 
By Glenn Whipp  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Adorably lamebrained in a distinctly Drew
Barrymore way, ``Never Been Kissed'' is so far-fetched that it
makes the actress's last fairy-tale movie, ``Ever After,'' seem
like (ITALICS)cinema verite(END ITALICS). Unfortunately, while
Barrymore remains a winning screen presence, ``Never Been Kissed''
is a formulaic fantasy whose supposedly up-with-teens spirit
amounts to nothing more than misguided drivel.
</P>
<P>
   Barrymore plays Josie, a mousy Chicago Sun-Times copy editor
assigned to go undercover at a local high school and report on what
teen-agers are really like. It's a good-news, bad-news scenario for
Josie. The good news: She has always wanted to be a reporter. The
bad: She hated high school and now she has to relive it.
</P>
<P>
   When Josie arrives at school, history does seem to repeat
itself. She shows up dressed in outdated fashions and behaving so
strangely that one student asks, ``Are you in special ed?'' The
popular kids immediately shun Josie and find a variety of painful
ways to humiliate her, bringing back memories of her geeky
adolescence when she was nicknamed Josie Grossie.
</P>
<P>
   But just as she triumphed over her evil stepmother and
stepsisters in ``Ever After,'' Barrymore again rises to the
challenges of today's savage youth with an assist from her older,
underachieving brother (David Arquette), who returns to school to
boost Josie's image and impress baseball scouts. Never mind the
fact that Arquette couldn't pass for a college student, much less a
high school senior.
</P>
<P>
   But then, that far-fetched subplot doesn't have anything on some
of the other, shall we say, improbabilities, here. Examples: As the
youngest copy editor at the Sun-Times, Josie has her own office and
her own (italics)assistant(end italics). Her newspaper has its own
surveillance truck and equips Josie with a mini-camera that
transmits her exploits back to the office. A reporter is fired
because he was scooped on a story. Work stops in the newsroom as
staffers follow each new development with rapt attention.
</P>
<P>
   The high school scenes are equally idiotic. The most misguided
aspect of the movie has Josie's literature teacher, Sam (played by
Mark Harmon look-alike Michael Vartan). Sam develops a thing for
Josie, despite the fact that he thinks she's supposed to be 17. He
flirts, he shares a Ferris wheel ride with Josie, tells her how
special he thinks she is. He even asks her to dance at the prom.
</P>
<P>
   It's handled in a wink-wink way because, after all, we know
Josie is really 25. But we also know that Sam thinks she's 17. When
Josie's editor tells her to go after Sam for his inappropriate
behavior, she's horrified. She won't betray a friend. The thing is,
her editor is right. And that makes the movie's fairy-tale romance
pretty wrong-headed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Barrymore is so darn cute that it's easy to forget
how egregiously stupid the movie is. No actress suffers indignities
better. Barrymore pours her heart into her wounded characters,
making them more sympathetic and endearing than a puppy dog in a
pet shop window.
</P>
<P>
   That's great when the movie is clever. (See ``Ever After.'') But
lip-quivering loopiness can only go so far on its own. And that's a
lesson Barrymore (who also executive produced this movie) needs to
learn before she picks her next project. &QL;

MAKING SCALLOPED POTATOES WITHOUT THE BOX

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Some foods, such as puff pastry and hollandaise
sauce, are just not worth making from scratch. Frankly, good
convenience versions are tasty enough to pass as the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are other convenience products that don't seem to
make the grade. Scalloped potatoes for instance. I've yet to find a
packaged version that tastes as good as Mom's. And if you con a
spouse or child into peeling and slicing potatoes, you can make
scratch potatoes just as quickly as you would dehydrated potatoes
and powder.
</P>
<P>
   The secret here is to use the microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Peel and slice 4 to 6 medium baking or yellow potatoes (or have
someone else do it). Place 2 tablespoons margarine in a 2-quart
casserole. Cover with wax paper and microwave on high for 1 minute
to melt. Stir in 2 tablespoons flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few
grinds of pepper. Microwave 30 seconds more. Gradually whisk in 2
cups milk and microwave on medium, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring every
2 minutes, until thickened.
</P>
<P>
   Add potato slices, cover and cook on medium (50 percent) power
for 20 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. Potatoes should be
cooked through. Carefully remove cover and top with slices of
American cheese (or another cheese of your choice). Microwave again
on high until cheese is melted, about 2 minutes.

`GO' WHERE TEEN PIX FEAR TO TREAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
RATING: 3 stars 
By Bob Strauss  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Clever in a Tarantino-ish way and hysterical in a
manner Kenneth Starr might relate to, ``Go'' tries really hard to
look hip. It's got young people behaving badly, three stories that
intersect and fall back on one another from different perspectives,
sudden bursts of crazy violence and gender-bending sex gags. But
the real agenda here is fundamentally square.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers, novice screenwriter John August and director
Doug Liman, whose previous feature was the differently retro
nightlife comedy ``Swingers,'' appear to be thoroughly appalled by
the prospect of young people doing anything the least bit illicit
and feel the wayward youths must be punished for their
transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   The comeuppance that spills out onto the screen includes some
very funny, even existentially absurd situations, which indicates
that we're hardly in the hands of humorless Puritans here. Still,
you come out of this movie wondering why any sensible kid would
ever wish to experiment with drugs, attend a rave or visit Las
Vegas, so cheap are the thrills and harrowing the consequences of
those acts. It's a lecture with laughs, the moral of which is that
not thinking before you, well, go off and do something always gets
you into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The first to learn this is underpaid L.A. supermarket clerk
Ronna (Sarah Polley, the fine Canadian actress from ``The Sweet
Hereafter''). She's headstrong and tough and apparently living on
her own, the latter none too successfully: Ronna's about to be
evicted _ on Christmas Eve _ unless she can drum up some rent.
</P>
<P>
   A holiday miracle of sorts arrives in the form of English
co-worker Simon (Desmond Askew), who's about to leave for Vegas
with some buddies but has a drug deal pending. If Ronna runs some
Ecstasy from Simon's connection, Todd (Timothy Olyphant, good at
mixing menace with stoner charm), to some guys at a party, she can
keep enough of the profits to pay her landlord.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the deal does not go down as easily as it should.
Ronna's partners in crime, virginal checkout girl Claire
(``Dawson's Creek's'' Katie Holmes) and stock boy Mannie (Nathan
Bexton), end up sort of kidnapped and hallucinating under a pile of
trash, respectively. As for Ronna, her fate is just awful ...
</P>
<P>
   But before we have time to absorb that, we're in Nevada with
Simon and his friends, where our hero enjoys multiple sex partners,
steals a car, sets a hotel on fire and breaks some evidently
important rules at a lap-dancing club.
</P>
<P>
   The third chapter takes us back to L.A. a few hours earlier (or
is it later that same night? With all the hard partying, you kind
of lose track). We're in the early stages of the Ronna story, but
this time from the viewpoints of the two guys she was scoring dope
for. They're Adam (``Party of Five's'' Scott Wolf) and Zack
(``Jerry Maguire's'' Jay Mohr), and they're stars of the kind of
syndicated cop show local stations air late weekend nights against
reruns of ``Walker, Texas Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Adam and Zack have apparently been busted and, to keep
the scandal quiet, are working in entrapment cahoots with a real,
weird cop, Burke (William Fichtner, in arguably the film's funniest
performance). Burke keeps dropping outrageously homoerotic hints to
the actors and insists that they spend Christmas Eve dinner at his
house, where he and wife Irene (``Ally McBeal's'' Jane Krakowski)
have a startling proposition cooked up.
</P>
<P>
   The refreshing things about ``Go'' are its kinetic energy, its
observational humor and its often realistic portrayals of young
people as tougher, more reckless and just plain crazier than the
current run of high school comedies dare to acknowledge. Liman and
company get both the silliness and the danger of the teen drug/rave
scene pretty right, and the director balances laughs with palpable
paranoia quite effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these are qualities only audiences older than the film's
target crowd can appreciate. The same is probably true of ``Go's''
underlying, finger-wagging attitude.

EXTRAORDINARY TEEN ACTRESS HAS HER EYES WIDE OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the tender age of 16, Leelee Sobieski has
already survived a blockbuster-sized disaster, being burned at the
stake and working on Stanley Kubrick's final movie.
</P>
<P>
   Even taking on Drew Barrymore with her adorability dial cranked
past 10 didn't faze Sobieski, who plays a militant nerd in the new
high school comedy ``Never Been Kissed.'' In fact, she enchanted
the film's white-hot star and producer as thoroughly as she has
impressed filmmakers ranging from Steven Spielberg to James Ivory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leelee is like an old-fashioned movie star,'' says Barrymore.
``She is one of the most extraordinary people I've met in a long
time. She is so passionate and has so much going on inside of her.
And she's so smart; she mesmerizes me and is mesmerizing to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   A little gushy, but not off the mark. Tall for her age and
strikingly articulate, Sobieski stands way out from the teen-age
actor crowd. Sometimes she works at it, like when she arrives for a
day of interviews decked out in risky combination of thrift shop
olive drab and expensive DKNY black, crowned by a green fishing hat
accented with leaves and netting.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, it's been Sobieski's natural intelligence
and radiant emotionalism that have made her performances in ``Deep
Impact,'' ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' and even her first
film, the unremarkable Tim Allen comedy ``Jungle 2 Jungle,'' shine.
</P>
<P>
   It's also why Kubrick hired her two years ago for his
long-in-the-making ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' to play a role opposite Tom
Cruise that was written for an actress 18, not 14.
</P>
<P>
   And it's why CBS chose her for the title role of its big-budget,
May sweeps miniseries ``Joan of Arc.'' Well, that and a certain
shared perspective with France's maiden warrior saint.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time Joan of Arc is being played by a
virgin,'' Sobieski notes. We're guessing she's right: Other filmed
incarnations include Maria Falconetti in the classic silent ``The
Passion of Joan of Arc,'' a quite worldly Ingrid Bergman in the
1948 ``Joan of Arc,'' Jean Seberg (whose purity reportedly did not
survive the 1957 production of ``Saint Joan'') and Milla Jovovich,
who is headlining her boyfriend Luc Besson's upcoming feature film
on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if making a public pronouncement of such a personal matter
feels strange, Sobieski shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 16 years old,'' she logically notes. ``If I was 24 and
saying this, that would be sort of strange. But I'm just open and
honest _ although I don't think I'll tell anybody when I'm not a
virgin anymore! _ and I love to say fun, silly things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's also an important fact. Joan of Arc did make a vow to
God to stay a virgin, and I think it was sort of good for somebody
who was _ not because she made a vow, but it was just her choice
for now _ to play the role.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong, well-reasoned opinions are a Sobieski specialty. Take
her take on, well, geeks.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Never Been Kissed,'' Barrymore plays a dorky undercover
reporter who pretends to be a high school student. Of course, she's
instantly rejected by the cool clique of kids but is befriended by
Sobieski's Aldys. Smart and self-possessed, Aldys proudly leads a
nerdy students' support group called the Denominators. And even
though her fashion sense can be charitably called unique, Aldys'
willowy beauty is unmistakably evident by the closing credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My upbringing always was, `Leelee, forget about the popular
boys. The nerds are the smart ones,' &UR;  &LR; '' she recalls. ``I was like,
`But the popular boys are sort of cute, Mom.' But she was right.
That doesn't mean I'm not attracted to handsome young men, but I
don't know; I think it's bizarre that nerds are always portrayed as
ugly ones. I don't find that true at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski's mother is an American writer, and her father is a
French painter of Polish and Swiss heritage. Her full name is
Liliane Rudabet Gloria Elsveta Sobieski, but she's mercifully been
called Leelee since toddlerhood. Besides, ``Liliane sounds like the
name of a little boutique in Paris; it's too sophisticated for a
kid,'' she sniffs.
</P>
<P>
   Though born and raised in New York City, she spent some of her
early childhood in France and speaks the language fluently. Her
English also seems to bear slight French inflections, the o's and
u's more pronounced. But Michael Vartan, the French actor who plays
her teacher in ``Never Been Kissed,'' describes Sobieski's precise
diction differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less an accent than the fact that she's a very bright and
intense person,'' Vartan says. ``Her pattern of speech is the
opposite of mallrat talk, if you know what I mean. It's a pretty
rare thing for a 16-year-old girl to talk like that, so it makes
you go, `What is that? That's not English.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski always wanted to follow her parents' creative pursuits,
and indeed she still makes abstract paintings. But when a casting
agent plucked her out of her school cafeteria to screen test for a
Woody Allen movie, she figured she might as well pursue the
unexpected opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, this deck of cards and all these chips had been
dropped in front of me, so why not play poker? Well, I didn't know
the rules of the game, so of course I failed. But then I took some
acting classes, learned some of the rules, and then it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski landed some TV movie gigs and a regular stint on the
short-lived ``Charlie Grace'' series before graduating to movies.
While the Spielberg-produced ``Deep Impact'' remains by far her
most widely seen work, it was her complex ``Soldier's Daughter''
portrayal of a writer's child coming of age in the 1960s and '70s
that revealed the substantial depth and breadth of Sobieski's
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've grown as a young lady grows, maturing from the
experiences she's had, as an actress as well,'' she reckons. ``The
different roles that I've done have been like living different
lives, in a way. But I don't feel fake yet, which I really like.''
</P>
<P>
   A rising profile comes with rising demands. Like being burned
alive for the climax of ``Joan of Arc,'' which will air May 16 and
18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really cold, actually,'' she says of the infamous
execution's staging, which was filmed earlier this year in the
Czech Republic. ``It was freezing, snowing. And my feet were bare!
I had to keep putting these hot packs under them so they wouldn't
go completely numb. There were some poles of fire in front of and
behind me, but I was more afraid of the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying as that medieval production was, it was a happy time
compared to what came next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no time to read anything in Prague, I was really working
every day,'' she explains. ``So when Stanley Kubrick died, I didn't
know. I had two more days of work, and when that was done my mother
told me. She was so afraid I would go into town and see it in a
newspaper; it was certainly something I hadn't expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski put in two months on the marathon ``Eyes Wide Shut''
production in 1997. But she maintained communications with the
perfectionist, England-based director _ she sent him paintings, he
sent her rare European chocolates _ after her scenes had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else associated with the film, Sobieski has vowed
not to reveal anything about its story or what she does in it.
Warner Bros. plans to release the picture, which Kubrick completed
shortly before his death last month, on July 16. But she does admit
that most of her scenes in the erotically charged movie are with
star Tom Cruise. And no, they're not the kind that would shock St.
Joan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 14 at the time,'' she notes. ``It would have been
against the law for me to do anything a little out of hand there.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a relief. And just one of the reasons why Sobieski has
nothing but fond memories about making ``Eyes Wide Shut'' _ even if
the meticulous auteur of ``2001'' and ``The Shining'' did ask for
80 takes of the same shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't difficult to work with at all; it was more of a
joy,'' she says of Kubrick. ``I think if I was working that way for
two years, I might get a little annoyed. But I only worked there
for two months, and they were a great two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was such a little girl at the time, though, and I didn't
really realize,'' says the wisely innocent teen. ``I almost wish
that I was working with him now, because then I would ask so many
more questions, and I would be so much more able to bathe in
wonder. At the time, I really didn't understand what a genius he
was.''

TWO VERY DIFFERENT FAMILIES IN TURMOIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Edward Norton delivered a powerful performance as
Derek, a racist skinhead, in ``American History X.'' That role
netted him an Oscar nomination for best actor. Meanwhile teen-ager
Leelee Sobieski showed off a maturity and presence beyond her years
in ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' her first major film role.
</P>
<P>
   The two films _ which hit video stores this week _ both have
stories that revolve around families, and both feature excellent
acting.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, ``American'' is the more explosive of the two, but
not the more satisfying. The film was steeped in controversy even
before it opened. Its director, Tony Kaye, took out ads in the
Hollywood trade papers decrying the fact the the studio had recut
his film. Whether it would have been a better film is anyone's
guess. As it stands, ``American'' keeps your attention despite its
flaws, but the brutally edgy film is often undercut by weak plot
contrivances and too many overly melodramatic moments.

   For instance, Derek, who has been sentenced to prison for
purposely killing two African-Americans after they tried to steal
his car, has a conversion, seeing the error of his ways toward the
film's end. But this epiphany hardly seems real. Derek's hatred
stems from the slaying of his father, a firefighter who was killed
while putting out a blaze in a crack house. For a number of years,
he falls under the influence of the neo-Nazi Cameron (Stacy Keach),
carrying out the older man's agenda. It's made clear during the
film that Derek is bright, even reasonable, and you wonder how he
could be blinded so long.
</P>
<P>
   But he is, and nowhere during this time does he show any concern
for his family and how he's destroying their lives with his
viciousness, particularly his younger brother, Danny (Edward
Furlong), who is following in his footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two years of prison where he shows no remorse,
he sees that the other neo-Nazis in his cellblock are not as
``righteous'' as he because they sell drugs. This and some kindness
shown to him by an African-American inmate are supposedly enough
for Derek to have a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``American History X,'' though, should be given credit for
addressing this country's skinhead culture with a cold eye. Besides
Norton's tour de force, Furlong and the rest of cast's strong
performances help viewers overlook some of the film's gaps in
logic.
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski is also surrounded by a marvelous cast in the
Merchant-Ivory film ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.'' Based on
the novel by Kaylie Jones, the daughter of James Jones (``From Here
to Eternity,'' ``The Thin Red Line''), the film is somewhat
autobiographical. It's the story of novelist Bill Willis (Kris
Kristofferson) and his family living in Paris during the '60s and
'70s, told from the point of view of his daughter, Channe
(Sobieski). When Channe is quite young, Willis and his wife,
Marcella (Barbara Hershey), adopt a 6-year-old French boy, who was
born out of wedlock to a 15-year-old mother.
</P>
<P>
   The story quickly shifts to the children's adolescent years, as
Channe and Billy (Jesse Bradford) struggle through the difficulties
of gaining acceptance in schools, while their father struggles with
his writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Soldier's Daughter'' is one of those perfect Merchant-Ivory
films (``Howards End,'' ``Remains of the Day,'' ``A Room With a
View'') that probes relationships, societal manners and emotions.
It's often the characters who drift in and out of the story that
help define it.
</P>
<P>
   There's Francis Fortescue (Anthony Roth Constanzo), the boy who
befriends Channe and is set on a life of art; Candida (Dominique
Blanc), who refuses to marry though wanting to; and Billy's real
mother, whose tale haunts the film.
</P>
<P>
   And Merchant-Ivory films always feature great acting.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe how much Kristofferson seems to inhabit the
role. His earthy touches are perfect. The underappreciated Hershey
again displays her emotional juggling act _ from happy to manic in
the blink of an eye. And Sobieski is simply impressive.
</P>
<P>
   What happens in ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' you may
ask? Well, you know and you don't know, and that's the beauty of
it. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   After NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia, the Kosovo
Liberation Army is girding for a long guerilla war to win an
independent Kosovo now and a Greater Albania later. To Washington's
chagrin, the KLA rebels have supplanted Kosovo's moderate leaders
and won the support of most of its ethnic Albanians. The author,
who writes from inside the rebel group, says that Serbian brutality
has left the KLA bent on secession.

<P>
   (1,600 words) As the world's only superpower, America is told
that it must act like ``a great nation,'' which still means
defending freedom around the world. That is a difficult enough task
for any nation. It is even more difficult for America, not only
because of its established Cold War pattern, but also because of
its longstanding tradition of holding aloof from global
partnerships.

   (1,300 words) American officials seem peculiarly blind to the
fact that often the more the United States attacks a foreign
leader, the more his popularity soars among countrymen who applaud
him for standing tall against the greatest power on earth. The
demonizing of leaders has so far failed to shorten their tenure in
power, from Fidel Castro (who has survived eight American
presidents) to Slobodan Milosevic to Saddam Hussein.

   (1,400 words) To report international news, the cost of a
journalistic caravan, including hotels, per diem expenses, car

Airfare and excess-baggage charges can easily reach $12,000. Then
there are ``extras'' such as satellite fees. New digital
technology, including smaller and lighter cameras and editing
equipment, will eventually reduce costs, but there is no indication
that the networks will use the savings to increase international
coverage.

</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) There will always be ``trapped'' minorities, no
matter how carefully boundaries are drawn, except in the smallest
or most isolated environments. But when should secession be
supported by the international community? When massive human-rights
violations, approaching the scale of genocide, are being
perpetrated. Or when reasonable demands for minority rights have
been arbitrarily rejected by a central government.

<P>
   (2,000 words) The bloodshed in Kosovo is a symptom of the
approach, in the Dayton Accords of 1995, which strengthened
Slobodan Milosevic. In fact, Dayton plunged Serbia deeper into
ethnic chauvinism, whereby the ``sacred Serb soil'' of Kosovo
matters vastly more to Belgrade than do the Albanians who resided
there. As such, the Kosovo crisis comes as scant surprise.

</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) The male appetite for battle has always been far
less voracious than either biologically inclined theorists of war
or army commanders might like. In traditional societies, warriors
often had to be taunted, intoxicated or ritually ``transformed''
into animal form before battle. Throughout Western history,
individual men have gone to near-suicidal lengths to avoid wars _
cutting off fingers or limbs or risking execution by deserting.

</P>
<P>
   (1,400 words) In the United States and other rich countries, a
pronounced gender gap with regard to foreign policy and national
security issues endures. American women have always been less
supportive than American men of U.S. involvement in war, including
World War II, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War. They are
also consistently less supportive of defense spending and the use
of force abroad.

<P>
   (1,500 words) There will always be ``trapped'' minorities, no
matter how carefully boundaries are drawn, except in the smallest
or most isolated environments. But when should secession be
supported by the international community? When massive human-rights
violations, approaching the scale of genocide, are being
perpetrated. Or when reasonable demands for minority rights have
been arbitrarily rejected by a central government.

approach, in the Dayton Accords of 1995, which strengthened
Slobodan Milosevic. In fact, Dayton plunged Serbia deeper into
ethnic chauvinism, whereby the ``sacred Serb soil'' of Kosovo
matters vastly more to Belgrade than do the Albanians who resided
there. As such, the Kosovo crisis comes as scant surprise.

   (1,500 words) The male appetite for battle has always been far
less voracious than either biologically inclined theorists of war
or army commanders might like. In traditional societies, warriors
often had to be taunted, intoxicated or ritually ``transformed''
into animal form before battle. Throughout Western history,
individual men have gone to near-suicidal lengths to avoid wars _
cutting off fingers or limbs or risking execution by deserting.

   (1,400 words) In the United States and other rich countries, a
pronounced gender gap with regard to foreign policy and national

supportive than American men of U.S. involvement in war, including
World War II, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War. They are
also consistently less supportive of defense spending and the use
of force abroad.

MISSING ATHEIST, FAMILY MAY HAVE BEEN DISMEMBERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Federal investigators suspect atheist Madalyn
Murray O'Hair and her two adult children were dismembered and put
into 55-gallon drums after they were murdered in late 1995,
according to informed sources.
</P>
<P>
   Agents think the three may have been killed in San Antonio and
then transported 120 miles west to a hidden burial site on a
5,000-acre ranch near the tiny town of Camp Wood, some 120 miles
west of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   However, a search of the area last weekend apparently didn't
turn up drums or anything else, despite the concerted efforts of
three dozen FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents using metal
detectors, dogs, a borrowed backhoe and heat-sensitive equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the property is not suspected of any wrongdoing,
but attention is focusing on an Austin man who leased the property
at the time, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Holmes, an FBI spokesman in San Antonio, declined to
comment on what authorities think happened to O'Hair and her
children or any federal interest in the lease-holder. Holmes also
declined to talk about the weekend search at Camp Wood.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has been extremely tight-lipped about its interest in
the 1995 disappearance of O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and
daughter Robin Murray O'Hair, refusing even to admit an
investigation is under way.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, who enjoyed prominence decades ago for leading the fight
to ban prayer and Bible reading in public schools, was a sick and
aging woman when she vanished.
</P>
<P>
   She and her children disappeared along with $500,000 in gold
coins after spending a month in San Antonio. They last were heard
from Sept. 29, 1995, when Jon Murray spoke to atheist officials in
Austin by cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible victim in the case, Danny Fry of Florida, was
dumped by a riverbank east of Dallas on Oct. 2, 1995, after his
head and hands had been severed. He was identified in January by
genetic testing.
</P>
<P>
   Two men linked to the O'Hair family have been arrested, although
neither is charged with an offense related to their disappearance
or the Fry slaying.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Waters, 52, of Austin, and Gary P. Karr, 50, of Novi,
Mich., were charged with being felons in possession of firearms or
ammunition. Both have extensive criminal records including violent
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ganne, the Austin lawyer representing Waters, said his
client was ``baffled'' that anyone thinks he had anything to do
with the O'Hair or the Fry cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always maintained he knows nothing about it. Like the old
joke goes, `That's my story, and I'm sticking to it,''' Ganne said.
</P>
<P>
   Waters was the office manager for O'Hair's atheist organizations
in Austin in 1994. He had said he had had no contact with the
family since he left their employment that spring.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, he pleaded guilty to stealing $54,000 from the
O'Hair family and was given probation. The same month, Karr was
released from an Illinois prison after serving more than 20 years
for aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The two had spent eight months together in the same Illinois
prison.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Karr was arrested March 25 in Michigan after agents found two
loaded guns in his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the testimony of FBI agent William O'Leary, Karr
talked freely to investigators about his role in four Texas
homicides, including at least one that involved decapitation of the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, who testified March 26 at Karr's detention hearing in
Detroit, said Karr admitted to an extensive role in the crimes but
denied killing anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He admitted to concealing property from the victims after
their death. He admitted to acquiring equipment to help the victims
be moved,'' O'Leary testified.
</P>
<P>
   The agent testified that Karr also admitted to helping conceal
the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary also testified that Karr admitted flying to New Jersey
from Texas with a member of the O'Hair family in September 1995 to
expedite the transfer of $600,000 to San Antonio. Travel records
show Jon Murray made the trip with another man.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair's surviving son, Bill Murray, said federal officials have
not told him anything about what they suspect happened to his
family members.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray said he feared they may have suffered the same
gruesome fate as Fry, whose head and hands were never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a gut feeling. I figure they would try to cover
their tracks like they did with Fry, try to bury different parts in
different places,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is probably not going to be anything to identify. Its
probably going to be DNA,'' he said.

COUPLES TRYING TO DELIVER THE FIRST BABY OF THE NEW CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRY LEE GOODRICH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, Texas _ Christine Benton is preparing for a rigorous
race. She has undergone a physical and says she's in good shape.
She's taking plenty of vitamins and even has a uniform picked out.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike an Olympian hoping to bring home a medal in 2000,
Benton's trophy would be swaddled in a soft blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Benton, 32, of Haltom City wants to have a baby on Jan. 1, 2000.
So she and her husband will be off and running on Friday _ the day
given by obstetricians and gynecologists as the ideal day to
conceive a baby to be born on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be kind of neat,'' Benton said. ``It is
something that we could say years later, `This is what happened.' I
hope we have a little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Benton and her husband are not alone in their effort to produce
the first Y2K baby. They will face competition potentially from
thousands of other couples.
</P>
<P>
   Baby races are going on across the United States. In the
Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, radio station KYNG/105.3 FM will put
up 20 married couples in a hotel on Friday. The couple that has the
baby earliest in 2000 will win at least $2,000, KYNG officials
said. And no inducing labor or having a Caesarean.
</P>
<P>
   The Bentons hope to be one of the contestants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will kind of be like a honeymoon,'' said Benton, who has
bought a new dress for the occasion. ``I'm hoping it will be kind
of romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   It will definitely be a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Preston, a Bedford obstetrician and gynecologist, said
``only about 5 percent of people will deliver on the due date.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone embraces the idea of trying for that Y2K baby. One
who dislikes the baby race is child psychologist Robert R.
Butterworth of International Trauma Associates in Los Angeles, who
appears frequently on national talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``As if children don't have enough to worry about growing up in
this world, parents are trying to burden them with another
problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will do nothing for the child,'' he said, questioning the
parents' motivation. ``But I have to admit it will be a good
research project for developmental psychologists in 2020 to see how
these `special' babies turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, there are lots of ways to boost chances of
a pregnancy, doctors and midwives say.
</P>
<P>
   One recommendation is that would-be fathers wear boxers rather
than briefs _ a valid strategy, doctors say. That means a romantic
evening in the hot tub might not be the proper warm-up for couples
who want a bun in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, the experts say, timing is everything. Because
egg and sperm are short-lived, and there are only a few days a
month when a woman is fertile, doctors and midwives generally
consult a ``fertility wheel,'' a round device about the size of a
compact disc. It's a calendar of sorts, based on the assumption
that a woman has a 28-day menstrual cycle and that the due date
will be 40 weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period
before conception.
</P>
<P>
   Individual lengths of cycles must be taken into account, Preston
said. But generally speaking, conception for a Y2K baby should
probably occur in the first 10 days of April.
</P>
<P>
   To help women pinpoint their conception time, ovulation kits
costing about $25 abound in drugstores, most requiring urine tests.
A variation on that is Ovu-Tec, said Hurst midwife Gail Johnson of
Well Woman Health Care Associates. About the size of a lipstick,
it's a microscope that can be tucked into a purse and used as a
gauge for a saliva test.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you do is lick it and examine the dried saliva under the
microscope,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   If you see bunches of what look like little ferns _ go for it,
she advised. But shapeless blobs won't do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Ovulation kits could give false positives, and boxers don't
always work, experts say. Still, modern methods make for better
odds than fertility rites from ancient times, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In certain Latin-American cultures, a pomegranate was brought
to the altar for the moon goddess, cut in half and covered with
honey, and the name of the woman written on paper and placed
between the halves,'' said Johnson, who consulted Carol Dunham's
book ``Mamatoto: A Celebration of Birth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was that the woman became ripe like the fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancient Malayans had a more chauvinistic approach, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They regarded man as a higher rational being than woman,'' she
said. ``They thought the baby was in the brain of the man and fell
down,'' ending up inside the woman.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a smidgen of truth in that, she said. ``After all,
doesn't sex begin in the brain?''

IN INDIANA, HISTORY IS SEEN FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE

<P>
   MERRILLVILLE, Ind. _ When NATO bombs rain down on Belgrade, they
are felt here in a Byzantine church built on a former corn field,
where a perplexed priest in a black robe gives history lessons to
anyone who will listen.
</P>
<P>
   The Very Rev. Jovan Todorovich leaned forward Wednesday in his
chair and, through a thick accent of his homeland, lamented the
slaughter of 77,000 Serbs in Kosovo at the hands of the Turks in
1389. His hands shaking slightly, Todorovich told the story as
though it happened the night before, and if people only knew it,
they would realize NATO is bombing the wrong side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we an enemy? Why are we a pariah of the Balkans?
Kosovo was ours, Kosovo is ours, and Mr. Clinton better register
this: Kosovo will remain ours, one way or another,'' the Serbian
Orthodox priest said quietly, more a vow than a threat.
</P>
<P>
   It is a particularly American phenomenon that no matter whom the
United States is at odds with, there are hyphenated Americans who
hail from, or trace their lineage to, a place that has been deemed
enemy soil.
</P>
<P>
   Just as consistently, those Americans with immigrant roots have
sought to correct what they consider misunderstandings about their
homeland, while also maintaining their own stars-and-stripes
patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   In northwest Indiana along the southern edge of Lake Michigan
lies a region that by some estimates is home to 100,000
Serbian-Americans. By dint of numbers alone, that makes it the
wellspring of Serbian support on US soil and _ in light of the past
two weeks of bombing _ a slow-boiling cauldron of anger,
frustration and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Merrillville, a town of 32,000 people 90 minutes from Chicago,
is arguably the Serbian-American capitol, home to two of the
region's four Serbian Orthodox churches, as well as a Greek
Orthodox Cathedral and the oldest Macedonian Orthodox church in the
nation. Aside from those grand, domed edifices, there is nothing
especially impressive about Merrillville. It is a flat, featureless
area with car dealerships and endless strip malls.
</P>
<P>
   But to Serbs and other Eastern European immmigrants it has been
a land of opportunity. They poured into this area beginning 100
years ago, drawn by jobs at Big Steel _ United States Steel Corp. _
and Little Steel _ Inland Steel Co. _ in neighboring Gary. And just
as their fathers and grandfathers withstood the searing heat of
steel mill furnances, today's residents have resisted the cultural
melting pot, reveling in their status as Americans of Balkan
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Roknich is a retired machinist and an officer in the Loyal
American Serbian Democratic Club. Zarko Korac is a retired trucker
and president of the Serbian Republican Club. There is little about
public policy these two men agree on, but they are political
soulmates on one subject.
</P>
<P>
   In separate conversations, each proudly recalled Serbia's warm
relationship with the United States during World War II. Each
invoked Serbs' rescue of several hundred allied pilots shot down
during bombing raids. Both suggested the NATO pilots flying the
current raids have betrayed that bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are seen as the Nazis,'' said Korac, 80, an American
for nearly 50 years. ``It's not very far back we were fighting with
Germany to help get American pilots home, and now America does
this? For what? For Albanians? No, that shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Roknich told his own version of the history, also with a sharp
jab at the Albanian Kosovars whose treatment by Serbian forces
under Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic triggered the NATO
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to America, I speak the language of this country.
But those Albanians never want to speak Serbo-Croatian,'' he said.
``Albania was poor, so they came to Kosovo, and they had 8, 9, 10
children to a family. All of a sudden they are a majority on Serb
land, and they push the Serbs out of there and they want their own
country. What if the Mexicans tried to do that in Texas or
California? We'd never allow it, but in Serbia, (NATO) supports
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Local Serbian-Americans are quick to note that warmth toward
their homeland does not extend to Milosevic, who is routinely
denounced as a communist and a barbarian. And yet, his pursuit of
total authority over Kosovo wins him grudging respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose side are you going to be on, the United States when they
bomb Serbia? We're not for Milosevic, we're for keeping what is
Serbian. If NATO didn't interfere, eventually the Serbs would get
rid of him themselves,'' said Olga Dotlich, president of the
Serbian Sisters of St. Sava, a women's group at Todorovich's
church.
</P>
<P>
   At Bronko's, a tavern in neighboring Crown Point that is a
gathering spot for Serbian-Americans, there is a general sense that
the Serbs are misunderstood and misrepresented by the media. There
have been no reported incidents of Serbian-Americans suffering as a
result, but tavern regulars wonder how long that will last.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are being portrayed like the Palestinians were in
the '60s and '70s, as people who don't want peace,'' said Peter
Flemming, whose father was Serbian. ``The Serbs only don't want
peace if it's a peace where the Albanians get everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At Todorovich's church, the St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church,
the bells have been rung throughout daylight hours every day since
the bombing began, in sadness and solidarity. ``I'm trying to be
forgiving, to have compassion, for the Albanians, for everyone. But
I think of Kosovo and it starts digging inside me,'' the priest
said, his voice trailing off.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Kosovar refugees being relocated to the US
naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba will be trading life in one no
man's land for another, human-rights advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't simply a question of conditions _ though people
familiar with Guantanamo call it a ``hell-hole'' of shadeless
concrete, steamy tents, and barbed wire that will be anything but
welcoming to the ethnic Albanian refugees who are expected to begin
arriving in Cuba by US airlift as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The key concern is that Guantanamo is not a US territory.
Refugees who come there, even under the auspices of an American
humanitarian mission, have no civil rights under the Constitution
and, unlike refugees on US soil, have no status to apply for asylum
and resettlement in the United States under immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is appalling,'' said Michael Ratner, a lawyer for the
nonprofit Center for Constitutional Rights in New York. ``These
people are not prisoners, they are refugees. If this is a
humanitarian operation, then the Kosovars should be brought to the
US mainland for safe haven and not put in Guantanamo, which is
really a hell-hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratner, who in a series of court cases argued _ largely
unsuccessfully _ for the rights of Haitian refugees held at
Guantanamo Bay in the early 1990s, said he thinks the Clinton
administration chose to shelter the Kosovars on foreign land to
avoid the issue of whether they have a right to resettle in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   J. Brian Atwood, who is heading the US refugee-relocation
operation, said there is no urgency on the immigration issue
because the Kosovar refugees want to go home, not to the United
States. In fact, Atwood said he was not sure when the airlift to
Guantanamo would begin or how many refugees would depart the region
because ``a lot of people don't want to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want (the refugees) to understand where they are going and
what the facilities are,'' said Atwood, who is administrator of the
US Agency for International Development. ``We are not sure how many
will want to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced Tuesday it was prepared to accommodate
as many as 20,000 refugees from Kosovo at the US naval base at
Guantanamo. US officials stressed that the relocation would be
temporary. The Kosovars would not even be processed as refugees by
the US Naturalization and Immigration Service, an INS spokesman
said, because the mission is to provide the Kosovars a haven until
it is safe for them to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our anticipation is that they are going to be allowed to
return to their homeland,'' said Russ Bergeron, an INS spokesman.
``To create a scenario where the vast majority of the Kosovars
would be given permanent refugee status would play into the hands
of (Yugoslav President) Milosevic and would further his goal of
ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees, defined under international law as individuals
persecuted in their homeland, are admitted to the United States
under an annual quota system and once here are entitled to a host
of benefits, including food stamps, Medicaid, and job training.
Most important, they are allowed to apply to become permanent
residents after one year and to have family members join them in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But refugees outside the United States have no such rights, the
US Supreme Court ruled in 1993 in a case that tested whether aliens
outside the US territory _ in this case, Haitians intercepted on
the high seas _ were entited to protections under the Immigration
and Nationality Act.
</P>
<P>
   So the rights normally afforded refugees in the United States
won't apply to the Kosovars at a US naval base in Cuba, just as
they would not apply if the Kosovar refugees were housed at the US
air base in Aviano, Italy, Bergeron said. ``In a broad sense, these
are not legal refugees, and they have no immigration status, since
there is no intention of letting them immigrate to the United
States,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said it will inform the ethnic Albanian
refugees who volunteer for relocation to Guantanamo that they will
not be entitled to apply for political asylum in the United States.
But J. Brian Atwood, the US official coordinating the refugee
operation, acknowledged Wednesday the administration ``would have
to re-evaluate the (immigration) situation'' if Kosovars were at
Guantanamo for more than six months.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Acer, who coordinates the asylum program for the Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights in New York, said refugee advocacy
groups like hers will press the administration to allow the
Kosovars freedom to travel, to obtain legal counsel, and eventually
to be brought into the United States, either to immigrate or to
unite with family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big concern is leaving them in legal limbo for long,''
Acer said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard announced on
Tuesday the 5,000 Kosovar refugees Canada agreed to accept would
have freedom to move around the country, live with host families,
and be allowed to stay permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican,
suggested to the State Department that 500 Kosovar refugees might
find the climate and living conditions more comfortable at the
shuttered Loring Air Force Base in Limestone, in northern Maine.
The State Department refused, according to Felicia Knight,
Collins's spokeswoman, citing its desire to keep the Kosovars
together in one place.
</P>
<P>
   But Irwin Stotzky, director of the Center for the Study of Human
Rights at the University of Miami Law School, said the decision to
confine the Kosovars to a ``detention facility in a hot, tropical
climate with nothing to do'' appears more political than
humanitarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the purpose of accepting 20,000 Kosovar refugees is to show
NATO and Macedonia that the United States is doing its fair share,
then these refugees are being used as political pawns,'' said
Stotzky, a legal advocate for Haitian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``By taking the refugees to Guantanamo, we could be put in the
embarrassing position of violating the refugees' human rights,
which is just what we are trying to protect them from,'' Stotzky
said.

LA TIMES'S EYES ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day the dispatches roll in from forbidden and foreboding
territory. Wednesday, there was the report _ from the checkpoint
between Kosovo and Macedonia _ of some Kosovo refugees turning
around and heading home. On Tuesday, it was an eyewitness account
of a very uncomfortable meeting in Pristina between Kosovo leader
Ibrahim Rugova and Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic.
On Monday, the story detailed attempts to administer criminal
justice on the empty streets of Pristina, including the tale of a
``journalist'' briefly detained by local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   That journalist putting himself in harm's way by filing reports
from the hellish scene in Kosovo is Los Angeles Times correspondent
Paul Watson, believed to be the only American reporter currently
based there. As testimony to the risks inherent in such work,
Watson has already had two rented bulletproof vehicles confiscated
by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does difficult stories,'' says Times editor Michael Parks
of Watson. ``It's a real calling.'' Asked if he worries about his
reporter, Parks responded, ``all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, 39, was hired by the Times in September as its Vienna
bureau chief and has been stationed in the Balkans ever since. At a
time when other journalists have been exiled from the war zone, he
has been producing a steady stream of stories with Kosovo
datelines. (His dispatches can be read on line at
http://www.latimes.com/home/news/reports/yugo/dispatch.)
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Watson is reprising the role of Caryle Murphy, the
Washington Post reporter who spent nearly a month as the only
American newspaper reporter in Kuwait during the 1990 Iraqi
invasion. She was forced underground, hiding from the Iraqis until
she finally escaped to Saudi Arabia wearing a disguise. For her
remarkable efforts, Murphy was awarded with a Pulitzer Prize for
international reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Given the events he describes in his reports, Watson has cropped
up in public, must be known to the Serbian authorities, and has not
had to completely emulate Murphy's clandestine existence. But like
Murphy, he, too, has claimed a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, as Africa correspondent for The Toronto Star, Watson
became the first Canadian to win the coveted award for his famous
photograph of a dead American serviceman being dragged through the
streets of Mogadishu in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers believe that the emotionally charged photo forced
America to reverse its policy and withdraw from Somalia. In a story
about Watson's Pulitzer that appeared in the Star, he was quoted as
saying that ``military people have told me to my face that (the
photo) degrades the American military . . . that it destroyed
morale and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Watson's Kosovo-based accounts of
another dangerous intervention will have the same impact.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   There's a strange multimedia story brewing in San Diego where a
man claiming to be the victim of an aggressive TV reporter has
taken matters _ and revenge _ into his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   About three weeks ago, Colin Flaherty _ who describes himself as
a former journalist turned public relations man _ started a Web
site dedicated to harassing Mark Matthews, a reporter for station
KGTV in San Diego. In order to spread the word, Flaherty hyped the
site in e-mails he sent to ``San Diego opinion leaders'' and
members of the San Diego Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty says his action is basic tit for tat: Matthews, he
says, invaded his privacy in pursuit of a story about who wrote a
fake letter to the editor. And now he's returning the favor. The
site _ called ``Mark and Me: Tales of an Investigative Reporter'' _
includes accounts of Matthews's alleged ``ambush'' journalism,
solicits other complaints about him, and even features photos and a
map of Matthews's home.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he's worried about violating Matthews's privacy,
Flaherty responds that ``this is 100 percent the point. I want
Channel 10 (KGTV) to come back to me and define . . . what the
limits of coverage are. . . . I'm going to engage Channel 10 in a
very public discussion of what it is people can do to get a news
story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're puzzled by this. We don't understand this. Mark is an
award-winning reporter,'' says Neal Allen, a spokesman for KGTV.
``If this is intended to have a chilling effect on our news
gathering, it will not.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, 70 US newspapers (from the Los Angeles Times to The
Wausau (Wis.) Daily Herald) and 43 Associated Press bureaus have
signed on for the National Time-Out for Diversity and Accuracy
sponsored by the American Society of Newspaper Editors and the
Associated Press Managing Editors.
</P>
<P>
   The Time-Out is a fresh attempt to tackle a stale problem.
America's newsrooms _ where only one in every nine desks is
occupied by a minority _ are too often bastions of demographic,
cultural, and philosophical homogeneity. Traditionally, newsroom
diversity has been considered a matter of equality and morality.
But Time-Out organizers want to reframe the issue, in the words of
Michael Dukakis, as one of competence, not ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Time-Out for Diversity and Accuracy is based on
the common sense proposition that in order for a newspaper to be
accurate, it should look like its community,'' stated ``Time-Out''
organizer David Yarnold at a March 29 press conference kicking off
the initiative in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Yarnold says that during the Time-Out, scheduled for the week of
May 17, newspapers will conduct content audits, examine how sources
are chosen, discuss how stories are framed, and take a hard look at
the structure of beats.

RUSSIA'S MILITARY SEES A BALKAN OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Remember ``The Peacemaker?'' The 1997 Hollywood flick
in which a maverick Russian general, disgruntled over the sad state
of his once proud country, steals nuclear warheads for Bosnian Serb
terrorists?
</P>
<P>
   That was the movie. Here is the reality.
</P>
<P>
   Today's maverick is Viktor Chechevatov, a three-star general and
commander of ground forces in Russia's Far East region, who is
convinced that NATO's attacks on Yugoslavia is ``the beginning of
World War III.'' No matter how often Russian President Boris N.
Yeltsin says Russia will stay away from the fighting, Chechevatov
keeps making public calls for Moscow to send arms and men,
preferably with him in charge, to fight the American-led alliance
alongside the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, this is insubordination. But do not look for
Chechevatov to be fired, or even reprimanded, anytime soon. Much of
the country agrees with Chechevatov when he says NATO's campaign
against Yugoslavia poses ``a direct threat to Russia.'' And the
Kremlin, which Wednesday ordered several more warships into the
Mediterranean, may be listening, too.
</P>
<P>
   As Russians watch the US-led assault on Yugoslavia, political
and military hawks are finding more support for their
confrontational policies toward the West than at any time since the
1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. They miss the way the West
feared the former USSR, and they want those days back.
</P>
<P>
   That poses a number of dangers, analysts say. In the short run,
the Kremlin may find itself forced to take an increasingly
militaristic line, even as Yeltsin repeats his promise not to let
Russia get caught up in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other forces in the Russian leadership who listen
when Chechevatov and other military leaders say that World War III
has begun, and that Moscow's best move is to aid the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma,
voted overwhelmingly for a resolution advising Yeltsin and his
government to send weapons and an unspecified military mission to
Yugoslavia. Last week, the upper house passed a similar resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There exists the risk of the military pressuring the civilian
leadership for a military reaction,'' said Alexander Pikayev, an
analyst for the Carnegie Center in Moscow. ``The political
leadership is under greater pressure from the leftist and
nationalist opposition, which wants to use the Balkan crisis to
come to power.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the Kremlin has so far ignored Chechevatov's call to
arms. Meanwhile, hundreds of volunteers have offered to fight
alonside the Serbs, thought of by some here as Russia's traditional
allies because of the two cultures' common Slav heritage and
Orthodox Christian religion. The government has told them to stay
home.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin urged Western leaders to accept a unilateral peace
proposal offered by Yugoslavia on Tuesday. Underscoring Moscow's
options if diplomacy fails, a naval spokesman said a squadron of
warships had set out from the Black Sea base of Sevastopol,
Ukraine. Moscow had previously informed Turkey that as many as
eight ships, including the missile cruiser Admiral Golovko and
several destroyers and frigates, could be passing through the
Bosphorus Strait in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Russia says the ships are heading for exercises in the
Mediterranean, but it is clear they are intended to send a message
to NATO as well.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Moscow has sent an unarmed electronic reconnaissance
ship to monitor the conflict. The Liman entered the Adriatic Sea
Wednesday, where it will begin relaying information about NATO air
strikes back to Moscow _ and possibly to the Serbs, although Russia
denies that Belgrade will get direct information from the spy ship.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of all these vessels is not that some Russian officer
might go freelancing, like that maverick general in ``The
Peacemaker,'' and act unilaterally to escalate the conflict.
Military analysts say that even given the deterioration of the
Russian armed forces over the past decade, the command structure
among field officers is still too rigid to allow that. But analysts
say Russian ships pose a threat just by being there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of Russians in the area of the conflict could
lead to an uncontrolled escalation of the situation,'' Pikayev
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombing began, commentators have underlined how weak
Russia's military has become, implying that the Cold War-style
rhetoric coming out of Moscow, and such acts of suspending ties
with NATO, are no more than symbols because Russia can go no
further.
</P>
<P>
   In a way this is true. Russia's military owes $1.5 billion in
back wages, heating bills, and rent. According to the the newspaper
Segodnya, it fields only 550 warplanes and 1,200 helicopters, 15
times less than 10 years ago and about 14 percent of NATO's 12,500
jets and helicopters. Those Black Sea fleet warships, like many
vessels in Russia's four fleets, have not had exercises in years.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia still has 6,660 nuclear warheads, and senior generals
have warned that Moscow would use them if it felt threatened, and
the Northern Fleet test-fired a ballistic missile during exercises
last week.
</P>
<P>
   But what does ``threatened'' mean? Russia's defense minister,
Igor Sergeyev, has said that the events in Yugoslavia are worrisome
because they ``could happen anywhere.'' Many Russians worry NATO
could use Kosovo as a precedent to intervene in Russia's breakaway
province of Chechnya, or in any of a number of hot spots along
proposed routes for oil pipelines out from the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombing of Yugoslavia could turn ut in the very near
future to be just a rehearsal for similar strikes on Russia,''
Chechevatov wrote in a recent letter to Yeltsin. Nearly two-thirds
of Russians agree with the general, according to a poll by the
Moscow-based Public Opinion Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the nuclear winter in Russia's relations with the
West means that no significant arms-control initiatives will be
signed anytime soon. More disturbing is the cancellation of an
exchange program that would have had US and Russian nuclear weapons
officers in constant contact at year's end to prevent any launches
as a result of Year 2000 computer troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Someone is happy about what the Balkans crisis may do for
Russia's military: defense factories and military leaders for whom
reduced spending on the army has been a disaster; officers who for
the first time in years are holding exercises; officers like
Chechevatov, who recently completed exercises that ``had nothing to
do with the Balkans'' in which his troops practiced shooting down
Tomahawk cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   These people ``are partying 24 hours a day,'' in the words of
Russian defense anlyst Pavel Felgenhauer. Parliament has already
called for increases in defense funding, although it is hard to say
where the money will come from. The Soviet military once enjoyed
the lion's share of spending, but the rest of the country lived in
relative squalor as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing good would come (of increased defense spending) for
Russians,'' said the newspaper Segodnya. ``Given the parameters of
our budget, this means turning the country into a single military
camp. We won't be able to get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   A long-term danger posed by the hawks' increasing influence is
that political moderates, and those who favor constructive
relations with the West, are finding their voices drowned out by
what one legislator, Alexi Arbatov, called ``the feeling of
helpless rage'' experienced by many Russians. This may be the
lasting legacy of the Balkan conflict for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main lessons which has been learned by the bulk of
the Russian political elite is that no one will take you into
account if you are weak,'' commented Nadezha Arbatova, history
professor at the Institute of World Economy and International
Relations. ``No one in the West loved the Soviet Union, but the
USSR caused fear, and despite the lack of love hardly anyone would
go against Moscow's position.''

CITIZENS STILL BANKS ON PITINO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- What happens when a company signs up a star to
represent it and the star suddenly loses his luster?
</P>
<P>
   That's a question Citizens Bank could be asking these days. In
the fall of 1997 Citizens paid an estimated $5 million for five
years and outbid its two larger rivals to become the bank of the
Boston Celtics. Citizens later signed a separate deal with coach
Rick Pitino, and made him the centerpiece of its radio and
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The move made a lot of sense. Pitino is good-looking,
articulate, and has the reputation of being a winner. There's only
one problem: Pitino and the Celtics aren't winning. In fact, they
are having a disastrous season.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago the Celtics were talked about as a playoff team.
Today they have one of the worst records in the league. The team
has lost consistently at home and there have been suggestions _
denied by Pitino _ that some of the players have quit on him. Just
this week the coach benched point guard Kenny Anderson for one game
for an unspecified discipline problem.
</P>
<P>
   Who brought underachievers like Anderson to Boston? Celtics
president Rick Pitino, one of those rare people in sports with the
power both to recruit players and coach them. In the memorable
words of football coach Bill Parcells, Pitino cooks the meals and
shops for the groceries. Based on the results, you might think
twice before sending him to the supermarket. Pitino traded the
number-three pick in the draft for Anderson. He also traded away
next year's first-round pick for Vitaly Potapenko, a 7-footer who,
so far, has come up short in the performance department.
</P>
<P>
   Off the court, Pitino has developed a hate-hate relationship
with the callers to sports talk radio. They call him ``Little
Ricky.'' He derisively refers to them as the ``fellowship of the
miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does Citizens Bank think of its poster boy?
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen any negative impact,'' says Hal Tovin, the
bank's chief marketing officer. On the contrary, the feedback the
bank has received on its Pitino ads could hardly be better,
according to Tovin. He says a recent survey commissioned by the
bank found that consumers consider Pitino credible, believable, and
likable. Even better, the Pitino commercials have helped Citizens
sell more home equity loans.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens also uses Pitino to give speeches and chat up
customers. There too, the results have been impressive, says Tovin.
``He is still very good at getting people to come out,'' Tovin
points out.
</P>
<P>
   Tovin is no rookie when it comes to sports. At Shawmut Bank he
developed relationships with all four sports team in Boston and
helped negotiate the deal that put Shawmut's name on the new
basketball and hockey arena, now the FleetCenter. ``Any time you go
into sports there will be blips up and down,'' says Tovin. ``We
take that risk. But Rick Pitino is a quality individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people around town who know sports think Citizens still has
a valuable property on its hands. ``Rick Pitino has a tradition of
winning,'' says Larry Moulter, president of Woolf Associates, a
sports marketing firm. ``He's rebuilding this team and that isn't
going to be accomplished overnight. These are just bumps in the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Pile, who owns his own marketing and consulting company,
agrees there is no reason for Citizens to panic. ``My instinct
tells me things will turn around,'' says Pile. ``This won't
negatively affect Citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one top advertising executive, who asked not to be
identified by name, sounded more like a member of the ``fellowship
of the miserable.'' As he put it, ``I think Pitino's effectiveness
is greatly diminished. I don't think the bank is getting its
money's worth right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino himself probably isn't letting all this negativity get to
him. His $6-million a year paycheck soothes a lot of pain. On top
of that, the man who comes through in his 1997 management and
motivation book, ``Success Is A Choice,'' is relentlessly upbeat.
The book lays out 10 steps for overachieving in business and life.
Some of the steps include, ``always be positive,'' ``thrive on
pressure,'' and ``learn from adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Success is not a lucky break,'' writes Pitino. ``It is not a
divine right. It is not an accident of birth. Success is a
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the obvious question: Is failure a choice too?

IT WILL END WITH A `PHONY PEACE DEAL' 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The score after 15 days:
</P>
<P>
   --The number of Albanians ethnically ``cleansed'' out of Kosovo
is now above 400,000; the total for the past year is approaching 1
million.
</P>
<P>
   --Macedonia and Albania, shaky to begin with, have been unhinged
by the flood of refugees that poured across their borders.
</P>
<P>
   --The war has convulsed Montenegro, Serbia's tiny sister
republic; its government sympathizes with the West, but many
Montenegrins are rallying to support Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   --In Serbia itself, Milosevic is stronger than ever; his
domestic opposition _ organized and vocal just months ago _ was the
first casualty of the NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   --Europe, facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, is
stunned; tens of refugees are dying daily; the amounts of manpower
and equipment needed to aid them are far greater than anything NATO
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   --Three US servicemen are prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   On its 50th birthday, NATO's first offensive military action is
off to a rotten start. ``Our mission is clear,'' President Clinton
said on March 24 _ to make ``Serbian leaders understand the
imperative of reversing course, to deter an even bloodier offensive
against innocent civilians in Kosovo and . . . to seriously damage
the Serbian military's capacity to harm the people of Kosovo.'' Of
those three goals, America and its allies have achieved none.
Milosevic, by contrast, has all but achieved his goal: the
depopulating of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After 6 1/2 years as president, Clinton has not a single
unalloyed foreign-policy or military success to his credit. Somalia
ended in humiliation. Haiti continues to seethe. There is no peace
between Palestinians and Israelis. Russia is sullen and dangerous.
Northern Ireland keeps erupting in violence. Saddam Hussein,
assembling his weapons of mass destruction, has outlasted the UN's
inspectors. ``Engagement'' with China has led to espionage,
campaign finance corruption, and harsh persecution of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Given that record, it was an act of the purest optimism to have
hoped that Clinton's handling of Kosovo would be well planned,
clearly explained, and deftly executed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some of us did have that hope. We hoped that Clinton would
make the case for NATO action in terms so compelling that Americans
would mobilize behind it. We hoped he would lay out Milosevic's
history of savagery _ first hijacking Yugoslavia's national
government, then revoking the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina,
then strafing Slovenia, launching all-out war on Croatia,
destroying Dubrovnik, besieging Sarajevo, torturing Bosnian women
in rape camps, killing civilians by the thousands and uprooting
others by the tens of thousands. We hoped Clinton would announce
that inasmuch as Milosevic has been the prime mover behind the
Balkans' decade of blood, his removal from power would be the
allies' first aim.
</P>
<P>
   We hoped Clinton might acknowledge that the United States bears
a special responsibility to act in Yugoslavia because of its
inexcusable failures to act in the past. We hoped he would concede
that by repeatedly drawing lines in the sand and allowing Milosevic
to cross them with impunity, his administration (like the Bush
administration before it) encouraged the Serb ruler to greater and
worse aggressions.
</P>
<P>
   We should have known better. This, after all, is the president
who had Monica Lewinsky service him sexually while, on the phone to
a member of Congress, he discussed sending US servicemen to Bosnia.
Not even Balkan slaughter and the prospect of putting American
troops in harm's way could hold his undivided attention. In
retrospect, it was naive to imagine that Clinton could ever have
mustered the seriousness or thoughtfulness required to be an
effective commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   The talk for days has been of a land invasion. It isn't going to
happen. In the months it would take to organize an expeditionary
force powerful enough to defeat the Serbian army, the conquest of
Kosovo would be over and done with. Just getting the 24 Apache
attack helicopters and 2,600 support troops promised last Monday
into Albania will take a week and a half. By then there may be no
Kosovars left to save.
</P>
<P>
   The administration declares that it will not accept some ``phony
peace deal'' in exchange for a cease-fire. It was unmoved by
Milosevic's Easter cease-fire. Only his agreement to take back the
Kosovars and restore their autonomy under NATO supervision will do,
says Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But aerial bombardment alone cannot bring that about. That means
the only options left are: &UR;  &LR; (1) a full-fledged invasion of Serbia
or (2) a phony peace deal. Option (1) might be defensible if it
resulted in Milosevic's removal, the destruction of his regime, a
supervised transition to democracy, and the repatriation of the
Kosovars. It would restore much of the respect the United States
has squandered of late. But the cost _ in blood and treasure _
would be huge, and it is inconceivable that Clinton could provide
the leadership necessary to see it through.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, to repeat, it isn't going to happen. The emptying
of Kosovo will continue. When it is done, a phony peace deal will
be arranged. Clinton will slickly explain why it is a great victory
for NATO, and some people may even believe him. But there are other
Milosevices out there _ in Central Asia, in Africa, in
who-knows-where _ who are even now contemplating a little ``ethnic
cleansing'' of their own. They will understand what happened in
Kosovo, and they will take heart.

WAGE AN ATTACK ON SERBIA'S `SOFT ASSETS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Washington Post has reported that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic had sent his son, daughters, and grandchildren
to Crete for an extended vacation. One presumes that other children
and grandchildren of the Milosevic elite are likewise ensconced,
far away from NATO air strikes and the possibility of personal
collateral damage. Precious assets get special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the United States and its NATO allies have devoted all
of their resources to attacking ``hard'' military assets in
Yugoslavia. These include missile defense systems, communications
infrastructure, ammunition depots, and the like. Cruise missiles
and laser guided bombs rain down on these targets with stepped-up
intensity. The Clinton administration believes these attacks are
``working.''
</P>
<P>
   Experience teaches that aerial assaults will not reverse what
has already happened in Kosovo. Two weeks ago, Pristina, the
capital city of Kosovo, was a bustling community of 250,000 ethnic
Albanians. Today, it has 300, according to one news account. The
battle for Kosovo is over. The Serbs have won. The only thing that
will reverse this outcome is an allied invasion of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of 19 NATO countries agreeing to use ground
troops in the Balkans is not great. The best the air campaign can
hope to accomplish is to make Milosevic more flexible when the
inevitable ``peace conference'' is convened. So the question
arises: What should the United States and its NATO allies do to
weaken Milosevic's negotiating posture?
</P>
<P>
   First, the United States and its NATO allies should continue the
air war on Yugoslavia without interruption. Degrading the military
assets and the communications infrastructure of the Serbian army
diminishes its ability to wreak further havoc in the Balkans.
Milosevic's unilateral cease-fire was patently bogus and rightly
rejected out of hand. The air war on hard assets should increase
and intensify with each passing day.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the United States should begin to mobilize a ground
force for deployment in the Balkans. Troops can be introduced into
Albania under the cover story that they are there to help with
humanitarian and relief efforts. The United States can do this
without NATO approval. Milosevic will get the point.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the United States and its NATO allies should mount an
aggressive campaign against the ``soft assets'' of the Milosevic
elite. In the past, campaigns against ``soft assets'' have taken
the form of economic sanctions and have not been particularly
successful. But just because they haven't worked against, say,
Iraq, does not mean that a ``soft assets'' campaign won't work
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian elites see themselves as cosmopolitan Europeans. They
educate their children abroad. They travel frequently throughout
the region. They shop in Athens, attend fashion shows in Milan,
dine at the finest restaurants in Paris. They care about all that _
a lot more than they care about Kosovo. The point of a ``soft
assets'' campaign would be to take all that away.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its NATO allies should publish on the
Internet a list of the names of the 3,000 to 5,000 people (and
their families) who comprise the Milosevic elite. Once published,
anyone who is on the list or related to someone on the list would
be denied entry into every NATO country.
</P>
<P>
   All existing visas would be canceled. All students would be sent
home. All businessmen would be sent packing. All diplomats would be
told to get out. Let the Serbian elites educate their children in
Moscow. Let them shop in Belgrade. Kick them out and never let them
back through customs again until Kosovo is restored.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its NATO allies should also freeze and
seize all financial assets of the Milosevic elite. Serbian elites
are legendarily corrupt. Over the years, they have stolen hundreds
of millions of dollars from their country. Many of these assets are
tucked away in Swiss banks and off-shore accounts. They use these
money havens to protect themselves in the event that their
countrymen someday take exception to their malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   The Genocide Convention, signed after World War II by most
countries, including the United States and Yugoslavia, establishes
genocide as an international crime and makes possible criminal and
civil charges against specific individuals. The United States and
its NATO allies should freeze and seize all financial assets of the
Milosevic elite as part of a concerted legal effort to prosecute
specific individuals on charges of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   A ``soft assets'' campaign could be very effective. It might
make the Milosevic elite realize that they will never be Europeans
so long as they occupy Kosovo. It could steal back the money they
stole. And it could serve as a kind of test case for future ``soft
asset'' campaigns, which may become necessary if, for example,
nationalist forces in Russia prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Waging a ``soft asset'' campaign against Yugoslavia would set
useful legal precedents for the future. And it just might split the
Milosevic elite into warring factions.

WHEN CHILDREN SEE THAT PARENTS AREN'T PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As parents, we know we aren't perfect. Our children, however,
think we are, at least when they are young. Depending on how and
when we fall off our pedestal, their reaction can range from mild
disappointment to intense anger: From their perspective, we have
let them down, and that is no small thing.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Brotter, father of three boys, found out the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   One evening last January, as he was driving the family to his
brother's birthday dinner, their car was hit nearly head-on. Both
air bags inflated, emitting an acrid smoke that caused Brotter and
his wife, Deborah Jurkowitz, to think the car was on fire. (For the
record, Jurkowitz is my cousin.) Amid lights and sirens, police and
two ambulances arrived. No one in their family was hurt, but the
occupants of the other car were taken away on stretchers and their
car was towed. Later, Jurkowitz went to the emergency room for
minor bruises.
</P>
<P>
   For Jesse, 5, Cody, 7, and Jake, 12, this was indeed a scary
scene.
</P>
<P>
   That night and the next day, they talked as a family about how
frightened they had been. Cody, however, began acting out toward
his father. ``If I tried to help or comfort him, he pushed me
away,'' says Brotter. ``If I talked to him, he put his hands over
his ears.'' Day 2 was even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Brotter is a psychotherapist who recognized not only
that Cody needed to get his anger out but also that he needed
Brotter's permission to be angry with him. ``As the driver, I had
let him down, I had put the family in danger,'' says Brotter. ``I
told him I wouldn't be surprised if he was angry at me because,
even though I did a good job of preventing a worse accident, I
wasn't able to keep it from happening altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Cody responded with fury: ``I am mad at you!''
</P>
<P>
   Being able to confront his father worked like a charm for Cody;
anger spent, his behavior soon returned to normal. Brotter,
however, felt worse. ``It was one thing to know it intellectually,
but to hear my son tell me I had let him down in such a big way
made me feel awful,'' he says. &QL; 
 &QL; 
An adaptive process &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All parents disappoint their children sooner or later. Happily,
most of us don't come off the pedestal with such a loud thunk.
</P>
<P>
   Young children think parents are omnipotent, giving us powers
that are beyond human capability. ``They can be angry with you that
you didn't keep a pet from dying or a best friend from moving
away,'' says psychologist Susan Linn of the Judge Baker Children's
Center in Boston. This is an adaptive process, she says; when they
are young and powerless, the world would feel too overwhelming if
they didn't think Mom and Dad could provide total safety and
security.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at about age 7 and continuing for several years,
however, children enter a developmental stage where they gradually
come to understand that parents have strengths and weaknesses like
everybody else and that there is a certain amount of randomness in
the world beyond even our control.
</P>
<P>
   In the normal course of events, this doesn't frighten them as
much as we think because they are also developing a greater sense
of self-control, says psychologist and researcher Judith Newman of
Pennsylvania State University. ``As they become more competent,
they have less need for us to be all-powerful and all-protective,''
she says. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Growing awareness &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Typically, this growing awareness comes from life's daily
disappointments: You forget to send him to school with lunch; you
get caught in traffic and miss the first half of her soccer game.
When it is provoked by something traumatic, however, like a car
accident, it can be more dramatic: ``If you can't protect me from
this, what can you protect me from?''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ordinary disappointments, even though a child
seems angry about the event itself, that's only half the story,
says family psychologist Linda Budd of St. Paul. ``He's really
angry that you messed up,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Parents aren't supposed to do that.
</P>
<P>
   If the mess-up is small, and assuming you don't make matters
worse by ignoring or denying it, the incongruity is absorbed
without much difficulty. But if you disappoint him consistently _
you miss game after game _ or in big way, it can be shattering.
``It's as if she's looking at you for the first time: `Omigod, this
person is not who I thought he was!' '' says Budd.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, a parent is off the pedestal in a very specific
way: only as a driver, for instance, or only as a driver on the
street where the accident happened. Budd tells of a father who
missed his 8-year-old's birthday party because bad weather
prevented him from returning from a business trip. Even though he
had been at her party every other year, for the next three years,
as her birthday neared, she would tell him, ``I guess you won't be
here for my party this year, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Budd says the response was self-defensive. ``She's protecting
herself so if there is another disappointment, it won't be so
bad,'' she says. Had the parent taken it personally _ asking
angrily, ``Why do you keep bringing up the one party I missed?!
I've been at every other party all your life!'' _ he would have
denied her her reality. A steady dose of that, says family
psychologist Peter Goldenthal of Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia, and a child learns not to share feelings because she
doesn't want to incur your anger. (She'll also stop telling you if
it makes you so sad you're tearful.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Facing up to the letdown &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you know you've let your child down, Goldenthal and others
urge parents to:
</P>
<P>
   --Validate the disappointment: ``I know it was hard for you not
to have me at your birthday party.''
</P>
<P>
   --Acknowledge that you blew it: ``I thought I did a good job of
planning, but it turned out I didn't. I'm really sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   --Express your own disappointment: ``I hated missing your party;
it made me very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   --Promise to try harder next time: ``From now on, I'm planning
my trips more carefully so this won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing what to say is sometimes not as much of a problem as
knowing that you need to say anything at all. With children who are
not expressive or in touch with their feelings, we may not even
know we have disappointed them. Goldenthal's advice is siple: ``If
you even think she thinks you've let her down, ask her if that's
so,'' no matter how young or old she is.
</P>
<P>
   This is easier to do if you start when your children are young
to create an atmosphere where feelings get talked about, including
angry feelings about you. Otherwise, he says, over time, feelings
of disappointment bottle up and lead to loss of trust, withdrawal,
or antisocial behavior. ``I see parents who feel badly and don't
say so because they think talking about it makes a child feel
worse. Not true,'' he says. ``Resentment builds quickly, especially
in teens.''
</P>
<P>
   The older the child, the more likely he'll tell you, ``It's not
a big deal.'' If he typically handles disappointment well, perhaps
you can take him at his word. But if his history is that he'll wake
up tomorrow with a stomachache, push it further: `` `I think I let
you down. How you feel is important to me, so I reserve the right
to ask you again later.' '' Even if you never get a response,
you've modeled self-awareness and introspection.
</P>
<P>
   After Brotter had his conversation with Cody, he repeated it to
his other sons to give them the opportunity to confront him with
their anger, too. Neither did. Jesse continued to talk about the
noise, the lights, and the air bags; at 5, he's in a stage of
concrete thinking, where a child can focus on only one thing at a
time. But psychologist Linn says anger could surface in a year or
two when he's at a different stage of development.
</P>
<P>
   Jake didn't express any anger either, perhaps because he's
already learned that sometimes things happen that are beyond our
control or because he's at a stage where it will take more effort
to get him to express his feelings. With a child this age,
Goldenthal recommends coming back to the subject in a few months.
``It's never too late to get feelings out or make amends,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Then he grows quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he says, ``I disappointed my daughter a few months
back when I couldn't be a guest reader in her class. I've had in my
mind that I would ask the teacher if I can read in the spring
instead but I've never told my daughter that that's my plan. I
could use a little of my own advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Brotter, meanwhile, is continually going back to the subject.
All three boys had some trepidation driving with him after the
accident, but Cody was the most anxious, often sitting in the back
seat with eyes wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could promise it will never happen again, but I know
that would be a mistake,'' Brotter says wisely. Instead, he
reassures them of the precautions he's taking. ``Does everyone have
a seat belt on?'' he'll ask. Then he might add, ``Just in case
you're wondering, I'm being extra careful as a driver.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Let a child know it's OK to express his anger with you but not
in a disrespectful way.
</P>
<P>
   --If you let your child down and he continues to hold it against
you long after it happened, seek professional advice.
</P>
<P>
   --Apologies are important, but even young children see through
them if they aren't genuine and you don't try to do better.
</P>
<P>
   --Every time we kiss a hurt to make it better, we contribute to
the belief that we have extra-human powers. Don't stop doing it,
though; children ascribe powers to us no matter what we do, and
this particular one can be loving and even helpful.
</P>
<P>
   --When a disappointment is beyond control _ a car accident, a
theft _ acknowledge that it's upsetting but also talk about the
ways in which you keep her safe: ``I always make sure everyone
wears a seat belt, I always obey traffic signals, and I drive very
carefully.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   With spring finally in full bloom, it's nice to get out in the
yard and garden, cleaning up, planting pansies and impatiens in the
window boxes, and planning all kinds of other good things. It is
particularly pleasant when the sun is warming your winter-weary
bones.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something else that you can enjoy in the warm
weather: refinishing or cleaning up that old chest, an old wardrobe
gathering mildew in the basement, or any wood furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this work can be done outdoors, which will help protect
you from all those toxic finishes and strippers that you'll be
using.
</P>
<P>
   The only things that should not be done outdoors is painting and
varnishing. Even a mild breeze can blow dust and other debris on a
paint or varnish job.
</P>
<P>
   Not so incidentally, when working with finishes and strippers,
oils and varnishes, wear rubber gloves and safetly glasses or
goggles. When sanding or spraying, wear a face mask and/or a
respirator. A simple, paper respirator is good.
</P>
<P>
   Minwax, manufacturer of stains, wood fillers, varnishes,
finishing oils, refinishers, and wood conditioners, has published a
dandy little booklet called ``Tips on Wood Finishing.'' It is
available at paint stores and building supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   Always practical, Minwax suggests the refinisher wear old
clothes, not only because they are expendable, but also because
they are lint free.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now let's get to work.
</P>
<P>
   But wait! If you have an antique piece, or think it's an
antique, do not strip or refinish it, even if the piece looks
pretty tired. Stripping and refinishing can cut the value of an
antique by half and more.
</P>
<P>
   If in doubt, take it to an auctioneer for appraisal. Local
auctioneers are quite helpful in identifying an antique or
determining whether it really is an antique.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you can do with an antique is clean it. Wipe it with a
cloth dipped in mineral spirits (paint thinner), and rub small
areas, then wipe with a dry cloth.
</P>
<P>
   You can do the same with non-antiques. Cleaning may surprise
you, removing all the dirt and old wax.
</P>
<P>
   And to make sure it is clean, Minwax offers this tip it calls
the white glove inspection. Go over the entire piece with a fresh
cloth and mineral spirits (paint thinner). If the piece is really
clean, the cloth will stay clean.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes pieces never come clean; you can wipe with mineral
spirits until the cows come home, and you still get brown stains on
the cloth. Hmm. That's because the mineral spirits are taking some
of stain off. The answer: refinish.
</P>
<P>
   Paint thinner may dull the finish, but often it can be restored
by buffing with a dry cloth. The finish is just awaiting a little
polishing, but not polish. Avoid polish.
</P>
<P>
   If there are a few bare spots in your piece, touch them up with
a penetrating oil stain to match. It will be dull but the same
color. You can also disguise scratches with an almond stick or
other scratch filler. They come in various colors.
</P>
<P>
   Minwax calls its oil stain ``wood finish.'' By any name, though,
Minwax stains are good, and in most cases clear, providing the
color without hiding the wood, as some pigmented stains do.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing you can do with an old piece without stripping
it: paint it. It's a good idea if the piece has been painted in
psychedelic colors _ you know: purple, orange, that awful green _
or the paint is chipping badly. Or, if the wood is not particularly
attractive, even stained and varnished. Some pieces look better
painted.
</P>
<P>
   Painting is easy, compared with stripping and refinishing, but
there are rules to follow: 1. Sand the old paint thoroughly to
roughen the finish and reduce gloss. 2. Wash with paint thinner or
a strong solution of detergent and water. 3. Apply one coat of a
latex enamel undercoater, also called primer sealer. If you skip
this rule, you'll regret it. 4. Apply two coats of finish paint:
high-gloss, oil-baed indoor-outdoor enamel; semigloss or satin
latex enamel; or eggshell (low sheen) latex wall paint.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth rule: use thin coats, not thinned-down paint but thin
layers.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now let's really go to work. Stripping gets the wood ready
for stain and varnish or just varnish. There are several ways to
strip: sanding, paint remover, and a hot-air gun.
</P>
<P>
   Remove all hardware, hinges and other metal pieces that could be
damaged by the stripping process.
</P>
<P>
   Sand with a small power sander, being careful to keep the
surface even, with no ripples or high or low spots.
</P>
<P>
   Sanding will remove both varnish and stain, which is good, but
you can't sand the little nooks and crannies and fancy trim. You
have to use chemical paint remover for those areas. Apply the
remover, let it soak into the niches and nooks, then scrub out the
old finish with an old toothbrush. Get the stubborn spots with an
awl, ice pick, or other dull-pointed tool.
</P>
<P>
   But how can you sand the grooved turnings in chair and table
legs? Try this: Spin steel wool on a stout cord and pull the string
back and forth in each groove. In fact, you can buy sanding cords
in building supply and paint stores.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical paint stripper is the second way to remove old
finishes, but they may not remove a stain. Sanding is the only way
to get the stain out.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest strippers contain methylene chloride, a toxic
chemical, but they work the fastest. Rubber gloves and a face mask
are the things to wear when working with this material. If working
iondoors, use lots of ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   Some strippers do not contain methylene chloride; one is a
citrus-based remover called Citristrip.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical strippers will remove varnish very quickly; it takes
longer and more work to strip paint. These jobs are sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   Let the stripper stay on the finish for at least 15 minutes to
soften the finish; if the finish does not soften, apply another
coat of stripper over the first.
</P>
<P>
   Use a wide putty knife to scrape off the softened finish. If any
remains, repeat with the stripper and scrub with steel wool, or
sand off the final bit.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid using steel wool on surfaces you plan to use water-based
finishe on; shards of steel get caught in the wood, and the
water-based materials will create all kinds of little rust marks on
your work.
</P>
<P>
   A hot-air gun is an excellent way to remove paint and varnish;
it heats the material enough to soften the finish, which is then
scraped away with a putty knife. And this project is clean; when
the scrapings are removed, they dry out as they cool off, and they
are easily swept up for disposal.
</P>
<P>
   A hot-air gun is another reason to work outdoors. A hot-air gun
(it shoots air 700 to 1,000 degrees) should never be used indoors.
Wood ignites at about 500 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the finish is off, to stain or not to stain is a
question you will have to answer yourself. It's a matter of taste,
and penetrating oil stains come in many colors.
</P>
<P>
   Hardwoods take stains very well, and evenly. Softwoods,
especially pine, take stains unevenly, leaving strong and weak
colors. To avoid this unevenness, apply a sanding sealer, which
will seal the wood enough so stain will go on evenly. Minwax calls
its sealer Wood Conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   Apply stain with a paintbrush, foam brush, or the down-and-dirty
way, with a cloth dipped in the stain. For a light stain, wipe it
off with a dry cloth immediately after applying. For darker tones,
let the stain sit a while before wiping dry, or apply a second
coat.
</P>
<P>
   For the finale, finish with a polyurethane varnish. How good
your finish will be depends on your skill and the brush. Your skill
can be honed by practice; the quality of the brush depends on its
price. So don't stint on the brushes.
</P>
<P>
   For old pieces, especially those previously varnished, use an
oil-based polyurethane varnish; it is apt to be more compatible
with different finishes than water-based polyurethane varnish. You
can use high gloss, but that may not be to your taste, and some
furniture is not meant to have a high gloss. Or, choose satin or
semigloss. Two coats are usually all you need, although sometimes
three are better.
</P>
<P>
   Another good tip that Minwax gives is to follow instructions on
the container, no matter what you use. This is especially important
when applying the final finish.
</P>
<P>
   For many pieces, you can use water-based polyurethane varnish,
which has these advantages: It is fast drying and brushes can be
cleaned up with water.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to be more careful with water-based polyurethane
varnish because it may not be compatible with old finishes, and
also with oil-based polyurethanes.
</P>
<P>
   As with any application, thin coats can make all the difference
in the final result.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that is one thing you have to be careful about with the
water-based varnish. It looks milky in the can, and sometimes goes
on milky, but the manufacturers assure us that this milkiness will
go away when the varnish begins to dry.
</P>
<P>
   But not always, particularly if you are careless in how thin you
make the coats.
</P>
<P>
   So, thin coats count double with water-based varnish.
</P>
<P>
   OK, you're all set. You can even do the work on Easter Sunday,
because there's an old Latin saying (I forget the Latin): ``To Work
is to Pray.''

RUSSELL'S LAUGH ALMOST AS LEGENDARY AS HIS PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The limousine's back seat is filled with music, even
though no one has flipped on the radio. What you hear is the sound
of a tenor, erupting with full notes and notes of laughter. It is
Bill Russell, still cackling from a previous joke. And as Russell
rolls through the streets of Roxbury on his way to the FleetCenter,
you often hear these surprising high-pitched bursts of sound mixed
with a little basketball history.
</P>
<P>
   Before you take this limo ride with Russell, you must understand
this: You cannot hear him laugh without laughing a lot yourself. It
is impossible. The man who owns more NBA championship rings (11)
than anyone was one of the first athletes to host ``Saturday Night
Live.'' It would have been more appropriate if he had been a
regular on one of those ``Make Me Laugh'' game shows. If I were
trying to win the first-prize big money and had to scowl for three
minutes with Russell laughing in my face, well, just call me Mr.
Runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   Russell was here Wednesday to talk about the tribute that will
be held for him May 26. That date will be 30 years and three weeks
after he played his final pro game for the Celtics in Los Angeles.
During his tribute, he will have his No. 6 jersey re-retired. He
will be surrounded by Aretha Franklin, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom
Brokaw, Muhammad Ali, and his daughter, Karen. He'll laugh a
little, too. It's fitting that a very funny man named Bill Cosby
will host the event.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's shiny black limo was parked outside the Reggie Lewis
Center Wednesday. Eventually he would climb in and be taken to the
FleetCenter, where he would speak at his press conference. But not
before he reminded John Thomas, owner of two Olympic medals, of how
he embarrassed him during a pickup basketball game when Thomas was
a kid who didn't know better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to say to me, `I can play for the Celtics, I can play
for the Celtics. I can jump,' '' Russell said of Thomas, who won
the 1960 silver medal for his high jumping. ``I said, `It's a lot
more than that, John. But, all right, I'll tell you what I'll do.
We'll go out there and I'll shoot lefthanded.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pow. There was that laugh again. Thomas had thought Russell was
doing him a favor. But the 6-foot-9-inch Russell was and is . . .
lefthanded. So he crushed Thomas during their matchup. About a week
later, Thomas found out the truth and ``he told me what a chicken
(expletive) thing that was to do,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   He is laughing again. All the people in the Center who hear him
tell the story are laughing, too. Malcolm Winn, Roxbury Community
College's men's basketball coach, loves telling that story when
Russell is not in town. When he saw Russell Wednesday, he repeated
it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born the year you graduated from college (1956),'' Winn
said to Russell, within earshot of Thomas. ``My daddy whispered to
me, over my crib, `Son, Russell is lefthanded.' '' Russell loved
that one. He laughed some more and slapped Winn's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he would slide into the limo, seated next to another
joker, a man who wore No. 6 because Russell wore it. The joker
sitting next to Russell, Julius Erving, heard Karen Russell's cell
phone ring. He decided to answer it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Karen Russell's phone,'' Dr. J said into the phone, an
instrument that looked like a thimble in his huge hand. Although
Karen was sitting in the front seat, Erving told the caller, ``Oh,
Karen? She's been arrested. Do you want me to tell you how to reach
her? We're talking about the same Karen, right? Tall, black girl?''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: Dr. J was sitting next to Bill Russell in a limo,
crank-calling Karen Russell's mother. Once Karen got the phone from
Dr. (J) Patch Adams, she told him, ``My mother says she's going to
knock you upside the head.''
</P>
<P>
   More laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Erving also will be here to toast Russell in May. Wilt
Chamberlain will be here, too. They will not be here solely because
they liked the way Russell artfully swatted away shots and began
fast breaks. They will not honor a man, now 65, just because he
once touched the top of a backboard during a test at the University
of San Francisco. They will talk about him because they are friends
who saw sides of him that, often, he would not let the public see.
</P>
<P>
   You know that he battled with Wilt, who ``was stronger than
anyone you've ever seen, I'll tell you that. Shaq? I think he was
stronger than Shaq, especially in his upper body.'' But Chamberlain
and Russell used to have Thanksgiving dinners together, too. You
know Erving wore No. 6 because of him and met Russell while Erving
was a sophomore at the University of Massachusetts, but, as the
Doctor asked Russell Wednesday, ``Do you remember the time you flew
me out to Los Angeles to do your radio show? You were hanging with
Jim Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell replied, ``Yep. And I was losing money to him playing
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Pow. There was that laugh again. Surprising and complete.
Russell then looked at Erving and said, ``When guys play well and
conduct themselves in a way that makes you proud, that makes it
even better. And Julius always did that _ even when he was fighting
with Larry Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the best laugh yet. Russell grabs Erving by the
shoulders, squeezing and laughing hysterically. He laughs so much
that Karen turns around and laughs, too. I think I saw the driver,
battling the Big Dig and afternoon traffic, crack a smile, too. I
think this is a first: Someone laughing uncontrollably despite
being locked in traffic. Erving and Bird have never talked at
length about their scuffle in the early 1980s. But you get the
feeling that Russell could get both of them to talk and laugh about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Russell rarely showed this side of himself when he played. He is
a private man (his jersey was originally retired 27 years ago in a
private ceremony). He rarely pens an autograph. There are stories
about him steeling himself against racists who threw epithets when
he wanted to purchase a home in Reading. He is asked about Boston,
a city that has a reputation for being unkind to black athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if I remember correctly, Ted Williams had some difficult
times here,'' he said. ``So, maybe it's a town that's tough on
athletes. Roger Clemens is gone. He was a pretty good baseball
player.''
</P>
<P>
   The limo was beginning to turn into a driveway, where Russell
would enter the FleetCenter. Erving gave Russell a big hug _ not
one of those half-hugs that are so popular now _ and returned to
the car. Erving knows: No one won like Russell. Rick Pitino knows,
too. That's why he asked Russell to speak to the Celtics before
Wednesday night's game. He spoke, but he chooses to drop his
basketball wisdom sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't mean anything to those guys,'' he said of the 16
championship banners hanging above the parquet. ``Do you think that
there is a single player on the Celtics that goes into the gym,
looks up (at the banners) and says, `Look at those. We've got to
get ours'? There's a remote possibility that happens. It's not a
knock. It's like walking into a house and seeing wallpaper. To
them, the banners are the ambience of the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell laughed again. Before he left, he commented about
hair. He said people were aghast at his beard when he was 22.
``I'll bet,'' he said, ``you get the same reaction to your hair.''
He pointed to my dreadlocks. He laughed. And I did, too.

MENOPAUSE MADE MORE MEMORABLE  
 LUNG CANCER FIGHT FACES NEW HURDLE  
 BIRTH DEFECT STUDY SHOWS LATER RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE

 Menopause made more memorable
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Menopause may be inevitable, but the memory loss that often
accompanies it may not be.
</P>
<P>
   Taking estrogen stimulates activity in areas of the brain known
to control memory, according to a study published this week. And
researchers are hopeful that the hormone can help reverse the
difficulty many post-menopausal women have remembering names and
performing other simple tasks requiring short-term recall.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long suspected such a link, based on their work
on how children learn to read and on how estrogen affects the
brain. The new study at Yale University confirmed those links by
using magnetic resonance image tests to actually measure the
brain's response on 46 postmenopausal women while they were
performing simple memory tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The results were encouraging: doses of estrogen typically used
in hormone replacement therapies produced responses in areas of the
brain that control memory, suggesting that it's possible to alter
those memory receptors in ways that would restore the women's
impaired recall. But the tests didn't produce actual improvements
in memory, which researchers say may be because they weren't done
for long enough and the memory tasks tested were too simple.
</P>
<P>
   So what should women considering estrogen therapy do while more
tests are being done?
</P>
<P>
   ``Specific decisions are highly personal and have to be made
between a woman and her doctor,'' advised Dr. Sally E. Shaywitz,
professor of pediatrics at Yale and lead author of the study in
this week's Journal of the American Medical Association. ``But this
evidence now enters into the equation and becomes an important
factor. It should encourage doctors who care for these women to ask
about memory loss.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lung cancer fight faces new hurdle
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known for half a century just how resilient
cancer cells were at evading our attempts to annihilate them. Now
there's more disturbing proof.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been trying lung transplants to treat some patients
with bronchioloalveolar carcinomas, a rare but increasing type of
lung cancer where the tumor spreads quickly within the lungs but is
barely detectable outside them. That contained damage led
researchers to believe that new lungs could mean new lives for
patients, of whom there are more than 5,000 a year in America, and
it has meant a considerably longer life for many.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, there's evidence that the cancer resurfaces in the
transplanted lungs. That happened in four of seven transplant
patients studied at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and
reported on in the current New England Journal of Medicine.
Researchers believe that cancer cells from the original tumorous
lungs may have spread beyond the lung, remained dormant, then
reinfected the new lungs but not any other organ.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that these cancer cells have some sort of address
on them that sends them back to the lungs,'' explained Dr. Robert
I. Garver Jr., lead author of the study and associate professor of
medicine at the University of Alabama. While he was disappointed
that the tumors recurred, Garver added that ``we've shown that lung
transplants can add a lot of high-quality life time to these
patients who would have died within several months using any
conventional therapy.''

<P>
   The damage done by birth defects can persist for a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound obvious, but until now doctors have focused most
of their attention on risks just after birth and during infancy.
Now Norwegian researchers have studied 24 different kinds of birth
defects, ranging from a cleft lip to heart deformities, in the
8,192 females born with birth defects there between 1967 and 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent survived to 15 years of age, compared to 98
percent of a control group without defects. But subjects with
defects were a third less likely to give birth by the age of 30,
and their children had a substantially greater chance of having the
same defect as their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The lower birth rate among women with birth defects is caused by
social factors as well as biological ones, according to researchers
at the University of Bergen in Norway, who published their findings
in the current New England Journal.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PLYMOUTH, Mass. _ If the English architect C.F.A. Voysey thought
a client's wishes might compromise his design, he would walk away
from the project. As a result, word spread that he was
``difficult,'' and Voysey houses are few and far between. They do
exist, in tantalizing form, in drawingsand plans; and one of these
days, David E. Berman of Plymouth, who's one of the chief Voysey
votaries, will build himself a Voysey.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Berman is in the satisfying business of tending
the flame of one of the more intriguing figures in the English Arts
&AMP; Crafts movement. He does this in several ways. He helps the lucky
few who actually own a Voysey to restore their houses and furnish
them. He also has a hand in the reproduction of Voysey's designs
for wallpaper, textiles, and furniture. And if Voysey didn't think
to design lighting fixtures or TV armoires, Berman adapts Voysey to
the task at hand. Berman even has Voysey coming out of the oven. An
accomplished baker who's a notorious punster, Berman calls the B &AMP;
B he runs Sconehenge, and for tea he serves up shortbreads in the
shape of Voysey's signature heart.
</P>
<P>
   Who was Charles Francis Annersley Voysey (1857-1941), and why is
he a cult figure? Active toward the end of the Arts &AMP; Crafts
movement, he was a younger contemporary of William Morris. By
training and vocation an architect, Voysey was also gifted at
designing ``flat patterns,'' used for such surfaces as wallpapers,
textiles, and carpeting. When he needed money, he sold his textile
patterns, many to Liberty of London, which was then the leading
emporium for Arts &AMP; Crafts decor (and still does a roaring trade in
Liberty prints).
</P>
<P>
   As for Voysey houses, the nearest most of us have come to one is
via the Hercule Poirot episode on ``Mystery'' in which a Voysey is
used for a swell boat club on Windemere in England's Lake District.
Once seen in picture books, however, Voyseys seem the archetypal
homey house. They are long and low slung, a horizontality also used
by Frank Lloyd Wright in his ``Prairie House'' period. Lucky owners
must feel embraced and safe, yet elevated by the sureness of
Voysey's design.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Morris was the intellectual capital and emotional motor of
Arts &AMP; Crafts, then Voysey is a ramble in the countryside with
Peter Pan. Morris and his immediate circle had fought the good
fight against mass-produced decor and won. Their best work was
lofty but livable, Victorians pitching their comfortable tents in
the Gothic Middle Ages and producing things of serene beauty. This
would get dumbed down, till ``artsy craftsy'' said it all and
Morris became the hand-me-down stuff the Bright Young Things put
out with the trash. In fact, Voysey himself was declared dead
before he actually died: A retrospective of his work in 1931 was
ill-attended. The last public acclaim was the eulogy delivered on
the BBC by actor Robert Donat (who had married Voysey's niece,
Emily).
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the 1980s, the English Arts &AMP; Crafts style came back
into vogue, and with it the rediscovery of the American Aesthetic
movement. Revivals being draconic and scholarly, the artsy-craftsy
was soon shunted to flea markets. Morris got another 15 years of
fame. And when it got too crowded on the Morris bus, people like
David Berman _ and Judith Tankard of Newton is another _ moved on
to Voysey. Tankard, now a garden historian, wrote her master's
thesis on Voysey's flat patterns.
</P>
<P>
   To understand Voysey, Berman and others say it helps to know
about a defining event in his childhood. His clergyman father was
removed from the Church of England ``for preaching a God that was
too benevolent for those times,'' as Berman puts it. This was a
message much liked by the upwardly mobile middle class, and the
Rev. Voysey found people to set him up as a theist minister. But
the elder Voysey's ouster from the Establishment, necessitating the
family's relocation, traumatized his son. As an adult, Voysey would
retreat to the surer worlds of childhood and the nursery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good part of childhood never left him,'' Berman says.
Voysey would marry but live apart from wife and children. For much
of his life, home was two rooms at various London addresses. His
last office was hit by a Nazi bomb and disappeared in the London
Blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the rather fierce glare of the birds that figure in
so many Voysey designs, you might think all his life had gone
ticketyboo. But that glare is lifelike. And so is the food chain
that Voysey depicts in a design Berman will develop as a
needlepoint kit. Called ``Let Us Prey,'' it shows a cat stalking a
bird eying a worm, which will eat the sheltering flower.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One snowy morning, Berman opened Sconehenge's front door and a
visitor stepped into the green and pleasant world that is his
showcase for Voysey designs. Not every room is papered in Voysey.
Not every Voysey rug is on the floor: An all-over floral, rendered
by Berman in needlepoint, makes a stunning coverlet for one of the
B &AMP; B beds. The side porch boasts two of Voysey's invalid chairs.
These have high wooden sides ending in tester tops, and not just
the infirm will want to curl up on their generously cushioned
seats. But that wooden hand (from the statue of a saint) camping
out on the pump-organ keyboard surely isn't Voysey.
</P>
<P>
   As craftsmen, Berman and Voysey are somewhat alike in their
dress. Berman wears an artisan's tunic and turtleneck; Voysey hated
anything that harbored dust, so his jackets had no lapels, his
trousers no cuffs. He loved color: His starched collars were the
bright blue of old butcher's striped aprons. But there are
differences: Berman moves easily in cyberspace. Voysey was
buffaloed by the movies. He'd gone to see one of Donat's films and
left after 20 agonizing minutes. ``That dreadful noise!'' he said
of the soundtrack. ``And why did they keep on slipping in a huge
picture, a huge portrait of you?'' Donat explained this was a
close-up. ``But why?'' Voysey persisted. ``It isn't necessary, damn
it all; we're not as stupid as all that. We can see who it is and
what he's doing, without having it stretched far and wide across a
great big space.''
</P>
<P>
   At nearly 6 feet, Berman is taller than Voysey, who stood at a
little over 5 feet. Height says much about Voysey. He did not
believe in tall ceilings. Apart from the two-story halls of some
houses, ceilings were dropped to 8 feet, even to 7 1/2 when Voysey
could persuade clients. But Voysey's sense of proportion was such,
says Berman, that his houses have the feel of amplitude. Wide doors
gave the rooms a welcoming feel. Architects who admired Voysey
ranged from Sir Edwin Lutyens, that master builder of English
country houses, to Robert Venturi, the postmodernist.
</P>
<P>
   Voysey houses look bigger than they are. Berman remembers one he
could see clear across a valley. The living space was contained in
a shoebox, a two-story rectangle, and Berman sees Voysey's
inspiration in the long, low houses of 17th-century England.
``Which he slightly upgraded.'' Covering the shoebox was a high
pitched roof; some were so high and steep that Voyseys seem more
roof than house. Not exactly quaint but unsettling: houses for
gnomes, you might say. The exterior walls were a white, countrified
rough-cast stucco. The windows, grouped horizontally, were framed
in stone. A fine red line marked the water coursing. The house sat
on a dark terrace, actually a tarred plinth that kept the damp out.
The big, mouth-like front doors were set into the house so you
could stand out of the rain. Right inside the front door, Voysey
put a loo so the traveler could freshen up. This was the era of
dusty roads and tire punctures. But when the green slate roof swept
down almost to the green lawn, there was drama of line and mass as
well as interplay of color.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, and yet. Voysey's houses were somehow toy-like, writes
the architectural critic David Gebhard. They ``seem to be
dollhouses which have been taken from the children's nursery,
magically enlarged, and then placed in the pastoral countryside.''
This storybook aspect of Voysey extends to his flat patterns, and
it has caused some people to confuse subject matter with scale.
Voysey really did mean his designs to bulk large. His first drafts
were most often his final drafts, and his ease in composition
Berman likens to ``the way we think of the young Mozart and the
music just coming off the ends of his fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   So in restoring Voysey, Berman must also restore his scale. He
works from documentary prints, many in London's Victoria &AMP; Albert
Museum, and he treasures the friendship and help of the last living
link to the Voysey architectural practice, John Brandon-Jones of
Hampstead, who worked for Voysey's son. ``He's enormously kind in
loaning me things and does copy work for me, and when I leave his
house to go back to America, he always says, `Don't be too long
coming back.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Voysey is now a cottage industry. Wallpaper reproductions are
handled by Carol Mead of Pomfret, Conn. One is the 1890s pattern
called Isis. Computer wizardry returned it to the original scale.
If silk-screened in flat solid colors, this pattern would seem
harsh and daunting; to reproduce the gentler textures of Voysey's
watercolor draft will require as many as 13 screens. As a companion
to Isis, Berman offers a paper border of little shamrocks to make a
4-inch frieze close to the ceiling. Isis is a riot of birds and
poppies and thistles and Tudor roses. ``When you add the
shamrocks,'' says Berman, ``you've got the whole British Isles.''
</P>
<P>
   Voysey carpeting, with its sometimes dizzying patterns, is
available through John Burroughs, Historical Design Merchant, of
Rockland. Burroughs's business manager, Dan Cooper, is Berman's
partner in Trustworth Historical Design. Through his Trustworth
Studio, Berman produces lighting, furniture, and accessories
``after Voysey,'' which he makes himself.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where did Voysey get his ideas? He may look more modern than
Morris; he was a more practical man than Morris. Not for Voysey the
labor-intensive cabinetry of Arts &AMP; Crafts furniture. Even if
Morris had lived into the Automobile Age, you wouldn't expect him
to design a gas station. Voysey's, alas, with its fanciful
iconography, awaits its oil tycoon. Still, Voysey would not have
approved of our copying machines. It was all right to study other
people's work for ideas, but ``sketching was stealing.'' He could
not help knowing Art Nouveau. How else to explain certain Voysey
patterns so dense they rival Art Nouveau at its most headachy?
(Interestingly, he did not use patterned papers in the houses he
designed but preferred a plain silk-threaded paper in green or
purple. With this, turkey-red curtains.) But, in fact, Voysey
thought Art Nouveau too sinuous and sensuous. ``It offended the
puritan in him,'' Berman says.
</P>
<P>
   What looks like Art Nouveau may be just Voysey's wish to stay
lost in the forest. The Voysey style, says Berman, is very natural,
very English. ``He thought of himself as a Victorian, not a
pioneer.''

THE DEATH BUSINESS IS BOOMER-ING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; once speculated here, apropos of something or other, that
when my time draws nigh I'm sure Martha Stewart will be standing by
with a lavishly illustrated book of elaborate do-it-yourself
funeral arrangements. I was joking. Well, half-joking. As we've
seen, Martha is capable of anything, emphasis on ``capable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately I've been looking at death as a marketing opportunity,
and I'm here to report that a Martha funeral tome is a modest
notion compared with some new developments on the funeral front.
</P>
<P>
   Death be not dull. The baby boomers have discovered death and,
as usual, they want to do it their way. A cartoon I saw the other
day captured the situation. Man in bed, clearly in extremis. Woman
hovering over him, saying, ``If it's any comfort, Vanity Fair says
that death is `in.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Death is always ``in,'' alas. So is the impulse to memorialize
self and loved ones; it's as ancient as man. But there are new
twists, among them the Art Casket. A story in the Stamford Advocate
reports that its creators, a company called WhiteLight, will
``personalize'' a coffin to convey ``a life statement on behalf of
the deceased.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has several designs, among them ``Fairway to
Heaven'' for golfers, a casket adorned with an image of a par-3
hole on a verdant course. Other themes are nature, religion, AIDS
awareness, and the Alamo. The president of the company says he sees
a future for caskets with sports logos, the NBA, the NFL, Major
League Baseball, and colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reports that high-tech innovations
promise ``to transform cemeteries from places bound by granite into
playgrounds for the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital memorials are available that allow visitors to call up
an image of the departed and listen to a recorded message from
beyond the grave. In the works are holograms that will project 3-D
images of the deceased and tombstone computers that can be
programmed to simulate the departed's personality, allowing vistors
to have a virtual-reality conversation with the dead. Special
effects are everything these days.
</P>
<P>
   What would Jessica Mitford have made of all this? In the early
1960s Mitford, who died in 1996, wrote ``The American Way of
Death,'' a brilliant and savagely funny expose of the excesses of
the American funeral industry. An updated edition of her book was
published recently because much of what she criticized hasn't
changed. Indeed, things have gotten worse, with big corporate
funeral homes gobbling up family operations, and pushing up prices.
</P>
<P>
   Death is the final major consumer opportunity, and we do love to
consume. Many people are pre-planning their own funerals. In his
wonderful collection of essays, ``The Undertaking: Life Studies
From the Dismal Trade,'' undertaker/poet Thomas Lynch writes that
the dead don't care about their own funeral arrangements. But they
care while they're alive, hence the growth in ``pre-need''
planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a plot?'' a friend asks.
</P>
<P>
   Plot? When I hear the word ``plot,'' I think of a novel or a
movie. I tell her I've never been good at plotting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A burial plot,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She's shopping for one, even though, given her age, life
expectancy and a little luck, she won't need a plot for another 30
years or so. When she finds the plot of her dreams, she may want to
engage the services of a cemetery beautification and maintainence
service to keep it looking nice. Not long ago I received an
invitation to a seminar sponsored by one of these services. The
subject was, ``Death is Not the End of the Road.'' Not for this
company, apparently, which will tend your plot in perpetuity, for a
price.

CUPID FLIES INTO CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend Beth is an incredible woman.
</P>
<P>
   Here, I'll let her tell you in her own words.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to meet at a party, I'm the vivacious, tall,
elegant woman very engaged in conversation, listening intently. You
find out that I am a consultant to financial services companies all
over the country. You watch my wild silver-blond hair because it is
so unruly, longer than most, and the texture of silk. You are
seeing the public self.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to stumble on my Cape Cod summer garden in the
woods, you would notice a well-muscled woman in cutoff shorts,
T-shirt, wild hair captured in a ponytail under a baseball cap,
dirt smearing my arms, hands, and cheeks, as I dig in the black,
crumbly earth. You think I am attending my garden. I am really
attending my soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to see me in the gym, you would find a determined
athlete. If you were to enter my mind, you would find a discerning,
critical thinker. If you were to ask what I want in a man I would
say: Make him emotionally available, entrepreneurially flexible, a
loving father with a good relationship with his kids, someone who
finds it important to give back to society in thanks for what he
has achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound fantastic? That's because she is.
</P>
<P>
   Beth has been happily single for 11 years. Yet every once in a
while she has the urge to ``go back out there,'' as she puts it;
but where can a 55-year-old woman find male companionship these
days? She's far too professional to flirt during business hours.
Yet, in her very busy life, she doesn't meet many available men.
Given that the last place she'd seek a soulmate is at a bar, where
in the world can she go?
</P>
<P>
   How about to an Internet dating service?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the initial investment is low. The service Beth
chose, www.match.com, has a free seven-day trial period before
charges of $12.95 a month kick in. For another, an on-line dating
service also provides all the space you need to present yourself in
depth. You can write to dozens of applicants on line before you
ever have to face one in person. In addition, the answers you give
to questions about ethnicity, religion, age, body type and height,
smoking, drinking, and children are organized in browse fields so
that someone looking for a particular combination can quickly
locate participants who match his or her requirements.
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, if people are honest.
</P>
<P>
   When Beth listed her true age, she received only one reply. When
she deducted 10 years, however, she drew 15 responses in 24 hours,
all from men between 50 and 65. To her credit, the first thing she
did when she responded was confess how old she was. To her
surprise, only a few correspondents withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Beth, who goes by the handle of Paradise Hill, has corresponded
with several men in the past month, ultimately meeting two of them
in very public places. One drank too much for her taste. The other
came across as condescending. Another, however _ a divorced,
successfully self-employed business writer who lives in Connecticut
and works for a range of corporate clients _ seemed a perfect
match. His first response ran to three single-spaced pages and
included the following: ``I certainly have room for a woman in my
life, with an emphasis on the sensual and an emphasis on the
heartfelt. One thing I've come to terms with in the past few years
is the power of openness and honesty in a relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder Beth looked forward to reading her e-mail with
renewed enthusiasm; but before they could meet, this man informed
Beth he'd decided to pursue a relationship with a woman closer to
home.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection barely hurt. ``It isn't as if there isn't an
ever-renewing audience for my profile,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Beth understands the risks of meeting people on line. In the
anonymity of cyberspace, the married easily get divorced and
criminals can claim to be college professors. She's also aware,
however, that this is a chance to meet men she'd never encounter
any other way. Taking a small risk seems vastly superior to giving
up hope of ever finding a life partner.
</P>
<P>
   As the millennium approaches, there are more and more culturally
accepted ways of finding a mate. Let's hope that enchantment via
e-mail turns out to be at least as reliable as love at first sight.

   FROM THE INTERVIEW:

   ``I love the genre,'' Jackson says over lunch at the Four
Seasons Hotel in New York. ``I wanted to be in a `Star Wars' movie.
So the next time I was asked (which director he wished to work
with), I said, `I would love to work with George Lucas.'
</P>
<P>
   `` ... (On the set) some guy would come over to me and he'd open
a case,'' says Jackson, who recalls seeing the original ``Star
Wars'' movie on its opening day in 1977. ``Inside were, like, nine
lightsabers, and he'd say, `Choose yours.' I'd be there
hyperventilating. I'd say, `Oh, I'll take that one.' It was very
cool.''

   Fernando DeRosa, a 22-year-old college student from Suffern,
N.Y., dresses up as the character Boba Fett and attends sci-fi
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dressing up as Fett, going to conventions, talking to people
about the character and how I made the costume, and posing for
photos with kids really helped me come out of my shell,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The costume, fashioned from assorted pieces of fabric, plastic
and metal, as well as parts purchased online, took two years to
assemble and cost nearly $2,000.

 By MICHAEL MADDEN GOBE STAFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ The slick can do so much with words. Not talking
politics, either, but golf, because the slick have taken the word
``rough'' and smoothed its meaning. So much so here at Augusta
National Golf Club, that the rough _ though smooth _ is still
called ``rough'' by the smooth-talkers. And tradition is said to
tremble.
</P>
<P>
   The word has been out for months: Augusta National was changing.
Bobby Jones, wherever he is, was said to be quivering at the mere
thought. Clifford Roberts, too. And introducing ``rough'' to this
Taj Majal, this Vatican, this Mecca, this absolute shrine of golf,
was the most radical of changes.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the White House were painted pink, the ceiling of
the Sistine Chapel festooned with McDonald's ads, the Mona Lisa
redone in velvet, Fenway Park sold out to a giant Coke bottle
hanging over The Wall, the change was that traumatic.
</P>
<P>
   Except the ``rough'' is not rough. The new, insidious,
invidious, and despicable ``rough'' at Augusta National is all of 1
3/8 inches high, compared with the 4 inches of rough usually found
at PGA Tour events and the rough of 5 inches at the US Open, where
rough is really rough. The slick cannot smooth out that truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how this is going to affect the play very much,''
said the straight-talking Greg Norman. ``The guys still have have
plenty of fairway to aim at out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Fred Couple put it, ``It's not like real rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more, the grounds at Augusta National are so pristine that
even those 1 3/8 inches of rough are in such perfect condition that
balls ending up in it will present lies as good as or better than
average golfers find on 99 percent of the fairways they play on.
The fairways have been made a bit narrower with the addition of the
rough, but not dramatically so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been thinking about the second cut (second cut is the
Masters' euphemistic term for rough) for a good little while,'' new
Masters tournament chairman Hootie Johnson said Wednesday. ``As you
know, we've had a little fuzz there around the edges. But (the move
to rough) has been made primarily to put a greater premium on
accuracy off the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   As England's Lee Westwood put it, ``I think the rough is fair,''
which means it is really a non-factor.

   ``There may be a flyer or two coming out of that rough,'' said
Norman, ``but that's about it. If the rough was thick, where you
really had to muscle it out, then it'd be a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the rough may actually help golfers on these wide-open
fairways, because one of the few dangers off the tee was to push
drives on holes such as the second, fifth, 10th, and 11th where
trees line the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Shots too far right often would roll through the fairways and
into the trees. Now, the second cut could help stop balls from
reaching the trees. ``If you fly your ball into the rough it's not
going to go as far,'' said Couples.
</P>
<P>
   An example of that came during defending champion Mark O'Meara's
practice round Tuesday when he pushed his tee shot on the 10th. The
rough stopped his ball, giving him a clear shot to the green. ``I
think,'' said Jack Nicklaus, ``the rough will keep more balls out
of the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is no rough around the greens.
</P>
<P>
   As Nicklaus so aptly put it, ``I don't think the rough is much
of an issue.'' All golfers know rough. The new grass at Augusta
National, whether it be known as rough or second cut is not really
rough. Except to the smooth.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   When Union Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman undertook his famous
(``infamous'' down here) March to the Sea from Atlanta to Savannah,
and then north into South and North Carolina, Sherman chose to
bypass Augusta. That reference to 135 years ago is apt because,
inside the gates of Augusta National, it seems that so much has
remained untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Augusta National this year chose to make four changes,
changes that are much more significant than the addition of the
pseudo-rough. The changes have been praised by some, criticized by
others, and shuddered at by a few. Traditionalists, those few.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are these: The tee on the second hole (par 5, 575
yards) has been moved back into the pine trees by some 25 yards;
the green on the 11th hole (par 4, 455 yards) has been raised and
altered, and a bunker has been added to the rear of the hole; 20
pine trees have been planted on the right side of the 15th hole
(par 5, 500 yards) and several large mounds on the right side have
been removed; those same trees also affect the tee shot on the 17th
hole (par 4, 425 yards) and the tee on 17th also has been moved
back some 30 yards or so.
</P>
<P>
   None of these changes are pseudo or subtle. All dramatically
change the look of the holes and, even more significantly, change
the shotmaking on all of them. While Augusta National has made many
changes to the course over the years (upwards of 75, according to
Johnson, many subtle, a few major) never have so many significant
changes been made in one and the same year.
</P>
<P>
   In one breath, Johnson said what had to be said. ``This is the
Masters tournament and it is a national treasure. It's something
precious and something to be preserved.'' Yet, in the next breath,
the chairman detailed the opposite: ``Yes, yes they are'' the most
significant changes ever made to the course. ``And not just in
recent memory,'' continued Johnson, ``but ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The premise for the changes is Tiger Woods. When Woods shot his
18-under par score of 270 two years ago, breaking all Masters
records, Jack Stephens, the former tournament chairman, and now
Johnson decided to make changes. ``The final decision about whether
to do it, I guess, would be either Mr. Stephens or myself,'' said
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were made, Johnson went on, not necessarily to
``Tiger-proof'' or ``Duval-proof'' the course, ``but that what we
hope to do is to keep up with the world and the game of golf today.
And the guys are hitting it longer and they're in better condition
and the equipment is better. We're attempting to strengthen the
golf course and stay in tune with the times.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, upon examination of Masters scores over the years, the
premise for the changes might be open to question. The winning
Masters scores have been very similar except for a
dramatically-improved score once every 15 years or so, followed by
a long period of similar scores; a bolt of lightning, it seems,
once a generation.

So the next time I was asked (which director he wished to work
with), I said, `I would love to work with George Lucas.'
</P>
<P>
   `` ... (On the set) some guy would come over to me and he'd open
a case,'' says Jackson, who recalls seeing the original ``Star
Wars'' movie on its opening day in 1977. ``Inside were, like, nine
lightsabers, and he'd say, `Choose yours.' I'd be there
hyperventilating. I'd say, `Oh, I'll take that one.' It was very
cool.''

   FROM THE INTERVIEW:
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the genre,'' Jackson says over lunch at the Four
Seasons Hotel in New York. ``I wanted to be in a `Star Wars' movie.
So the next time I was asked (which director he wished to work
with), I said, `I would love to work with George Lucas.'
</P>
<P>
   `` ... (On the set) some guy would come over to me and he'd open
a case,'' says Jackson, who recalls seeing the original ``Star
Wars'' movie on its opening day in 1977. ``Inside were, like, nine
lightsabers, and he'd say, `Choose yours.' I'd be there
hyperventilating. I'd say, `Oh, I'll take that one.' It was very
cool.''

<P>
   Fernando DeRosa, a 22-year-old college student from Suffern,
N.Y., dresses up as the character Boba Fett and attends sci-fi
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dressing up as Fett, going to conventions, talking to people
about the character and how I made the costume, and posing for
photos with kids really helped me come out of my shell,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The costume, fashioned from assorted pieces of fabric, plastic
and metal, as well as parts purchased online, took two years to
assemble and cost nearly $2,000.

 AUGUSTA, Ga.: ... once a generation.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first five years, winners scored in the 280s until Ralph
Guldahl shocked all with his 279 score in 1939. Guldahl's record
stood until Ben Hogan shattered it by 5 strokes with his 274 in
1953. Then, for the next 12 years, no Masters' winner came close to
Hogan's mark until Jack Nicklaus smashed it with his 271 in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Raymond Floyd, who tied Nicklaus's mark in 1976, no
golfer came within range of the record for the next 22 years, Ben
Crenshaw coming closest with 274 in 1995. Finally, 33 years after
Nicklaus set his mark, Woods broke it in 1998 _ by all of one
stroke. O'Meara, last year's winner, reverted back to a very
typical winning score of 279.
</P>
<P>
   False premise or no, though, the changes have been made in an
attempt to send Masters scores back up.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, no matter what's been done, I think the guy who
hits it long and straight still has the advantage around here,''
said Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, all in all, now it's a visually different golf
course. (The changes on) 17 I'm not a fan of. It just makes it more
difficult to hit the fairway, especially when the (new) trees get
up (and grow) in 10 or 15 years time. Secondly, the design (of the
green) is not for a 7-iron or a 6-iron or a 5-iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``The green on 17 is so small, it's got a lot of movement to it,
it's very crowned, and it's just not a 6-iron-shot green. Most of
the time, the prevailing wind is hitting you there when it's warm
and from the south, and the green's going to dry out and be firmer,
and there's going to be places where you're just not going to be
able to hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Translation: The changes on 17 are challenging, especially
because of the lengthier shot to the green, and most likely will
change a routine par-4 hole into a thinking-golfer's riddle,
especially on Sunday afternoon with a major championship on the
line.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The 15th hole is a little bit different, because the tee's
been moved a little bit to the right,'' said Norman. ``There'll be
a little different angle off the tee but, all in all, all you're
going to do on 15 is hit it hard and hit it straight and you're
going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   (Translation: The planting of 20 trees along the right removes a
huge advantage for medium-range hitters who could bounce tee shots
off the high mounds and get an extra 50 yards or so of ricochet
toward the green. Longer hitters such as Woods usually flew their
shots over the mounds. As Norman sees it, though, the 15th hole now
seems fairer because all drives must be straight and true.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've got to understand about the second hole,'' Norman
said of moving the tee back on that hole, ``is that it still favors
long hitters. The long hitters are still going to get it down there
near the front bunker (near the green). I mean, that's where we're
all trying to hit our (second) shots anyway. We're all still going
to end up in the same place. And the real long hitters _ the Dalys,
the Woods, maybe the Ernie Elses _ will still be down there 340
(off the tee), but they'll be off the downslope. Instead of hitting
a 7-iron, they'll probably be hitting a 5-iron.''
</P>
<P>
   (Translation: Woods, Daly, and a few others still will be able
to drive over the fairway bunker, now some 300 yards away. Many
others will hit only a 3-wood off the tee, hoping to lay up short
of the bunker. The end result is the shorter hitters might be more
severely penalized than the longer hitters.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The 11th green is a great improvement. I think that, by far,
is the best improvement. It's really improved the playability of
the hole. It looks better on your second shot. I'd give that one a
100 percent markup.''
</P>
<P>
   (Translation: If this change had been made 13 years ago, Norman
might have a Masters championship and would not have writhed in his
sleep for a decade or more. Larry Mize was able to chip in from
wide right of the 11th green (the second playoff hole) and seize
the title from Norman. Such a chip shot would be impossible now
that the green is raised instead of sunken and a bunker now lies
between the green and where Mize made his famous chip. Norman,
quite naturally, loves these changes.)
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, Norman is dismayed by the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to see this, because I like to step on the tee
and say, `Well, Gene Sarazen did this or Byron Neson did this' and
feel the same piece of nostalgia and history under your feet as
what those guys played on. When you change the course, you change
all that. I hate to see golf courses changed because of low
scores.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Woods, the object of many of the changes, said they ``are good.
All the changes, I think, are beneficial to all the long hitters.
There's no doubt about it. They've made the par 5's longer, which
means that 2 and 15 are going to be more difficult to hit in two,
which helps out the long hitters.'' O'Meara was distressed by the
lengthening of the 17th hole, particularly because Ike's Tree _ the
infamous tree along the left edge of the fairway that President
Eisenhower wanted hacked down because so many of his drives found
it _ now will be even more on his mind when he stands on the tee.
``(The tree) bothered me before, and unless the conditions are
right, I probably can't hit it over the Eisenhower Tree (now 195
yards from the tee). I'll probably have to work around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples said the changes may add a stroke or so to each player's
round, and Nicklaus agreed. The irony, though, is what O'Omeara and
others said. The changes make the course longer ``and when you make
the course longer, it kind of favors (Woods).''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, and almost always, the Masters champion is decided
by the greens of Augusta National, those infernal, undulating,
hidden-break greens that never can be appreciated on television. It
is the best putter the week of the Masters who usually wins the
Green Jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Strange that it is the men closest to the traditions of the
Masters who have forgotten that it is the strongest-willed and not
the strongest-armed who most often win at Augusta National. All
their tampering just may be for nought.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My in-laws are having their 65th wedding anniversary, and I
can't find any information about gift traditions to mark the
occasion. What's associated with anniversaries beyond the 60th?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.B., Hurst, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Most lists don't go beyond the diamond anniversary, which
marks 60 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Some lists also call anniversaries of 65, 70 and 75 years
diamond anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   The World Almanac gives wedding anniversaries these names:
</P>
<P>
   One through 15: paper, cotton, leather, linen, wood, iron, wool,
bronze, pottery, tin, steel, silk, lace, ivory and crystal.
</P>
<P>
   After that, anniversaries are named every fifth year: china
(20), silver (25), pearl (30), coral (35), ruby (40), sapphire
(45), gold (50) and emerald (55).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt go to
school? I attended school with a Richard and Robert Gephardt in
Erie, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   _ E.K., Azle, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Richard Gephardt attended school in St. Louis and has a
brother named Don, said Laura Nichols of Gephardt's communications
office.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of House Democrats was born in the same St. Louis
district he represents. His official biography describes him as a
``fiercely loyal'' St. Louis Cardinals fan.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt graduated from Northwestern University, where he became
student body president, and the University of Michigan Law School.
</P>
<P>
   You can write to him at the Office of the Minority Leader, Room
H204, The Capitol, Washington, D.C. 20515.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My dad swears by cough drops called Fisherman's Friend. I've
always wondered: Where does the name come from?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.J., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Fisherman's Friend lozenges, developed in a fishing village
in 1865, were marketed as ``on-the-spot relief'' for fishermen,
said Mike Bartz of Mentholatum, the product's U.S. distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Descendants of the pharmacist who created the product still
manufacture it in Fleetwood, England.
</P>
<P>
   Fisherman's Friend is available at Wal-Mart, Walgreens and
Albertsons. For more information, write to Mentholatum at 707

IS CLINTON SMARTER THAN YOU THINK?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once more into the brier patch.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton keeps saying that he doesn't want to go there,
but some of the pundits, committed Clinton-bashers, potential
congressional and presidential candidates, retired military
kibitzers and American public opinion are coalescing into a force
to throw him in it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton keeps saying like a stuck compact disc that he and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies have no plans to insert
ground troops into the Kosovo unpleasantness. And he is now drawing
volleys of criticism from across the political spectrum for his
lack of an endgame strategy, his military inexperience and his
foreign policy ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   Unidentified sources are now being referenced as having told the
president that airstrikes alone would not be sufficient to convince
Yugoslav strongman Slobodan Milosevic to abandon his genocidal
course in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, some assert that Clinton should never have
committed this nation to a course of military action that he knew
in advance would not get the job done. By continuing to demur on
the deployment of ground troops, Clinton reinforces their view of
him as a draft dodger who is incapable of providing the nation with
the kind of leadership it needs in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it passing strange what a couple of weeks, televised
images of thousands of destitute, dispossessed Kosovars and a trio
of kidnapped American soldiers can do?
</P>
<P>
   It seems like only the day before yesterday that many of those
same wise ones who are now lambasting the president for not having
the guts and the vision to do what it takes to prevail in the
Kosovo conflict were singing a different tune. They were speaking
of the difficulties of fighting a ground war in the Balkans and
citing the Germans' World War II experience there as a classic case
in point.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the notion of sending ground troops into the
Kosovo fray was unthinkable for most of those wise heads and the
overwhelming majority of the American people. If the president had
intimated that the air campaign against Milosevic's forces might
lead to the use of U.S. ground forces, he never would have been
able to get the air campaign off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion would have been overwhelmingly opposed to the
airstrikes if the American people had become convinced that they
could lead to down-to-earth bloodletting. And, as Clinton's critics
are quick to point out, the president pays attention to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were those who contended that Clinton was being
devious, that he did understand from the outset where the course
that NATO was setting might lead. They may have assessed the
situation then better than they realized.
</P>
<P>
   But that assessment doesn't fit into the current strategy of
Clinton's staunchest opponents, especially those posturing for
political races next year. Their strategy is to portray Clinton as
leadership-challenged, as one who would blunder into a military
conflict with no plan for either winning it or cutting U.S. losses
and pulling out.
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question: What constitutes effective national
leadership today?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been criticized as someone who allows public opinion
polls to dictate his policy. And some see that as a failure of
leadership. But is it really? Is it not possible that a really
clever leader can manipulate things so that the polls point in the
direction he wants to go?
</P>
<P>
   One stratagem for making that happen is the old ``please don't
throw me in the brier patch'' ploy, a tactic employed by Br'er
Rabbit in the well-known fable to get Br'er Bear and Br'er Fox to
chunk him to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Picture this: While Clinton insists vehemently that NATO has no
intention of sending in ground troops, a Washington Post poll shows
that 55 percent of Americans now favor using ground forces against
the Serbs. A poll conducted by New York pollster John Zogby shows a
60 percent level of support.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some potential candidates for the Republican
presidential nomination are now speaking of the need to send in
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   What's a president to do in the face of all that body of
political and military wisdom and that groundswell of public
opinion?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, therefore, can't lose now politically. Milosevic
already is showing signs of willingness to yield because of the
intensity of the air war and the damage being done to his already
economically depressed country. If he does, Clinton comes out ahead
politically as a result of having resisted the calls for ground
troops.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic perseveres in his folly ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, Clinton has no choice. The American people have spoken.
They are now telling him what kind of endgame they want played.
</P>
<P>
   Is that slick or what?

GET ORGANIZED WITH A PIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Journalists tend to be disorganized, and I'm the worst of a bad
lot. I'd never remember an appointment if it weren't for a Personal
Information Manager program that slaps me out of a gearhead daze.
My PIM of the moment is Microsoft's Outlook. It suffers from the
usual Microsoft failings -- it eats up too much memory and runs too
slowly. But it combines a calendar, address book and e-mail which
work almost seamlessly together.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of Outlook is the chief reason I still haven't
been able to switch entirely to Linux, my favorite alternative
operating system. Try though I might, I haven't found any
Linux-based alternatives that measure up.
</P>
<P>
   However, one can rely on a Web browser and a growing number of
Internet PIMs -- Web sites that provide registered users with free
calendars and address books.
</P>
<P>
   There's a PIM site boom these days. Firms like Anyday.com and
PlanetAll are clamoring for new users. Another entrant, When.com,
was purchased by America Online Inc. last week, and is already the
Web-based calendar for AOL's Netcenter Web portal. Other top
portals like Lycos and Yahoo are also wooing visitors with online
calendars. The services are all free; the goal is to keep you
coming back to the site, where they can fling ads at your eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   As with most other free Internet services, all these sites will
eventually offer identical features, so that it won't matter which
one you use. But right now, it makes quite a difference. Some, like
Cambridge-based Anyday.com, are still in test mode and aren't ready
for serious use. And there are sizable differences among the
well-established on-line PIMs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, When.com makes a good lightweight calendar for
casual Web users. After you get a free password, you can record
appointments months or years ahead. There's also a handy little
feature called Event Tracker that keeps watch on a variety of
upcoming events you might want to track. Say you're a fan of the TV
series Law and Order. Event Tracker will remind you to tune in, and
provide a summary of that night's episode. It also tracks concerts,
the latest movies, corporate earnings reports -- quite a lot of
useful stuff.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, When.com doesn't include an address book. Worse
yet, it doesn't offer one of the most important features for an
on-line PIM -- synchronization.
</P>
<P>
   After all, many users of on-line PIMs already have similar
software on their computers. Copying your calendar to the Web lets
you get access to it from any Internet-linked computer on earth.
But you need a way to dump data from your PC or Palm Pilot into the
Web-based PIM.
</P>
<P>
   That's where synchronization comes in. Some of these sites let
you download a program that will copy data from your computer and
send it over the 'Net to your on-line calendar or address book.
</P>
<P>
   PlanetAll has been offering this for some time. Their software
can synch up with Palm Pilots, or with PCs running Microsoft
Outlook. And when your Outlook address book changes, the software
reminds you to send those changes along to PlanetAll as well. Too
bad the PlanetAll software only covers the address book. It won't
let you automatically transmit appointment data to the service's
on-line calendar.
</P>
<P>
   That's a major blunder, one which Yahoo has avoided. Their
synchronization software lets you transfer both address book and
calendar data. The first transfer can take a long time if you've
got lots of data. But from then on, the software only transmits
updated files, so the job only lasts a minute or so.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I've got my PIM data stashed on a Web site, it doesn't
matter whether I'm running Windows or Linux or any other obscure
operating system. All I need is an Internet connection and a Web
browser. It also helps to be the trusting sort -- after all, you're
putting a lot of personal information onto somebody else's
computer. Firms like Yahoo and PlanetAll pledge to respect the
privacy of the data you store in their PIMs, and soft-headed fool
that I am, I believe them.
</P>
<P>
   These on-line services aren't a completely adequate substitute
for PIM software on your own machine, especially if you've got a
slow modem connection to the Internet. Then again, considering how
slow Microsoft Outlook runs, it's nearly a draw.

THE PRICE IS NOT RIGHT: OIL PRODUCERS SAY INDUSTRY NOT YET OUT OF

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The bluebonnets are in bloom, baseball
season is back, and energy prices have moved up about 40 percent
since midwinter.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas oil producers, who saw daily posted prices drop below
$8 per barrel during a grim winter, are still seeing the glass as
half-empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be seeing some light at the end of the tunnel,'' said
John Pinkerton, chief executive of Range Resources of Fort Worth.
``But we're still in the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   What bothers Texas drillers are daily reports in their
newspapers and on television that tell of $17-per-barrel futures
prices, a level tantalizingly close to the $18 price that oil
producers say they need to justify bigger exploration and drilling
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, Texas oil producers aren't getting the $17 that
traders are paying on the New York Mercantile Exchange for futures
contracts. They are getting the ``posted,'' or wellhead cash price,
which is around $14. The posted price is cash that refiners and
transporters pay producers for oil right out of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   That's better than the $8-$9 per barrel they were getting in
December and January, but doesn't justify a flurry of orders for
drilling rigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to shut down the doors of the industry at $14,
but clearly there isn't enough spread to justify expansion,'' said
Pinkerton, whose company is among many that reduced their work
forces this year because of declining prices and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Energy price analysts say they believe that the posted prices
will rise gradually this year, to about $16 per barrel by summer
and maybe to as high as $20 per barrel by later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Goldstein, analyst with the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation in New York, noted that while the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries has had difficulties in enforcing
production quotas, it has reduced the flow of oil. That in turn has
pushed prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC took 2 million barrels (out of 27 million barrels of
production daily) out of production, and now is working on another
2 million barrels,'' Goldstein said. ``They wanted to cut more, but
the point is that they have reduced output and the market will feel
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with a decline in U.S. production and flat demand,
particularly in Europe and in Asia, and the scenario is set for oil
to return to near $20 by the year's end, Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for producers, Goldstein said, OPEC members have
spare drilling capacity, and as prices rise, they will inevitably
drill more to earn cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't see $24 per barrel oil. In fact, by the end of this
year, prices may be declining again, although they won't go down to
$12 like before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Any breather for producers would be welcome. Bill Stevens of the
West Central Oil &AMP; Gas Association in Abilene said that the recent
run-up in prices has ``generated some activity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a little cash to do some workover and maintenance
on wells,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said ``the rule of thumb is that we need crude prices _
posted, that is _ at $15 before people will feel comfortable
putting money into drilling and exploration.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the energy industry in Texas continues to contract.
The Texas Workforce Commission reports that in February, the last
month for which figures have been compiled, 150,100 Texans worked
directly for the oil and gas industry. That was down from a high of
162,400 in December 1997, just as oil prices were tipping from
their average of $20-$22 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' rig count has been cut almost in half from a high of
1,000 in September, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The job losses are felt in cities and in the fields. Halliburton
Energy Services said last month that it will close its Fort Worth
plant that made wireline equipment. That will cost the city about
400 jobs, although some of the workers will be offered positions in
Houston and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Halliburton announcement was the latest cutback, after the
news that Union Pacific Resources Group would reduce its downtown
Fort Worth work force by at least 140.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the job loss figures are understated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the people who used to work in the oilfields as
contractors have found other work, in construction or cattle
tending or the like,'' he said. ``Because they don't file for
unemployment compensation, they aren't counted as jobless. But they
are lost to the industry and we worry that we won't get them
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said that among producers, the survivors of the late
1980s energy bust emerged as better capitalized, leaner and better
operators. For that reason, most are likely to ride out the current
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't seeing a lot of bankrutpcies and liquidations now,
and that's kind of surprising,'' Stevens said. ``Most are able to
hunker down and wait for better times.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton, who has built a New York Stock Exchange company
during the past 10 years, said that the recent price slump has been
``incredibly debilitating'' to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   He said the much-heralded jump in stock prices, which followed
the most recent OPEC announcement in late March, won't put any more
money in producers' cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen some improvement in our stocks, although most are
still trading at or near the 52-week low,'' Pinkerton said. ``But
you aren't seeing new issues of stock or IPOs, so you can't count
this little blip as any increase in companies' liquidity.''

KODAK DIGITAL CAMERAS GOOD, BUT EXPENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children love digital cameras. You snap their picture and the
kids are immediately displayed on a screen on the camera's
backside.
</P>
<P>
   The big advantage of a digital camera is that the instant you
snap the picture, you can take the image into your computer. Once
there, you can put the image on a Web page, e-mail it to a friend,
or electronically retouch it. The second big advantage of a digital
camera is storage: you can cram more than 10,000 pictures into a
one gigabyte hard drive _ no more bursting binders!
</P>
<P>
   But despite the allure of the digital, last year's e-cameras
were, for the most part, quite limited. Basically point-and-shoot
devices, these cameras had limited memory. That meant you
frequently had to empty the images; they had limited resolution;
and they couldn't adequately reproduce detail in bright spots or in
shadows. The cameras themselves had few features. Another problem
was in the optics: most of last year's cameras were fixed-focus,
which further reduced image quality.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras released this year are likely to be significantly
better, both as advances in computers move into these hand-held
devices, and as camera makers begin to catch their stride .
Increasingly, these cameras must stand on their own as photographic
devices, rather than electronic playthings.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning Kodak has been a pioneer in the field of
digital photography. Recently, the company released two new digital
cameras. Both are among the best available. Alas, they are also
quite expensive .
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's DC240 ($700) is a sophisticated digital camera with a
built-in zoom, built-in flash, and 8MB of compact flash memory.
It's lightweight and relatively high resolution. Standard
resolution is 640 by 480 pixels, the same as a VGA computer screen.
High-resolution is 1280 by 960, which looks pretty good printed as
a 4 inch by 5 inch photograph. Besides changing the resolution, you
can also adjust the compression setting, allowing you to get
between 30 and 160 images in a 8MB flash cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's more-expensive DC265 ($1000) camera is loaded with more
features, but of course that's what you are paying for. The DC265
has higher resolution (768 by 512 pixels standard, 1536 by 1024
pixels max) and three compression settings. The DC265 also has a
microphone that lets you record a little audio note for each photo,
and a little speaker to play it back. The camera uses this speaker
to make sound effects when you take a photo or click the buttons on
the back panel. And one feature that's super cool on the DC265 is
that it has a gravity sensor: when you turn the camera sideways, it
senses the turn automatically rotates the image back when the
picture is displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The DC265 will allow you to take burst photos (several pictures
in a row) or time-lapse (taking a photo once a minute to once a
day). Burst mode is handy if the person you are photographing
consistently blinks : perhaps the first frame won't be any good,
but the second or third frame probably will. Time-lapse is useful
for surveillance, scientific experiments, and nature photography.
</P>
<P>
   Both cameras have a little LCD screen on the back that lets you
view the pictures that you have taken as well as set the camera's
controls. Both cameras have a built-in flash, which you can
disable, and both allow you to set the color balance of your scene.
That is, you can tell the camera whether the lighting is by
sunlight, fluorescent, or tungsten bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras also come with programs that allow you to control
nearly all of the camera's settings from your computer _ a process
that's much easier than fiddling with the camera's built-in menu
system. The DC240's software is more sophisticated than the
software for the DC265; besides setting controls, it actually lets
you snap a picture.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to get the images out of one of these cameras is
to take the compact flash picture card out of the camera and plug
it into your PC using Kodak's optional connection kit. The kit
comes with a PCMCIA adapter card that lets you plug the compact
flash into a laptop computer, as well as another adapter that lets
you read the card through your computer's parallel port. Once it's
attached to your computer, the compact flash looks like a big
floppy disk or a small ZIP cartridge, filled with images.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to get the images into your computer is to use the
USB (Universal Serial Bus) interface. Once attached, the camera
looks like an external hard drive. One good piece of software
engineering that Kodak has done is to create an extension for the
Microsoft Windows explorer, so that you can directly view
thumbnails without having to start up another application.
Unfortunately, despite the supposed speed of USB, viewing the
photos this way is quite slow. I suspect that the fault lies not
with USB, but with the microprocessor inside the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, these are nice cameras, but $700 or more is a lot for a
point-and-shoot and I would like to see a bit more camera for the
money.
</P>
<P>
   My first problem with these machines isn't the electronics, but
the optics. Both of these cameras have the problem that when you
hit the shutter button, they don't take the photographs
immediately. Instead, they focus, making a lot of noise in the
process. They take the photograph about a second after you press
the shutter release, and by then it's sometimes too late. Alas,
this is a problem shared by many point-and-shoots and the only way
around it is to get a 35mm SLR (Single Lens Reflex) camera.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is the lens cap: it doesn't stay on the lens.
This is especially troublesome because there is no way to replace
the glass cover over the lens and there's no way to augment it with
a transparent (and relatively low-cost) haze filter. This means
that after a year or so of heavy use, the glass lens cover is
likely to be quite scratched and need factory replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Battery drain is another problem. One of the big advantages of
digital cameras is that you don't need to keep buying film.
Unfortunately, these cameras both suck batteries dry _ you'll be
lucky if you get 50 shots from a set of 4 AA cells. Be sure to use
rechargeable batteries, if you can.
</P>
<P>
   Although these are nice cameras, the price makes them
prohibitive for most consumers. However, the features in these $700
cameras today will likely appear in $200 and $300 cameras later
this year or early next. If you do decide to buy a digital camera,
be sure that you get one that has at least 640 by 480 resolution
and 8MB of RAM. Otherwise, you'll just be shortchanging yourself.

WOODS CONFIDENT HE IS STILL THE TIGER TO BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ David Duval and Tiger Woods. Tiger Woods or David
Duval. The golfers themselves are not much more daring _ or
insightful _ than sportswriters when predicting the winner of the
Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger Woods can do anything,'' is how Fred Couples put it.
``David Duval can do anything. It's just that they're totally
different. They play differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval ``hits it the same every single time,'' said Couples.
``Tiger plays with a boat load of emotion; and when he's going
strong, he's pumping his fists, he's hitting it even farther.''
</P>
<P>
   No question, said Jack Nicklaus, Woods and Duval ``have been way
above everybody else in the last few months, in the last year or
so. And I think it would be great if one of them won this week and
one of them won the US because that would fuel the rivalry,'' the
same type that Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer had 35 years ago, the
rivalry that so energized golf, the rivalry that golf itself has
been searching for.
</P>
<P>
   But look closely. Tiger Woods leaves the 18th green after
finishing his practice round and, altering his routine, does not
head to the practice tee. Instead, he heads to the putting green
where he taps and taps and taps one ball after another. And does
not bend over that often.
</P>
<P>
   That ``boat load of emotion'' that Fred Couples mentioned seems
far away from Woods, so in control here. If he taps his putter and
then bends over to pull his ball from the cup after only one tap,
doing it time and again, maybe the fists will pump and the emotion
will sky. And the electricity, too. Just like two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good motivation, the fact that David's playing
extremely well,'' Woods says in one sentence. And then follows with
another sentence, dampening any hint of a rivalry. ``You can't get
caught up in all that and have that as your only motivating factor.
You have to try and get better and I have been.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Just as there is little doubt that Woods is becoming more and
more inscrutable in the public eye. ``Just now, unfortunately, I
haven't been able to get as many wins as David,'' Woods says, too
matter-of-factly. ``I haven't been able to make shots at the right
time, and guys are outplaying me down the stretch. It's just part
of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, too matter-of-factly. Understandable, of course,
since Woods was called upon to carry golf on his shoulders after
his record-breaking win here two years ago, and he needed a shell
around his soul with so much, too much, attention. Still. ``Guys
are outplaying me down the stretch . . .'' Words that would never
be heard from the lips of Palmer or Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   It's a relief, Woods says, that it is Duval and not he who is
getting all the attention. ``I can tell you one thing,'' Wood says.
``It's a lot easier to come to tournaments and not have to do a
mandatory press conference every day. Now, David's doing that, and
he can have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, for others, it might be a relief not to see so many
Tiger Woods commercials every day, either. ``Yeah,'' Woods says,
``the hype kind of got up a little bit. It's a little different
now. Now, David's got to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   So Woods is pleasant, pleasantly testy. When asked how he feels
that it is Duval, and not Woods, who is being inspected so closely
these days days, Woods's rejoinder is, ``Trust me, I still am.''

GORTER PUTS REVOLUTION MIDFIELD ON GOOD FOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Revolution are regrouping for their MLS home
opener against D.C. United Saturday. Edwin Gorter will return from
suspension and Giovanni Savarese is on the verge of recovering from
a deeply bruised ankle and shin.
</P>
<P>
   Gorter played the entire 75 minutes of Wednesday's scrimmage
against the Boston Bulldogs at Babson College in Wellesley and is
expected to make his first regular-season appearance for the
Revolution since Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The teams played to a 0-0 tie, but at least the Revolution
survived intact _ last week, Savarese was injured in a scrimmage
against the New Hampshire Phantoms.
</P>
<P>
   Gorter directed the attack from midfield, along with Jair, and
helped control the tempo against the Bulldogs, who provided a
strong test.
</P>
<P>
   Last season was unfulfilling for Gorter, who was recruited to
the Revolution by Thomas Rongen as the answer to D.C. United's
Marco Etcheverry and Miami's Carlos Valderrama. Gorter displayed an
excellent touch, but the Revolution's lack of cohesiveness limited
Gorter's effectiveness in midfield, and midway through the season
he was moved into central defense in a desperate attempt to settle
the team. The Revolution continued to lose, and dissension became
apparent, climaxing in a postseason brawl involving Gorter and
David Nakhid, for which Gorter was fined $25,000 and suspended for
the first two games of this season.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Walter Zenga had replaced Rongen, who was on the way to
D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas is one of my best friends,'' Gorter said. ``We are
professional soccer players, but after the game I will have dinner
with him. But the only thing that counts Saturday is the three
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, D.C. is the best team in the league. We always play
well against D.C. But they are so strong, a very smart team with a
lot of quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have held the lead for 134 of 180 official
minutes in taking a shootout loss to Miami and a win at Kansas
City, indicating a sharp turnaround in the team's fortunes. But the
advantages have been earned by a composed and experienced defense,
keyed by Zenga's goalkeeping, and opportunistic strikes by Joe-Max
Moore and Savarese. They have failed to display inspirational
midfield combinations, so the understanding shown by Gorter and
Jair was encouraging Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gorter had the Revolution's best scoring chance, from the edge
of the goal area midway through the first half, but failed to round
goalkeeper Anthony Latronica. Jair and Paulo Dos Santos also barely
missed with shots, Dos Santos sending an impressive 25-yard drive
just high. And the Bulldogs' Unisa Conteh hit the post in the 12th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United will provide a stiff test for Gorter's defensive
abilities and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided all together to play this way, where our forwards
are the first defenders and the No. 10 is the second defender,''
Gorter said. ``We are more defensive than offensive now. But when
you are building a house, you start with the basement. Later, you
add the roof. It is going to take a couple of months, but we are
getting better with every game and the season is long. We have
three points, and almost had six points, in two games. And points
are what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 20,000 is expected for the opener. ``We are starting
a week earlier than last year,'' general manager Brian O'Donovan
said. ``And people want to see what kind of team we have.'' About
6,000 season tickets have been purchased, about 300 fewer than last
year . . . Giuseppe Galderisi, who played for the Revolution and
Tampa Bay in 1996 and '97, attended practice in an advisory
capacity. ``I am here to see if I can help the team,'' Galderisi
said. ``I want to be a coach, and this could be a chance to get
some experience, and to help this team and the league.'' Galderisi,
who won Italian Serie A titles with Juventus and Verona, is
scheduled to enroll in coaching license courses at Coverciano, the
Italian Federation training center, in June but could postpone his
participation.

   POW-MUSEUM _ Before the $5.8 million National Prisoner of War

most visitors to Andersonville were Civil War buffs who came to
gawk at the 12,920 marble tombstones of Union soldiers who perished
at the Confederate prison whose name has become synonymous with
cruelty. But since last April 9, it's become a hallowed mecca for
tens of thousands of veterans, most wrinkled, limping on canes or
pushed in wheelchairs by aging sons and daughters through the dark
corridors of the grim museum, full of relics that point out the
horrors of life as a POW. Attendance skyrocketed more than 20
percent in just the first six months, and Park Superintendant Fred
Boyles expects 12-month figures to show a 40 percent jump over the
previous fiscal year. And an unexpected consequence has been the
donation of a flood of 1,561 relics by ex-POWs who salvaged eating
utensils, hand-made weapons, diaries and even German and Japanese
flags that flew over their camps when they were liberated.

   NEWORLEANS-WARM _ NEWORLEANS _ As if it weren't bad enough that
New Orleans is the fattest city, the most heart-disease-ridden
city, now it's the city most at risk for global warming, according

DUVAL A WINNER, BUT HE'D RATHER BE SNOWBOARDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ David Duval says he is sometimes at his most
relaxed when he is snowboarding down the mountainside in Sun
Valley, Idaho, or fishing near his home outside Jacksonville, Fla.
He is quiet, introspective and hides behind a pair of Oakley
sunglasses on the golf course. He is now also the game's best
player, in the middle of an astonishing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Should he win this 63d Masters and don the green jacket that got
away from him a year ago, he will have five victories in nine
starts this year and 12 wins in his last 34 starts. After earning a
reputation as a perennial bridesmaid, he burst to the front with
three straight victories to end the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   The only players in the past 49 years to enter the Masters with
four Tour victories were Arnold Palmer (1960) and Johnny Miller
(1974), and a Masters victory would give Duval three straight
following his triumphs at The Players Championship the BellSouth
Classic. Duval, who is 27, has earnings of $2,598,33, a PGA season
record with The Tour barely into April.
</P>
<P>
   Duval said winning The Players Championship near his home in
Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., was even more special in that his father,
Bob, was enjoying his first Senior Tour victory on the west coast
of the state the same day. Winning the BellSouth in Atlanta was
special to him because he played his college golf at Georgia Tech
and led the tournament after three rounds when he was 20. The
Masters? The taste of victory would be even sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to have it wrapped up a year ago, leading by three
with three holes to go. Then his bogey on the par-3 16th opened the
door for Mark O'Meara, who registered birdies on three of the final
four holes, rolling in a 20-foot putt on the 18th to win.
</P>
<P>
   Duval seems to maintain a calm, relaxed demeanor in contrast to
the fiery presence of Tiger Woods. After his victory at The Players
Championship, Duval became the world's No. 1, displacing Woods.
``To be successful out here you have to find the demeanor and
personality under which you perform your best,'' says Duval.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me that's not worrying about stuff. Other players might
get fired up by getting upset. That doesn't do me right. It doesn't
serve me well at all, so I don't worry about it. I can't do
something over. I can't rehit a shot. I can only move forward. So
that's what I try to do. Certainly stuff bothers me away from the
golf course. I try not to let outside influences dictate whether
I'm happy or not. I guess that's what it boils down to.''
</P>
<P>
   They are arguably the world's two best players, and there is a
mutual respect. When Woods burst on the scene after capturing his
third US Amateur title in September 1976 and tore up the field and
the course to win the Masters, it forced the other players to try
to elevate their games. Duval was one of them, turning to weight
training and talking with sports psychologist Bob Rotella.
</P>
<P>
   Duval doesn't see himself in the same category as Woods, or a
Michael Jordan, or a Jeff Gordon. ``I've always thought I've had a
pretty good responsibility anyway,'' said Duval. ``I might be in
the process of becoming a golf star or whatever you want to call
it, but I'm not like Tiger in the sense that Tiger's a star. I
don't think because I've surpassed him as No. 1 I've been given any
more responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The tables are reversed, and Woods seemed poised to respond.
They're also friends. ``I don't know if I can say he's good for me
from that standpoint,'' says Woods. ``I think he's good from the
standpoint that he's playing so well and that's what we all want to
do. So as players we want to get to where he's at right now. I knew
it was a matter of time the points would add up and David was going
to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been frustrating from the standpoint I was playing well
but not getting the victories. If you look at my finishes, I was
always in the top five. I just wasn't able to get a victory before
San Diego. Even then, I had to play great golf on the weekend for a
victory. It just hasn't been one of those stretches where guys are
making mistakes or I'm making shots at the right time to make guys
make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The ascent to No. 1 has placed new demands on Duval, requiring
more time away from the course and taking him away from live-in
girlfriend Julie McArthur whom he met at Georgia Tech. Now he's the
favorite, a responsibility he realizes he has properly inherited as
he seeks his first major championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me,'' said Duval. ``I embrace it. I believe
it's my responsibility now; it's part of playing tournament golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to choose, would I seek it out? No. I think everybody
knows I wouldn't seek out attention. I firmly believe it's my duty
to be here and do the best I can. I've always thought I have a
pretty big responsibility anyway. I won't have to rely on
adrenaline here. If you can't get worked up and ready to play here,
you need to go and do something else.''

ALREADY HE'S A FALLEN ANGEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Eighty million dollars . . . and he was hurt
before he took his first swing in his new uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty million dollars . . . and he was in a hospital before the
end of his first game with his new team.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty million dollars . . . and he was on crutches in the
locker room after the first game.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn toiled for 10 seasons in the Boston Red Sox
organization. He knows all about curses. He knows the feeling of
helplessness when it seems larger forces are calling the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Now he plays for the Anaheim Angels, another franchise that
seems to have angered the diamond gods.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning of his first game with Anaheim Tuesday
night, Vaughn fell into the Cleveland Indians dugout while chasing
a pop fly. He hung around for five innings and went 0 for 2, but
left for the hospital at the start of the sixth (x-rays were
negative) and was out of the lineup for Wednesday night's game with
a sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No curses,'' said Vaughn. ``I've been through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Players who have worked for the Red Sox, Cubs, and
Indians have a working knowledge of Why Bad Things Happen To Good
Teams. But it would appear that there's also a black cloud over the
Angel halo.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels never have been in a World Series. Their closest
brush came in 1986, when they led the Red Sox, 3-1, in the American
League Championship Series and held a 5-2 lead in the ninth inning
of Game 5. But Gene Mauch maneuvered himself out of the playoffs
and reliever Donnie Moore surrendered a crushing home run to Dave
Henderson. Moore killed himself three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was not the first Angel to die tragically. Outfielder
Lyman Bostock was shot to death in Gary, Ind., in 1978, one year
after signing a big free agent contract with California.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Sox and Cubs, the Angels are known for late-season
folds. They lost a one-game playoff to the Mariners in 1995 and
last year collapsed in the final week and handed the American
League West to the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries decimated the Angels in September 1998, and it hasn't
gotten any better this year. Anaheim opened the 1999 season with
eight players on the disabled list. Then Vaughn was on crutches
after the 6-5 victory over the Indians in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   The foul pop that did in Vaughn was hit by Cleveland shortstop
Omar Vizquel. Clearly unfamiliar with his new home field, Vaughn
bolted for the first-base boxes and quickly ran out of room. He was
lucky that he came down on the dugout floor, rather than on one of
the steps. Not one Cleveland player made any effort to catch him or
break his fall (Vaughn did not make the catch).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not our players' job,'' said Cleveland general manager
John Hart.
</P>
<P>
   True. But it would have been the sporting thing to do. Vaughn
easily could have broken one or both ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the lack of help he got from the Tribe, Mo said,
``People talk about, `The guys do this or that.' My job, first of
all, is to take care of myself, and I didn't. So I don't blame
anybody in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he have grabbed a Cleveland fielder if the situation were
reversed?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let anybody fall,'' he said. ``But I don't
blame anybody in their dugout. I've got a lot of friends on that
team and know that team pretty well. It was just one of those
things that happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a high sky, so I wasn't really able to look back and
look where I was. My main thing is nothing was broken, so
everything's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn stayed in the game and received a standing ovation when
he came to the plate in the bottom of the first. When he hit a
routine fly to left, he collapsed in the batter's box, further
aggravating the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my back leg and my drive leg,'' he said. ``You know
you're not 100 percent, but I'm going to play until something's
broken. As long as I can. That's just the way I am. I tried to go
out there as long as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   He was late getting on the field in the top of the second
because he was having his ankles taped. He flied weakly to left in
the third and lasted two more innings before going to the hospital
for X-rays. Team doctor Lewis Yokum said Vaughn had a high sprain
of the left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered me, but I was going to go as long as I could go
and do what I could,'' said Mo. ``I knew I was hurt, but I'm one of
those dumb guys who tries to keep playing at all times. I had them
both taped to try to get some balance, but it just started getting
really tight. I didn't want to be a defensive liability in a close
game like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was back in the clubhouse, icing the ankle, when the
Angels rallied for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very exciting,'' he said after putting down his
crutches. ``We've got a ball club that plays together and plays
hard, and the guys came in and picked me up. These guys all did the
job, so that was one to work off right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to heal pretty fast, so I'm not looking to be out too
long. You ain't gotta be 100 percent to play this game. I've had
sprained ankles before. I'll get some treatment and we'll see what
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen. We've got 160 more games to play. I'm pretty
durable, but that's the way things go sometimes. I guarantee you it
won't be too long. Believe that.''

GROANING CHIMNEY CAN BE EXPLAINED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a problem that no one seems to be able to solve, so
I'll see what the Handyman has to say. My 100-year-old farmhouse in
Hampton, N.H., has three chimneys with bluestone caps and hardware
cloth (steel mesh) over all three to keep out critters. But every
day, groans come from somewhere in one of the chimneys. They are
low, long, and weird, starting in late morning and going to 10 or
11 p.m. There are no trees nearby, and the hardware cloth keeps out
animals. So what is happening?
</P>
<P>
   NANCY BENSON, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Those groans sound like my refrigerator, which sometimes
makes similar noises, maybe when the fan goes on. I have gotten
used to them, but when they started, it was, indeed, weird.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've excluded the possibility of a poltergeist (they are
reputed to make a terrible racket!), you're left with wind and
downdrafts as the probable cause. What I think is happening is that
there is always a downdraft in one or more chimneys: a wafting of
air downward, caused by lower air pressure in the house than
outdoors. Wind, however small, may be forcing more air down the
chimney, but the downdraft continues even without wind.
</P>
<P>
   Being 100 years old, the chimneys are unlikely to have liners in
them, or maybe a piece of liner has broken off, or a brick has
become dislodged, wedging in the flue (the chimney opening) at an
angle, forming a whistle. When the downdraft hits this whistle, it
sounds. It's like blowing across a Coke bottle to get a toot, or
across the mouth of a jug to get the groan. Or, the downdraft is
vibrating a piece of liner tile or brick shard. But I don't know
why it occurs only between the hours you mention.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, the wind may be blowing across the soil pipe (the
sewer gas vent on the roof), making a jug-like groan. Cover that
pipe (temporarily) to see if the sound stops. If it does, you can
put an inverted U-shape extension on the soil pipe, which should
stop the noise by changing the position of the pipe opening. Don't
keep the pipe covered; it will affect the plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing: A breeze may be sounding when it blows through
that hardware cloth, which is 1/2-inch or 1/4-inch steel mesh. We
have all heard an ordinary insect screen whistling in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   To find out if all this is so, try this: Cover that hardware
cloth with a piece of polyethylene, sealing all joints with duct
tape (Don't do this with a fire or a heater going). Try this on one
chimney at a time, then all three.
</P>
<P>
   If the groans stop, it's the hardware cloth. If they don't, then
seal the bottoms of the chimneys, too, in the basement and in any
fireplaces. Just cover the firebox openings with plastic, sealing
them with duct tape. What you are trying to do here is stop the
downdrafts. If the groans stop when the downdrafts are stopped, you
know what you have to do. And, have a chimney sweep check the
chimneys for any blockages or partial blockages, and remove them.
</P>
<P>
   A final cause may not be the chimneys at all. This has happened
before. Sometimes a tree in a wind will bump up against the
telephone or electric wires coming into the house. The tree
branches are caressing the wires, like Heifetz on a violin, and the
whole house is the violin, the sounding board. The same thing could
happen with tree branches caressing the side of the house. I know
you said there are no trees nearby, but it is still worth a careful
check around the house, for anything that might be rubbing against
anything. Sometimes a loose wire will fly in the breeze. Check for
it. Check to see where the various wires to your house end up in
the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   If you do find anything, the Handyman would appreciate a call or
a letter, so he can add it to his vast files.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas might be a little harebrained, but the phenomenon
has happened before, with amazing cures, and all of them are in the
Handyman's files.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My roommate insists on keeping the bathroom window open about
12 inches, as well as the door. She says that since we have central
air conditioning, opening the window is necessary for fresh air to
get in. I believe that with the advanced state of this technology
there is built into the system a provision to bring and circulate
fresh air. We are either cooling the outdoors or heating the
indoors _ very expensive, and hard on an air conditioner. What say
you?
</P>
<P>
   ANGELA HESS, Lake Wales, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. Whether your system has a fresh-air provision depends on its
age. We called Richard Kessler, an HVAC (heating, ventilation, and
air conditioning) consultant in Westfield, who said that the
fresh-air provision was developed five to seven years ago when air
quality became an issue. So if your system is seven to 10 years
old, chances are there is no fresh-air provision in it. Some
systems have an extra duct to allow fresh air to come in; others
have a damper that can be adjusted to control the amount of
incoming fresh air. A contractor can install such a duct for you in
a few hours, Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it. If your system has the fresh-air
provision, you don't have to open the window. If it doesn't, then
opening the window will help until you can put in the required
duct. But 12 inches? That's a bit much. An inch, even half inch, is
enough.
</P>
<P>

IN INDIANA, HISTORY IS SEEN FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERRILLVILLE, Ind. _ When NATO bombs rain down on Belgrade, they
are felt here in a Byzantine church built on a former corn field,
where a perplexed priest in a black robe gives history lessons to
anyone who will listen.
</P>
<P>
   The Very Rev. Jovan Todorovich leaned forward Wednesday in his
chair and, through a thick accent of his homeland, lamented the
slaughter of 77,000 Serbs in Kosovo at the hands of the Turks in
1389. His hands shaking slightly, Todorovich told the story as
though it happened the night before, and if people only knew it,
they would realize NATO is bombing the wrong side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we an enemy? Why are we a pariah of the Balkans?
Kosovo was ours, Kosovo is ours, and Mr. Clinton better register
this: Kosovo will remain ours, one way or another,'' the Serbian
Orthodox priest said quietly, more a vow than a threat.
</P>
<P>
   It is a particularly American phenomenon that no matter whom the
United States is at odds with, there are hyphenated Americans who
hail from, or trace their lineage to, a place that has been deemed
enemy soil.
</P>
<P>
   Just as consistently, those Americans with immigrant roots have
sought to correct what they consider misunderstandings about their
homeland, while also maintaining their own stars-and-stripes
patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   In northwest Indiana along the southern edge of Lake Michigan
lies a region that by some estimates is home to 100,000
Serbian-Americans. By dint of numbers alone, that makes it the
wellspring of Serbian support on US soil and _ in light of the past
two weeks of bombing _ a slow-boiling cauldron of anger,
frustration and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Merrillville, a town of 32,000 people 90 minutes from Chicago,
is arguably the Serbian-American capitol, home to two of the
region's four Serbian Orthodox churches, as well as a Greek
Orthodox Cathedral and the oldest Macedonian Orthodox church in the
nation. Aside from those grand, domed edifices, there is nothing
especially impressive about Merrillville. It is a flat, featureless
area with car dealerships and endless strip malls.
</P>
<P>
   But to Serbs and other Eastern European immmigrants it has been
a land of opportunity. They poured into this area beginning 100
years ago, drawn by jobs at Big Steel _ United States Steel Corp. _
and Little Steel _ Inland Steel Co. _ in neighboring Gary. And just
as their fathers and grandfathers withstood the searing heat of
steel mill furnances, today's residents have resisted the cultural
melting pot, reveling in their status as Americans of Balkan
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Roknich is a retired machinist and an officer in the Loyal
American Serbian Democratic Club. Zarko Korac is a retired trucker
and president of the Serbian Republican Club. There is little about
public policy these two men agree on, but they are political
soulmates on one subject.
</P>
<P>
   In separate conversations, each proudly recalled Serbia's warm
relationship with the United States during World War II. Each
invoked Serbs' rescue of several hundred allied pilots shot down
during bombing raids. Both suggested the NATO pilots flying the
current raids have betrayed that bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are seen as the Nazis,'' said Korac, 80, an American
for nearly 50 years. ``It's not very far back we were fighting with
Germany to help get American pilots home, and now America does
this? For what? For Albanians? No, that shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Roknich told his own version of the history, also with a sharp
jab at the Albanian Kosovars whose treatment by Serbian forces
under Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic triggered the NATO
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to America, I speak the language of this country.
But those Albanians never want to speak Serbo-Croatian,'' he said.
``Albania was poor, so they came to Kosovo, and they had 8, 9, 10
children to a family. All of a sudden they are a majority on Serb
land, and they push the Serbs out of there and they want their own
country. What if the Mexicans tried to do that in Texas or
California? We'd never allow it, but in Serbia, (NATO) supports
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Local Serbian-Americans are quick to note that warmth toward
their homeland does not extend to Milosevic, who is routinely
denounced as a communist and a barbarian. And yet, his pursuit of
total authority over Kosovo wins him grudging respect.

   ``Whose side are you going to be on, the United States when they
bomb Serbia? We're not for Milosevic, we're for keeping what is
Serbian. If NATO didn't interfere, eventually the Serbs would get
rid of him themselves,'' said Olga Dotlich, president of the
Serbian Sisters of St. Sava, a women's group at Todorovich's
church.
</P>
<P>
   At Bronko's, a tavern in neighboring Crown Point that is a
gathering spot for Serbian-Americans, there is a general sense that
the Serbs are misunderstood and misrepresented by the media. There
have been no reported incidents of Serbian-Americans suffering as a
result, but tavern regulars wonder how long that will last.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are being portrayed like the Palestinians were in
the '60s and '70s, as people who don't want peace,'' said Peter
Flemming, whose father was Serbian. ``The Serbs only don't want
peace if it's a peace where the Albanians get everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At Todorovich's church, the St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church,
the bells have been rung throughout daylight hours every day since
the bombing began, in sadness and solidarity. ``I'm trying to be
forgiving, to have compassion, for the Albanians, for everyone. But
I think of Kosovo and it starts digging inside me,'' the priest
said, his voice trailing off.

SOME WOMEN SEE SUGGESTIVE TECH ADS AS TURN-OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The maker of the Palm Pilot personal electronic
organizer is being criticized for using the female form to market
the device.
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign, labeled ``Simply Palm,'' features a nude woman
demurely caressing a sleek new Palm V, the latest version of the
best-selling hand-held personal electronic organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm ad campaign is the second recent dust-up over Silicon
Valley's use of the female form to sell products. Last year, a
marketing pitch featuring Katrina Garnett, an executive of
Burlingame-based Crossworlds Software Inc., was criticized because
she appeared in numerous magazine ads clad in a low-cut, black
dress, pushing her role as a dynamic component of the software
company. The company continued to run the ads despite the
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Palm has taken center stage, there could be
another storm in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates, a Santa Clara-based network security
company, has erected a billboard in Redwood City that shows a
voluptuous blonde asking: ``While you're watching me, who's
watching your network?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that's what I call offensive,'' said Donna Hoffman, a
professor who teaches electronic commerce at Vanderbilt University
in Nashville, Tenn. ``It really hearkens back to a time when women
were simply adornments in the office.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of other women contacted for comment on the Palm ad
campaign criticized Network Associate's billboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't the intention of the ad,'' said Jennifer Keavney,
director of public relations for Network Associates. ``The woman is
a hacker, she's in a position of power. She's calling the shots.
That was really the intent of the billboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women in the computer industry have publicly castigated
3Com Corp., the Santa Clara manufacturer of the Palm V, saying the
ads are demeaning to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a slap in the face,'' said Aliza Sherman, president
of New York City-based Cybergrrl Inc., which publishes the
Cybergrrl.com Web site, a clearinghouse for contemporary women's
issues and Internet culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so beyond anger,'' Sherman said. ``I'm completely
insulted. It shows that when it comes to technology, women are
simply adornments.''
</P>
<P>
   One women said she did not understand what message the ad tries
to convey.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Lusty, a director at San Jose-based TSI Communications
Inc., a Silicon Valley public relations firm, said she drove by a
Simply Palm billboard every day. ``And I have no idea what's going
on with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get the fetal position of the woman,'' she said, ``and
the image together with the device is confusing. It just doesn't
correlate for me.''
</P>
<P>
   A Silicon Valley pundit, Upside.com's Tish Williams, chided 3Com
for ads that appeal to the sexual fantasies of men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I confess, I laughed,'' she wrote in her daily Web column.
``To be more specific, I did a double take, made sure I wasn't
missing any fine print, and then I laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet reaction to 3Com's campaign was typically quick and
pointed. A Web site called Simply Porn satirized 3Com's campaign by
doctoring the ads and putting the device on the laps of naked
pornography starlets. A 3Com lawyer's warning prompted the site's
author to take it off the Web, though other Web sites had already
copied and posted the parody.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, while criticizing the Network Associates ad, said the
message she got from the Palm campaign was one of ``design and
simplicity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of an art form than anything else,'' she added. ``I
find the ads very elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what 3Com intended, according to the woman who approved
the marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this as a celebration of design,'' said Liz
Brooking, the director of marketing communication at 3Com. ``We
wanted to have simple and arresting images that were aesthetic.''

FLIGHTY CAT RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC DRUDIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gremlin, the 2-year-old cat who leapt into the
nation's imagination when he jumped from the fifth floor of a
burning building in February, scaled smaller heights at a ceremony
marking his release from the animal hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by news crews and photographers, the black-haired cat
perched on owner Wiley Clark's shoulder Wednesday and ... jumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't go jumping anymore,'' Clark said as Gremlin dodged
between the legs of veterinarians and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he's just not used to this many people,'' he said.
``But he has to be careful _ he has already used up at least one of
his lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Gremlin broke his jaw and suffered internal injuries when he
jumped from the Hartland Hotel during a fire Feb. 12. A videotape
of the cat's jump was broadcast on all-news stations, and donations
from around the country soon followed Gremlin to Pets Unlimited,
the San Francisco animal hospital that operated on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lady even wanted to give (us) her credit-card number and
said to charge whatever it cost to help Gremlin,'' said Peter
Pattengill, Pets Unlimited's director of development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so very appreciative and grateful for everything,'' Clark
said. ``I didn't think he'd even make it, and so many people have
helped him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gremlin's medical bills were about $5,000. Donations more than
covered the expenses, and the extra money went to the hospital's
general fund to help other animals, said Robert Marshall-Walker,
president of Pets Unlimited.
</P>
<P>
   Gremlin required surgery and nearly two months of care. He was
fed through a tube in his stomach for nearly a month, and his
dislocated jaw had to be wired and covered with a ``composite
bonding'' to keep it stable, said hospital medical director Tom
Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that when the fire broke out at his home in the
Hartland Hotel, he tried to grab Gremlin _ but the cat hid under
the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the wall of smoke and flames, I knew I had to make
a choice,'' Clark said. He later saw the cat _ ``a black streak in
the air'' _ jump from a ledge, but couldn't find him until the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like he's in real good shape,'' Clark said. ``When I
first saw him (after the jump), I lost it. I didn't think he was
going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gremlin left the hospital with no lingering injuries _ just a
few missing teeth, Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Pets Unlimited, founded in 1947, also runs an animal shelter and
adoption center.

NICKNAME OR NO NICKNAME FOR HOUSTON'S NEW STADIUM? THE FANS WILL
DECIDE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Now that Enron Corp. is paying more than $100 million
for the naming rights to the baseball park under construction
downtown, will people call it Enron Field?
</P>
<P>
   Or will they call it ``The Ron?'' How about ``Union Station?''
Maybe just ``The New Ballpark.'' Or ``The Downtown Ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   How about the ``Pop-Top,'' for the stadium's retractable roof?
</P>
<P>
   In the world of sports facility naming, monikers sometimes
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Field in Atlanta is just that. Coors Field in Denver
doesn't need a nickname. Does Wrigley Field in Chicago need another
name?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they don't.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix is called ``The Bob.'' Jacobs
Field in Cleveland is ``The Jake.'' Qualcom Stadium in San Diego is
``The Murph.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, they get a little confusing.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Rockets play in The Summ ... uh, no ... uh, Compaq
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Brenner, editor of the Chicago-based Team Marketing Report,
predicts that Houston fans will join their counterparts who call
their stadiums by the corporate name. Fans are getting used to such
names, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1990, only four sports facilities, none in baseball, had
corporate names, Brenner said. This year, he said, 68 facilities in
the four major sports _ baseball, basketball, football and hockey _
have corporate names, including half of the 30 Major League
Baseball teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The further we move into the era of naming rights, the more
likely those names are to stick,'' Brenner said. ``The last good
example of significant resistance was when Candlestick Park was
renamed 3COM Park. But now it's an accepted part of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Enron Chairman Ken Lay hopes so.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference outside the ballpark Wednesday, as a
single-engine plane flew above towing a sign reading ``Enron Field:
Home of the Astros,'' Lay and Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr.
unveiled the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Enron will pay more than $100 million over 30 years for the name
to be placed atop the stadium. It will get a 30-year contract worth
about $200 million to manage energy services and certain parts of
the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Astros spokesman Rob Matwick said the team has already changed
the name on its Internet location and is rewriting other
publications to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want everyone to call it Enron Field,'' Matwick said.
</P>
<P>
   But will they?
</P>
<P>
   Houston lawyer Stan Perry, a season ticket holder at the
Astrodome, said he probably will call the field ``Union Station.''
He associates it with the physical location rather than a company's
marketing ploy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of the Sugar Bowl, I don't think of Nokia,''
Perry said, referring to the football game played each year in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Jowett, a University of Houston communications professor,
said the ballpark may attract a nickname at first, but as the media
continue to pound ``Enron Field'' into the public's consciousness,
that name will eventually surface.
</P>
<P>
   But if people do call it by a different name, that would not be
unusual in Houston's baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Astrodome's formal name is the Harris County
Domed Stadium.

</P>
<P>
   Soul music didn't disappear with the popularity of hip-hop, it
just packed up and moved to Jackson, Miss., where the mighty Malaco
label is based. This delightful six-disc box proves the patient is
still robust. Included among these 112 examples of gritty Southern
r&AMP;b magic are obvious '70s gems like King Floyd's ``Groove Me'' and
Jean Knight's ``Mr. Big Stuff'' (both cut with New Orleans horn
arranger Wardell Quezerque), Dorothy Moore's elegant ``Misty
Blue,'' and raw, earthy sides from Little Milton, Bobby ``Blue''
Bland, Johnny Taylor, Denise LaSalle and the great Bobby Rush.
Makes a nice companion to the award-winning first Stax box. 4 stars

   For the 20 percent of the population that still requires what
used to be known as alt-rock comes the painfully lo-fi new effort
from Brit art-school refugees Blur. Don't look for anything
resembling the band's upbeat radio hit, ``Song 2'' (the
``whoo-HOO'' song), though, because this is one dense, often atonal
but eventually rewarding journey. Produced by William Orbit
(Madonna's ``Ray of Light''), the album opens with the hymnlike
``Tender,'' helped along by a church choir. The grating ``Bugman''
is one of the few rockers here, while the lyrics to many of these
moody tracks seem to be about the breakup of Blur singer Damon
Albarn and longtime girlfriend Justine Frischmann of the
missing-in-action Elastica. 2 1/2 stars

   The 87-track collection, which comes complete with decals, key
chain and a pair of fuzzy dice that look good hanging from your
dashboard or on top of your computer, travels from Duane Eddy
(``Forty Miles of Bad Road'') and the Beach Boys (``Little Deuce
Coupe'') through Rod Stewart (``Gasoline Alley''), the Flying
Burrito Bros. (``Wheels'') and Junior Brown (``Highway Patrol'').
Best of all, though, are the many obscurities, such as ``Motorhead
Baby'' from Johnny ``Guitar'' Watson and ``Hot Rod Lincoln'' by
Johnny Bond. 4 stars

TOM RUSSELL/``THE MAN FROM GOD KNOWS WHERE'' (Hightone)
</P>
<P>
   Known primarily for making authentic-sounding western music on
such albums as ``Cowboy Real,'' Russell here takes on the ambitious
task of telling his family history in song. Employing a multivoice
approach _ Russell as well as guest vocalists Iris DeMent, Dolores
Keane, Sondre Bratland and Kari Bremnes all sing for several,
sometimes recurring characters _ he charts his forebears' progress,
from the immigrant pioneers who settled the Iowa prairie (``Patrick
Russell'') to his own high-livin' father, who raised Tom and horses
in Topanga Canyon (``Throwin' Horseshoes at the Moon'').
</P>
<P>
   The album's great musical coup is the way it charts the
development of our traditional music from its European antecedents,
best represented by the haunting mix of Uilleann pipes and
Hardangar fiddles _ the instruments of Russell's Irish and
Norwegian ancestors _ with American folk idioms. Its poetic triumph
is an achingly personal mosaic of (mostly) unfulfilled pilgrims'
yearnings, how it captures the restless national need for both a
sense of belonging and a promising horizon. Far from downbeat,
though, ``God Knows Where'' also incorporates hard-bitten optimism
and even wry satire, as in Keane's lilting, adorably gossipy
lament, ``When Irish Girls Grow Up.'' 4 stars

VARIOUS/``THE DISCO BOX'' (Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   This four-CD retrospective on the golden age of polyester packs
enough bootie-shaking bass lines, propulsive horns and cheerfully
insinuating and/or inane lyrics to keep you and your
medallion-wearing friends wiggling your groove thangs from dusk
till dawn. Especially welcome are such early-'70s disco forerunners
as the Jackson 5's Motown-meets-Munich synth-funk hit, ``Dancing
Machine,'' and ``Get Dancin','' a braggadocious, quasi-rapping
party tune from the unfortunately named Disco-Tex &AMP; his
Sex-O-Lettes. But what's this? A disco boxed set that's completely
missing the Brothers Gibb (that's Bee Gees, to those under 30), and
with only minimal contributions from Donna Summer and none _
repeat, none _ from Rick James, Prince or George
Clinton/Parliament/Funkadelic? Blasphemy! The producers' narrow
focus is especially damning on the weak Disc Four, which misses a
chance to illustrate the bridge between American disco-funk and the
pioneering New Wave and techno-disco of, say, Kraftwerk and the
Human League. Still, this is a useful compendium for a
much-maligned genre. 3 stars

OSCAR PETERSON/``A NIGHT IN MUNICH'' (Telarc)
</P>
<P>
   Those who were lucky enough to have seen pianist Peterson and
his outstanding quartet last summer at the Hollywood Bowl should
pick this disc up, as it contains several of the songs he played
that evening. (A rip-roaring ``Satin Doll,'' one of the night's
many highlights, is among the compositions included here.) If you
weren't there, now's your chance to see what you missed. The
73-year-old Peterson debuts a couple of lovely ballads _ ``Evening
Song'' and ``When Summer Comes'' _ proving that his way with a
melody has not diminished over time. Nor has his keyboard skill,
despite a stroke several years ago that forced him to alter his
style. (For proof, check out the barnstorming opener, ``Backyard
Blues.'') Peterson remains a towering figure in jazz. 3 1/2 stars

MCCOY TYNER/``MCCOY TYNER AND THE LATIN ALL-STARS'' (Telarc)
</P>
<P>
   After going symphonic with the music of Burt Bacharach with his
last album, pianist Tyner goes off on another unexpected path here
with an album of Afro-Cuban music. Tyner has been down this road
before, though (just not that often), and knows his way around a
groove as well as anybody. The album features familiar
compositions, such as Kenny Dorham's ``Blue Bossa'' and Ahmad
Jamal's ``Poinciana,'' delivered with an elegant authority by pros
like trombonist Steve Turre and flutist Dave Valentin. There's
nothing groundbreaking here, just many fine musical moments. 3

HIGH SCHOOL TEAM ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A veteran high school baseball coach has been
dismissed and the team's season abruptly canceled amid allegations
that several teen-age team members sexually assault other students
in a hazing ritual.
</P>
<P>
   The reported incident involved 10 students from Raoul Wallenberg
Traditional Alternative High School who were playing at a
tournament in to San Diego. What began as a poolside hazing was
said to have devolved into sexual assault by four students on six
others. The students were at the tournament from March 30 through
April 2.
</P>
<P>
   Three students were arrested, and a fourth player from the high
school will be arrested, the police said. School district officials
said they recommended the students be expelled if the investigation
of the incident confirmed the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of Wallenberg's baseball season was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Although none of the students allegedly involved, all boys 16 or
17, was identified, sketchy details of the alleged sexual battery
on younger teammates emerged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police sources said ``foreign objects,'' possibly coat hangers
found in the hotel, had been used by the older boys to sexually
assault the other students.
</P>
<P>
   Wallenberg's coach, Bob Babick, who founded the school's
baseball program in 1990, said he had learned of the allegations
only Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beyond disappointed ... I'm totally devastated by this,''
said Babick, 51, a coach in San Francisco schools for 16 years.
``This has always been my labor of love. It's where my heart is.''
</P>
<P>
   School district spokeswoman Sandina Robbins said Babick had been
``released'' pending the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's no season, there's no coach,'' Robbins said. ``It's
unfortunate that the season is ended, and the coach was released.
But we have to send a strong message of zero tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's high school athletics program involves about
4,700 students who participate in 16 sports.

MODERNIST PHOTOGRAPHER CROSSED ARTISTIC BOUNDARIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the early 1920s, while the Lost Generation was
gleefully being seduced by Paris, the mecca of Modernism, Edward
Weston went searching for his artistic future in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of intuitively contrarian choice that would
define Weston's career, as can be seen from the taut, skillfully
arrayed mini-retrospective on view through May 3 at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with culturally staid Los Angeles, which he called ``that
impossible village,'' Weston left his wife and three of his four
sons in Tropico (now Glendale) in 1923, and headed south to the
only country besides the United States that he would ever know
first-hand.
</P>
<P>
   While his Parisian contemporaries were steeping themselves in
the promiscuous experiments of jazz, dadaist art and cafe society,
Weston was photographing geometric ruins, playing with space and
perspective in compacted images of skies and tree trunks, and
shooting children's toys with a reverence befitting a Renaissance
cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Weston also discovered in Mexico the intellectual camaraderie
he'd found lacking in his homeland. (His relationship with Alfred
Stieglitz, the ``prophet'' of modern photography, was famously
strained.)
</P>
<P>
   It's customary to romanticize Weston as a rugged spiritual loner
_ the artist as Trappist monk _ combing the Carmel coastline for
suggestive rock formations, Guggenheim grant in hand.
</P>
<P>
   There's some truth to that. But for large swatches of his life,
including his two extended Mexican sojourns between 1923 and 1926,
Weston was a social creature, incorrigibly curious about new
developments in photography, painting, sculpture, music and
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Highland Park, Ill., in 1886, he began shooting pictures
when photography was struggling to map out a purpose apart from the
other visual arts. He spent his early years constructing static,
sentimental scenes in the soft-focus, self-consciously painterly
style of the Pictorialists.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1920, he'd begun to find an alternative focus in
geometric light patterns and the interplay of architectural spaces.
In his 1920 portrait of Johan Hagemeyer, for instance, the subject
is framed and subdivided by a slanting parallelogram of light,
which strays into a blackened doorway, flattening the human figure
into a kind of cubist still life.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, where he operated a portrait studio, Weston was
greatly inspired by a 1919 show at the Los Angeles Museum of
History, Science and Art (LACMA's predecessor), featuring works by
such modern artists as Arthur Dove, Man Ray and Marsden Hartley. He
also learned from photographers Paul Strand and Charles Sheeler,
whose works incorporated the geometric compositional strategies
pioneered by the paintings of Picasso and George Braque.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until he settled in Mexico with the Italian
actress Tina Modotti, who variously served as his muse, lover,
student and manager, that Weston began paring down his photographs
to the ``high modernist'' abstractions that history will remember
him by.
</P>
<P>
   Ignited by the Revolution of 1910-17, Mexico's creative fires
were still burning brightly in the 1920s. Led by the great
painter-muralists Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros, the poet
Luis Quintanilla and others, the Mexican avant-garde of the 1920s
and '30s was as lively a cluster as London's Bloomsbury Group or
Paris' expatriate American colony.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera and his colleagues had elevated simplicity and folk art
to the level of an aesthetic religion. Their idealized visions of
the Mexican proletariat and the country's indigenous peoples were
concentrated in an art that was nationalistic, expressionistic and
highly iconographic.
</P>
<P>
   Weston began to see possibilities for a photographic art in
which modernism and primitivism could be synthesized in expressive
patterns and monumental icons, in which mundane objects could be
transformed into tantalizing abstractions and individual parts
could stand in for a greater whole.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1924 portrait of Rivera, he boiled down the Mexican
artist's iconic bulk into a moody cross-hatch of light and shadow.
The resulting image looks like an outtake from an Eisenstein epic.
</P>
<P>
   A favorable notice from Siqueiros prompted Weston to spend two
weeks photographing a toilet from multiple angles, with a nod to
Duchamp and the swelling sensuality that Ingres might have lavished
on a woman's naked torso. In all, Weston made more than 750 images
during his Mexican years.
</P>

   While Weston was away, Los Angeles grew up, attracting flocks of
new artists and important collectors. An assured Weston now turned
to ``merging the erotic and the abstract,'' as a catalog essay puts
it.
</P>
<P>
   His photographs were tactile, immediate. He photographed a lowly
cabbage, sliced in half to reveal a Rorschach blot of multiple
forms. His sinuous female nudes, seen from odd angles in sharply
focused light, suggested vegetables or sea shells. His close-ups of
peppers, squashes and rocks looked like Brancusi sculptures. In one
of LACMA's galleries, a white radish, its roots coitally
intertwined, uncannily mimics the next-door photo of human limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Weston trained his lens on Hollywood backlots, Mojave
Desert diners and ruined antebellum mansions in the Deep South,
ripping these familiar images out of stale, journalistic contexts.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical of theory and pretension, Weston never put much stock
in manifestoes. Perhaps that's what makes some of his late works
seem crudely dogmatic. The satirical point of ``Civilian Defense''
(1942), featuring a female model posing nude except for a gas mask,
is embarrassingly blunt.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1940s, when Parkinson's disease had largely confined
him to the studio, Weston was as much a California artist as John
Steinbeck. His influence still can be felt here in the surreal
contrasts of Richard Misrach's desertscapes, or in painter Ed
Ruscha's photo-realistic treatment of light.
</P>
<P>
   Weston found his voice in Mexico, his mature self in and around
that ``impossible village.'' It's nice to have him back home for a
while.

 &HT;    BLACK COLLEGES NEED BETTER TECHNOLOGY, EXPERTS SAY
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Students at historically black colleges and
universities have less access than most other students to the
computer technology that is a key to today's cutting-edge jobs,
experts said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Waving the list of ``America's 100 most-wired colleges'' from
the latest issue of ``Yahoo! Internet Life'' magazine, technology
consultant Larry Blackwell of Atlanta-based WANlink Communications
exclaimed, ``Not one is a historically black college or
university!''
</P>
<P>
   More evidence for the tech gap comes from a study comparing last
year's ``most-wired'' schools and the 118 historically or
predominantly black institutions in the National Association for
Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, which is holding its annual
conference here this week.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed:
</P>
<P>
   _ In the black schools, 12.5 percent of students and 71 percent
of faculty members had personal computers. In the ``most-wired''
schools, more than 75 percent of students and 100 percent of
faculty members had PCs.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 63 percent of the buildings in the black colleges were
wired for modern voice, data and video systems, compared to all the
buildings in the other colleges.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 10 percent of the classes in the black colleges used
e-mail or the Internet, compared to more than half the courses in
the other colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have improved since then at many historically black
colleges and universities,'' said Ramon Harris, technology director
for the Washington-based Executive Leadership Foundation, which
paid for the study and is supported by senior African-Americans at
more than 100 major corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's like the auto industry,'' he said Thursday. ``As you
move ahead, the competition also keeps moving ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to ``close the gap,'' the black educators laced this
week's conference schedule with sessions on technology. The experts
at the sessions repeatedly cited a handful of black institutions _
including Florida A&AMP;M, Howard University, Livingstone College,
Stillman College and Johnson C. Smith University _ as ahead of
their black peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just in Salisbury (N.C.) visiting at Johnson C. Smith,
where all the students have e-mail addresses and they have just
agreed that all incoming students will have laptops,'' said Lester
Newman, who became president of Mississippi Valley State University
last July.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Mississippi Valley, we are wiring our campus now, and we
already have in place plans to purchase computers and put them in
the dormitories,'' Newman said. ``But the pace at which you go is a
question of money available, just as it is for a lot of other
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to administrators discussing the pros and cons of
offering e-mail or on-line registration seemed ``incredible'' at
times to Allison Clark, who is in charge of access and inclusion
initiatives at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
at the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``If minority-serving institutions don't get on the technology
bandwagon, they won't survive,'' she said. ``They have no choice.''

stood in a forest clearing on a rise above Walden Pond, just at the
spot outside Concord, Mass., where Henry David Thoreau built the
cabin in which he lived from July 1845 to September 1847. For a few
splendid minutes, I had the place all to myself. I could look at
things as Thoreau did when he explored the thicket of ideas about
self-reliance and spiritual immanence that he later shaped into
``Walden,'' one of the great works of American transcendentalism. I
also savored the amusing fact that I had come to this abashed,
intense interlude of personal reflection primarily as a customer of
a new vehicle of historical tourism called the Literary Trail of
Greater Boston. By Will Joyner.

 Matt Wolf is the London theater critic for Variety and a regular
writer on the arts from London.  
 (bl)  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It was a clear, brisk March morning in the Chilterns, a
pastoral stretch of England's Thames Valley, to the west of London,
and film director Tim Burton was looking skeptically at the sky.
``What we really want is lousy weather,'' said cinematographer
Emmanuel Lubezki, who shared Burton's concern over glimpses of sun
in a country where clouds can prevail for weeks on end. Before
long, the elemental status quo was restored, the skies darkened and
an essential gray returned to ``Sleepy Hollow,'' a movie being
freely adapted from Washington Irving's American classic.
</P>
<P>
   The Irving tale, of course, is set in a relatively new America,
so it may seem odd to find a movie version shooting not in the
Hudson Valley of New York state but in the home counties around
London. That is where Burton and his stars, Johnny Depp and
Christina Ricci, playing Ichabod Crane and his beloved Katrina Van
Tassel, have been for more than four months, as Burton creates
another of the singular and self-enclosed worlds for which he has
become known.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that time has been spent here at Shepperton and
Leavesden Studios. But on a recent day they were finishing a
monthlong location shoot outdoors on private English grounds that
had been transformed into the fearsome (and rain-soaked) turf of
Irving's legendary Headless Horseman.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, 40, is of course highly regarded for constructing
elaborate environments, even if the period setting of ``Sleepy
Hollow'' couldn't be further from the futuristic (and often
forbidding) splendor of Gotham City in ``Batman'' and ``Batman
Returns'' When location manager Keith Hatcher came upon it, the
Sleepy Hollow site consisted of an unspoiled meadow with a pond in
what is known as Lime Tree Valley on the Hambleden Estate. Now, on
some 20 acres (the entire estate covers 4,000), a picturesque
version of a Dutch colonial town, circa 1799, has been built.
</P>
<P>
   Lining the main street are a covered bridge, a blacksmith, a
general store and pub, and a doctor's residence and office, among
other structures. And as Depp's Ichabod Crane makes his
corpse-strewn way through the village, this cerebral man who lives
inside his head comes up against a vengeful figure on horseback who
goes his terrifying way without a head.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't often get the opportunity to do an entire town,''
said Rick Heinrichs, the production designer, who has worked with
Burton in varying capacities for much of the past 20 years. At a
cost estimated by producer Scott Rudin at $1.3 million, and over a
period of four months, 12 structures were built, several with
detailed interiors as well as exteriors.
</P>
<P>
   But because ``Sleepy Hollow''(due for a Nov. 19 release) is a
horror film as well as a fantasy and a romance, the houses aren't
simply what they seem. ``We wanted a sort of portentousness,''
Heinrichs explained, ``houses with growths on them: tumorous,
interesting shapes growing out of other shapes all kind of huddled
together.'' So without giving too much away, one can reveal that
Burton's famously angled, skewed vision _ the apparent doziness of
a town that holds within it a nightmare _ remains intact. (Remember
the Necco-wafer-colored, manicured suburbia of Burton's 1990 fable,
``Edward Scissorhands''?) The result, Heinrichs said, could be
described as ``colonial expressionism: a sort of pastiche of Dutch
and English and some French domestic architecture, and that all
feels oddly American because it is a pastiche of different
influences.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of the location, however, has exacted a price in a
climate where rain, not sun, is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the perfect setting for a hollow,'' Heinrichs
continued, ``but what makes it a hollow is the fact that there's a
basin, and all the water from the hill runs from the center down.''
That's why Burton spoke wryly of a farming community that resembled
Woodstock revisited. ``One day we went location scouting, and I
couldn't get out of the mud,'' he said. Had he not been hoisted
out, ``I would have still been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not then shoot ``Sleepy Hollow'' in its actual East Coast
setting, or entirely on a soundstage? ``We came to England because
we couldn't get a combination of locations and stages in New
York,'' said Heinrichs. ``There was no way we could have gotten
this anywhere else.'' For his part, Rudin spoke of a level of
craftsmanship in period detail, painting and costuming that was
available in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then for me,'' he added, there was the bonus of who got to
be in it'' _ such Britain-based character actors as Ian McDiarmid,
Michael Gambon, Michael Gough and Miranda Richardson, all of whom
work regularly in the London theater. ( Gough also played the
solicitous butler, Alfred, in Burton's ``Batman'' movies.) ``That,
for me,'' said Rudin, who also produces plays, ``was a big draw.''
</P>
<P>
   McDiarmid, the co-artistic director of London's Almeida Theater,
has a supporting role in ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace.'' And since that film was also shot at Leavesden Studios,
in suburban Hertfordshire, north of London, McDiarmid was able to
compare the esthetics of the two films. ``Having come from the
blue-screen world of `Star Wars,''' he said, referring to the
monochrome backdrops that can be filled in later digitally, ``it
was wonderful to see gigantic, beautifully made perspective sets
and wonderful clothes, and also people recreating a world. It's
like the way movies used to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Leavesden a week later, Burton was busily assembling yet more
British theater talent (including Simon McBurney, the director of
last season's acclaimed Broadway revival of Ionesco's ``Chairs'' )
for a scene early in the film in a New York City watchhouse, the
police station of its day. There, in a sonorously spoken cameo
appearance, was none other than Christopher Lee. A veteran of the
same horror movies from England's Hammer Films that Burton said he
had long admired, Lee plays the official who sends Depp's Ichabod
to investigate the murders at Sleepy Hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Looking like a French painter in his beret, Burton checked out a
motorized torture device, known as ``the confessional,'' into which
the actor Michael Feast would soon be strapped. ``Making a film,
you certainly feel as if you're in one of those every day,'' Burton
said. Weighing about a quarter of a ton, the instrument, Burton
said, ``was very symbolic for all of us; we've all got our head in
a vise.''
</P>
<P>
   Other similarly grim and imposing contraptions were evident
around the room, including a ``Venus flytrap in four parts'' that,
said Joss Williams, the special effects supervisor, ``is supposed
to make you confess to whatever it is you haven't done.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Depp, 35, who is making his third film with Burton after
``Edward Scissorhands'' and ``Ed Wood,'' sat quietly, tapping his
fingers on his knee as if to maintain his concentration. He was
dressed for two early scenes in a policeman's outfit deemed
``incredibly chic'' by the film's costume designer, Colleen Atwood,
who was nominated for an Academy Award this year for ``Beloved.''
``Uniforms of the period were really beautifully made,'' Ms. Atwood
said. They weren't the polyester we have today; it was a whole
other thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise Depp wears more or less one costume, sporting a
waistcoast shot through with gold thread. ``Johnny is a design
element in this movie as much as any piece of scenery,'' Rudin
said. ``He looks like an Edward Gorey drawing, as if there's some
string inside him, pulling him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Depp, his neck stiffened by his constable's suit, said
cheerfully during a break: ``It feels like `Scissorhands'; they've
got me locked in.''
</P>
<P>
   (In the current version of the tale, Andrew Kevin Walker's
screenplay _ tweaked by Tom Stoppard, who in March won an Oscar for
``Shakespeare In Love'' _ presents Ichabod Crane as a forensic
detective, not the schoolteacher of Irving's story.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it must have been like to work on the set of
`Frankenstein' or `Dracula' or `The Phantom of the Opera,' with Lon
Chaney,'' Depp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pleasure to see somebody change from one film to the
next,'' Burton said of his star, though to Rudin there is one
constant: ``Basically, Johnny Depp is playing Tim Burton in all his
movies.''

A PURSE IS MORE THAN A CONTAINER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Somebody should tell the Supreme Court that a
woman's purse is more than just an ordinary ``container.''
</P>
<P>
   The high bench sometimes inadvertently demonstrates how isolated
it is from the real world. That happened this week with a 6-3
decision that held the Fourth Amendment protection against
unreasonable search and seizure need not prevent a cop from pawing
through an automobile passenger's property in her handbag.
</P>
<P>
   The majority acknowledged that without a warrant a body search
of a passenger that would include a pocket or ``the space between
his shirt and underwear'' would be an unconstitutional invasion of
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But a purse? Fair game. Not technically attached to the body.
</P>
<P>
   It's merely attached to the heart and mind and personality of
the woman carrying it, that's all.
</P>
<P>
   A purse is an extension of a woman's identity. It is her very
self, her lifeline, her support system.
</P>
<P>
   Men carry billfolds to hold money and credit cards, usually in
those pockets the court is protecting. But women carry purses in
order to keep with them at all times their most intimate
possessions, such as eyeglasses, keys, appointment calendars and
makeup as well as money and pictures of loved ones. You name it.
Purses hold it.
</P>
<P>
   Purses are not to be taken lightly. They come in all sizes and
shapes, depending on the requirements of their owners. Normally
they dangle from a hand or shoulder, serving as virtually a
permanent female appendage.
</P>
<P>
   They are miniature suitcases. Most women would rather lose their
soul than lose their purse.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the two female justices split on the issue. Sandra Day
O'Connor thought purses were no big deal while Ruth Bader Ginsburg
disapproved of the majority's strained language protecting a man's
pocket but not a woman's pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing the majority opinion in Wyoming
v. Houghton, ruled that a closed container like a purse or
briefcase belonging to a passenger in a car legally stopped because
the driver was suspected of transporting drugs can be included in a
general police search of the auto and its contents. In this case,
the passenger, Sandra Houghton, was found to be carrying drugs and
related paraphernalia in her purse.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia sought to make this invasion of privacy palatable by
making a distinction between possessions being worn and those being
carried. He conceded that ``even a limited search of outer clothing
... constitutes a severe, though brief, intrusion upon cherished
personal security and it must surely be an annoying, frightening
and perhaps humiliating experience. ... But such traumatic
consequences are not to be expected when the police examine an item
of personal property found in a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer, in a concurring opinion, was troubled by
Scalia's airy dismissal of a purse as just another receptacle for
holding goods. ``Purses are special containers,'' he noted. ``I am
tempted to say that a search of a purse involves an intrusion so
similar to a search of one's person that the same rule should
govern both ... ''
</P>
<P>
   But Breyer added that in past decisions the court had refused to
legally treat purses differently from any other closed bag or box
and he would stick to precedent.
</P>
<P>
   He was also influenced by the fact the purse was found at a
distance from its owner, rather than clutched in her hands. ``It
would matter if a woman's purse, like a man's billfold, were
attached to her person. It might then amount to a kind of outer
clothing,'' Breyer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the three-justice dissent,
arguing that a warrantless search of a passenger's purse or
briefcase involved a serious intrusion of privacy that could not be
justified without probable cause to suspect that the person owning
it has committed a crime. The mere existence of a purse in a
suspect's car does not mean the cops should be free to rummage in
it just for the fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Supremes'' do not realize the mischief they are creating
here. No self-respecting woman is likely to hand over the secrets
of her purse to police snoops without a fight. We have not hard the
last of this issue.

BREAK A LEG: STAGE PERFORMERS FACE HIGH RISK OF INJURY 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVERETT EVANS 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Watch out for that rake!
</P>
<P>
   That's the advice Houston doctors Randolph and Richard Evans
have for theater performers after conducting two studies on their
injuries in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The warning does not refer to farm tools in revivals of
``Oklahoma!`` but to the raked or sloping stage floor used in many
shows to give audiences a better view of the action. Though they
may be an aesthetic boon, the Evans' two studies found that they
caused a threefold increase in the likelihood of performer injury.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was a raked stage that inspired the studies.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Evans, a neurologist with the Texas Medical Center, was
taking a backstage tour after attending ``Miss Saigon`` at the
Broadway Theater in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like standing on a ski slope!'' Evans said of the stage
floor. ``I asked cast members, especially dancers, if it was
difficult performing on it. They said that it was and that some had
made complaints to management, but had gotten little response.''
</P>
<P>
   A longtime theater buff with friends in the business, Evans
decided to do a study on the frequency of actor injuries, the
contributing factors and possible ways of making the stage a safer
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I contacted Actors Equity (the profession's union), and they
were very interested in the idea. Especially when they learned I
wanted to do the survey free of charge. In other cases, they've
hired companies to do studies of particular occupational hazards
and had to pay a good deal for them. As I'm in private practice,
the cost to me was mostly my time.''
</P>
<P>
   The project soon involved Evans' father Richard, distinguished
professor and director of social psychology and behavioral medicine
at the University of Houston and another longtime theater buff (and
friend of the late Alley Theater founder Nina Vance).
</P>
<P>
   ``My father and his graduate students were very helpful in
designing the survey and analyzing the results. I came up with the
concept, wrote up the findings and was the contact with the unions,
arranging things.''
</P>
<P>
   The first study was conducted in 1993 among cast members of 10
Broadway productions and 13 national tours, with results published
in the American Journal of Public Health in 1996. Involved were 168
dancers and 151 actors in the 23 productions.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 55 percent sustained injuries at some
point. Most common were strains and sprains of the lower
extremities. About 37 percent of dancers and 28 percent of actors
incurred an injury serious enough to make them miss at least one
performance, and 13 individuals required surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The raked stage was found to be the highest risk factor. ``Miss
Saigon,'' which had the steepest rake _ 10 degrees _ had the
highest number of injuries, followed by ``Cats.`` Among the road
tours, ``Cats'' registered the most injuries, followed by ``The
Will Rogers Follies,'' which didn't have a raked stage but featured
an elaborate staircase on which many of the numbers were performed.
</P>
<P>
   Other risk factors were: fog and smoke effects, which hindered
visibility and caused upper respiratory irritation; heavy wigs,
masks and costumes; uneven floors; and trap doors. Women were
injured more often than men, presumably because they often had to
perform the same maneuvers wearing heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem like common sense that certain things increase
risk,'' said Kenneth Greenwood, senior representative of Actors
Equity. ``But we can't make significant progress at the bargaining
table unless we have studies showing the harm caused. So Randy's
study has been very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actors Equity was thrilled because the study supported their
position,'' said Randolph Evans. ``They got some changes in the
production contract, which now recommends a maximum rake of 7.5
degrees, (and specifies) that shows with raked stages have a
physical therapist on staff to help the actors work more safely.
They also recommend more judicious use of fog and smoke, and that
machines producing it be placed farther from the singers to cause
less damage to vocal cords.''
</P>
<P>
   When Randolph Evans suggested in 1996 that the study be
replicated in London's West End, British Equity greeted his plan as
a welcome coincidence. Only the week before, the union had
circulated a memo about performance injuries. In London, the study
looked at 269 actors and dancers in 12 dramas and eight musicals.
</P>
<P>
   The results, published last fall in Occupational and
Environmental Medicine, were similar to the New York findings,
pointing to raked stages and fog machines as leading dangers. Close
to half the players (46 percent) suffered work-related injuries at
some point in their runs. ``Starlight Express,'' Andrew Lloyd
Webber's musical roller derby, was found to be the most hazardous
show (surprise!).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In both studies, sprains and strains of lower extremities proved
the most common injuries, though back and neck injuries were fairly
common.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at the attention the studies received,'' said
Randolph Evans. ``I was interviewed by USA Today and the BBC, among
others. Best of all, our little studies had an impact on production
contracts, both on Broadway and the West End.''
</P>
<P>
   Though not included in the Evans' studies, Houston's resident
theaters have seen their share of mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   In the Alley's 1997 production of ``Mere Mortals,'' Annalee
Jefferies was leaving the stage after curtain call and (she
confesses) ``horsing around'' a bit with fellow actor Paul Hope.
She took a tumble, and the resultant ankle injury caused her to
miss a performance and play the show's final week in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, veteran Houston actress Marjorie Carroll took
a wrong turn exiting the stage during a rehearsal for ``Hedda
Gabler'' and fell. Her resultant ankle injury caused her to
withdraw from the show. Bettye Fitzpatrick replaced her opening
night, and Carroll's understudy, Sharon Bennett, played the rest of
the run.
</P>
<P>
   An accident with far greater potential for harm befell Richard
White, leading man of Theater Under The Stars' ``Zorro'' in 1998.
During a rehearsal, the horse he was riding slipped and fell on
White's leg. (Theater buffs know that a similar accident crippled
composer Cole Porter.) Though the accident exacerbated an earlier
knee injury, White nonetheless got back on the horse with no
further mishaps during the run. After the engagement, however, he
had surgery on the knee. ``There was no permanent damage,
happily,'' said TUTS spokesman Susie Works.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most extreme result of actor injury in recent years
befell ``Busker Alley,'' the Broadway-bound musical that played
here as part of a tryout tour in 1995. The show put star Tommy Tune
and the male chorus through their paces in athletic dance numbers
that often involved swinging on a phalanx of onstage lampposts.
Though there were no disasters during the Houston engagement, star
Tommy Tune ``landed wrong'' during a number on the tour's final
stop in Tampa, breaking his foot. As the show was frankly a vehicle
for Tune, who couldn't have danced for many months, it folded
without reaching Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it odd that millions of people are riveted to every
detail about a sports figure's injuries,'' said Randolph Evans,
``but no one pays much attention to actors' injuries. The theater
is thought of as such a glamorous profession. Yet it's very hard
work, usually for far less pay than the audience realizes, and
often under less than ideal conditions. The Broadway and London
theaters are wonderful and historic _ but they often have backstage
areas far less spacious and comfortable than those of university
and community theaters. Besides the onstage risks, the performers
are racing on and off through crowded dressing rooms and sometimes
up and down steep, narrow stairways.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans admits that, in the cosmic scheme, actors' injuries may
not seem an important issue, as they affect so few people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet it's important to the actors who make this their life's
work, and to all who attend these shows and enjoy their work. It's
a quality-of-workplace issue. If you love the performing arts, you
are concerned about these artists, especially since most of them
rarely get the recognition they deserve. And what we learn looking
at their safety concerns can be applied to those in amateur and
student productions, which opens it up to a lot more people.''

 &HT;    Ceramics showcase flourishes amid rolling pastures
 &HT;    By Howard Pousner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEAGROVE, N.C. _ In this tiny Piedmont town where just about
everyone is a potter, and nearly every gravel driveway winds back
to a pottery shop, customers make an art of searching for the
perfect pot.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, Darlene Samuelson, who was in the hunt last
week when she popped into Turn and Burn Pottery, one of more than
100 _ yep, two zeroes _ ceramics shops within 15 miles of here. The
46-year-old Cincinnati nurse was staying overnight on her second
visit to Seagrove, 45 minutes south of Greensboro, breaking up a
long drive to a beach vacation. Her mission: finding a primitive
piece for herself and a contemporary one as a present for friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice off-the-beaten-path way to spend the day,'' she
said, before turning to shop proprietor David Garner and adding,
``I guess you don't particularly like hearing Seagrove called `off
the beaten path.'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, for Garner, 47, who happens also to be mayor of this
town of 250, that kind of smarts.
</P>
<P>
   Seagrove has long been a bit of a secret among ceramics lovers,
decorators visiting the nearby High Point furniture showrooms and
spouses of golfers playing at neighboring Pinehurst.
</P>
<P>
   Then, nearly two years ago, a stretch of new interstate opened,
bypassing Seagrove and removing most of the 29,000 cars that used
to tool through the heart of town on U.S. 220 _ many on the way to
Myrtle Beach, S.C. At first I-73/74's exit signs didn't even
mention the name Seagrove, quite a slight for a place where
pottery-making goes back so many generations that some shops
include family ``museums.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there are more interstate signs than billboards for Mickey
D's and, while traffic isn't what it was, there are encouraging
signs of renewal. The $1.2 million North Carolina Pottery Museum,
which opened late last year, not only gives the area a new
attraction but also serves as a needed information center for
tourists not quite sure where to start. And there's also the Duck
Smith House, a new B&AMP;B, the town's first, to keep them overnight.
</P>
<P>
   And, just as the oaks leaf out and dogwoods blossom, there's
also the promise of customers returning after winter's doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   To help launch the season, 60 of the potteries are participating
in the 6th annual Spring Kiln Opening on April 17-18. Many of the
potters will unload their freshly fired wares from their kilns (the
ovens in which the glazed clay forms are baked into pots at
temperatures higher than 2,000 degrees) in front of customers who
line up to get first pick. The crowd is typically so big at the
pottery of Ben Owen III, a seventh-generation potter, they have to
give out numbers to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the potters are much more casual about it, doing the
unloading and finishing work ahead of time and simply displaying
the new wares for sale. But many literally put on a show _
demonstrating how to ``throw'' pots or firing some. At Turn and
Burn, for instance, Garner plans to have two raku kilns stoked,
yanking pots out of the infernos every 20 minutes or so with long
fireplace tongs then smothering them in sawdust to get a crackled
decorative effect on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, Phil Morgan, who creates porcelain pieces with a
gorgeous crystalline glaze, will be holding his breath as he opens
his kiln. With any firing, there's an element of chance _ a
mistake, or even a sudden climactic change, can ruin a load that's
taken a month or more to produce. Morgan's glaze, in which colorful
crystals burst onto the pots' glowing surfaces by alterations of
temperature during firing, is harder to control than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's Christmas when I open the kiln, and sometimes
it's Halloween,'' says Morgan, 50. ``But it's exciting to know that
here's this big kiln cooling down, and (the customer is seeing
what's inside when the potter sees it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you can't make it to the spring event _ or to the 18th
annual fall festival, held at a central location rather than the
individual potteries, on Nov. 21 _ Seagrove is a fun, down-to-earth
destination almost any time.
</P>
<P>
   While there are bigger employers here, including a furniture
manufacturer and a canning plant, Seagrove seems to boast more
potteries than Luck's has pinto beans. Most of them are off N.C.
705 as it winds east out of Seagrove through the barely-there
communities of Whynot, Westmoore and Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   It's a beautiful drive past rolling Piedmont pastures where
cattle are already working overtime to keep the grass trimmed and
tidy. Colorful, hand-painted road signs for the potteries dot the
roadside, pointing you down side streets where shops are
interspersed with farmhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the pleasure of the hunt is seeing what's around the
next bend _ every time you think you've found the last shop and
start to turn around, there's another one. Just don't act like a
city slicker and get all startled when one of the neighbors looks
up from his mailbox run or garden dig and actually waves as you
cruise by. (Tip: It's polite to wave back.)
</P>
<P>
   Just as there's no typical style of Seagrove pot _ it's the
variety that helps keep more than 100 potteries in business _ the
shops themselves run the gamut. Westmoore Pottery is housed in a
chalet-style cottage with a cedar shake roof, somehow fitting for
the Moravian and English reproduction wares that are its
speciality. Other shops are a living lesson in rural recycling:
Phil Morgan Pottery used to be a roller rink, a bootleg bar and a
Holiness church. Luck's Ware is half of a former chicken coop.
Michael Mahan's From the Ground Up pottery _ so named for the
burnished pots that he fires in an earthen pit _ is in converted
outbuildings.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the places conduct business in a style so low key they
barely seem to be in business. One customer last week spent 15
minutes wandering though historic Jugtown Pottery and its adjoining
museum without anyone appearing to say as much as howdy.
</P>
<P>
   At the nearby M.L. Owens Pottery Shop, the sign out front
promises, ``M.L. Owens is here.'' But on two visits, the front door
was wide open, the birdhouses and ashtrays and such were sitting
out and the lights were on, but ol' M.L. wasn't home. Finally, the
visitor noticed the note scrawled on scratch paper on the desk:
``Wait on yourself if no one's here. Please add 6 percent tax and
leave money in basket. Thanks, M.L.O.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, you'll have to come back if you want to talk to the
80-something dean of local potters about the history of Seagrove,
which, like a pottery wheel, has gone in a circle.
</P>
<P>
   The industry was born to produce food storage wares for the
Moravian farmers who settled in the Piedmont in the 1750s. There
were more than 250 potteries here around the turn of the century,
but the advent of factory-produced containers and other factors
reduced them to a handful after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Working at Jugtown Pottery from 1923-1959 and then in his own
shop until 1972, Benjamin Wade Owen Sr. was instrumental in a sea
change in Seagrove, from strictly utilitarian pieces to the more
artistic works that collectors covet today. His Asian-inspired pots
_ with their serene lines and vividly hued glazes _ are handsomely
displayed alongside his grandson's in the new museum that adjoins
Ben Owen III's gallery, as slick as any in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   After traveling to Japan several years ago for a workshop, Ben
III has delved deeper into Asian design, incorporating glazes such
as Chinese red, oribe (a sea-foam green) and shino (sand).
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the museum last week, Owen, 30, marveled over how
Seagrove has rebounded to reign as the country's biggest pottery
center. ``We're all influenced by many different backgrounds,'' he
said. ``That's what people notice when they come into this
community. When they go into different potteries, they see
different, not better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every piece produced in Seagrove is one of a kind because
everyone's hand has a different touch on clay.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: It's a six-hour drive to Seagrove: From Atlanta
take I-85 north to Charlotte and N.C. 49 to Asheboro and U.S. 73/74
South. Or by plane, it's $98 round trip on AirTran or Delta to
Greensboro, with a 14-day advance purchase.

potters to help visitors decide which shops to hit first. 10 a.m.-4
p.m. Tuesdays-Saturdays. 250 East Ave. 336-873-8430.

 &HT;    Behind rocker Janis Joplin's flamboyant persona, biographer
finds an empty life
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 11.
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 30 years after she became the hottest female entertainer
in rock 'n' roll, Janis Joplin is perhaps better known for her
sordid death than for her groundbreaking body of work.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to forget how shocking her arrival on the music scene
was in 1967. Long before the ditch-your-makeup emergence of the
women's movement, Joplin was shaking her wildly unkempt hair,
wearing feathers and bangle bracelets, pushing her bare chest into
our faces like the ultimate flip-off. Her voice was a howl _ part
soul diva, part banshee _ that stunned audiences. She caught
America's attention like a train wreck and shot to the top of the
music charts as the ultimate rock chick.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, history has chosen to remember her more as the ultimate
rock corpse, a 27-year-old alcoholic-addict who lay dead on the
floor of Los Angeles' seedy Landmark Hotel for 18 hours before any
of her doped-up friends figured out she was missing. Joplin's fatal
heroin overdose in 1970 put her squarely in the triumvirate of
death by overindulgence, joining Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison as
icons of the dark side of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Biographer Alice Echols _ a scholar of radical feminism, not a
rock journalist _ renovates the myth by shifting the focus from
Joplin's infamous death to the events and social attitudes that
shaped her life. No doubt it's the author's background that makes
the approach here more one of female character study than gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The book has, of course, its salacious moments. It would be
impossible to write honestly about Joplin's life without exploring
fringy details such as her insatiable sexual appetite (for both men
and women), unbridled drug use and ever-present bottle of Southern
Comfort. Echols shows how the singer's outrageous persona was
created largely to cover up bottomless insecurities about her
looks, her voice and her countercultural lifestyle. (At one point
Joplin even became engaged, left San Francisco, went home, put her
hair in a bun and worked on her trousseau.) Echols writes that one
potential boyfriend was put off by Joplin's overwhelming
``sexual/personal neediness, saying, `Whoa, it's too big for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   The foundations of the Joplin legend begin in Port Arthur,
Texas, the bleak industrial town where she grew up in a
conservative, middle-class family that expected her to go to the
community college, get a teaching certificate and get married. A
pampered and popular child, she ``lost her looks'' at age 14,
Echols writes: She gained weight and developed a severe case of
acne, two things you did not want to happen in the beauty-pageant
'60s of the South.
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to her declining social status and the taunts of
schoolmates, Joplin developed the rude and bawdy character she
would later make famous, wearing oversize men's shirts over
leotards to high school, swearing like a barfly and swilling
alcohol in Cajun dives across the state line in Louisiana. Along
the way, she began singing along with the jukebox and experimenting
with her voice, whose natural sound was said to be sweet and folkie
like Joan Baez. Influenced heavily by the Jack Kerouac-inspired
beats of the era, Joplin developed a passion for blues and began
adding rawness to her sound to emulate Bessie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   After a short, wild stint at the University of Texas in Austin
in 1965, Joplin became one of the first immigrants to the
burgeoning hippie haven of San Francisco. Echols' description of
this now-revered peace-and-love scene is unsettling as she pulls
back the tie-dyed facade to reveal the sexist and reckless
underbelly of this piece of American folklore. Placing Joplin
squarely in this world, Echols writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of undoing the deeply rooted sexual double standard,
free love only masked it in countercultural pieties. Nor did hippie
households pioneer an alternative to the traditional division of
labor. Although many hippie guys managed to avoid nine to five
jobs, few hippie females avoided housework.''
</P>
<P>
   Joplin was deified as an entertainer, yet vilified for bucking
convention. As Echols puts it: ``Janis's fame had revealed the
limits of the San Francisco free thing, but her real sin was in
being a ballsy broad, a chick with acne who took up too much space
in the boys' club of late-sixties rock and roll.''
</P>
<P>
   But to say that sexism is what killed Janis Joplin would be a
cliche. Other women, such as Grace Slick, survived those years
(admittedly, with scars). And female rockers in the 1970s and '80s,
from Chrissie Hynde to Madonna, faced many of the same obstacles
without self-destructing.
</P>
<P>
   Echols leads one to believe that Joplin may have been a victim
of her own insecurities and rebellious perspective, a
hope-I-die-before-I-get-old attitude that sees excess as romantic.
But as jazz vocalist Nina Simone once said, ``The saddest part of
performing was that it didn't mean anything once you were
offstage.'' Utterly empty in her personal life, Joplin appeared to
embrace the role of tortured artist, subscribing to the notion that
creativity and glamour are only enhanced by personal destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's a fine line between walking on the edge
and falling off.

 &HT;    Common sense not so common in the academy
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 11.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Several years ago, a prominent academic at Duke
University took offense at something I had written about the
English department and offered a suggestion that revealed how deep
in the sand her head was buried. Newspapers, she said, train
reporters to cover fields such as medicine and science as well as
law, business and economics.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, she said, newspapers needed specialists to
cover the English department. I let pass the implication that there
was anything to cover in the first place. Instead, I asked why it
was necessary to learn a pseudo-technical jargon to understand what
should be common to all educated people: the English language.
Whatever she said in reply, it was her remoteness from ordinary
life that struck me.
</P>
<P>
   She was the president-elect of the Modern Language Association
at the time, but, for all she understood of the world, she might as
well have just checked in from Pluto. She was representative of the
postmodern intellectual in the academy, a figure of public ridicule
who doesn't know why.
</P>
<P>
   Such a figure is Judith Butler, a philosophy professor at the
University of California at Berkeley and winner recently of the
1998 Worst, Most Awful Writer Award. That's not exactly what the
humanities journal Philosophy and Literature calls it, but it's
close. The journal's editors created the award to recognize the
``ugliest, most stylistically awful passage found in a scholarly
book or article published in the last few years.'' Mine is more
succinct, theirs more precise. Take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   A philosopher responds to her critics
</P>
<P>
   What matters is that Butler won hands down, and her prose has
been in demand ever since. To say the least, it is not the kind of
demand a writer enjoys. Last month, I quoted Butler's winning
sentence, and some readers thought it was a hoax on her part,
others a typographical catastrophe. From English departments in
Georgia came two unsigned letters berating me for aggressive
``anti-intellectualism.''
</P>
<P>
   Indignant, or maybe just tired of being beaten up, Butler
herself is fighting back. Recently, she took to the op-ed page of
The New York Times to explain why intelligent people should not
expect to have the faintest idea what she's trying to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt,'' she conceded, ``scholars in the humanities should
be able to clarify how their work informs and illuminates everyday
life. Equally, however, such scholars are obliged to question
common sense, interrogate its tacit presumptions and provoke new
ways of looking at a familiar world. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``If common sense sometimes preserves the status quo, and that
status quo sometimes treats unjust social hierarchies as natural,
it makes good sense on such occasions to find ways of challenging
common sense. Language that takes up this challenge can help point
the way to a more socially just world.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you think? No one, on the basis of the above, would call
Butler a stylist, but you have to say she can write clearly and
forcefully when she wants to. She's not the nincompoop her award
would suggest _ but no deep thinker either. Just another leftover
leftist still living in the '60s, still citing Theodor Adorno and
Herbert Marcuse. (Marcuse! Somewhere I have my pink and black
paperback copy of ``Reason and Revolution,'' solemnly annotated so
many years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Being difficult for difficulty's sake
</P>
<P>
   What Butler wrote in the Times was not so much an apologia pro
vita sua as a defense of ``difficulty.'' The word is fashionable
among academics afraid that their profession is anything but. Is,
in fact, a bit Mickey Mouse (as we used to call courses that were
easy A's). Insecurity creates the pose it needs.
</P>
<P>
   But letter writer after letter writer in the Times saw through
it. And none was fooled by Butler's invocation of a sentence from
Adorno, a German emigre who was instrumental in founding the
voguish ``critical theory'' school in the academy: ``Man is the
ideology of dehumanization.'' For Butler, it is the kind of
sentence that is not immediately transparent, yet is jampacked with
profound meaning. Thus, she supposes, a reader pauses over it,
puzzling out its secrets.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, as one letter writer neatly put it, it's
nothing more than ``the verbal equivalent of a secret handshake,''
an insider's signal that he knows the lingo. No one begrudges
physics its difficulty, because it strives to simplify what is
complex. Postmodern criticism does the opposite. It obfuscates for
the sake of obfuscation, and in doing so mistakes artificial
``difficulty'' for ideas. This is impossible to do without the
protective cover of tenure, but that's what universities are for.
In their security, some critics have dispensed with the mask
entirely. Jonathan Culler, a mediocrity but druid in some circles,
calls the ``ideology of lucidity'' one more form of oppression.
</P>
<P>
   When you put it that way, you can't be accused of burying your
head in the sand. You can only be accused of not caring. If the one
prompts pity, the other elicits contempt. And richly deserved it
is.

 &HT;    From birthday parties to doggie delis, new treateries cheerfully
catering to canines
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a warm afternoon, and Rick Sisson's customers,
fresh from a walk in the park, are stopping by for their just
desserts.
</P>
<P>
   Sisson pulls a tray of chunky pretzels out of the oven and
arranges them _ just so _ on a tray, which he slips into a display
case. The case is filled with other temptations as well _ clusters
of truffles there, miniature carob-chip cookies here, peanut
brittle and darling little tarts with a piped filling.
</P>
<P>
   A shopper wants a treat personalized, so Sisson writes ``Holly''
in carob icing.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, he'll wipe down the display case, removing
smears left by wet noses. And someone will give the floor a coat of
disinfectant, to discourage the next day's bakery clientele from
peeing on it.
</P>
<P>
   Even at a store where canines are treated a lot like people, a
few things still separate the paying customers from the four-legged
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Three Dog Bakery is one of a growing number of treateries in
Atlanta and elsewhere that caters solely to dogs. Another, Barking
Hound Village, opened Wednesday. In less specialized settings as
well _ Einstein Brothers with its bagel-shaped dog biscuits and pet
stores with various upscale nibbles _ gourmet dog food is becoming
a noticeable niche market.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo.-based Three Dog has 18 outlets selling items
such as Dottie's Donuts, two for $1.75, and 7-inch carob-chip cakes
for $16. Ten more stores are scheduled to open in the next two
months, and the chain is putting together dog related programming
to start this fall on cable's Animal Planet. Some of Three Dogs'
dry treats are sold through PetSmart and Neiman Marcus, too.
</P>
<P>
   Three-year-old Bone Appetit Bakery, based in Omaha, Neb., has 22
franchises, with three more opening soon. In Seattle, there's the
Bow Wow Meow Treatoria, with baked goods and a deli serving fresh
food for dogs and cats. In Dallas, the Big Bark Bakery holds
birthday parties complete with apple-cinnamon, banana-nut or
honey-almond cakes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Atlanta area, David Reid of Powder Springs, a chef who
trained at the Culinary Institute of America, prepares peanut
butter and carob pinwheels, biscotti and bones for stores such as
Highland Pet Supply in Atlanta and Pet Land in Duluth (Ga.). This
summer, Highland Pet plans to add refrigerated takeout meals.
</P>
<P>
   Gourmet pet chow purveyors tout their products as low-fat health
foods without salt, sugar and chocolate. Some items are advertised
as free of preservatives and antibiotics; others say they are
organic or made of meat suitable for human consumption. Wheat, oats
or rice are the base for many baked treats.
</P>
<P>
   Giving dogs an occasional treat is fine, as long as snacks don't
make up more than 10 percent of their diet and they're not
overweight, says Sherry Sanderson, a clinical nutritionist at the
University of Georgia's veterinary school.
</P>
<P>
   But dogs don't care whether they snack on an old-fashioned pig's
ear treat or a bakery-prepared carob cake, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners do seem to care, however. Driving the boom in
gourmet chow are pet owners who want the same things for Fido as
they do for themselves or their children. Consider what Barking
Hound plans to open by summer: a doggie deli, a gym with a
treadmill and a day care center with Internet cameras, so owners
can keep an eye on their pooch from work. It will also have a cafe
where people can dine next to their dogs _ albeit separated by a
window.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Barking Hound threw the first of 14 birthday parties
already scheduled for its back room, a $150 affair with balloons, a
gift basket for the birthday dog, a layer cake for humans and, for
the canines, slices of a pineapple, oatmeal, apple and whole wheat
layer cake artfully arranged on white paper doilies in shiny bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting the same thing for your pet as yourself only goes so
far, however.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Heath, co-owner of the Atlanta Three Dog franchise, says
he's snacked on Dottie's Spots, a peanut butter cookie with carob
chips, and Pawlines, a rice flour and vanilla chip concoction. Some
of the treats are bland because they contain no sugar or chocolate,
he says, but the Pawlines are tasty even for humans. Want to try
one? Uh, no.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the corner of the bakery, Roger Massell of Asheville,
N.C., is looking around with his mother and son. They've seen a
triple-tiered cake in the window and have come inside for a snack
for themselves. No luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is for dogs?'' he asks. ``Golly, this is
unbelievable. They sure don't have this in Asheville, do they,
son?''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the Massells are on the way out, with a bag of
goodies for their two bichon frises.
</P>
<P>
   Joey and Andrea Hirsch, holding their pug Scooby, eye the
display case with the ardor of new pet owners. They buy a
personalized bone for Holly, the pug next door, and treats for
Scooby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always buy him stuff,'' says Joey Hirsch. ``We're supposed
to be on a budget, but just look at his face.''
</P>
<P>
   They also figure that if the 4-month-old puppy has treats to
nibble on, he won't chew the furniture or their sneakers, which
have a few shredded spots already.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, Teddy snuffles around barrels with biscuits
piled up at just the right height for a hungry Weimaraner. A
moment's inattention by Lou Flauraud of Smyrna, the guy holding the
business end of the leash, and Teddy snags a cheese-and-herb treat.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dog's life.

 &HT;    Before you can say `designer label,' copycats have translated
high-fashion trends into affordable looks
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 11.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fashion moves quickly these days. And the track from
runway to reproduction is faster than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet and television have enabled copycat designers to
duplicate styles in record time, in order to sell them, of course,
at a fraction of the price. Instead of months, production time for
copying a style and shipping it to retail stores has been cut to as
little as four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a world that moves fast,'' says Freda Greenbaum,
fashion director at A Nose for Clothes, a specialty shop for women
that has stores in Sandy Springs (Ga.) and Alpharetta (Ga.). ``It's
not just coming from Europe. Middle America is able to see high
fashion almost at the same time designers are presenting the same
style. There's an entire entity of fashion designers who look to
the runway for design inspiration. They are able to create these
looks at popular prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Popular'' doesn't necessarily mean cheap. But these
reproductions are often much more within reach than the cost of a
designer label.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a designer jacket modeled on the runway for the
spring 1999 collection could cost around $1,500, estimates Kaye
Davis, fashion director for the Atlanta Market Center. A similar
jacket, made by a lesser known designer, could run around $500.
</P>
<P>
   The pink Ralph Lauren gown that Gwyneth Paltrow wore to the
Oscars last month costs about $4,000, says Kevin Knaus, president
of Inside Fashion, a local company that studies the industry. But
Victor Costa has already started production on a similar version
that will retail for around $400, just in time for prom season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is an issue in most American homes,'' said Scott
Krugman, spokesman for the National Retail Federation in
Washington. ``You're finding more of a mix between the actual
designer brands and things that might have the designer look,'' he
said, referring to consumer spending habits.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving the look
</P>
<P>
   The key to replicating runway styles is knowing what to look
for. Names still count. But instead of searching for a Calvin
Klein, Jil Sander or other top designers, focus on copycat labels
such as Victor Costa or ABS by Allen B. Schwartz. Private label
store brands, such as Gap, Ann Taylor and Banana Republic, also
resemble designer looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a woman has the time, go to a designer store to see what's
out there,'' advises Greenbaum. ``If you recognize that when you
walk into another store and you like the fabric, it fits you and
it's at a price that's affordable, feel secure that you're into
something great. But you have to do your homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion magazines (InStyle is mandatory reading for Greenbaum's
sales staff), televised runway shows and the Internet provide some
good places to ``study.'' To get started online, check out these

</P>
<P>
   Anything lost in translation?
</P>
<P>
   You will save money by not paying premium designer prices, but
you should also be prepared to sacrifice a little on the style.
</P>
<P>
   Designer garments tend to have more detail, such as stitching,
lining and buttons. The fabric also tends to be more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll never get them to look the same stitch for stitch, but
there are so many fabrics out there that are much less expensive
that look just as good,'' Knaus said.

 &HT;    First, he sets the stage; then Altman `insists' on good acting
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cookie's Fortune'' is about a whole lot of not much. And
that's the way Robert Altman intended it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sign in the picture that tells you about that,'' the
legendary director of ``Nashville,'' ``MASH'' and ``The Player''
says by telephone from Los Angeles. He's referring to a historic
plaque glimpsed in ``Fortune,'' engraved with the inscription, ``In
1876 absolutely nothing happened on this spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Altman's new Southern slice-of-life comedy has plenty
of things going on, from a suicide cover-up to a gloriously awful
church production of ``Salome.'' But the movie is basically an
excuse to let actors Glenn Close, Charles S. Dutton, Julianne
Moore, Patricia Neal, Chris O'Connell and Liv Tyler turn in
performances packed with sharp detail and little grace notes. It's
the sort of work most movies these days don't slow down to
showcase.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he does to get such good performances, Altman says
simply, ``I make 'em do it. I insist. I insist that they do what
they became actors to do in the first place, which is to create.
I've made many, many good friends who are actors, and I love
actors. But I don't understand what they do. Even now, 'tis a
mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   When shooting ``Fortune,'' everyone stayed in Holly Springs,
Miss., where accommodations are far from West Coast swank. No
restaurants, just one cafe, open only in the afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cooked in our own homes,'' Altman says. (The cast and crew
rented about 18 private homes for the shoot.) ``Glenn used to ride
her bike to work, and people waved at her, and came by at night to
watch us shoot. They brought their kids and dogs, and caught
fireflies and put them in bottles.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 74, Altman has sculpted a career by choosing scripts based
on character and often a sense of place. He's charted his native
Kansas City (``Kansas City''), ``Nashville,'' the Los Angeles of
``Short Cuts,'' the rainy Savannah of ``The Gingerbread Man'' and
the opium-dream idea of the old West (``McCabe and Mrs. Miller'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Agents want to keep their clients in L.A. where they can keep
an eye on them,'' Altman quips. ``Otherwise they might go off and
do something good that doesn't make a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his 30-odd feature films, the director claims he doesn't have
a favorite: ``They're like your children. You tend to love your
least successful children the most.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses a moment and makes his point by adding, ``I love
`Popeye.' ''

 &HT;    Mellower Altman heads south with leisurely, masterly `Fortune'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having proved with last year's ``The Gingerbread Man'' that he
can make a well-crafted mainstream movie as well as the next
director, it's nice to see Robert Altman return to his old
eccentric self with ``Cookie's Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   A kind of Southern Gothic shaggy-dog tale, the film takes place
in tiny Holly Springs, Miss., where about the biggest show in town
is the church's annual Easter play, directed by self-appointed
artiste Camille (Glenn Close) and starring her sister Cora
(Julianne Moore), who's as sweetly dim as Camille is imperiously
domineering. Probably the town's second-biggest show _ by default
more than anything else _ is the return of Cora's prodigal
daughter, Emma (Liv Tyler). A rebel in black overalls and cut-off
T-shirt, Emma has always flouted authority. She even has the 234
outstanding parking tickets to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Things pick up in Holly Springs, however, when the focus moves
to Camille and Cora's Aunt Cookie (Patricia Neal). A genteel,
pipe-smoking eccentric who shares her frayed-around-the-edges
antebellum home with Willis (Charles S. Dutton), her
African-American caretaker, Cookie decides that she misses her late
husband, Buck, so much that she'd like to join him.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, what could have been a nice, quiet suicide is
turned topsy-turvy when family members try to make it look like a
homicide. Things spin mischievously out of control from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookie's Fortune'' goes down smooth and easy. The laid-back,
affectionate tone is set early on by Dave Stewart's bluesy score
and by Altman's leisurely, let's-just-look-around approach to Anne
Rapp's script. Once the ostensible plot kicks in, you can sense
that Altman (``MASH,'' ``Nashville,'' ``The Player'') is still more
interested in poking around among his various characters than in
getting on with the investigation of the supposed murder.
</P>
<P>
   The film is full of flavorful touches. For example, the way the
church production of ``Salome'' is billed as ``By Oscar Wilde and
Camille Dixon.'' And the way Willis is characterized as ``a
responsible man who never drinks before Tom Brokaw.''
</P>
<P>
   The performances demonstrate a master's touch as well. Tyler has
never seemed so lively and appealing. The long-absent Neal, who has
co-starred with everyone from Gary Cooper to Paul Newman, turns
gentle dementia into a kind of grace note. Moore is demurely dotty
without ever descending into a cliche. And Dutton is like a bear
hug made flesh as the wondrously generous Willis, whose true place
in the scheme of things is revealed in a tumult of blood-relation
revelations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookie's Fortune'' gives us Altman the maverick in a mellower
mood, with disdain for few and compassion for all. Well, almost
all: Close gets stuck with a madwoman bit that's uncomfortably
close to ``Sunset Boulevard'' territory. Otherwise, ``Cookie's
Fortune'' is indeed a small treasure, one that celebrates the
phenomenon of human foibles as well as that of simple human
decency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookie's Fortune''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Glenn Close, Charles S. Dutton, Liv Tyler and Julianne
Moore. Directed by Robert Altman. Rated PG-13 for sexually
suggestive scenes. 2 hours. At Phipps.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: You'll like the way this ``Cookie'' crumbles.

 &HT;    There's something about Drew: Actress lifts sophomoric tale
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a whole lot of unbelievable stuff going on in ``Never
Been Kissed,'' not the least of which is expecting audiences to buy
Drew Barrymore as somebody who's never really locked lips.
</P>
<P>
   Even E.T. smooched with her when she made her first movie.
</P>
<P>
   In this story, Barrymore, the film's executive producer, plays
Josie Geller, a twentysomething newspaperwoman, and former high
school dweeb (they called her ``Josie Grossie''), who goes back to
teenville as an undercover reporter, relives her high-school hell
and bumbles her way to popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about her career is implausible. (Where on the planet
is there a front-line newspaper copy editor who has an assistant
and an office?) Plus, at school, she and her twentysomething
English instructor, Sam, have so many eyes-locked dangerous
liaisons that you'd think somebody would wise up about their
student-teacher close encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the script's lame jokes and loopy situations, the movie
does have a solid fix on the shallowness of high school popularity.
At school, ``rufus'' becomes the coolest of words to say only
because one of the most popular kids deems it worthy. (``Spread the
word,'' he exclaims, rufus is cool).
</P>
<P>
   Barrymore does make a go of all this. Ultimately she has about
five roles going on: Josie as gross-out high schooler all wired up
in braces from earlier days; Josie as reserved, permanently pressed
modern-day copy editor; Josie as girlish, insecure, cool-kid
wannabe returning to school; Josie as potential prom queen; and
Josie as the end-of-reel, wiser woman waiting and wishing and
hoping the new love of her life will at last bestow the smooch
she's always wanted.
</P>
<P>
   While not always believable, Barrymore is at least charming. And
she gets plenty of solid support from David Arquette (``Scream's''
jim-dandy Deputy Dewey). He plays her brother Rob, a grown-up
slacker stuck in a dead-end job requiring that he dress like a
dime-store Tahitian.
</P>
<P>
   Rob also sneaks back into school, and that's a blessing. He has
all the good lines _ all two of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never
</P>
<P>
   Been Kissed''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore and David Arquette. Directed by Raja
Gosnell. Rated PG-13 for language, drug use and sexual references.
1 hour, 47 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Class dismissed.

   This farce about a mobster (Robert De Niro) who takes his issues

talk code emanating from five brilliant babes. Sly _ the toddler

chock full of stupid pint-sized tricks from the brain of Bob Clark.
At first, ``Geniuses'' is dumb, and then it just gets dumber. (Bob

</P>
<P>
   You can go see this movie intent on divining all sorts of hidden
messages in its tale of abject poverty, scary authority figures and
other aspects of Iranian life. But then you'd miss seeing a
simpler, much more delightful story about two little kids and their
quest for one pair of shoes. The ending is by turns touching,
heartbreaking and hilarious. (Jill Vejnoska) 1 hour, 27 minutes. B

   This Southern gothic shaggy-dog story goes down as sweet and
smooth as a double shot of Jack Black. Glenn Close, Julianne Moore,
Charles S. Dutton, Liv Tyler, Chris O'Donnell, Ned Beatty and Lyle
Lovett are among those involved in the unexpected death of a gently
demented Mississippi widow (Patricia Neal.) A mellow Robert Altman
directs this magnolia-scented whimsy with affection and compassion.

   Last decade's ``Dangerous Liaisons'' gets a makeover with Sarah
Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as a couple of desultorily rich
teens manipulating the romantic lives of everyone around them,
purely for their own amusement and without a whit of concern about
who may be hurt in the process. It's practically guaranteed to be a
runaway hit with the teen audience. (Jill Vejnoska) 1 hour, 37

   Like the Nickelodeon series on which it's based, this movie's
appeal is centered in the carefully nurtured normalcy of its title
character, Doug Funnie, a nice kid coping with some typical preteen
passions. The gently anarchic, pro-environment plot is simply a
framework to dispense the quiet main-street morals and vivid
comic-book colors that make the wholesome Doug a superstar with
children. (Tom Sabulis) 1 hour, 17 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``EDtv'' PG-13 (profanity, partial nudity, sex-related
situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew McConaughey,
</P>
<P>
   Jenna Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey plays the subject of a 24-hour-a-day
documentary in Ron Howard's new comedy. Yeah, it's too much like
``Truman Show'' for its own good, but the slick packaging and
strong cast (including Jenna Elfman, Ellen DeGeneres and Martin
Landau) help it stand on its own. (SM) 2 hours, 3 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears' documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996
storm that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon
Krakauer's best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces of Nature'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Ben Affleck.
</P>
<P>
   Opposites attract as strait-laced Ben Affleck heads to his
wedding with free-spirit Sandra Bullock. Like ``My Best Friend's
Wedding,'' it's a savvy blend of romantic-comedy formula and wise
'90s updates. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Go'' R (drug content, sexuality, profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sarah Polley,
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wolf, Katie Holmes,
</P>
<P>
   Jay Mohr.
</P>
<P>
   A three-part comedy-drama unfolding on a single Christmas Eve,
it has the energetic, late-night delirium of a Chinese fire drill.
You could think of it as a movie built on ``X's.'' We get Xmas,
exhilaration, exhaustion, excitement and the drug called ecstasy,
better known as X. It's a bright, shining package. And though it
turns out to be pretty empty, you can't help admiring how cleverly
it's wrapped. (SM) 1 hour, 42 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' Not rated, but includes sexual themes and
brief nudity
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen
</P>
<P>
   and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant re-imagining of the final days of gay British
director James Whale. Whale, best known for his classic horror
movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died mysteriously in 1957.
Played here by the marvelous Ian McKellen, he's an isolated,
forgotten recluse who becomes interested in the hunky new gardener
(Brendan Fraser). (ERG) 1 hour, 35 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The King and I'' G
</P>
<P>
   Voiced by Miranda Richardson
</P>
<P>
   and Martin Vidnovic.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first animated feature based on a work by Rodgers
and Hammerstein, but does this second-rate animated King of Siam
really need to high-five the paw of his pet black leopard? This
king has a hot-air balloon to fly around in and to swoop into
action when somebody's about to drown. Kids will probably be
charmed. For everybody else, it's a puzzlement. (Bob Longino) 1
hour and 26 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   Three Oscars, including best actor. An Italian Jew shields his
son from the horrors of a concentration camp by pretending their
predicament is part of a big, complicated game. Roberto Benigni's
low-comedy slapstick approach isn't entirely convincing and is
often chillingly wrongheaded. Subtitles. (ERG) 2 hours, 2 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' R (violence and
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Moran and Jason Flemyng.
</P>
<P>
   Smokin'. This whip-smart lark is an English caper comedy
glistening with confidence and a wicked sense of humor. Four
likable, conniving East End lads have a week to settle the debt
they owe a hood named Hatchet Harry. Rookie writer/director Guy
Ritchie piles on the characters, plot twists and violence, but one
thing is clear: everyone involved had a fine time making this
movie. You'll have fun watching it. (ERG) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' R (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves,
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Fishburne,
</P>
<P>
   Carrie-Anne Moss.
</P>
<P>
   A knockout sci-fi flick. Writer-directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski bring their sharp storytelling and visual showmanship to
an adventure starring Keanu Reeves that should please both comic
book fanatics and mainstream moviegoers. Balancing intelligence
with stunning special effects and action, it's a movie that earns
its explosions, high kicks and cascades of spent bullets. (SM) 2
hours, 15 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mod Squad'' R (profanity, violence, nudity, sexual
situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Claire Danes,
</P>
<P>
   Omar Epps, Giovanni Ribisi.
</P>
<P>
   It's the look that matters. Not the plot involving drugs,
murder, good guys turned bad and a car wash. This ``Mod Squad'' _
with Claire Danes, Omar Epps and an occasionally inspired Giovanni
Ribisi _ is a fashion layout for ``Details'' magazine. All image.
All blurry visuals. All reds and blacks. All jazz riffs and retro
TV music with plenty of bongo drums and brass. (Bob Longino) 1 hour
and 34 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Never Been Kissed'' PG-13 (profanity, drug use, sexual
references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore
</P>
<P>
   and David Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore is Josie Geller, a mid-20s newspaper copy editor
and former high school dweeb (``Josie Grossie,'' they called her)
who goes back to teenville as an undercover reporter, promptly
relives high school hell and pretty much bumbles her way to
popularity. Everything about her career is implausible. The movie's
jokes are lame, its situations loopy. But Barrymore does make a go
of it. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 47 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' PG (profanity, sensuality, alcohol use, some
thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jake Gyllenhaal,
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cooper and Laura Dern.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teen Homer (Jake
Gyllenhaal) and three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and
shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of
their small town. Based on Homer Hickam's autobiography ``Rocket
Boys,'' it makes the process of learning seem as exciting as a
special FX-driven action flick. (SM) 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Out-of-Towners'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin,
</P>
<P>
   Goldie Hawn and John Cleese.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mess from the start. Henry (Steve Martin) and Nancy Clark
(Goldie Hawn) are a long-married couple from Ohio trying to
redefine their lives now that the children are grown. They land in
New York and high jinks ensue. The only time the film hints at the
madcap success it could be is when John Cleese appears as the
secretly cross-dressing hotel manager.
</P>
<P>
   (Drew Jubera) 1 hour, 31 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rage: Carrie 2'' R (violence, gore, sexuality, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Bergl
</P>
<P>
   and Amy Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Bergl plays a misunderstood, telekinetic teenager in this
cheap, dull horror flick. The sort-of sequel is so bad, you might
mistake it for self-parody. Amy Irving also stars as the first
film's survivor, but skulks through her scenes looking like she's
ready to kill her agent. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The School of Flesh'' R (profanity and strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Isabel Huppert and
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   A smart, cool-hot drama of sexual obsession. Isabel Huppert, the
grand sphinx of French cinema, plays Dominique, a wealthy, single
Parisian whose life changes when she steps into a bar one night and
locks eyes with a hustler. It is smartly edited, trusting us to
keep up with it, never delivering a scene that feels contrived. In
French with subtitles. (SM) 1 hour and 41 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Oscars, including best picture. Poor, overworked Will
Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish his play ``Romeo and
Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win the hand of
noblewoman Viola
</P>
<P>
   (Gwyneth Paltrow, who received an Oscar for best actress) in
this witty comedy that uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot
devices. (SM) 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Tango'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Miguel Angel Sola,
</P>
<P>
   Mia Maestro.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Angel Sola plays Mario, a Buenos Aires
filmmaker-choreography shooting the definitive film about the
tango. As he falls for young dancer Elena (Mia Maestro), we wait
for inevitable retribution from her gangster lover. The plot is
almost secondary to the self-conscious but gorgeous theatricality
of the film's design, the steamy elegance of its dance numbers.
Subtitles. (SM) 1 hour and 55 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``10 Things I Hate About You'' PG-13 (sex-related dialogue,
alcohol/drug-related scenes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Stiles,
</P>
<P>
   Heath Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   What starts out as a terrible teen version of ``The Taming of
the Shrew'' unexpectedly starts to percolate with wit and charm,
thanks largely to its Kate-and-Petruchio stand-ins, Kat (Julia
Stiles) and Patrick (Heath Ledger). The script can't go too far
wrong with Shakespeare's plot. (It's worked for 400 years.)
References to the original verge on precious. But the film also has
a few nutty touches of its own. (SM) 1 hour, 34 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)
40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``True Crime'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clint Eastwood
</P>
<P>
   and James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Producer-director-star Clint Eastwood plays a hard-boiled
newspaper reporter trying to prove a death-row inmate's innocence.
It's so full of
</P>
<P>
   cliches, you'd think it was a self-parody. (SM) 2 hours, 7
minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``A Walk on the Moon'' R (sexual situations and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Diane Lane,
</P>
<P>
   Liev Schreiber, Viggo Mortensen.
</P>
<P>
   The movie starts as a fondly observed look at upstate New York's
Jewish family resorts. But when housewife Pearl (Diane Lane) gets
an itch once her husband goes back to the city, her actions seem
both dumb and selfish. By the time she's making picturesque whoopee
under a waterfall with her lover, the movie has veered from
well-observed 1960s character study into silly soap opera. (SM) 1
hour, 46 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Phil Kloer) 41 minutes. B-

   Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray, Bob Longino, Jill
Vejnoska, Drew Jubera, Tom Sabulis and Phil Kloer writes for the

DISTRACTING DETOURS IN THE HUNT FOR A FINAL EXIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though David Guterson's new novel ``East of the Mountains'' is
set in an area of Washington state not far from the backdrop of his
1994 best seller ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' the two books could
not be more different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cedars'' conjured up in vivid detail a small Puget Sound
community ractured by racial prejudice and historical hurts. It was
a rich, suspenseful novel that turned the murder trial of a
Japanese-American fisherman into both a courtroom drama and a
beautifully nuanced examination of public and private memory and
the wages of resentment and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``East of the Mountains,'' in contrast, is a much smaller, more
claustrophobic book. Instead of a community of neighbors and
acquaintances linked by grievances and affection, it gives us one
man: a loner, cut off from family and friends and isolated by his
skeptical intelligence. Instead of the vast vistas of history that
haunt the individuals in ``Cedars,'' it portrays one man's tortured
efforts to come to terms with illness and mortality.
</P>
<P>
   In structure and concept ``Mountains'' is a sort of dry, prose
version of Ingmar Bergman's ``Wild Strawberries'' minus the
haunting, surreal imagery and minus the masterly cinematic
manipulation of time and mood. As in ``Wild Strawberries'' we are
introduced to a crotchety old man reliving his past during a long
journey. As in ``Wild Strawberries'' we are supposed to piece
together a portrait of this man through his dreams, memories and
encounters with assorted strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The old man in this case is Ben Givens, a retired heart surgeon
and recent widower who has colon cancer. Ben, we learn in the
opening pages, has decided to commit suicide: he does not want to
suffer the pain and debilitation he knows will accompany his
cancer, and he has decided to go off on a long hunting trip and
shoot himself. Only his doctor, Ben thinks, will suspect the truth,
and he will spare Ben's family from such suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   As depicted by Guterson, Ben's momentous decision never feels
particularly convincing. We never understand why his daughter and
grandchildren are not incentives to go on living, nor do we
understand why Ben does not elect the option of ``palliative
surgery'' that might ease his pain. Instead, we are supposed to
believe that Ben, a renowned physician, believes it is ``better to
avoid pain than engage it,'' ``better to end his life swiftly,
cleanly, and to accept that there would be no thwarting the
onslaught of this disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben loads up his car with his hunting gear and his two hunting
dogs and sets off on the long drive east from Seattle to the
Columbia Basin, the apple-growing region where he grew up. His
carefully laid plans soon go awry, however, when his car skids off
the road in a rainstorm and crashes into a tree. Ben, slightly
injured, is rescued by a young couple who remind him of his
youthful love for his late wife, Rachel.
</P>
<P>
   Ben's efforts to get his suicide mission back on track soon lead
to a further series of picaresque adventures. He meets a drifter
who gives him some marijuana cigarettes. He hikes across some
desert country and goes on one last hunt. He has an unpleasant
run-in with a coyote hunter, whose wolfhounds kill one of his dogs
and maim the other. He hikes on through the desert to get his
injured dog to a veterinarian. He hops a bus and meets an illegal
Mexican alien in need of medical attention. He spends a night in an
apple pickers' camp, where he helps deliver a baby.
</P>
<P>
   There is something hokey and schematic about these encounters:
Ben's exchanges with the strangers he meets have a cliched quality.
The young lovers who help him after the car accident say things
like ``We're soul mates,'' ``We're forever.'' The vet who saves his
dog notes that one is ``better old than dead'' and a girl who helps
Ben help the ailing illegal alien pronounces him ``Un angel de
Dios.'' Unlike the carefully observed characters in ``Cedars,''
these people feel like cardboardy mouthpieces for Guterson, each a
cipher whose role is simply to telegraph messages to Ben that he
should rethink his suicide plans.
</P>
<P>
   The flashbacks triggered by these encounters are somewhat more
persuasive. Although Ben's memories of hunting with his father
sometimes feel like ersatz Hemingway, Guterson does an admirable
job of evoking the harsh, physical world of Ben's youth, the
arduous and gratifying work of farming and the unforgiving beauty
of the Columbia Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Ben's memories of fighting in World War II, reminiscent of
similar passages in ``Cedars,'' are by far the most powerful
portions of this novel. The rigors of military training, the shock
and horror of being under fire, the spectacle of seeing his best
friend being brought back from the dead by an army surgeon: such
scenes are visceral, uncompromising and harrowing, and they remind
us what this talented writer can do when he isn't coasting along on
automatic pilot.

`BLOOD, GUTS, ... OCTANE': DON'T BUY A USED CAR FROM EITHER OF
THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Carnahan's maniacally frenzied little film, ``Blood, Guts,
Bullets and Octane'' is set in the desert wasteland around Needles,
Calif., where Sid ( Carnahan) and his partner Bob (Dan Leis), two
motor-mouthed used-car salesmen, are desperately trying to keep
their failing business afloat. Just when they are about to throw in
the towel, their sleazy broker hands them an opportunity to make
$250,000 simply by letting a 1963 Pontiac LeMans sit in their lot
for 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   There's a deadly catch, of course. The car, which has been on a
long intercontinental journey, will be under constant surveillance
by gunslingers who have left a trail of carnage behind them, and
the vehicle is wired to explode should anyone attempt to open the
trunk. No sooner has a deal been struck than Sid hatches the notion
of stealing the Pontiac and holding it for $500,000 ransom.
Meanwhile, the FBI is hard on the trail of the car and its owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane'' runs on the movie equivalent
of fake adrenaline. The story is continually interrupted and kicked
into high gear by the flash of sardonic chapter titles and the kind
of sonic blasts that punctuate items on tabloid news shows. Between
chapter titles, the characters yammer at each other in dialogue
that feels semi-improvised, and people get shot. Although the pair
succeed in taking the hot car to a repair shop, where blood is
discovered leaking from the bottom of the trunk, they don't get
much farther than that. The grainy, jittery cinematography and flat
deadpan performances give this preposterous scenario a patina of
realism.
</P>
<P>
   The movie aspires to be a David Mamet-like slice of lowlife in
the American wasteland with added Quentin Tarantino-like
muscle-flexing and dripping gore. Desperate, lying used car
salesmen out for a big score; deadly macho games of gun-waving;
suitcases stuffed with drugs and cash; absent women: do I hear a
metaphor? It's all grindingly familiar and has been done by others
with far more style and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian). It includes profanity and scenes of violence.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the world according to Guare _ John Guare, that is
_ the more things change, the more they, well,  &UR; don't &LR;  change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person I was 40 years ago, I am still today,'' says the
61-year-old playwright, best known for ``The House of Blue Leaves''
(1971), ``Landscape of the Body'' (1977) and ``Six Degrees of
Separation'' (1990).
</P>
<P>
   Guare's latest play, ``Lake Hollywood,'' is now in previews and
opens April 29, presented by the Signature Theater Company, the
group that dedicates each season to the work of one major American
playwright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the same artist with the same nagging questions I had in
my early 20's,'' Guare said. ``What's real and what isn't? How do
we tell what's real in our lives? How do we see things as they are?
What is my role in life?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any writer deals with those questions,'' he continued. ``If
the Signature hadn't forced the issue by devoting its season to my
plays, I could at least believe I had  &UR; changed &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   As is his habit, Guare spoke about his many plays in jest and at
the same time with deadpan conviction. ``Really, they're all the
same!'' he exclaimed. ``What is `Six Degrees of Separation' but
`The House of Blue Leaves' with money?''
</P>
<P>
   While ``The House of Blue Leaves'' focuses on a third-rate
songwriter, and ``Six Degrees of Separation'' involves a
first-class art dealer, these plays (like ``Landscape of the
Body'') are comedies that reveal the desperate flights of fancy the
characters engage in to escape the ugliness of their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   If Guare believes that his plays repeat a refrain of existential
obsession, it is fitting that the final one in the Signature's
eighth season is a world premiere of a work that its author began
39 years ago. What is more, the very theme of ``Lake Hollywood''
is, in its author's words, ``the myth that our lives really change
that much at all.'' In this play, the unanswered questions from
decades ago bob up as the unanswered questions of today.
</P>
<P>
   James Houghton, the artistic director of the Signature, both
agrees and disagrees with the author's self-assessment. ``We chose
John's work this year for its common thread, its timelessness,''
Houghton said. ``In every Guare play, even if not realistic, there
is the nuance and heartbreak of everyday life. But we make a point
of not doing a playwright's greatest hits, and this year you could
see some real different styles in John's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He crosses into every territory: realism, surrealism,
naturalism, and doesn't sit in any particular time or style.
Emotions change on a turn; one moment you're laughing and then
you're in complete heartache. John reveals a wildly vivid
imagination and insight into the struggle each of us has to make a
difference and feel we belong. All his plays deal with the need for
us to matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 1973 ``Marco Polo Sings a Solo,'' the first
production in the Signature's season, is an absurdist romp that
switches locales between icebergs and outer space. The second play,
the 1979 ``Bosoms and Neglect,'' is a satire of psychoanalysis
wrapped around an enigmatic mother-son relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to close the season with a new work, though, to put
the playwright's career in context,'' Houghton said. ``This time,
we were just lucky that all the seeds of John's earlier work are in
`Lake Hollywood.'''
</P>
<P>
   The play's title refers to the New Hampshire setting of the
first act, in which a young woman named Agnes brings a young man
named Andrew home to meet her eccentric family. (An uncle has
renamed the local lake Hollywood after renting a cabin to Spencer
Tracy.) The second act jumps 50 years, to the couple's bittersweet
old age in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cast, co-directed by Douglas Hughes and Itamar Kubovy,
includes Kate Burton and Adam Grupper as the young Agnes and Andrew
and Ralph Waite and Betty Miller as the couple a half century
later.
</P>
<P>
   The play began as a fragment of a two-character scene that the
author staged as a student at Yale in 1961. ``It was a shred, a
tiny clam of a play called `Something I'll Tell You Tuesday,' which
has now become the second act of `Lake Hollywood,''' Guare said.
``When I went back and looked at it, I was amazed. Here I was, 22,
and writing about old people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Hollywood'' also contains, along with almost entirely
brand new material, what Guare calls ``permutations'' of the first
of his plays produced in New York, the 1965 ``To Wally Pantoni, We
Leave a Credenza.'' (A common denominator of the first and second
acts of ``Lake Hollywood'' is a credenza.)
</P>
<P>
   Over a recent lunch on Theater Row, Guare chronicled the unusual
history of his latest work. In preparing an anthology of his plays
for publication, he looked for ``Something I'll Tell You Tuesday''
(which was presented at the Caffe Cino in Greenwich Village in
1966) but could not find it. When he finally unearthed a copy, he
said, he discovered that the play seemed to have a lot of juice in
it. ``So I thought, Well, I've written the end of a life here, but
these people had beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a rough draft of a first act, and kept thinking about
the characters while working on other projects. He intended to
complete the play for the Signature's 10th season in 2000-01, when
Houghton plans to produce world premieres by most of the
playwrights whose works he has presented in past seasons (a list
that includes Sam Shepard, Edward Albee and Adrienne Kennedy).
</P>
<P>
   But Guare decided to finish ``Lake Hollywood,'' he said, when
``what we were going to do became financially cuckoo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to close this year with the entire `Lydie Breeze'
cycle,'' he said, a trilogy of plays about an American family set
between the Civil War and the beginning of the 20th century that
Guare began in 1982. ``Too much. So, one day last December we were
working on `Lydie Breeze,' and the next I was getting `Lake
Hollywood' ready for production.'' Revising furiously, Guare said,
he rewrote every page.
</P>
<P>
   With a head of thick snowy hair and blue-green eyes behind his
glasses, Guare looks and speaks like the professor he has been _
teaching playwriting at both Harvard and Yale. He is currently
involved in the writing program for young playwrights at the
Juilliard School.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as `How to Write a Play,''' he said.
``Too many of my students do ventriloquist acts: they give me their
version of Mamet, of Pinter, of Beckett, and think they've written
a play. So you have to encourage the author to find his or her
voice. That's why I could go back to this play I wrote as a
student, write the first act 40 years later, and it's the same
voice!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy for me to go into my past; the artifacts are all
the same,'' he said. ``How little my life has changed. I've lived
at the same address for 30 years. Adele and I have been happily
married for 25.'' His wife, Adele Chatfield-Taylor, an authority on
historic preservation and urban design, is the president of the
American Academy in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The real-life event that inspired ``Lake Hollywood'' happened to
the author's parents before he was born. ``Something terrible
occurred when my mother brought my father back to meet her family
in New Hampshire,'' Guare said. ``I had heard about it as a child,
but we never spoke about it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Guare is coy about revealing the actual event, he admits
that, like the character Agnes, his mother insisted on immersing
herself in water every year on Aug. 15, the Feast of the
Assumption. Within surrealistic episodes that interrupt the play's
action, Agnes is pursued by a mysterious figure, and Lake Hollywood
seems to hold the promise that the water can cleanse her psychic
terror. But when pressed for details, Guare said only, ``Other
people's nightmares can become your autobiography.''
</P>
<P>
   John Guare was an only child, ``100 percent Irish Catholic,'' he
said, brought up in Jackson Heights, Queens. At age 11, when the
local paper ran a photograph of him as the author of three plays
performed in a neighbor's garage, his parents bought him a
typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father worked on Wall Street and hated it,'' Guare
recounted. ``He said: `Never get a job. Be a writer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Guare attended Georgetown University and the Yale School of
Drama, graduating in 1962. In addition to his plays, he also wrote
the book and lyrics for a musical adaptation of ``Two Gentlemen of
Verona'' in 1971 and the Oscar-nominated screenplay for Louis
Malle's 1980 ``Atlantic City.''
</P>
<P>
   One constant in his plays is an intricate plot that is never
constrained by the logic of realism. ``Naturalism kills; it's
deadly to the theater,'' Guare said. ``I remember the revelation
when, as a boy, I read Thornton Wilder's `Our Town.' The Stage
Manager says: `See that boy. He will be killed in the war.' And
there's no boy onstage, of course. So I realized you are not bound
by four walls. That simple, direct address across the stage creates
a whole life and death for an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Guare calls Wilder an enormous influence, as he makes plain in
his introduction to the first volume of ``The Collected Short Plays
of Thornton Wilder,'' published in 1997 by the Theater
Communications Group. Both playwrights create strange, sometimes
troubled worlds populated by characters with unflagging optimism.
``In every one of my plays,'' Guare said, ``there is that feeling
of, `If I could only show you who I really am, you would love me
totally.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This theme is revealed in the only strictly autobiographical
event in any of Guare's plays. In ``The House of Blue Leaves,'' a
boy performs a frantic, improvised audition for his uncle, who has
arrived from Hollywood. The uncle turns to the parents and says,
``You never told me you had a mentally retarded child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that happened to me,'' Guare said with a smile. ``And
that's what all my plays are about, that child in all of us who
cries: `Pick me! Pick me!' Which is why I keep writing for the
theater. The audition never ends.''

DAVID HARE: A PLAYWRIGHT REPORTS IN PERSON

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You might not fully appreciate it when it happens,
but the most memorable and gutsy moment of this theatrical season
to date is when David Hare, a slim, trim, unassuming figure in his
50s, wearing gray slacks and an open-neck shirt, steps onto the
stage of the Booth Theater to begin his performance playing David
Hare in his own ``Via Dolorosa.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hare, the British playwright? Yes, and not only that, but
a playwright making his debut as a professional actor.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about the man American audiences have long
identified with such polemical works as ``Plenty,'' ``Racing
Demon'' and ``Skylight.'' He is a writer of such an imposing,
rather chilly reputation for dismembering British society and its
institutions that when his bitter sex comedy, ``The Blue Room,''
opened on Broadway earlier this season, many critics regarded it as
an aberration. This is the same fellow exactly, though you have
never really seen him until now, nor have you heard his voice with
such clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing Hare has done before prepares you for ``Via Dolorosa''
and its discoveries, including the demonstrated fact that he can be
such seriously invigorating company. But, then, there are no exact
precedents for what he is doing here.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Via Dolorosa,'' the playwright comes out from behind the
characters through whom he has been talking all these years to
confront audiences as himself. For the moment, he has abandoned
what he calls ``the conventions of the theater of fiction,'' at
least to the extent that such conventions can be abandoned in any
structured theatrical presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Via Dolorosa'' is no ordinary 90-minute one-man show, a
stand-up performance of prepared ad-libs and well-rehearsed riffs
designed to persuade audiences that, after all, life's horrors and
funninesses are no different from those in any sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, ``Via Dolorosa'' is the playwright's carefully
considered report on his reactions following several trips to
Israel and the West Bank to gather material for a play. Apparently,
this sort of journalistic research has often been a part of his
mode of operation, whether taking aim at the Church of England
(``Racing Demon'') or British law (``Murmuring Judges''). It has
also sometimes given his plays a schematic tone that can subtly
sabotage their dramatic effect as well as the questions he wants
the plays to raise.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Via Dolorosa,'' however, he came to feel that
the subject was beyond any treatment as theater of fiction, the
reality being too blunt, the stakes too large and the likely
outcome too grim. Throughout ``Via Dolorosa'' there are frequent
asides in which the adequacy of fiction is questioned, and this
from one of the London theater's most successful practitioners of
the art.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he goes through Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum
in Jerusalem, where he is moved by its ``simplicity,'' its ``bleak
photographic record'' and especially by the text of a speech in
which Himmler ``congratulates his men on the discipline they have
shown in exerting what he calls their `moral right' to exterminate
the Jews.'' Hare finds that the only false notes are struck by the
museum's sculptures and paintings, which he describes as
``superfluous'' and ``inadequate.'' ``What is a painting, a
painting of a starving man? What is a painting of a corpse? It's
the facts we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Having decided that this material could only be handled as
reportage, Hare has written a piece that, in a modest, moving way,
illuminates not only the Israeli-Arab conflict but also some of the
other confrontations that keep the world on bloody edge. It is not
necessarily the facts that are persuasive, though he does seem to
have done his homework, but the skeptical if always humane point of
view Hare brings to a complex situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Via Dolorosa'' is, of course, fiction in that Hare has shaped
his material for theatrical effect. We are not seeing what he saw
at the moment he saw it. Instead, it is a very particular
recollection, written by a gifted playwright attempting to give
theatrical fiction a new dimension of reality, one unencumbered by
the usual make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   He, himself, stands at the center, the reporter and narrator.
Here is the playwright undisguised, a man of Christian background,
from a land where passions are mingy, voyaging through a part of
the world where passions are the stuff of life. Or, as one Israeli
friend tells him, in any single day the Israeli experiences events
and emotions ``that would keep a Swede going for a year.'' Hare is
the outsider idealized, sometimes ignorant and naive, but always
curious and reactive. More important, he functions as if he were
our conscience, which at any single moment is both safely aloof and
profoundly implicated.
</P>
<P>
   The result is this fascinating production by the Royal Court
Theater of London, being presented in New York by Lincoln Center
Theater. As directed by Stephen Daldry, ``Via Dolorosa'' has such
an astonishing abundance of stories, characters and ideas that,
when you leave the theater, you feel as if you had lived through
some kind of crazy, continuing epic.
</P>
<P>
   At one point and another, ``Via Dolorosa'' has something to
offend just about everybody. Hare is dismayed by the religious Jew
who, since the Six-Day War in 1967, has come to see the Bible ``not
as a historical story but as an operations manual''; by the
corruption within the Arafat leadership; by the constant harping on
the holiness of places by both sides. At the same time, he is
amused by the sight of busloads of ``American evangelicals'' in
Jerusalem, ``searching vainly in an old Arab city for any remaining
evidence of Our Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is there not more?'' they ask. To which he responds:
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I share their bewilderment. After all,
Christianity's a well-known religion and I'd say influential in its
day. You'd think it was still worth a pilgrimage, but in this town
we come a sporting third.''
</P>
<P>
   He notes that the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which contains
the stone where Christ is said to have been crucified, is ``shared
unhappily,'' with 70 percent going to the Greek Orthodox and the
rest ``doled out higgledy-piggledy between the Armenian Christians,
the Coptic Christians, the Latins, the Syrians and the
Ethiopians.''
</P>
<P>
   His comment: ``A people divided by a common religion. Sects and
the single Church.''
</P>
<P>
   The playwright's dominant theme: ``Stones or ideas? Stones or
ideas?'' After all, he adds, ``Does the literal truth matter?''
That is, when someone kisses the stone in the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher, isn't he kissing an idea?
</P>
<P>
   As an actor, Hare is an excellent student. He plays the
character with enthusiasm, though not with the kind of professional
smoothness that might separate him from his own material. He is a
non-pro, and that is in his favor. Though there is a gentle
awkwardness about the performance, it appears to italicize the
dramatic effectiveness of the array of characters he recalls with
such vivid exactitude.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: Eran Baniel, the Israeli theater director who made
his name with a startling and somewhat abbreviated co-production of
``Romeo and Juliet,'' in which the Capulets were played by
Palestinians and the Montagues by Jews; Danny and Sarah Weiss, who
are making their contribution by living in a ``disputed''
territory, an Israeli community in Hebron, where 521 Jewish
militants live in middle-class comfort, protected by 4,000 Israeli
troops; Benni Begin, son of the former prime minister, who has
become the articulate, intellectually commanding spokesman for the
settlers.
</P>
<P>
   There is also Haider Abdel Shafi, the popular 70-year-old Gaza
politician who resigned from the Palestinian legislative body to
protest the corruption within the Arafat regime. To Hare's
consternation, Shafi agrees to see him under the impression that he
is David Hirst, a correspondent for The Guardian. Comments Hare:
``A man who knows nothing is now about to interview a man who
thinks he is someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The stage is crowded with figures large and small, passionate
and disaffected, gloomy and scarily self-assured. Like a seasoned
journalist, Hare knows not only how to listen, but also how to
persuade his subjects to express themselves far more freely than
they might otherwise. His language is clean, spare, sometimes blunt
and, on occasion, unaffectedly poetic. He does not presume to offer
solutions; Hare is a playwright, not a politician. His not immodest
concerns: thought, mind, the fate of what has loosely been called
the civilized world.
</P>
<P>
   Daldry and his associates, including Ian MacNeil, who designed
the spectacular set for the Daldry revival of ``An Inspector
Calls'' seen here in 1994, make sure that the physical production
of ``Via Dolorosa'' never gets in the way of the material or its
narrator. There is one extremely theatrical moment, a scenic
effect, that appears near the end as a kind of vision of peace. It
lasts no longer than a slow blink of the eye, and it is all that is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Via Dolorosa'' is an experience of most uncommon
theatricality.
</P>
<P>
   `Closer'
</P>
<P>
   The production of Patrick Marber's ``Closer,'' directed by the
playwright and now at the Music Box, would seem to be a faithful
approximation of his initial London staging of the work in 1997. A
hit at the Royal National Theater, ``Closer'' later successfully
transferred to the West End.
</P>
<P>
   I say ``would seem'' because though I went to see it at the
Lyttelton Theater in the National, I endured only one act before
making an exit. Because I wasn't able to give it a fair test, I
made no attempt to write about it at the time. I had seen it on my
first evening in London after having been swept away by a matinee
performance of ``The Invention of Love,'' Tom Stoppard's splendidly
witty meditation on the sad life of A.E. Housman.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't only jet lag that forced me out of the theater. It was
a creeping suspicion that Marber's brittle, brutal comedy about the
emptiness of love and sex in our numb times was saying nothing that
hasn't been explored to greater effect by other people. That
suspicion has now been certified (to my own satisfaction anyway) by
a visit to the Music Box, where the four members of its dream cast
are playing ``Closer'' with such intensity and conviction you can
believe that they believe in it.
</P>
<P>
   The play is an exhaustingly hip, pore-tight close-up of the
tangled romantic lives of four gabby, singularly dim people: Anna
(Natasha Richardson), a successful London photographer bewitched by
the surfaces of things; Larry (Ciaran Hinds), a dermatologist; Dan
(Rupert Graves), an unsuccessful novelist who writes obituaries for
a living, and Alice (Anna Friel), a waif who works as a stripper
and talks tough but, inside, is mint jelly longing for a lamb chop.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of 2 acts and 12 scenes that span 4 years, Anna
and Alice, who are the passive-aggressive victims, each fall into,
out of and back into terrible relationships with both Dan and
Larry. Each of the men is a sex-obsessed beast who whines a lot
while nattering on about love.
</P>
<P>
   As he demonstrated in his first dark but far less trendy play, a
melodrama titled ``Dealer's Choice,'' Marber can write funny,
perceptive, character-defining dialogue. In ``Closer'' you get the
feeling that almost any line might sound equally valid issuing from
at least one of the other characters. There is also some mildly
amusing throw-away dialogue and a cyberspace seduction scene that,
in the manner of patches that turn up throughout the rest of the
play, holds the attention while it is going on, without being
believable for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   If aggressively dirty talk doesn't reduce you to helpless
rapture, the principal reason to see ``Closer'' is to watch two
expert performers do the impossible. The enchanting Ms. Richardson
gives urgency and cohesion to a character that has the substance of
a smoke ring. As the lost Alice, Ms. Friel recalls those completely
improbable but seductive young women drifters once so popular in
French films when played by Miou-Miou and her spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the graphic descriptions of offstage sex and whether
or not it was good, and in spite of the dreary consequences,
``Closer'' is far too sentimental to be effective even as a
cautionary fable.

   If that's Michael Moore coming at you, beware. Once the man gets
his prey in his lens, there's no shaking him off. As confirmed by
``The Awful Truth,'' his new series of half-hour agitations, he is
insistent, persistent and far beyond embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   If you try to hold a reasoned conversation with him, you become
a foil for rude, crude questions delivered with a straight face and
malice aforethought. (``Henry Hyde is an adulterer, right?'') If
you try to sneak away, his camera lingers, a weapon of humiliation.
If you dare outright combat, you're just asking for it.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday night's opener of what promises to be an engagingly
discourteous set of confrontations, Moore, representing himself as
a one-man People's Democratic Republic of Television (PDRTV),
stages encounters with Kenneth Starr and like-minded pursuers of
sinners and with a big health-management company, whose policies
Moore finds lethal.
</P>
<P>
   So there is Moore (you may recognize him from ``TV Nation'' by
his baseball cap and sneakers) leading an amusingly outfitted coven
of Bible-waving Puritans chasing impeachment-prone legislators.
It's billed as a Washington witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   As the Moore congregation cries ``Repent! Repent!,'' their
leader inquires of Rep. Asa Hutchinson, ``Are you a fornicator?''
It takes a moment for Hutchinson to determine that Moore is not Jim
Lehrer before he hastens out of camera range. Representative Bob
Barr actually gets into an unedifying exchange about an episode in
his career involving sex and whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   In the second segment, Moore torments a public relations
executive for Humana, an HMO, with an invitation to the funeral of
a Florida man who expects to die soon because the company has
declined to pay for his needed pancreas transplant. It's not for me
to give away Humana's response, but this time out Moore's satire is
directed, perhaps inadvertently, not just at the easy target of an
HMO, but also at television's habit, indulged in by Moore himself,
of using a heart-stirring story about one sad case to influence
decisions about money and health for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least he does it in a satisfyingly outrageous way.
Among the promised targets as ``The Awful Truth'' proceeds: an
antihomosexual minister, tobacco lobbyists and the United Parcel
Service. In a more benign mood, Moore will also endeavor to give
Bill Gates a housewarming gift of Martha Stewart sheets and to come
up with a date for Hillary Rodham Clinton.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lauren Flanigan, the workaholic American soprano, is
40, feisty and, best of all if you are interviewing her, blunt. Her
career has been one of the most dynamic, unpredictable and
tumultuous of the last decade. She has wowed audiences from San
Francisco, where she was born to a working-class Irish-American
family with leftist leanings, to Milan, Italy, where in recent
seasons at La Scala she won frenzied ovations for her vocally
intense, dramatically riveting performances in Verdi's ``Macbeth''
and ``Nabucco'' and earned critical comparisons to Callas.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Flanigan has yet to join the top rank of singers in
terms of visibility, recording opportunities and clout. And she has
had an inexplicably shaky relationship with the Metropolitan Opera,
which should be a natural home for a singer with her kind of
temperament and vocal charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Why has she struggled?
</P>
<P>
   During a break from rehearsals for Strauss' seldom-heard
``Intermezzo'' at the New York City Opera, which is being mounted
for her and opens on Thursday, she seemed eager to talk about her
wide-ranging repertory, the tyrannical conductors she has worked
with, Richard Strauss' marital woes and anything else that came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest frustration is that the opera business does not
take nonmainstream opera seriously,'' said Ms. Flanigan, who has
been drawn to risky contemporary fare, like Marvin David Levy's
gripping ``Mourning Becomes Electra,'' which she sang with the
Lyric Opera of Chicago last fall, and Hugo Weisgall's impassioned
and formidably complex ``Esther,'' which she sang at its acclaimed
premiere by the New York City Opera in 1994. ``But let me tell you,
baby,'' she said, `` `Intermezzo' is selling great at the house,
and there are tickets to spare for `La Boheme.' So good work will
win out.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the conductor Riccardo Muti, the dictatorial music director
at La Scala, she speaks with admiration and exasperation. ``His
reputation as a stickler is well deserved,'' she said. ``But in
working for details, he loads your voice up with what I'd call
dramatic mannerisms. And he remembers years later. You come back,
and one little thing is off, and he says, `What's wrong with
you?'''
</P>
<P>
   As for her relationship with the Met, which has not called for
years, Ms. Flanigan at first begged off this ``most boring
subject.'' But she warmed to it.
</P>
<P>
   She made her Met debut in the 1991-92 season, singing a small
role in John Corigliano's ``Ghosts of Versailles.'' Her
breakthrough came the next season, when she substituted for an
ailing Aprile Millo in Verdi's ``Lombardi'' with no stage
rehearsal; the director, Mark Lamos, sketched out the blocking for
her on a napkin at a cafe. She sang seven performances, one of
which was televised, appearing opposite Luciano Pavarotti, with
James Levine conducting. So the dimensions of her talents should be
well known at the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you hear who they have singing Verdi over there,
and you hear my voice, so you just know I'm not what they want for
Verdi,'' she said. ``But there's a gray area.'' The Met might
consider her for roles like Donna Anna in Mozart's ``Don
Giovanni,'' she suggested, or Marie in Berg's ``Wozzeck.'' But no
one has called. (And when asked to respond to her statements, a
spokesman for the Met offered no comment.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it keep me up at night?'' she asked. ``Absolutely not.
Not when the New York City Opera will plan Donizetti's `Roberto
Devereux' for me, or this production of `Intermezzo.'''
</P>
<P>
   If anything is keeping Ms. Flanigan up at night, it is her
jam-packed schedule. She recently portrayed the manipulative
stepmother in Jack Beeson's chilling ``Lizzie Borden,'' in a new
production at the City Opera, which was telecast on ``Live From
Lincoln Center'' on PBS. Ms. Flanigan is a composer's dream
soprano, Beeson said. ``Lauren is technically flawless, vital and
inventive. In six performances, she didn't do the role exactly the
same way twice.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April, she will Gerard Schwarz and the Seattle
Symphony in a concert performance of Deems Taylor's ``Peter
Ibbetson,'' an opera given its premiere at the Met in 1931 and now
nearly forgotten. She is also learning the title role of an opera
she adores, Verdi's early, overlooked ``Giovanna d'Arco,'' for a
concert performance with the Collegiate Chorale next month at
Carnegie Hall. ``I'm the only singer learning, like, 3,000 pages of
music in five months that I will probably never sing again,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the diversity (and obscurity) of her repertory you glean
a thread that links her choices and makes sense of her seemingly
eclectic career: Ms. Flanigan is attracted by particular projects
and ideas, and by a chance to work with specific colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way actors work,'' she explained. ``Singers tend to
build their careers and their voices step by step, role by role.''
Actors, she suggested, are more inclined to lurch all over the
place, a method that comes naturally to Ms. Flanigan, who was
initially interested in acting and dance and has worked closely
with the innovative theater director Anne Bogart.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the lead role in ``Intermezzo'' was typical of Ms.
Flanigan's career choices. Many singers consider the opera, which
Strauss wrote in 1924 and called a ``bourgeois comedy with
symphonic interludes,'' vocally ungratifying.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The libretto, also by Strauss, is based on an event in his own
life. In Berlin in 1903, a young woman opera fan, intending to send
a note to the flirtatious conductor Josef Stransky, addressed it
mistakenly to Strauss. ``Dear Sweetheart,'' it read. ``Do bring me
the ticket. Your faithful Mitzi.'' Strauss' argumentative wife,
Pauline, opened the note and contacted a divorce lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion was cleared up but not without difficulty. Strauss
immortalized the incident in ``Intermezzo,'' turning himself into a
famous conductor, Robert Storch, and his wife into Christine, and
adding an amorous complication in the person of a scheming young
baron who befriends Christine.
</P>
<P>
   The libretto, to be performed in Andrew Porter's English
translation, is wry and clever. The opera takes place in 13 scenes,
some just a few minutes long. The role of Christine demands
physical comedy, including a toboggan ride, and in this production,
11 costumes changes.
</P>
<P>
   It also requires almost nonstop singing, though the vocal
writing is devoid of long, lyrical lines, and even short melodic
phrases are infrequent. Most of the text is delivered in chatty
patter or quasi recitative. The lyrical gems are in the orchestral
interludes.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a gifted Strauss singer be interested?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I love it,'' said Ms. Flanigan, who first performed
the role in 1990 at the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., in
a production by Leon Major, which has been adapted by the City
Opera. ``The opera is Strauss' fond recollection of his strange
wife and her escapades when he was away. Whenever Storch talks of
himself or is talked about, the music is huge and grand. Whenever
Christine talks or is talked about, the music becomes involved,
agitated and fussy, full of half-steps. It's just a hoot, and very
challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flanigan has established a close relationship with the City
Opera, which she credits with a supportive, familial atmosphere.
Her identity as a prima donna of the City Opera, she suggests, may
have contributed to the Met's coolness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet her favorite company is the Teatro San Carlo in Naples,
where, she said, the audience is passionate about opera, not
celebrities. After singing ``Nabucco'' triumphantly there, she was
recognized everywhere in the city. She should not have been
surprised, of course, in part because she is 5 feet 10 inches tall
and has flaming red hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people came up to me, they wanted to talk forever about
how I ornamented the second verse of the aria `Salgo gia,''' she
said. ``I mean, how cool is that?''
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see where Ms. Flanigan heads next, and
the answer may surprise her as much as her fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I get offered more than anything else?'' she
asked. ``Tosca and Turandot. I mean, hello? Look at me. Listen to
me.'' She called these opulent Puccini roles, with their arching
lyricism, ``whole-note music,'' explaining dryly: ``I don't do
whole notes. I still have tons of high C's in me, the real
shimmering kind, not the big blown-out ones. I want to sing more
Rossini and Bellini.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Flanigan is not likely to become a bel canto specialist.
Next month in Tokyo, for example, she will perform a new work for
soprano, actress and electronic surround sound. The piece,
``Justice,'' by the American Roger Reynolds, is still being
written. ``I haven't seen a note,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if she was worried, she didn't look it, heading eagerly
back to rehearsal, to practice her toboggan run.

CLASSICAL MUSIC'S HEAVY HITTERS IN ABBREVIATED AT-BATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
 Ed Ward, the author of the first volume of ``Rock of Ages,''
Rolling Stone's rock history, is a freelance writer in Berlin.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 40 years ago, Leonard Bernstein presented a nationally
televised New York Philharmonic Young People's Concert titled ``Who
Is Gustav Mahler?'' Addressing an audience of children, Bernstein
offered an analysis of Mahler's ``double personality,'' a product
of ``inner battles'' between composing and conducting, emotional
innocence and torment, Western music and exotic Eastern influences.
</P>
<P>
   This month, PBS will telecast ``Great Composers,'' six programs
beginning on Wednesday, April 14, and including, on Wednesday,
April 21, ``Gustav Mahler.'' Juxtaposed with Bernstein's concert,
this hourlong introduction to the composer documents a sea change
in the ways symphonic music is explained, observed and absorbed on
the home screen.
</P>
<P>
   In place of Bernstein's Carnegie Hall, we are regaled with
footage of the cities and mountains, houses and ``composing huts''
that Mahler knew and used, and with enacted re-creations of
incidents from his life. In place of a single commentator and a
sustained point of view, there are no fewer then 16 talking heads:
sources of innumerable sound bites of less than a minute each. In
place of Bernstein and his musicians, we observe in performance a
piano quartet, a couple of singers and the BBC Symphony Orchestra,
from which emanate tiny  &UR; music &LR;  bites, rarely exceeding 30 seconds
unless a sound bite is overlaid.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, who never talks while music is being played,
introduces his young people to the ``Abschied'' (``Farewell'') from
Mahler's ``Song of the Earth'' with a four-minute exegesis
culminating in a personal interpretation: that the movement is,
among other things, Mahler's necessary but intensely nostalgic
farewell to German Romanticism. He then conducts the final five
minutes of this painful leave-taking.
</P>
<P>
   In the new ``Mahler,'' we hear 45 seconds of the ``Abschied''
before a 25-second sound bite by filmmaker Ken Russell takes over.
The next 25 seconds of music are embellished by a danced
interpretation and images of trees and flowers. While these
enhancements may be less banal than the rainy windowpane inflicted
on ``Kindertotenlieder,'' they effectively fracture music that even
a child _ especially a child, according to Bernstein _ would
recognize as hypnotically poised and inviolable.
</P>
<P>
   Then come two more sound bites, totaling 45 seconds, another 10
seconds of music, and we are done with ``The Song of the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the ``Mahler'' talking heads _ in particular,
Russell, musicologist Donald Mitchell and biographer Henry-Louis de
La Grange _ are promising, but these contributions are drowned in a
sea of cliches. The music bites, without exception, are shrewdly
chosen. We hear, for instance, the amazing opening measures of the
Sixth Symphony's finale. No words can convey the metaphysical chill
of this passage, with its combination of soaring flight and
fatalistic descent. The prosaic tag here imposed drones, ``The last
movement of the Sixth Symphony includes some of the most
emotionally charged and frightening music Mahler would ever
write.''
</P>
<P>
   All six composers in the series are subject to the same
formulaic restrictions, a strategy to ward off boredom and placate
short attention spans. Sadly, it is all business as usual. Nervous
cameras compete for novelty of perspective. There are close-ups of
fingers, fingernails and fingerboards, of vibrating hands and
strings. One memorable shot, from the floor, shows a bloated elbow
connecting, at a great height, with a tiny fiddle.
</P>
<P>
   The sound bites are numbing in their superficial variety. The
intention, no doubt, is to instill a condition of feverish
passivity, so we won't switch to ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the series' first two installments, broadcast back to back
Wednesday, ``Beethoven'' is curiously disorganized: particles of
speech and music scattered like so many scraps of paper. Too often
the talking heads are celebrities with nothing much to say. The
quest to define Beethoven's genius leads nowhere. We learn that the
late string quartets are ``the greatest music Beethoven ever
wrote,'' that the ``Eroica'' Symphony was the first piece to
convince everyone that ``this really is Beethoven's voice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mozart,'' also broadcast this week, is better. More than the
other programs, it manages to concentrate, as Bernstein used to, on
a piece of music. Seven minutes are spent with the Piano Concerto
in A (K. 488), and with two terrific commentators. One is pianist
and musicologist Robert Levin, whose excited delivery is messianic,
even over the top. The other is conductor Colin Davis, soft-voiced
and melancholically intense. They disagree about the proper
performance of the coda to the concerto's slow movement. Citing a
manuscript in the hand of Mozart's pupil Barbara Ployer, Levin
insists that it should be lavishly ornamented. Davis reads Mozart's
score, barren of embellishment, as a self-sufficient text. ``You're
missing the moment of extraordinary depth and desolation,'' he
woundedly intones, ``by dressing him up in dolly's clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   To clinch this argument _ what could be more obvious? _ one
would have to hear the entire coda, only a minute long, in both
versions. The ground rules will not sanction this.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Mozart'' transcends cant and caricature. It
respectfully samples recent scholarship. It handsomely summarizes
the composer's life.
</P>
<P>
   If these shows suggest that the heroic Beethoven connects less
with our time than the elusive Mozart, ``Wagner,'' on April 21,
brings bad news: that an appreciation of this composer is today
muddled by issues of politics and morality, simplistically
understood. Extremist rant _ that Wagner's operas are infested with
encoded representations of the Jew _ is allowed to stand
unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers to Wagner could not possibly glean from such a
presentation the psychological complexity of ``Tristan und
Isolde,'' or the emotional wisdom of ``Die Meistersinger'' (here
characterized, in a single phrase, as ``a nationalistic tribute to
German art''). Even Wagner's anti-Semitism, the program's idee
fixe, remains a cartoon. His ambivalences are denied. His complex
practical and psychological dependency on the Jew, a rewarding
topic, goes unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly surprises that the program also manages to misread one
of Wagner's most famous and unnervingly explicit musical
descriptions. The unresolved climax of the ``Tristan'' Prelude, a
portrait of solitary, unslaked sexual thirst (``desire without
attainment,'' Wagner called it), is reduced, by a pair of dancers,
to an anodyne vignette of lovers kissing.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tchaikovsky and Puccini _ the final pair of composers, on
April 28 _ are effectively presented. (A seventh film in the
series, ``Johann Sebastian Bach,'' will not be shown on PBS but is
to be released with the others in May for home video by NVC Arts.)
</P>
<P>
   Conductors Yuri Temirkanov and Valery Gergiev are powerfully
articulate Tchaikovsky advocates, insisting on a dignified
rendering of the composer's music and personality. The Moscow and
St. Petersburg locations are telling. Even in snatches, the
performances of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic are distinguished.
Tchaikovsky's homosexuality is thoughtfully discussed; the pain it
caused him, it is plausibly suggested, inflected his creative
personality. Current scholarly dissension over Tchaikovsky's death
_ was it suicide? _ is entertainingly sampled.
</P>
<P>
   The least challenging of the six composers, Puccini furnishes a
diverting finale, in which the soap opera of his personal life _
his arrogance, miserliness and promiscuity _ is colorfully
described by surviving neighbors and hunting buddies. Three
commentators _ singers Julia Migenes and Jose Cura, conductor
Richard Buckley _ prove sincere and unaffected adherents. The
contradiction between this composer's high popularity and his low
esteem among certain scholars and connoisseurs is, if not explored,
at least acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes of Maria Callas singing ``Vissi d'arte'' (in black
and white, with a single stationary camera) would completely
upstage _ or wonderfully enhance _ this show, but never mind.
</P>
<P>
   What finally disappoints about ``Great Composers'' is not the
restriction on intellectual and musical content but something more
basic. For some time now, the canon of Western classical music has
not defined what is musically best and most prestigious. Already,
the concept of an elite caste of dead European great composers,
sources of timeless and eternal high art, caricatures itself.
</P>
<P>
   A co-production of WNET in New York and the BBC and NVC Arts in
London, ``Great Composers'' benefits from the participation of
leading American and British musicologists (on the whole, better
talkers than the musicians), who supply up-to-date findings and
perspectives. To be genuinely up to date, however, the series would
have to include a non-European composer, or a composer at least
partly invested in popular music, or both.
</P>
<P>
   A segment on George Gershwin would have been timely, provocative
and fun. The late-20th-century collapse of separate ``classical''
and ``popular'' musical spheres _ of which Gershwin was an early
embodiment _ could have been explored. The absorption of Old World
music by New World composers, performers and institutions _ a
fascinating and important theme, especially (one would think) for
Americans _ could have been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   These are chronic oversights that Bernstein, nearly half a
century ago, consistently avoided. His musical illustrations were
as likely to sample Copland and Harris, or Presley and the Beatles,
as Mozart and Beethoven. His passionate enthusiasms included
American musical theater and jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Bernstein was part of a more courageous broadcasting
era, a beneficiary of such distinguished CBS showcases as
``Omnibus'' and ``Ford Presents.'' The rival NBC created its own
opera company, presenting opera in English and emphasizing
contemporary and American repertory. And NBC 10 times televised
concerts by the NBC Symphony under Arturo Toscanini, alongside
which most symphonic ``Great Performances'' via PBS are yesterday's
banquet barely warmed over.
</P>
<P>
   One appreciates that PBS lacks the financial resources that
NBC's David Sarnoff and CBS's William Paley commanded before
commercial television was, in effect, relieved of responsibility
for cultural programming through the advent of public television.
One understands the need to satisfy a gamut of affiliated public
stations, and to compete with popular commercial fare.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, too, it must be said that ``Great Composers'' will
do some good. I know, because I tested three segments on my
11-year-old son. He was galvanized by the exchange between Don
Giovanni and the statue of the Commendatore, powerfully staged
(though intermittently interrupted) in ``Mozart''; he announced his
desire to see ``Don Giovanni'' as soon as possible. ``Tchaikovsky''
was found equally gripping. ``Beethoven'' was pronounced
``overemphasized,'' which, it turned out, meant full of hot air.
</P>
<P>
   At best, ``Great Composers'' is a kind of holding action,
innocuous in the short run but ultimately self-defeating. Surely it
is not too late to hope for something better from public
television: something more timely, more challenging, more
inspirational. Or is it?

LATIN ROOTS LEAVE ROOM FOR ALL-AMERICAN AMBITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
 (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take it with a grain of salt, and maybe a squeeze of lime, when
the Latin Playboys declare ``It's not about hip, you won't get it,
it's a Latin trip'' in the middle of their second album, ``Dose''
(Atlantic, CD, 834173).
</P>
<P>
   They're not making a policy statement. Whether or not the Latin
Playboys aspire to hipness, any kind of Latin separatism is the
furthest thing from their musical intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin Playboys assimilate whatever they like, from
slide-guitar blues riffs to Indonesian gamelan gongs; it's a Latin
trip simply because they're not going to let go of roots, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin Playboys are one spinoff from Los Lobos, whose most
recent album, ``Colossal Head,'' was released in 1996. The Playboys
include David Hidalgo and Louie Perez, songwriters from Los Lobos,
along with Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake, who have produced and
engineered Los Lobos' albums since ``Kiko'' in 1992. (The Playboys'
tour brings them to Tramps in New York City on Thursday.)
Meanwhile, Cesar Rosas, who shares Los Lobos' lead vocals and
songwriting, has made a solo album, ``Soul Disguise'' (Rykodisc,
CD, 10459). And Hidalgo and a blues singer, Mike Halby,
collaborated on an album, ``Houndog'' (Columbia Legacy, CD, 65861).
</P>
<P>
   Los Lobos became a flagship for Mexican-American rock in the
1980s. They had a No. 1 single in 1987 with a remake of Ritchie
Valens' hit ``La Bamba'' and followed it with ``La Pistola y el
Corazon,'' an album of Mexican and border songs. Last year, Los
Lobos' two guitarists, Hidalgo and Rosas, were part of Los Super
Seven, an all-star revival of Tex-Mex norteno music.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Lobos decided to be not a Mexican-American ethnic symbol
but an all-American band, tuned in to the whole world and ready to
slip in African or Asian licks alongside a blues shuffle or a
Tex-Mex waltz. In the '90s, Los Lobos began to make music that
sounded more subterranean, conjuring smoky clubs and cluttered
garages, staticky broadcasts and scratchy disks.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Kiko,'' ``Colossal Head'' and the first Latin Playboys
album, from 1994, guitars are distorted; peculiar keyboard sounds
tootle and hum; drumbeats thump on unexpected offbeats. The
traditionalists had suddenly become sonic guerrillas, knocking
ideas together like the younger generation of Rock en Espanol
bands. The music pursued its own impulses, not a format.
</P>
<P>
   The new albums take disparate routes toward their all-American
ambitions. Rosas chooses eclecticism, proving himself in one style
after another. ``Houndog'' concocts a stark, neoprimitive version
of the blues. And The Latin Playboys throw all the music they love
into a studio cauldron, then see what happens when it's heated,
melted and stirred.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Soul Disguise,'' Rosas strips away Los Lobos' tangents and
works his way through musical geography from accordion-driven
norteno to New Orleans funk to Chicago blues to Los Angeles
folk-rock. It's a tour of rock before hip-hop, with most songs
telling an old story: he's got woman trouble, and she's to blame.
Rosas sings with an amiable growl, then follows through with
coiled, teasing, pointed lead guitar solos. He's a master of his
chosen styles, and he makes his studio band steam through every
groove. But few of the songs are more than genre pieces, presenting
Rosas as an overqualified leader of a bar band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houndog'' is Hidalgo's inward-looking version of a genre
workout: not Rosas' public blues, but a private meditation on
``lonely dying love.'' Hidalgo produced, performed and wrote songs
with Halby, whose sleepy voice moves so languidly that it sometimes
sounds like the tapes have been slowed down. Singing like
Mississippi John Hurt meeting John Lee Hooker in a thick fog, Halby
gets minimal backup: a muffled beat, a guitar or two and Hidalgo's
rough-hewn fiddle. The music is quietly bereft, as if resigned to
misery. Yet while individual songs like ``All Fired Up, All Shook
Down'' hit home, the album as a whole grows logy.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin Playboys sound like they're having more fun in
musicianly ways: savoring odd beats and unlikely textures, fooling
around with riffs and tape loops, sometimes fighting against their
own facility to force new ideas. They process their deep knowledge
of blues, rock and Mexican music through samplers and noise gizmos,
pulverizing any notion of purism.
</P>
<P>
   Like the first Latin Playboys album, ``Dose'' is short _ under
40 minutes _ and wayward. A blues instrumental called ``Tormenta
Blvd.,'' only plays on the right channel; the album's most tuneful
song, the disillusioned come-on of ``Lemon `N Ice,'' ticks along
for a minute and a half before the vocal arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Anything can turn up in the Latin Playboys' songs: a steel-drum
hook and a low-riding piano riff in ``Latin Trip,'' Javanese
gamelan and tape-reversed percussion in ``Dose,'' a guitar line in
``Mustard'' that could be from southern Africa or Bali, Indian
film-music violins answering phased, fuzzed guitar in ``Fiesta
Exotica.'' Hidalgo makes his guitars poke and twang; Froom laces
the songs with outre, obsolete analog keyboards, and the whole
group searches for the raunchiest tones and lumpiest rhythms it can
sample.
</P>
<P>
   But the Latin Playboys aren't trying to flee their background,
only to gain perspective. The lyrics, mostly by Perez, are filled
with barrio memories _ looking at characters like a natty tough guy
in ``Latin Trip'' or a faded glamour girl in ``Cuca's Blues,''
taking the family pickup truck to the movies in ``Ironsides'' or
wondering about a kid who ``grows up brown'' in ``Dose.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Playboys get to folky Mexican styles in the album's
final songs, the sound is thoroughly untraditional. A distorted
bajo sexto bass line holds the foreground in ``Paletero''; the buzz
and snap of the strings of the requinto punctuates ``Paula y
Fred,'' a cheerful son jarocho, sung in Spanglish, in which
unrequited love leads to murder.
</P>
<P>
   It's still a Latin thing, but one that can no longer stay
insular. Now it's part of a larger, more chaotic world, where
strange connections have turned into family ties.

JAZZ REVIEW: A MIX AND MATCH OF TREASURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If jazz has been about one thing over the last 100
years, it has been about transformation. Jazz musicians changed the
sound of European instruments to reflect the needs of the new
environment. They transformed staid melodies and songs, making them
hop with the heat of improvisation. And jazz's endless revision of
standard pop harmony created a new way of thinking about chords,
one based on the idea of replacing the old and simple with the new
and complex.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed almost inevitable when Duke Ellington and his
longtime collaborator Billy Strayhorn took on Edvard Grieg's ``Peer
Gynt'' Suite and transformed its lush melancholia into something
less somber and more American. Using the raw materials of the
original work's melody and a bit of its harmony and shape, the two
produced an individual suite in 1960 that is the original's equal
in profundity.
</P>
<P>
   At Avery Fisher Hall on Wednesday, the New York Philharmonic and
the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra collaborated on the composition,
alternating pieces of Grieg's original with their Ellington and
Strayhorn counterparts, and produced an extraordinary event from
something that might have been pedantic. Pedantic because comparing
the two versions is something one does alone with a CD player or
lecturing from a podium. But the two works are so different and so
rich in varying ways and both orchestras are so accomplished in
their interpretations that the music stood firmly on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison enriched the experience, enabling listeners to
follow the scraps of repeated melodies, the octave jumps sung by
the soprano Kelley Nassief with the philharmonic mirrored in the
clarinet solos of Victor Goines during the Lincoln Center Jazz
Orchestra's turn.
</P>
<P>
   One could follow the Ellington and Strayhorn reharmonization,
the abruptness the two put in the changing harmonic scenery. Where
Grieg kept his emotional colors cool and gorgeous, using big blocks
of harmony in the strings with little polyphony, Ellington and
Strayhorn used counterpoint, clashing lines of melody and polyphony
to expand the emotional range of the work. One could hear the
different ways of producing a foundation for music: in one section,
Ellington and Strayhorn used a rhythmic pattern that both reflected
and informed the melodic development of the music.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra moved from static
rhythms to all the various swing rhythms Ellington and Strayhorn
brought to the piece, the music opened up as if its palette had
suddenly tripled the available colors. Ellington and Strayhorn were
masters at scoring and arranging, and their control of rhythmic
change was unparalleled.
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the concert featured Ellington works scored
by Wynton Marsalis for the combined forces of the philharmonic and
the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. They included ``Bula,'' from the
``Afro Bossa Suite''; ``Blues in Blueprint,'' ``Happy-Go-Lucky
Local'' and ``A Tone Parallel to Harlem''; Kurt Masur directed the
united orchestras with energy, and if the pieces didn't have the
heft of ``Peer Gynt,'' little does.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a sense that the collaboration had historical
weight. Masur, the music director of the philharmonic, and
Marsalis, the music director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, have been
talking about a collaboration for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Peer Gynt'' was their debut joint effort, and they plan
to do more. These five concerts at Avery Fisher Hall _ with
performances Friday, Saturday and next Tuesday _ are sold out.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the collaboration has ramifications for the jazz
world because it exposes the music of Duke Ellington to a broader
audience. Over the next month, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra
will perform the program with the orchestras of Chicago, Boston,
London, Amsterdam and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The size and success of the collaboration is a tribute to the
imaginative use of institutional power.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it's testimony to the continuing ability of jazz to
transform a variety of forms _ in this case, the classical music
structure _ to fit its needs.

`METROLAND': DELUSIONS OF A FAILED BOHEMIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Based on an obviously early novel by Julian Barnes,
``Metroland'' assails its hero's bourgeois family life in a London
suburb. From the film's standpoint, Chris Lloyd (Christian Bale)
has sold out and abandoned his dreams. He is aggressively reminded
of that by the arrival of his best friend (Lee Ross), who spells
his name Toni, writes poetry, boasts about sexual conquests and
roams the world. One of Toni's postcards: ``Africa's where it's
happening. Vibrant culture. Great people. Thinking of hanging out
here for a while. Eat the rich. Love, Toni.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is set in the 1960s and 1970s, which makes its social
observations a lot more dated than, say, Edith Wharton's. It flips
from when the men are in their early 30's (1977) to their
Beatlemania-era boyhood (when they dropped Jean-Paul Sartre's name
and sneered at the bank managers in their neighborhood) to 1968.
That was the year when Chris, in the film's own most bourgeois
notion, fancied himself a bohemian by ``going to Paris to be an
artist.''
</P>
<P>
   His life was a whirl of Gauloises, Rimbaud, Lawrence Durrell
novels and Francoise Dorleac records as he experienced first love
with a smiling French hedonist named Annick (Elsa Zylberstein), who
obligingly posed for his arty boudoir photographs. ``Annick, do you
want to see a film on Friday?'' he remembers saying, during one of
his nostalgic daydreams. ``There's a new Bresson.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Chris' sexual freedom is curtailed by marriage and
responsibility. (For a better film on this subject, see ``A Walk on
the Moon.'') While with his English wife Marion, who is played by
Emily Watson with welcome acuity, he daydreams about his wilder
times. In one of the film's wittier strokes, he also imagines
Marion saying: ``I want you to have affairs. It'll be good for our
marriage. And of course I'll still cook your dinner and do your
washing and ironing.''
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is a little goading from Toni and Chris begins
wondering why he settled down so early. During a flashback to their
courtship, Marion spells it out for him with the film's best line,
``You're not original enough not to.'' Later on, in a very forced
ending, it is Marion who has to explain away Toni's troublemaking
in the silliest possible terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metroland,'' directed by Philip Saville and adapted by Adrian
Hodge, does seem plausible as a cri de coeur from a trapped young
husband and father. But its affectations are more galling than
Gallic most of the time. Though Ms. Zylberstein is a Frenchwoman,
she plays such a stereotype that she seems to be impersonating one.
</P>
<P>
   Its strongest assets, aside from a performance by Ms. Watson
that pierces through the nonsense, are Mark Knopfler's fine,
expressive score and the attractiveness of its star. Bale is a
babe, as the film's characters make a point of mentioning. (Annick
calls Chris ``a beautiful English boyfriend.'') The story often has
him leaping into bed quite often, in search of bohemian thrills.

GROUP ACCUSES SAN FRANCISCO POLICE OF ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A coalition representing people who have had sex
changes is accusing the police and sheriff's deputies of abuse and
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The newly formed coalition, TransAction, made its case outside
the Hall of Justice on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing transgendered persons who are the victims of
police brutality and the numbers are on the rise,'' said Shawna
Virago, one of those who spoke at the gathering. Some of the
speakers said they were former prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   The police and sheriff's office deny the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Veronika Cauley, a member of San Francisco's Veterans Affairs
Commission, said she had been verbally harassed by the police or
mistakenly stopped for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a prostitute in a past life,'' Cauley said. ``But that
doesn't excuse what has been done to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Sherman Ackerson said the San Francisco Police
Department does not single out ``any group for any reason. We do
not target transgender people for any reason. We are treating them
like any other person in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers at the Hall of Justice complained about
practices in the San Francisco Jail, saying they have been strip
searched to determine their gender. They also complained of being
subjected to verbal abuse and harassment behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was in part to show support for Victoria Schneider, a
transsexual who has a lawsuit pending that alleges she was
subjected to an illegal strip search by officers following a 1996
misdemeanor arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the police strip search women, it's as though we've been
raped. It strips us of our dignity and our self-esteem,'' Schneider
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The city has denied wrongdoing and is fighting Schneider's
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Michael Hennessey said Wednesday that it is against his
department's policy to strip-search in order to determine gender.
He said that deputies will perform strip searches only if a
suspect's recent criminal history indicates use of drugs, weapons
or violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That applies to all arrestees in that category whether they
are transgender or not,'' the sheriff said. ``This is in order to
keep drugs and weapons out of the jail system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sheriff's Department is in charge of jails.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessey also said his department does not tolerate deputies
harassing inmates. He said the jail system has made special efforts
to accommodate people who have had sex changes and keep ``any
inmate who is believed to be vulnerable'' away from the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assess every single person for possible harm,'' Hennessey
said. ``We take that very seriously.''

`NEVER BEEN KISSED': GRADUATION IS THE BEST REVENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What does it say about ``Never Been Kissed,'' the latest and
dumbest in the deluge of high school comedies from Hollywood, that
the most despised nerd in the senior class, a girl who is
humiliated at the prom by having dog food poured down the back of
her dress, is better looking than the actual prom queen or any of
her attendants? That nerd, Aldys (Leelee Sobieski), who leads a
high school math team, is not much of a role. But Ms. Sobieski
lends the character about the only dignity to be found in this
bogus, bottom-of-the-barrel Cinderella story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never Been Kissed'' deals with the fantasy shared at one time
or another by most graduates of that savage institution known as
the American high school of reliving those traumatic years with an
adult's knowledge of the world. It is a potentially rich subject
that was treated a bit more seriously 13 years ago in ``Peggy Sue
Got Married.'' In that comforting but ultimately silly movie, an
older and wiser Kathleen Turner goes back in time and despite
having the chance to do things differently ends up making the same
major life decisions she did before.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Drew Barrymore, playing Josie Geller, a 25-year-old
reporter for a Chicago newspaper, poses as a high school student to
get the inside scoop on what it's like to be a millennial
teen-ager. Flashbacks reveal that in high school Josie was a
stringy-haired, hunched-over geek with braces on her teeth who was
unmercifully persecuted by the pretty people in her class. This
time around, of course, Josie rules. But by the end of her
assignment, she also learns that being the most popular girl in her
class and its prom queen are not all they're cracked up to be. And
when her true identity is revealed, she even gets to lecture her
stunned classmates about their cliquish narrow-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrymore, who is the executive producer of ``Never Been
Kissed,'' has shown enough cuddlesome spunk in the past to
illuminate otherwise mediocre movies, like ``Ever After,'' with a
flash of charm. But ``Never Been Kissed'' is so hopelessly
cartoonish and wrongheaded in its details that there's not even a
semblance of reality for her to grab on to.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the movie's view of journalism. Rigfort
(Garry Marshall), the editor of the paper for which she works, is a
railing buffoon who loudly threatens to dismiss people every five
minutes. Once Josie, outfitted with a tiny video camera, has gone
back to high school her newsroom colleagues appear to spend all
day, every day, huddled around a television set absorbed by her
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Josie's initial foray into high school life is a disaster. It
isn't until her brother Rob (David Arquette), who was a popular
jock in his day at the same school, re-enrolls, becomes instantly
popular and tells everyone how cool Josie is (she poses not as his
sister but as a former date) that she is taken up by the in-group.
Presiding over that inner clique is a triumvirate of vicious
shallow little witches who are carbon copies of the vixens in the
recent and equally awful ``Jawbreaker.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that Arquette is not only charmless but also
entirely unconvincing as both a high schooler (he appears to be on
the far side of 30) and a jock. Nor does it help that the
screenplay, by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, is virtually
joke-free, unless dog food poured down the back of a party dress
qualifies as humor.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by Raja Gosnell, gives Ms. Barrymore a
Prince Charming in Sam (Michael Vartan), a handsome English teacher
who is drawn to Josie's mature-for-her-years literary imagination.
But the movie is so nervous about the possibility of promoting
student-teacher sexual relations that it makes sure we know that
Josie, at 25, has never even been kissed. But not to worry, Josie
eventually becomes the lucky recipient of one very long,
passionless smooch that is applauded by an entire stadium of
onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Never Been Kissed'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It has some off-color humor.

AMERICANA? PHILADELPHIA, OF COURSE  
 SWEDISH STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.Y., Sweden)  (js) 
 BY WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As American antiques go, it is hard to think of anything more
famous than the Liberty Bell. So it's not surprising that the
annual antiques show in Philadelphia, home of the bell and cradle
of liberty, has exceptional examples of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best show of its type, in terms of fairs that focus
on Americana,'' said Leigh Keno, a Manhattan dealer who
participates in only two shows a year, New York City's Winter
Antiques Show and the Philadelphia Antiques Show, which opens
Friday night and runs through April 14. ``For the collector of
Americana and the decorative arts appropriate to it, like Chinese
porcelain and Oriental rugs, there's no better show.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lindsey, curator of American decorative art at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, said of the show: ``Dealers bring their
best American things to it. In terms of prices and quality, a lot
of records have been set at the show, but because Philadelphia is
so quiet you never hear about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six dealers are participating this year, including a few
who are new to the show: John Alexander of Philadelphia; Stephen
and Carol Huber of Old Saybrook, Conn.; William Reese of New Haven
and Marcy Burns of Wyncote, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   At the show, at the 103rd Engineers Armory, at 33rd and Market
streets, many dealers specialize in early American furniture,
porcelain and silver. A few focus on Philadelphia antiques.
``Philadelphians appreciate their home-grown antiques, and,
happily, everyone else seems to as well,'' Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
   He has organized an exhibition of 500 examples of Pennsylvania
baroque furniture and decorative arts made between 1681 and 1758
that opens at the museum on Oct. 7. He said that 25 objects at the
museum show would be on loan from local collectors who had bought
them in the last few years at the antiques show.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia antiques do not come cheap. On Jan. 16, Christie's
sold a magnificent Philadelphia rococo tilt-top tea table (circa
1765) from the Britton Collection to the Chipstone Foundation for
$1,542,500. And at the antiques show, Keno is selling a pair of
Philadelphia side chairs in the rococo style, circa 1770, with
leafy carved knees, for $65,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1755 and 1785, Philadelphia was the center for the
rococo style in the colonies,'' Keno said. ``It produced the most
opulent designs, full-blown rococo pieces with naturalistic,
asymmetrical foliate carving.''
</P>
<P>
   The show also features a loan exhibition of 38 idiosyncratic
chairs, many made in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose antiques that were quirky,'' said Fyte Ludington
Drayton, co-chairwoman of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Drayton was a founding member of the Fairmount Park House
Guides, Philadelphia Museum volunteers trained in the American
decorative arts. The guides will give a group tour of the antiques
show every morning at 10 before it opens. It costs $20. Mrs.
Drayton said she was not a collector: ``I'm an inheritor.''
</P>
<P>
   One item in the loan exhibition is a 19th-century wrought-iron
``cemetery chair'' with the name ``K. Getman'' on the crest rail.
(It can be assumed the chair was given in his memory.) ``It was
designed for a rural cemetery like Philadelphia's Laurel Hill,''
Mrs. Drayton said. ``One could sit there and think about the
deceased.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Johnson, her co-chairwoman, has been in charge of loan
exhibitions at the show since 1976. She singled out a reclining
``gout chair'' made in China of rosewood, bamboo and cane for the
American market. ``It supposedly belonged to Commodore Barry, the
father of the American Navy,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ``But he died in
1803. It was probably bought by his nephew, who was involved in the
China trade in the 1850s.'' The chair has a footrest. ``Gout is
very painful; this must have helped the afflicted person when his
ankles swelled,'' Mrs. Johnson added.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish Style
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saturday afternoon, Christie's will be the host of a
forum on Swedish design at its salesroom at 502 Park Ave. at 59th
Street. The session will be opened by Princess Christina of Sweden,
chairwoman for 10 years of a society that is trying to establish an
independent museum for design and the decorative arts in Stockholm.
``This is nothing new,'' the princess said. ``The museum has been
under discussion for 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The princess' group has a private gallery for seminars and
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a lobbying group,'' she said. ``We are trying to create
a wide interest in the museum idea among fashion people, industrial
designers, artists and craftsmen. Eventually, it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's symposium, organized by the American Craft Museum,
the Swedish Information Service, the Bard Graduate Center for
Studies in the Decorative Arts, and Christie's itself, will trace
Swedish design from 1900 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1897 Stockholm had an exhibition of Swedish art and
industry that attracted 1.2 million people,'' said Dr. Elisabet
Hidemark, a Stockholm museum curator who will discuss the roots of
Swedish design. ``There were only five million people in all of
Sweden. Swedish artists and architects took Art Nouveau and created
something new that was distinctly Swedish. You see it in the cut
and engraved glass and the colorful ceramics until about 1908.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerstin Wickman, a lecturer at the Konstfack Institute in
Stockholm, traced modern Swedish design to 1917, ``when artists
began to work together with the craftspeople in the factories in
the small villages of Orrefors, Kosta and Boda.'' Things changed
drastically in 1932, she said, when the Social Democrats passed new
laws to promote affordable housing, health, convenience and
hygiene. ``Rents were low and the government gave newly marrieds
loans to buy proper furniture,'' she said. ``The designers came
together to promote pragmatic, practical designs. No designers
became `stars' because they felt designers should not become
famous.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation changed again after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now a whole generation in Sweden wanted to be modern and live
in a new way,' Ms. Wickman said. ``Tradition was not worth much
anymore. That stimulated the designers. Blond wood came in. It's
elegant, well-done, quality, and it gives an idea about the good
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Cilla Robach, curator of 20th-century applied art and design at
the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, will discuss Swedish design after
1970. She said designers today were trying to create objects that
are both beautiful and practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swedes have a feeling for natural materials and lightness of
form,'' she said. `The language of the forms is quite austere. The
beauty comes in the proportions. The furniture looks simple, but
there is a lot of work involved in it. We are famous for this
austere design. If you are interested in comfort, choose another
style.''

`TWIN FALLS IDAHO': IT'S NOT THE USUAL MENAGE A TROIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ However many films you may have seen, you probably
haven't seen anything like ``Twin Falls Idaho'' on screen. One of
the most eerily effective films at the New Directors/New Films
festival this year, it takes the real-life closeness of the
identical twins Michael and Mark Polish into the realm of haunting
fantasy. These arrestingly gaunt, watchful-looking brothers star in
the film as conjoined twins, Blake (Mark) and Francis (Michael)
Falls, whose delicately balanced interdependence provides a rare
brand of tension.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which the Polish brothers wrote and Michael directed,
begins as the twins encounter a wild, gorgeous young woman named
Penny (Michele Hicks, a former model) in an interestingly desolate
hotel. It's a setting that the cinematographer, M. David Mullen,
photographs with bleak and painterly precision. And it is here that
the brothers' differences begin to emerge, with Francis as the
stronger figure, and the one most powerfully drawn to Penny.
Imagine how a Siamese twin might conduct a courtship, and imagine
this rendered with intense acuity and no gimmicks. Then you have
some idea of how tricky ``Twin Falls Idaho'' eventually becomes.
</P>
<P>
   Because Blake is the weaker and more dependent of the two, and
because the situation's menage a trois possibilities are
unavoidable, the film explores aspects of symbiotic relationships
that nonconjoined viewers will easily understand. It also has
strong, offbeat atmosphere and a richly perverse sense of mischief
where the twins are concerned. A pivotal part of the film unfolds
on Halloween, when the Falls boys impress strangers with their
marvelous costume (a two-armed, three-legged suit) and attend a
party where they seem like the most normal people in the room.
Though the twins have done time as a circus attraction, the film
itself never treats them like freaks.
</P>
<P>
   With an especially affecting performance by Michael Polish as
the story's dominant figure, and with Ms. Hicks a striking
kohl-eyed presence even when she struggles with the story's more
demanding scenes, ``Twin Falls Idaho'' has style, gravity and
originality to spare. It's a film that dwells as hauntingly on
loneliness as it does on never actually being able to be alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twin Falls Idaho'' will be shown Friday and Saturday as part
of the New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art.

`NEVER BEEN KISSED' PREDICTABLE, RARELY FUNNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore's first foray as executive producer in ``Never
Been Kissed'' certainly gives her a lot of close-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In this predictable Cinderella story of a nerdy Chicago
Sun-Times copy editor who gets her big chance by going back to high
school to write an undercover expose on student/teacher relations,
Barrymore stacks the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Her character is so intent upon repairing her own traumatic
teenage experience that she can barely do her job. By focusing on
becoming popular, she ignores deadlines, and finds true love.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to give Barrymore credit for portraying herself as
the ungainliest of geeks, but as a newspaperwoman she's about as
believeable as Julia Roberts' hooker in ``Pretty Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Never Been Kissed,'' Barrymore plays Josie Geller, a nerdy,
virginal 25-year-old copy editor on one of Chicago's two big daily
papers. She might have her own office, which is a feat in itself,
but Josie hasn't even been ``properly kissed,'' she tells her
libidinous best friend, Anita (Molly Shannon).
</P>
<P>
   Her dream is to be a reporter, but she can't get her editor, the
seasoned Gus (John C. Reilly), to give her a chance. Then the
paper's owner (played by Garry Marshall) assigns her to an
undercover expose: She has to find a story somewhere in the
hallowed halls of high school.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her joy, Josie has a problem. She was a total zero with
braces in school, humiliated on prom night and called ``Josie
Grossie'' by the other kids. Her brother, Rob (David Arquette) was
the popular kid, though his life is now on the skids. This could be
her big chance to redeem herself from her nightmares and bad
memories. But will history repeat itself or will Josie finally get
a date with the most popular guy in school?
</P>
<P>
   It's not too tough to see what's coming in this only
occasionally amusing romantic comedy. Barrymore goes out on a limb
to act the geek and, indeed, those are the films best (and meanest)
moments.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no real conflict or friction at the story's core and
there are so many incidental bits that the lessons Josie learns
feel hackneyed and tacked on. We know what will happen within the
first half hour. Barrymore is whinily bland, as is Michael Vartan,
in a thankless role as the school's handsome, popular English
teacher, who takes an interest in Josie.
</P>
<P>
   It's a small role by LeeLee Sobieski, who gave an impassioned
performance in last year's ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,''
that stands out. She's Josie's new best school friend, an offbeat
chemistry and calculus whiz named Aldys. When Josie finally
achieves status and becomes everything she never was the first time
around, the pain of rejection is evidently clear on Sobieski's
face. She scoops Barrymore in every scene of this painfully tepid
effort.
</P>
<P>

Kohn, Marc Silverstein. Cast: Drew Barrymore, David Arquette, Molly
Shannon, LeeLee Sobieski. 20th Century Fox. 100 minutes. Rated

IN ART, TOO, THE SOUND IS SPOOKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
 (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It may seem odd that a video artist like Douglas Gordon
should be drawn to Alfred Hitchcock's ``Vertigo'' by its
soundtrack. But having previously manipulated the images of movies
like Hitchcock's ``Psycho'' and Rouben Mamoulian's ``Dr. Jekyll and
Hyde,'' Gordon wanted this time to probe the psychological
dimension of music scores. And with ``Vertigo,'' a good measure of
the spookiness of the 1958 thriller starring James Stewart and Kim
Novak is provided by Bernard Herrmann's music.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, `Vertigo' was the single most generic sound I could
associate with cinema,'' Gordon said. ``I tested it on people. I
played it and asked people to identify it. Everyone knew that it
was not written by a classic composer, and that it was a cinema
score. But no one could place it as `Vertigo.' It was what I was
looking for. It was the sound of cinema for an entire generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Feature Film,'' a cinematic installation in
which Gordon, 32, separates the music from the movie, then brings
them together again in an unexpected way. The work, which has been
commissioned by Artangel, an independent arts organization that
promotes art installations in unusual venues, is on view through
May 3 at the Atlantis Gallery in the Spitalfields district of East
London. The gallery is, in fact, the loftlike second floor of a
former beer brewery. (And, coincidentally, the project has been
sponsored by Beck's, a beer company.)
</P>
<P>
   The space is filled with the lush soundtrack of ``Vertigo,''
which appears to be coming from a large screen that almost divides
the 150-foot-long room. The only images on the screen, though, are
flashes of the hands, arms, eyes, face and hair of a man who
appears to be conducting the score. At the far end of the hall,
``Vertigo'' itself is being projected onto a side wall, but without
sound. Thus, when dialogue is spoken during the 122-minute movie,
there is silence in the gallery. The music, 80 minutes of it, is
alone used to set the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, a wiry and good-natured graduate of both the Glasgow
School of Art in his hometown and the Slade School in London, sees
the work as a new step in his investigation into duality. In ``24
Hour Psycho'' in 1993, for instance, he projected Hitchcock's film
in shuddering slow motion over 24 hours _ and here Herrmann's score
was pointedly missing.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Confessions of a Justified Sinner,'' he took three
sequences from the 1932 ``Dr. Jekyll and Hyde'' and projected them
in slow motion in positive and negative images, like good and evil,
on two screens. In ``Divided Self,'' two screens show a hand
holding down an arm on a pillow: on one screen, a hairy arm holds
down a hairless arm, suggesting a woman's arm, and on the other the
roles are reversed (both arms in fact belong to the artist).
</P>
<P>
   These and other video works have placed Gordon at the forefront
of the current boom in contemporary art in Britain. He is not part
of the overheated London art scene led by Damien Hurst, prefering
to keep his base in Glasgow and to spend long stretches in Germany
and, now, in New York. He has nonetheless been gaining recognition
at an impressive pace: he won Britain's Turner Prize in 1996, the
Premio 2000 at the Venice Biennale in 1997 and the Guggenheim's
Hugo Boss Prize in 1998. He currently has two exhibitions in New
York: an installation inspired by Otto Preminger's 1949 movie,
``Whirlpool,'' at the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea, and a
gallery show featuring a scene from Martin Scorsese's ``Taxi
Driver'' at Gagosian in Soho.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, he was invited to develop a project by Artangel,
which first gained notice when the organization sponsored Rachel
Whiteread's ``House,'' the cast of the inside of a Victorian
terraced house, and has since worked with Robert Wilson and Hans
Peter Kuhn, Gabriel Orozco, Tatsuo Miyajima, Ilya and Emilia
Kabakov and other international artists. What appealed to Gordon
was that he was given all the time he needed to come up with an
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was conscious that most of my work was silent,'' he
recalled. ``My principal concern was psychological, and I had
always felt the principal instigation for psychological reactions
was the visual. But audio also interested me. I had done a piece,
`Something Between My Mouth and Your Ear,' which is a compilation
of all the songs that were popular when my mother was carrying me
between December 1965 and September 1966.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Feature Film,'' in seeking out an orchestral sound, Gordon
quickly found Herrmann, who composed for Orson Welles (``Citizen
Kane''), Francois Truffaut (``The Bride Wore Black''), Scorsese
(``Taxi Driver'') as well as for Hitchcock. A New York-born
conductor and composer who died in 1975 at age 64, Herrmann's roots
were in classical music, with the score for ``Vertigo'' showing the
influence of both Wagner and Mahler. And long before rock and pop
took over the screen, he exercised enormous influence over how many
moviegoers came to  &UR; hear &LR;  films.
</P>
<P>
   Having chosen ``Vertigo,'' Gordon then set out to find the
``star'' of the images accompanying the music. He rejected the idea
of using an actor because he wanted a real conductor working with a
real orchestra, but he also wanted a conductor who looked like an
actor. And after weeks of surfing the Internet, he cast James
Conlon, the youthful-looking 47-year-old music director of the
Paris National Opera. As it happens, he had never before heard of
Conlon _ and Conlon had never heard of Gordon. But this proved no
obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Douglas and James Lingwood of Artangel came to see me in Paris
and explained the whole project,'' the mop-haired American
conductor recalled. ``I said, `This is great, what you really need
is a guinea pig.' But it sounded like fun. I like experimental
things. I love movies, so I said, OK I hadn't seen any of Gordon's
work. I still haven't. I operate on chemistry. I had a gut feeling
that he had something. Maybe it was his Glaswegian accent.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with the Paris Opera Orchestra in a theater in Radio
France, Conlon first recorded the score, with Gordon testing his
equipment and camera positions. Three weeks later, using three
Super 16 cameras, Gordon began filming Conlon, who was wearing a
black turtleneck sweater and stood against the void of the darkened
theater. The afternoon session was treated as a performance, with
Conlon following the movie on a small monitor (occasionally faint
snatches of dialogue can be heard in the silent sections ``almost
like the spirit of cinema,'' as Gordon put it). Finally, there was
a session in which Conlon did act, conducting the recorded score
without an orchestra (``Much as Herbert von Karajan did for his
filmed performances,'' Gordon noted).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to strike a line between pure documentary and pure
narrative,'' Gordon explained over a beer in a pub near the
Spitalfields gallery, ``to achieve a sort of hybrid between
Hollywood fiction and contemporary documentary filmmaking. Since
you never see the orchestra, and Conlon is not dressed formally and
has no baton, there is the possibility that there is no orchestra
and no conductor. Anyone who knows the music world will recognize
Conlon, but most people won't get it. They'll just see a great
screen presence.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of hiring the 100-piece Paris orchestra, the Radio
France theater and the Atlantis Gallery pushed the project's budget
to over $400,000, but the work will also travel to the Georges
Pompidou Center in Paris, which produced the installation with
Artangel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was paid a very modest fee and get to keep the two
turtlenecks I conducted in,'' Conlon said cheerfully in a telephone
interview from New York, where he is currently conducting a new
production of Carlisle Floyd's opera, ``Susannah,'' at the
Metropolitan Opera. ``Artangel apologized that I wasn't going to
make a lot of money. I said, `I make a lot of money, I don't care.
I'm interested in doing something fun and different.'''
</P>
<P>
   And there was an unexpected extra, too. ``I went back and looked
at `Vertigo' again,'' he added. ``I didn't remember, but it is very
good music indeed. Now I'm much more interested in Bernard Herrmann
than I was before the project.''

`SCHOOL OF FLESH' A HAUNTING CHARACTER STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   French critics are forever crying that Hollywood values are
destroying their beloved national cinema but, in at least one
respect, U.S. movies seem to have little or no impact: Gallic films
are still packed with great roles for women.
</P>
<P>
   While you can count the number of solid star vehicles for
actresses in Hollywood films each year on one hand, almost every
French film has a great woman's role. Why is this? Clearly, they
like women more than we do. They think they're fascinating
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the chief pleasure of seeing Benoit Jacquot's
``The School of Flesh'' is the close-up spectacle of Isabelle
Huppert in almost every second of its 100 minutes. It's not that
she eats the scenery, either. She actually underplays the role in a
performance of immense subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   Based on one of the many novels of twisted passion by Japan's
Yukio Mishima, it's the story of Dominique (Huppert), a rather
cold-blooded, fortyish career woman who goes to a club one night
and falls in quiet, smoldering lust with Quentin (Vincent
Martinez), a young, part-Arab bartender.
</P>
<P>
   It's soon apparent the young man is bad news _ a cruel, abusive,
game-playing user and part-time male prostitute to boot. But she
doesn't care: she likes the unromantic, even mechanical approach he
brings to the sex act; she enjoys her humiliation at his feet; and
begs to become his ``sugar daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   The script follows the stumbling stages of their off-and-on
affair, which comes to a crisis after an abortive holiday in North
Africa when he meets and finds himself attracted to the nubile
young daughter (Roxanne Mesquida) of Dominique's best friend
(Marthe Keller).
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar story, and, frankly, the script doesn't do
anything remarkably new with it. As insouciantly played by Martinez
(younger brother of French star Olivier Martinez), Quentin is
simply never interesting enough for us to care much one way or
another who gets him.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the movie is mesmerizing _ in the same way that almost
any '40s Hollywood vehicle of Bette Davis or Joan Crawford is
mesmerizing. Jacquot's camera stays firmly riveted to Huppert's
face as it conveys her character's every thought and emotion.
Inadequate as the film may be in other respects, it's a haunting
character study and a terrific star vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The School of Flesh. Directed by Benoit Jacquot. Written by
Jacques Fieschi, from a novel by Yukio Mishima. Cast: Isabelle
Huppert, Vincent Martinez, Marthe Keller, Vincent Lindon.
Stratosphere Entertainment. 101 minutes. In French with English
subtitles. Rated R for sex scenes.

ANTARCTICA: AS GORGEOUS AND DEADLY TODAY AS EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Standing astern of Shackleton's whaleboat while watching
computer-generated waves play across movie screens off her bows, I
could almost feel the sting of freezing brine thrown up by the
mountainous Cape Horn rollers.
</P>
<P>
   The vantage point, of course, was on dry land in New York inside
the American Museum of Natural History, and the 22{-foot boat, the
James Caird, now nearly a century old, was part of the exhibition
opening Saturday, April 10, called ``The Endurance: Shackleton's
Legendary Antarctic Expedition.'' But so convincing are those big
video waves that a person could get seasick watching.
</P>
<P>
   The show is a memorial to Sir Ernest Shackleton and the stamina
of his 27 shipmates during their hellish 22-month voyage over water
and ice at the bottom of the world. But it is as much about
Antarctica itself as it is about Shackleton's heroes, and to anyone
who has spent time on the White Continent, it must touch a resonant
chord.
</P>
<P>
   Antarctica is as beautiful as it was in Shackleton's day, and it
is still deadly dangerous; some things don't change. It has been 83
years since Shackleton's Endurance saga ended, but the seafaring
memorabilia and the photographs that make up this beautiful
exhibition seem almost modern in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   During my five sojourns in Antarctica since 1974, all under the
auspices of the National Science Foundation, I have come to
understand (in a small way) the peculiar magnetism of the place.
People have always journeyed to Antarctica to profit, to glimpse
its incredible beauty and to probe its scientific secrets. But they
also go partly to taste the continent's inherent danger and the
thrill of risk taking, however large or small the risk may be.
</P>
<P>
   Something deep down in most people yearns for adventure, and
Antarctica is an icon for adventure.
</P>
<P>
   There have been enormous technological changes since the glory
years and derring-do of Roald Amundsen, Robert F. Scott, Douglas
Mawson, Adm. Richard Byrd and a legion of other polar explorers.
Gone are the dog sledges and skis on which explorers formerly
traveled, now replaced by snowmobiles, motorized sledge trains,
C-130 cargo planes, helicopters and Zodiac boats.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation over the continent's trackless wastes no longer
depends on compass and sextant; today the global positioning
satellite system informs travelers exactly where they are at all
times. Satellites have also provided such efficient voice
communication that the sense of isolation people often felt as
recently as 20 years ago has mostly vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Antarcticans are no longer compelled to nourish themselves with
``hoosh'' _ the disgusting stew of seal or penguin meat mixed with
lard, flour, cocoa, sugar, salt and water that fed many generations
of polar travelers. There are modern galleys with fine chefs at all
the big stations now, and even in the field, most travelers eat
fairly well.
</P>
<P>
   The sights are stunning: towering blue, white and green icebergs
and giant penguin rookeries near Palmer Station on the Antarctic
Peninsula; vistas of the snow-covered Transantarctic Mountains
across the sound at McMurdo; dancing solar halos around the sun at
the South Pole. Even winter, when most of the continent is shrouded
in continuous darkness for four months, has its beauties,
especially the shimmering aurora australis.
</P>
<P>
   The subfreezing cold that perpetually grips most of the
continent takes snapshots of life that never fade. The Ross Island
huts used by Scott, Shackleton and other explorers from 1902 to
1914 look much as they did when they were occupied by expeditions.
They are still littered with discarded trash and the carcasses of
seals and penguins slaughtered for meat, as well as the 89-year-old
body of a husky dog that looks as if it just died. Ancient copies
of The London Illustrated News and other early-20th-century reading
matter in some of the old huts evoke the ghosts of storybook
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   These days, tourists aboard cruise ships go to Antarctica to
savor its special flavor, and a veneer of security seemingly
protects visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But even tourism carries risks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst aviation accidents in history occurred on Nov.
28, 1979, when an Air New Zealand passenger plane on a sightseeing
flight was swept by a powerful downdraft onto the slopes of Mount
Erebus, a volcano on Ross Island. All 257 people aboard were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year alone, the National Science Foundation
estimates, 10 people have been killed in Antarctica, several of
them in the crash of a Russian helicopter making a scientific
flight.
</P>
<P>
   People still mistake snow bridges for solid ice and fall to
their deaths in concealed crevasses.
</P>
<P>
   Antarctica is the coldest place on earth; a temperature of minus
129 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded in 1983 at Russia's Vostok
Station on the South Polar Plateau. Clad in parka, wind pants,
thermal boots, bear-paw gloves and so forth, a traveler finds such
temperatures bearable, but vigilance is always needed. Many a time
a companion has warned me that my nose had turned white: a signal
of frostbite.
</P>
<P>
   This was nothing compared with the suffering undergone by one of
my polar friends, Liv Arnesen. A 40-year-old Oslo schoolteacher,
she set out in 1994 to become the first woman to ski unaccompanied
from the edge of the Antarctic continent to the South Pole. I
happened to be at the pole when she arrived on Christmas Eve 1994:
still dogged, her face torn by the elements and her endurance
practically exhausted. To clear ice crystals from her goggles, she
had frequently removed her gloves to scratch the rime away during
her 50-day, 720-mile trek, and her fingers were so frostbitten that
the South Pole Station surgeon had to amputate part of her
gangrenous thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later Ms. Arnesen was helping with the cooking in the
station galley, and ``yarning'' cheerfully with her new American
friends.
</P>
<P>
   She survived, but two of my other friends were less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Palmer Station is a small American scientific post on an island
just off the Antarctic Peninsula. Most of its heavy supplies are
brought by a small icebreaker from Punta Arenas, a port on the
Chilean coast of Tierra del Fuego.
</P>
<P>
   These trips are usually arduous. The stretch of water between
Punta Arenas and the Antarctic Peninsula, known as the Drake
Passage, has been famous since the 17th century for its mountainous
waves, hurricane-force winds and savagely unpredictable weather.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 I spent some time cruising the Drake Passage aboard the
Erebus, a French ship chartered by the National Science Foundation
to carry freight and scientists between Punta Arenas and Palmer
Station. I got to know the vessel's first mate, a 38-year-old
American mariner and adventurer named Mark Eichenberger.
</P>
<P>
   Mark had sailed under all conditions and had achieved modest
fame in 1988 when he and three companions paddled a modified
aluminum canoe 600 miles across the Drake Passage from Punta Arenas
to Antarctica: an incredible achievement.
</P>
<P>
   But during Christmas week 1991, the sea had its revenge. I had
left the Erebus at its dock at Punta Arenas when a sudden storm
swept ashore from the Drake Passage. The only officer aboard, Mark
ran out on deck to tighten the hawsers and secure the ship against
the onslaught, but a huge wave crashed over him, and he was swept
out to sea. His body was never found.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 I lost another friend, Bruno Zehnder, to Antarctica's
treachery. Bruno was a Swiss photographer famous for his eagerness
to take on any danger for the sake of a good picture. His style and
artistic touches reminded me of Frank Hurley, the photographer
whose images of the Endurance expedition grace the new museum
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   In his last years Bruno made his living mostly by photographing
Antarctic penguins, especially the big (and very photogenic)
emperor penguins that breed in the darkness of midwinter. In July
1997 (midwinter in Antarctica) Bruno had arranged to spend several
months at Russia's Mirnyy Station on the Antarctic coast along the
Indian Ocean. On July 7 he was out as usual looking for subjects
close to the Mirnyy huts when a violent storm struck. So much snow
was blowing, the Russians later said, that visibility beyond about
one yard was nil.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno did not return, and when the storm finally abated, the
Russians started searching. They found his frozen body less than
100 yards from the station.
</P>
<P>
   In the Swiss village of Bad Ragaz, where Bruno grew up, his
friends and family are building a small memorial, a circle of stone
penguins with their beaks bowed in sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Like Shackleton's whaleboat in its temporary berth at the Museum
of Natural History, the stone penguins memorialize all those who
gave their lives to a beautiful but unmerciful continent.

`COOKIE'S FORTUNE' A MOST LIKABLE ALTMAN FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Altman once said that his basic philosophy of filmmaking
was to gather the best possible ensemble of actors, take them to
some interesting location, allow them to play with their roles and
improvise some of their dialogue, and then hope something magical
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it does _ witness such classics as ``MASH,'' ``McCabe
and Mrs. Miller'' and ``The Player.'' Sometimes, perhaps more
often, it doesn't _ witness such travesties as ``Popeye,''
``Buffalo Bill and the Indians'' and ``Quintet.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, ``Cookie's Fortune'' _ Altman's 33rd feature film in 42
years of trying _ is one of his most magical brews. Indeed, it
would be hard to think of a more completely likable Altman film or
one in which the chemistry of his cast seemed more perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the (real) small-town of Holly Springs, Miss., it's a
rambling, amiable story about what happens when a pipe-smoking
Southern dowager named Cookie (Patricia O'Neal) commits suicide in
order to join her beloved late husband.
</P>
<P>
   Stumbling upon the body, Cookie's scheming, slightly crazed
niece, Camille (Glenn Close), eats the suicide note and concocts a
string of ``evidence'' to make the death look like murder _ because
``suicides don't happen'' in their family.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately (and unintentionally), this concocted evidence
gradually points to Cookie's handyman, Willis (Charles S. Dutton),
an easy-going, middle-aged black man who has been sharing the house
with her in a kind of ``Driving Miss Daisy'' relationship.
</P>
<P>
   This is the set-up of the movie, and at this point we might
naturally expect the proceedings to turn into one more
heavy-handed, self-righteous indictment of racism in the small-town
South _ especially since Willis is so downright lovable and such an
obvious potential martyr.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Cookie's Fortune'' goes against all expectations to be a
lazy, irresistibly good-natured little comedy in which race is
ultimately not much of an issue, and just about everyone in this
small town _ excluding Close's character _ is a fairly decent human
being. It's Mayberry, not Mississippi Burning.
</P>
<P>
   As usual in an Altman movie, a wide assortment of characters
wander in and out of the storyline: Ned Beatty as a sheriff who'd
rather be fishing; Donald Moffat as the town's affable only lawyer;
Courtney B. Vance as a frustrated state prosecutor; Julianne Moore
as Camille's addled sister and co-conspirator.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as in only the best Altman, every character seems to click
into place. As Cookie's free-spirited grand-niece, Liv Tyler has
never been more movie-star radiant. As Cookie, veteran movie-great
O'Neal gives a blissfully broad and fearless performance. Even
Chris O'Donnell _ the town's Barney Fife of a deputy _ is a welcome
part of this inspired ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   The film comes together to be less the wild farce and scathing
satire that its publicity promises than a mellow comedy of
character that communicates a gentle acceptance of human nature in
general and family eccentricity in particular _ a film that likes
its characters so much that it's impossible not to feel the same
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, ``Cookie's Fortune'' has the same kind of uncanny
authenticity that Altman was able to give 1902 Puget Sound in
``McCabe and Mrs. Miller,'' '90s Hollywood in ``The Player'' and
'70s Nashville in ``Nashville.'' Few directors convey a sense of
time and place so convincingly, and this most convincing vision of
the post-civil rights Mississippi is a place that's definitely
worth a two-hour visit.
</P>
<P>
   Cookie's Fortune. Directed by Robert Altman. Screenplay by Anne
Rapp. Cast: Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Liv Tyler, Patricia
O'Neal, Charles S. Dutton, Chris O'Donnell, Ned Beatty. October
Films. 118 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual references.

`GO' A JOYRIDE THAT RARELY DOWNSHIFTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Swingers pushed first-time director Doug Liman into the
limelight. ``Go'' will keep him there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swingers'' was an acquired taste, and people either loved or
hated it (I was in the second group), but ``Go'' displays Liman's
storytelling as well as moviemaking abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he borrows from the ``Pulp Fiction'' school of structure,
dividing his tale of six young people from Los Angeles who share
one night of crime and chaos, into three intertwining chapters. But
he also constructs _ from a script by John August _ a scary, darkly
funny and suspenseful film that surprises and engages at every turn
and became an audience favorite at this year's Sundance Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go'' features a terrific up-and-coming cast. Canadian Sarah
Polley, who was so good in ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' Scott Wolf from
TV's ``Party Of Five,'' Jay Mohr, Katie Holmes from ``Dawson's
Creek,'' William Fichtner, Desmond Askew, Taye Diggs and Timothy
Olyphant are among the ensemble who wreak havoc through L.A. and
Liman's favorite haunt, Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Ronna (Polley) is a supermarket clerk who is on the verge of
being evicted from her apartment. Her co-worker, Simon (Askew),
offers her some money up front if she'll take his shift so he can
go to Vegas with his buddies. Claire (Holmes) is the bystander who
becomes embroiled in Ronna's scheme to score some extra bucks.
</P>
<P>
   When two TV stars, Zack (Mohr) and Adam (Wolf), show up at the
store looking for Simon, who has been their drug dealer in the
past, Ronna decides she can turn the deal instead, especially since
Simon is out of town. She cajoles Simon's supplier, Todd Gaines
(Olyphant), into giving her the stash. But everything goes awry
when Ronna smells a rat and Todd finds he's been stung.
</P>
<P>
   Over in Vegas, Simon discovers that idle hands are truly the
devil's playthings. After he runs out of money at the casino, he
takes up with a couple of young women while best pal Marcus (Diggs)
is still at the tables. Simon's over-enthusiasm lands all the
friends in trouble and soon they've stolen a car, shot a strip club
bouncer, and are being pursued at high speed through the Vegas
streets.
</P>
<P>
   These disparate pieces manage to fall into place and create a
throroughly enjoyable, fast-paced movie that reminds us what it's
like to live on the edge and to react with the impulsive energy of
youth.
</P>
<P>
   While the best thing about ``Swingers'' was Liman's use of the
camera, he's equally up to the task here. He gives us a Los Angeles
that is as eerie and unworldly as it is familiar and his ability to
use cinematography as a storytelling tool has refined and
developed.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, most of the credit must go the vibrancy of
August's script and a cast whose lively performances even manage to
make unlikeable characters accessible. ``Go'' is a joyride that
rarely downshifts; it's unpredictability is its strongest asset.
</P>
<P>
   Go. Directed by Doug Liman. Written by John August. Cast: Taye

   India: A secure (and noisy) place for birds
</P>
<P>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER
</P>
<P>
   We awoke in the bird sanctuary of Bharatpur to the shrieks of
peacocks, the mimicry of magpie robins and the assorted cries,
tweets, cheeps and caws of one of the most astonishing
concentrations of avian life on the planet. My husband, Barry, and
my son, Max, 8, complained that the racket had disturbed their
slumber.
</P>
<P>
   The birds here in the Keoladeo National Park, near Agra, home to
the Taj Mahal, are not a shy bunch. Sparrows fly boldly into the
restaurant of the Forest Lodge to perch on chairs. Big-bodied Sarus
cranes take stately flight from the marshlands, soaring over the
narrow main road and buzzing bare-legged tourists who stand gawking
through binoculars. Purple herons, Indian rollers and rose-ringed
parakeets fish and catch insects and even kiss right in plain view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birds feel very secure in this place,'' said Shruti
Sharma, deputy chief wildlife warden for the Indian Forest Service
and the director of the park.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always like this. The sanctuary, one of the most
popular tourist attractions in India, was the creation of the
Maharajah of the princely state of Bharatpur, who wanted a place to
shoot wildfowl. He deepened and extended a marshland at the
confluence of the Gambhir and Banganga Rivers, constructed
embankments to contain the monsoon downpours and diverted water
from a nearby irrigation canal into the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The birds flocked to his marshy trap in the vast Gangetic plain
from Siberia, China and Central Asia. ``The coots followed the same
route as Ghengis Khan,'' Mrs. Sharma said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1902, the Maharajah's creation became a playground for
aristocratic colonialists and Indian royalty. A wall of shame still
stands in the middle of the park, engraved with the number of birds
bagged on notable outings. On Nov. 12, 1938, the shooting party of
Lord Linlithgow, the British Viceroy of India, killed 4,273 birds
in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, nine years after India gained its independence from
Britain, the reserve became a bird sanctuary, then, in 1981, a
national park covering just over 11 square miles. It is a four-hour
drive from Delhi on the so-called golden triangle for tourists,
with Delhi at its northern point, Jaipur to the southwest and Agra
to the southeast. Perhaps the best time to visit the park is from
November to February, when the great migrations of birds from
northern climes sail into the park. They are enticed not only by
the marshland habitats but also by grasslands and woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   By early March this year, many of the migratory birds had
already left, but the splendor of the remaining creatures was still
remarkable _ predatory eagles and knobby-kneed storks and green
bee-eaters. White-breasted kingfishers, with their plumage of
iridescent cobalt blue, swooped from acacia trees. Snake birds, so
called because of their long necks, sat with their black,
silver-streaked wings spread to dry in the sun. ``In no other park
can you see so many birds in such a short time in such a small
space,'' Mrs. Sharma said.
</P>
<P>
   The park managers have tried to maintain the park's pristine
condition by keeping out cars and jeeps. But the park is not immune
to ecological pressures. Farms come right up against the stone wall
that surrounds the park. Sometimes, farmers knock down the walls so
their cattle can get in to graze illegally. The pesticides and
fertilizers they use on their crops wind up in the water that comes
into the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, the pesticides will affect the fertility of
the birds,'' Mrs. Sharma said. ``Eggshell thinning takes place.
Even before eggs hatch, they crack.'' The park workers also battle
exotic plants that infest the park, choking out indigenous plant
life.
</P>
<P>
   But the sanctuary is still a magical world unto itself. On a
recent morning, a spotted owl of softest doe brown perched in a
tree with his eyes closed. ``He looks just like Mr. Brown in
`Squirrel Nutkin,''' Max said _ and it did.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to Keoladeo National Park, (91-5644) 22777, fax
(91-5644) 22555, costs $2.35. Tourists can explore on foot, or rent
a boat for about 50 cents a person an hour, or a bicycle for 50
cents a day. Or for 70 cents an hour, they can hire one of 108
bicycle rickshaw drivers who have taken an intensive bird-watching
course.
</P>
<P>
   The nearby Bharatpur Forest Lodge, (91-5644) 22760, fax

   Washington State: Sitting and waiting for killer whales
</P>
<P>
   By TIMOTHY EGAN We settled not long ago into a perch in the
rocks that rise above the far western edge of the continent, ready
for marine theater below. It can try the patience of an urban
American to watch and wait for something that may not even come.
But at Lime Kiln Point State Park, a half-day's trip from Seattle
on the western shore of Washington's San Juan Island, that is what
you do.
</P>
<P>
   Killer whales are the show. Not the orcas of Sea World or Free
Willy, but the wild natives that live year-round in the salt water
north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Lime Kiln Point, established in 1984 as perhaps the only park in
the country dedicated exclusively to whale watching, is a front-row
seat. On average, dozens of whales, from three resident pods, will
swim by once or twice a day. Some days, though, they never show.
</P>
<P>
   For us, the curtain rose in late afternoon, about an hour into
our vigil. ``I see a fin!'' my 8-year-old son shouted, as a dorsal
fin pierced the water. Then came a burst of exhaled water, and a
crowd of whales.
</P>
<P>
   Soon they were breaching, spy hopping and doing all the other
frolicking that are trademarks of Puget Sound orcas. They swam
within 50 yards of shore, in the swift current of Haro Strait. In
an hour, more than 50 passed by.
</P>
<P>
   As an eco-tourism experience, watching whales in the San Juans
is definitely not a solitary pursuit. Last year, 185,000 people
visited the park _ by land alone. As we watched with about 15 other
visitors, some people applauded, but most just oohed and aahed, as
if at a fireworks spectacle. It was a wondrous event, and not all
that unusual. ``We estimate that about 25 percent of the people who
come to the park will see whales,'' said Chris Guidotti, a park
ranger.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Black and white killer whales, hopelessly misnamed, chase sea
otters, salmon and myriad varieties of fish, but they do not seem
to mind humans. If anything, they seem to show off for them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they are predators at the top of their food chain.
Federal law prohibits people from getting closer than 100 yards to
the whales. But kayakers, tour boats and other vessels get around
the law by simply positioning themselves in the usual path of the
orcas, then wait to be surrounded. Last year, a woman even paddled
out in the cold water on an air mattress. She may have seen too
many friendly whale movies: the crash of two whales around her gave
her enough of a scare to send her back to shore, Mr. Guidotti said.
</P>
<P>
   Just over 100 whales live year-round in several pods around the
San Juans. The orcas are the source of a booming business for tour
boats, kayak rentals and bed-and-breakfasts in nearby Friday
Harbor. But biologists wonder if there will soon come a time when
too many oglers start to change the behavior of the whales.
</P>
<P>
   The park, basically a parking lot and about a milelong trail
along the bluff, is limiting land visitors this season to 53
carloads _ what can be accommodated in the parking lot. But a visit
during the week, or in the off season (other than summer), can
still bring the kind of personal encounter that makes people fall
in love with killer whales.
</P>
<P>
   Lime Kiln Point State Park is three to four hours from Seattle,
including car and ferry rides. There's no admission charge.
Information: (800) 233-0321.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington State ferry from Anacortes, about 90 miles north
of Seattle, makes five to seven round trips a day to Friday Harbor,
on the opposite side of the island from the park. Round-trip fares
are $17.25 for a car and its driver and $5.10 a passenger.
Information: (206) 464-6400, www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycles can be rented in Friday Harbor to ride to the park, and
there will be a shuttle bus from the dock to the park starting this
week, for $7 round trip; (360) 378-8887. A ride on one of the tour
boats from Friday Harbor or Roche Harbor Resort costs about $40 to
$50. _TIMOTHY EGAN is a national correspondent for The Times, based

<P>
   South Africa: Getting face to face with a great white
</P>
<P>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr
</P>
<P>
   I saw the great white, and she saw me, and I'm sure she was a
lot less impressed than I was. Had she been able to peer into the
boat, she would have seen nine off-green humans lying on their
backs with their eyes shut, trying to control the waves of nausea
rolling over them as they waited for two hours, anchored off
Gansbaai, South Africa, in a swelling sea under a hot sun, for a
shark to appear. Our captain, Gerrit Boshoff, and our dive master,
Schalk De Klerk, remained irritatingly perky, lolling on the
outboard motors only 18 inches above the water, telling jokes and
occasionally asking solicitously, ``How you doing, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   Our situation wasn't helped by the first spot we had stopped:
Dyer Island, home to more than 20,000 Cape fur seals, which is why
great whites are always nearby. Seals en masse under the African
sun smell like nothing else on earth.
</P>
<P>
   We were now far enough away to make the reeking hordes only an
aromatic landscape. Then Schalk dropped overboard 50 pounds of
slimy fish liver, two shark's heads, and a last macabre bit of
bait: a floating cutout of a baby seal.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, the cry rose: ``Shark! Shark! Who's first in
the cage?'' We staggered to our feet; the bravest jumping to the
port side to gape at the smallish six-footer. I lurched starboard,
and was trying to be discreet about my problems when she _ when the
shark turned sideways, there were no claspers of a male to be seen
_ circled the boat and regarded me with a baleful eye.
</P>
<P>
   Six of us were divers and due to take turns slipping into the
two-person steel cage tied alongside to watch her from underwater.
As it turned out, only the first pair got a turn, and, with
visibility at four feet, they barely saw her. Far from being the
ravenous monster of ``Jaws,'' she was cautious, circling the baits
repeatedly before mouthing one gently _ although a big shark's
three-ton bite pressure makes ``gently'' a relative term.
</P>
<P>
   After a dozen passes, she left. After two more stomach-bending
hours, we gave up. Luckier visitors, on calm, cool days in July and
August, have seen up to 30, shark captains claim. There is even one
skipper who grabs the sharks' noses, getting them to open their
jaws for photographers. (His name won't be revealed here, but
someday it'll be Lefty.)
</P>
<P>
   There is some controversy over great white viewing, which has
gone on for 17 years but increased three years ago. Shark attacks
on the South African coast surged last year to at least nine _ one
fatal _ compared with an average of four. The operators contend _
and shark biologists generally agree _ that it was a coincidence.
No attacks took place in Gansbaai or Mosselbaai, where the tour
boats go, and the bait they use is what fishermen cleaning their
catches always tossed overboard. Nothing the boats do encourages
sharks to think of humans as food. Annoying, perhaps, but not worth
snapping at.
</P>
<P>
   A day on the water looking for sharks costs $90 to $160,
including the use of scuba equipment, breakfast and lunch.
Operators are supposed to be licensed by the South African
Department of Sea Fisheries, but enforcement is erratic. Our boat,
operated by White Shark Ecoventures, for example, had no life
jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Gansbaai, the most popular spot, is a fishing village about two
hours from Cape Town by car. Tour operators will usually pick you
up early in the morning at any Cape Town hotel for $15 to $25.
Alternatively, they can arrange accommodations _ for as little as
$25 a night in some cases _ at guest houses or private homes in
Gansbaai. The boats don't go out in bad weather or if they don't
have enough passengers to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some boat operators: White Shark Ecoventures, (27-21)
419-8204; African Shark Ecoventures, (27-21) 788-4492; White Shark
Adventures, (27-28) 344-1380 or (27-28) 344-2519; White Shark
Expeditions, (27-83) 725-3186 or (27-21) 686-7041. _DONALD G.

DOCTOR KNOWS IT CAN HAPPEN TO MEN; IT HAPPENED TO HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Dr. Alan Johns stepped out of the shower one
evening about a year ago and was putting on his tux shirt for a big
formal auction at his daughter's school when he glanced down at his
chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My blood ran cold,'' he recalls. ``My nipple was inverted. I
reached up, and I could feel a tiny little bump under it. I felt
real cold, and I started sweating. I kept thinking, if I were a
woman, I would really be alarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth obstetrician/gynecologist has pointed out similar
suspicious lumps to hundreds of his patients over the past 20
years. He estimates that as many as 50 of them turned out to be
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he did nothing about the lump in his right breast until
the first week of June last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine was a typical case. I didn't tell anybody for three
months. I spent sleepless nights poking at it and telling myself it
was no bigger than the night before. I even tried to use my
ultrasound equipment on myself here in the office. That was pretty
dumb. I kept thinking, `I need to get it looked at, but it couldn't
be breast cancer. Men don't get breast cancer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Johns, who specializes in laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis
and other pelvic diseases, does most of his surgery on Mondays at
Harris Methodist Fort Worth. He decided he would get a radiologist
to check out the lump the first Monday afternoon he finished early,
but he never seemed to finish early.
</P>
<P>
   Two things finally prompted him to consult a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night, I sat down with a glass of wine and turned on the
TV without checking any schedule, and the topic of the news show _
`20/20,' I think it was _ just happened to be male breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had already looked up everything I could find on the subject
on the Internet, but that show took me by surprise _ like somebody
was trying to tell me something,'' Johns recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The following Sunday, he was out on the family boat at Possum
Kingdom Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have on a shirt, and suddenly my younger daughter
pointed at my chest, and said, `Eww, that's ugly. What is it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Johns shrugged off the question, but the next day when he
finished surgery, he walked over to the Doris Kupferle Breast
Center at Harris and asked a friend to take a look. When a sonogram
showed that the lump was solid, Johns asked the radiologist to take
a biopsy. He hand-delivered the tissue that same day to another
friend, a pathologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking into the microscope at the same time he was when
he diagnosed a ductal cell carcinoma,'' Johns says. ``I was totally
drained. I was hit hard by what I had known all along: It was
breast cancer. I was real scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Johns has had surgery and chemotherapy. He continues
to have follow-up mammograms and to take tamoxifen, a cancer drug
recently approved for the prevention of breast cancer in high-risk
patients, including those who have a history of breast cancer.
Tamoxifen halves the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chemo was a shock,'' Johns says. ``I had it in my mind
that once the cancer was cut out, that was the end of it, but after
surgery my doctor went over all the parameters of the tumor and
said my five-year survival rate was 85 percent _ and I had been
thinking 100. With chemo it would go to 92 percent, and with chemo
and tamoxifen, better than 95 percent. I opted for the best odds I
could get.''
</P>
<P>
   The chemotherapy ``made me terribly sick, and every time I
started to feel human again, it was time to hit me with it again.
My hair all fell out. I was balder than a bowling ball. I've had
hair, and I've been bald. I'll take hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Johns says, the hair loss is much easier for a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends would see me who didn't know I had cancer and ask
things like, `Did you lose a bet or something?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm taking tamoxifen for at least five years, maybe
forever, and I'm having hot flashes from it. That may be poetic
justice. I have a lot of patients with hot flashes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And, Johns admits, the mammograms are a little more traumatic
for him (''There's not much tissue there for them to squeeze'')
than he has, in the past, led his women patients to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society says 1,300 new cases of breast
cancer will be diagnosed in men in 1999. An estimated 400 men will
die of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Johns says the day after he was told the diagnosis, he gave his
sister the news, and she reminded him that an uncle _ their
father's brother _ died of breast cancer about 10 years ago,
although no one talked about what kind of cancer he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had totally forgotten that's what he had. For three months,
I was trying to convince myself that I couldn't possibly have
breast cancer, and here I had a family history,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Johns recently joined the board of the Fort Worth chapter of the
Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and will be running as a
breast cancer survivor in the five-kilometer division of this
year's Race for the Cure, along with his support team: wife, Jenny,
and two daughters, Julie and Jessica.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls that 22 years ago when he was a resident at John
Peter Smith Hospital, he would see women whose breast cancer was so
advanced, their tumors had broken through the skin before they were
finally diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't afford mammograms, and there were no free ones
to be had then,'' he recalls. ``That has changed. There shouldn't
be anyone in this community who can't get a mammogram today.''
</P>

   El Salvador: A park brimming with possibility
</P>
<P>
   By MIREYA NAVARRO
</P>
<P>
   El Salvador isn't the first country that comes to mind when
eco-tourism is mentioned. Much of the country has been deforested,
and air pollution often engulfs the capital, San Salvador, in a
hazy film. But two hours west of San Salvador on the Guatemalan
border, El Imposible National Park, a 12,000-acre tropical forest
in the Apaneca Mountains, is the last refuge for many wildlife
species that used to flourish all over the country before
agriculture, industry and urban sprawl encroached.
</P>
<P>
   The Government acquired most of the reserve from private owners
in the late 1970's and declared it a park in 1989, but it was not
until after 1992, when a 12-year civil war ended, that the park
became more inviting for visitors. Managed by the Ecological
Foundation of El Salvador (a private group known as Salva Natura),
El Imposible offers strenuous hiking and total seclusion. Trails
lead to thick vegetation, down to rivers and up to 360-degree views
of one of the few remaining Pacific coastal rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   The three main trails cover highly rugged topography, but not as
impossible to pass as when the park was named. Salva Natura warns
that even the shortest hikes can be challenging and recommends the
park ``to active people who enjoy natural adventures and hiking in
mountainous terrain.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most accessible hikes is the 40 minutes uphill from
the park entrance to El Mulo Lookout. It wends past coffee plants,
mahogany trees and iridescent butterflies and under a bamboo canopy
to a breathtaking view of the valley. Another hour or so of hiking
takes you to the peak of Cerro Leon (about 2,700 feet) for a
360-degree vista of the park and the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   A different 2.2-mile trail from the entrance also goes to El
Mulo, but then down a steep ravine to Piedra Sellada, a boulder
covered with rock carvings of unknown origins but thought to have
been used in religious activities during pre-Hispanic times. The
trail continues to Los Enganches, a canyon where two rivers meet _
a good spot to have a picnic lunch before heading back.
</P>
<P>
   The park, with elevations 800 to 4,600 feet, has at least 8
rivers, 400 types of trees and 279 bird species _ 115 of them
endangered _ mammals and reptiles. Some wildlife, like the great
curassow, a large bird, and the blue-crowned motmot, the
bright-colored national bird of El Salvador, are commonly sighted;
others, like the puma, ocelot and collared anteater, are rarely
seen and so are not considered dangerous to hikers.
</P>
<P>
   While the tourism infrastructure is still fairly primitive, the
park has camping areas with toilets and fire pits for cooking.
There is a small village outside the entrance, San Miguelito, where
local residents sell handicrafts and natural medicines. A new
restaurant, La Montana, serves Salvadoran fare _ beans, rice and
thick corn tortillas _ and small stores sell snacks and film.
</P>
<P>
   Park rangers serve as guides, and there are explanatory signs on
wildlife and vegetation on some of the trails. There are plans to
open a visitor's center in the park this year, with exhibits and a
museum, as well as a lodge with wood and bamboo cabins in San
Miguelito. A second entrance to the park is scheduled to open next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors who drive need a pickup or four-wheel-drive vehicle to
navigate the unpaved roads leading to the park. The park is
accessible even in the rainy season, from May to October.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to El Imposible is $6, and the trained guides cost an
extra $3.50 per group (tips are recommended). Visitors must obtain
a permit from Salva Natura, by calling (503) 263-1111 or faxing
(503) 263-3516. The Internet site, which is in Spanish, is
www.salvanatura.org.
</P>
<P>
   The United States National Park Service's Web site plans to
include information about this and other national parks in Central
America at www.nps.gov/crweb1/centralamerica/central-america.html.

   Brazil: A bit of jungle near Rio's beaches
</P>
<P>
   By LARRY ROHTER
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of thousands of visitors who travel to Rio de
Janeiro each year go there thinking not of eco-tourism but of sun,
sand and shopping. Yet within the limits of the sybaritic city lies
a natural wonder, Tijuca National Park and Forest, 13 sprawling
square miles of jungle, mountain peaks, trails and waterfalls that
offer travelers a miniversion of the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Known to Rio's residents as the city's ``green heart,'' the
Tijuca forest is said to be the largest urban nature reserve in the
world. But that should not inspire visions of a tame, neatly laid
out tropical equivalent of Central Park. The park is a thick and
wild tangle of exuberant vegetation, and exploring it can be more
adventure than bargained for: three or four times a year, hikers
stray too far off trails and rescue squads and helicopters are
called out to find them.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, some sections of the park, like the area around the
main entrance in Alto da Boa Vista, are designed more for Sunday
strollers than for serious backpackers. And no overnight camping is
permitted in the park. But a pair of recent visits, including a
guided hike with 19 other weekend warriors up a steep incline to
the top of Morro do Cochrane, altitude 2,334 feet, gave me at least
a sense of what the Portuguese bandeirantes found when they first
came through here 500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tijuca National Park is an Atlantic, rather than an Amazon, rain
forest, one of the few remaining pockets of such growth along a
Brazilian coastline that has been largely denuded for cities and
agriculture. Its trails meander through thickets of 100-foot trees
with exotic names: jaboticaba, ourico, imbauba, cupuacu, acai.
Occasionally, you come across orchids growing wild.
</P>
<P>
   Once into the heart of the forest, a cool stillness prevails.
The tree canopy blocks out most sound and light. It is so dense
that during a trek in March, I could hear thunder and heavy
rainfall above me, but all that trickled down onto my head was a
slight dewy drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Monkeys, especially the dominant marmoset species, are more
often heard than seen, though it is fairly common to come across
sloths and agoutis. Insect and bird life are ample, including
charming hummingbirds and colorful toucans. Over the years, I have
also encountered the Brazilian cousin of the opossum, the gamba,
and the raccoon, the coati.
</P>
<P>
   There are various ways to explore the forest, depending on one's
degree of adventurousness. For $35 a person, tour operators like
Atlantic Forest Jeep Tours, and Ecology and Culture offer four-hour
excursions that mix jeep travel with hikes along clearly marked
trails. There are also the somewhat more strenuous six-hour
versions for about $50 a head. Through these agencies and others,
one can contract an individual guide for an ambitious all-day
personalized trek that should cost about $150.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most enjoyable approach is to find a group of
like-minded local adventurers and just head out together. The best
guide to the forest, called ``Novas Trilhas do Rio'' (``Rio's New
Trails''), was written in Portuguese and has not yet been
translated into English. But its author, Pedro Menezes, who was
recently appointed director of the park, can provide advice about
local hiking and exploration clubs that know the forest intimately.
</P>
<P>
   Tijuca National Park and Forest is open free daily, 7 A.M. to 5
P.M. For tours, call Atlantic Forest Jeep Tours at (55-21)
511-2220, or Ecology and Culture at (55-21) 522-1620. Pedro Menezes
can be reached at his office, (55-21) 492-2253. A hiking club,
Caminhantes do Rio, offers hikes and general information about the
park at (55-21) 826-1459.

UNTIL THE EROTIC ENCOUNTER WITH THE RAT, IT WAS COOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francois Ozon's exquisitely unsettling ``See the Sea'' was one
of the high points at last year's New Directors/New Films series.
Now Ozon returns with a black comedy that means to be no less
disturbing than his expert thriller. But ``Sitcom,'' which is
sardonically filmed with the snappy look of a television comedy,
has a sour streak that eventually poisons its humor. Ozon pushed
the limits of shock value much more effectively with the carefully
measured violence of ``See the Sea'' than he does with this frontal
assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitcom'' begins promisingly enough with the sounds of gunfire
and screaming at a picture-perfect suburban house. The father of
the family (Francois Marthouret) evidently has not been pleased by
the surprise birthday party that greeted him. Then the film flashes
back to presumably happier times, when the mother (Evelyne Dandry)
fussed demurely about the housekeeping and the son Nicholas (Adrien
De Van) and daughter Sophie (Marina De Van, the same sullen actress
who set off chills in ``See the Sea'') looked like model children.
Needless to say, they're not.
</P>
<P>
   Two new members of the household, a pet rat and an insinuating
maid named Maria (Lucia Sanchez), touch off some amusing first
rounds of trouble. One night Maria arrives for dinner in
unexpectedly formal dress and accompanied by Abdu (Jules-Emmanuel
Eyoum Deido), her unexpectedly black husband. (The family is white
but the mother feigns interest in African history.)
</P>
<P>
   This is the same night on which Nicholas abruptly announces that
he is gay and stomps off to his room. Abdu offers to have a helpful
talk with Nicholas, but it soon becomes clear that Abdu's idea of
help isn't what the parents have in mind. Soon Nicholas' room is
home to a parade of strangers doing who-knows-what. The mother
greets these guests politely, if bewilderedly, at the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sophie has an erotic encounter with the rat, leaps out a
window, cripples herself and becomes a bad-tempered paraplegic
dominatrix. It is at about this point that the film's light touch
falls into jeopardy. As the rest of ``Sitcom'' dwells on broken
incest taboos, the popularity of zucchini among Nicholas' guests
and assorted other supposed outrages, we get the point and then
some. In the end, ``Sitcom'' isn't any more barbed about
middle-class complacency than many situation comedies, however
inadvertently, are themselves.

`AMONG GIANTS' IS POIGNANT ROMANCE FROM WRITER OF `FULL MONTY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Among Giants'' is an affecting and unlikely romance that owes
a huge debt to its lead actors.
</P>
<P>
   Though the gravelly voiced _ and faced _ Pete Postlethwaite
(``In The Name Of the Father'') is hardly be anybody's idea of a
romantic leading man, it's his very cragginess that gives his
performance weight as well as pathos.
</P>
<P>
   Add the unorthodox gutsiness and sexiness of Australian actress
Rachel Griffiths, who was recently nominated for an Oscar for
``Hilary and Jackie,'' and ``Among Giants'' radiates tremendous
appeal, if on a small, intimate scale.
</P>
<P>
   The film was written by Simon Beaufoy, the previously gave us
``The Full Monty.''
</P>
<P>
   Here he follows another motley group of Englishmen _ five
reprobate characters who are hired by Ray (Postlethwaite) to paint
high-wire electrical towers on an isolated 15-mile stretch of
English moors. Ray's best mate is handsome and brash young Steve
(James Thornton), a daredevil who enjoys rock climbing on the
Sheffield cliffs in his time off.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic between this bunch of misfits radically changes when
Gerry (Griffiths), a hiker trekking through England on a
``spiritual quest,'' asks Ray for a job. A triangle forms between
Ray, Gerry and Steve and, when Ray and Gerry embark on a love
affair, their actions lead to surprising consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is prepared for commitment _ Ray has just been divorced
and Gerry is a free spirit who shuns being tied down and indeed,
often unwittingly wreaks havoc on the lives of those around her.
But soon Ray, confused by the intensity of his attraction, asks
Gerry to marry him _ an act that forces each to evaluate and
confront demons and desires.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Postlethwaite and Griffiths, who even daringly display
themselves naked in one scene, the real star of ``Among Giants'' is
the tone and sense of restlessness evoked by Beaufoy, director Sam
Miller and cinematographer Witold Stok.
</P>
<P>
   It's the closest thing to capturing the mystique of a dying way
of life _ the ``western'' loner anti-hero _ that the movies have
given us for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Directors and actors have been so intent upon turning that
mystique into a caricature of itself that most films fail to convey
the true loneliness and pain in the lifestyle. ``Among Giants''
allows us to feel the rootlessness and the high price of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   And until the final scenes in the film, which are jarringly out
of place in such a yearning work, it lives up to Ray's explanation
as to why he's taken on such a reckless existence. ``I'm king up
here, lass,'' he says to Gerry, and for awhile, we actually believe
him.
</P>
<P>
   Among Giants. Directed by Sam Miller. Written by Simon Beaufoy.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Last week, on a crisp, cloudless afternoon, I stood in
a forest clearing on a rise above Walden Pond, just at the spot
outside Concord, where Henry David Thoreau built the cabin in which
he lived from July 1845 to September 1847. For a few splendid
minutes, I had the place all to myself. I could look at things as
Thoreau did when he explored the thicket of ideas about
self-reliance and spiritual immanence that he later shaped into
``Walden,'' one of the great works of American transcendentalism.
</P>
<P>
   Out over the water, which is more lake than pond, gulls dipped
at ripples being raised by a steady wind. Above, a hawk caught a
current and shot into the distance. Where I stood, beside a cairn
of commemorative stones, Thoreau's famous declaration of purpose
rang out, appropriately in silence, from a simple wooden plaque:
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to
front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not
learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover
that I had not lived.''
</P>
<P>
   As someone who, long ago, under the influence of those words,
left college briefly to find his own cabin, pond and point of view,
I savored my lone moment in Thoreau's woods, even though it was
marred by a few self-conscious middle-age regrets. But I also
savored the more amusing fact that I had come to this abashed,
intense interlude of personal reflection primarily as a customer of
a new vehicle of historical tourism called the Literary Trail of
Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   With not another tourist in sight, I was both tourist and
authentic literary pilgrim, a paradox that Thoreau, the blunt,
stay-at-home anti-materialist, would surely have appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   The Literary Trail of Greater Boston is a tour of sites in the
Boston area associated with New England writers. But it is
important to remember that it is a work in progress, not yet
subject to easy description or judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled in many ways on the city's venerable Freedom Trail, a
walking tour (devised in 1951) of notable American Revolution sites
like the Old North Church and Bunker Hill, the literary trail is
also the first creation of the Boston History Collaborative, an
alliance of historians, tourism professionals, business people and
government officials formed in 1997. The idea for the trail came
from Robert Krim, now the collaborative's director, who believed
that the city needed to think of new ways to recharge its history
for residents and visitors alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I told the city powers-who-be,'' the inexhaustible Krim
said recently, ``was that Boston's literary heritage should be an
integral attraction _ and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The collaborative is also working on a Maritime Trail, which
will allow a closer, more informed look at Boston Harbor, and an
Immigrant Trail. But the initial order of business is the literary
trail, and it is perhaps the most difficult: illustrating how the
Revolution of the 18th century was followed in the 19th by a
peaceful revolution of ideas, as writers like Thoreau, Ralph Waldo
Emerson, Louisa May Alcott, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Nathaniel
Hawthorne and Harriet Beecher Stowe enriched the new nation's
culture with radical expressions of freedom from a puritanical
past, not to mention good stories and poems.
</P>
<P>
   In Close Contact
</P>
<P>
   Integral to the trail is the recognition that these 19th-century
luminaries largely resided in three different places _ Boston,
Cambridge and Concord _ but were in close contact with one another,
traveling easily by rail or coach along the 20-mile route.
</P>
<P>
   For example, although Emerson lived in Concord and Longfellow,
for the most part, in Cambridge, each ventured into the Parker
House hotel to take part in the Saturday Club, which also from time
to time included Hawthorne, the Atlantic Monthly editor James
Russell Lowell and Oliver Wendell Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   And although Alcott lived at various times in several houses in
Concord, including Wayside and Orchard House, whose quaintly
revivified rooms will be familiar to readers of ``Little Women,''
she spent many winter weeks in a hotel on Beacon Hill just around
the corner from the Massachusetts State House, to be closer to
cultural events and bookstores. That hotel is now an apartment
house.
</P>
<P>
   The collaborative originally intended to introduce the trail in
2000, but decided to begin a trial trail last month, to elicit
reactions from participants and adjust accordingly. On each
Saturday and Sunday in March, two four-hour guided tours were
conducted; they proceeded by trolley from stops in Boston through
Cambridge to stops in Concord, then back again for drop-off in
either Cambridge or Boston. Tickets for the tours, each of which
could accommodate 40 people, were sold out, and almost all the
participants gave the tour high marks, said Lisa Simpson, the
director of the trail. Largely because of this response, the guided
tour is to be continued once a week through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the collaborative rushed into print ``The
Literary Trail,'' a handbook by Susan Wilson, which can be used
independently of the guided tour, either by trolley-phobic, bookish
types who prefer to wander about on their own or by guided-tour
customers who want to revisit points of special interest and
linger.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not exactly trolley-phobic, but I do prefer to set my own
course and pace in this sort of thing. So, as a new resident of the
Boston area, I've experienced the trail in both ways, following
along on part of a guided tour but mainly, in the spirit of the
transcendentalists, taking advantage of its open horizons, with
relevant well-worn volumes of literature in hand. And I've found
the handbook to be an effective, amiable, if sometimes abbreviated,
companion, too. (It's being revised and expanded into a true book,
which will be published next year by that old Boston publishing
house, Houghton Mifflin.)
</P>
<P>
   The Starting Point
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday morning, my wife and I got ourselves to the
lobby of what is now the Omni Parker House before 9. Said to be the
oldest continuously operating hotel in the country, since 1855, the
Parker House, on the corner of Tremont and School Streets, manages
to appear sleekly contemporary and _ with dark carpets, period
prints on the walls and lots of old wood _ historic at the same
time. That makes it a perfect starting point for the guided tour,
and Jayne Gordon, the leader during the first part of the tour,
quickly made that clear to our group, which was made up primarily
of adult couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``The connections we will be drawing,'' she said, ``are
connections between past and present, between people's ideas and
their actions, between the city and the country, between
individuals and communities, between landscape and the literature
it inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon, a longtime consultant to Concord's historic sites
who also teaches at Tufts University, is a strong, eloquent
speaker, and she did a wonderful job of mixing playful anecdotes
(visiting from England, Charles Dickens used a mirror in the
hotel's mezzanine to practice a recitation of ``A Christmas
Carol'') with the tour's more ephemeral content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideas matter,'' she said. ``People not only articulate ideas,
but they live them out. And those ideas have tremendous
repercussions.''
</P>
<P>
   In about 20 minutes, she also related a great deal of
information about the neighborhood around the Parker House. She
talked about a building on the corner of School and Washington
Streets that once housed the Old Corner Bookstore, where Emerson
and others bought books, and about Ticknor &AMP; Fields, which
published Emerson, Thoreau, Longfellow and Stowe.
</P>
<P>
   She also discussed the Old South Meeting House, at 310
Washington St., and, at 13-15 West St., the site of the Book Shop,
which was owned and run by Elizabeth Peabody, a transcendentalist
who also founded America's first kindergartens and was the
sister-in-law of both Hawthorne and the innovative educator Horace
Mann.
</P>
<P>
   But these sites were for us to investigate later, by ourselves.
Next stop on the tour was the Boston Athenaeum, just a block up
Beacon Hill, at 10{ Beacon. Ms. Gordon led us up the narrow
sidewalk, pointing out where there was a glimpse of the Old North
Church, then into the vestibule of the Athenaeum, a private library
that has been a home for writers and scholars since 1807.
</P>
<P>
   There, we discovered one of the weaknesses of the trail as it is
currently designed; Ms. Gordon remained with us, but the narration
was handed over to a guide employed by the Athenaeum, and although
she was certainly proficient at giving dates and facts and pointing
out the seductive appointments of the library's two floors (anyone
who has seen the movie version of ``The Bostonians'' is familiar
with the lavish, light-filled interior), she did little to advance
the grand story of nobly embodied ideas that Ms. Gordon had
started.
</P>
<P>
   It was refreshing to get back outside and walk another block up
Beacon to the Massachusetts State House. There, a trolley provided
by a well-known Boston tourist company, Old Towne Trolley, was
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon concluded her part in the tour by speaking about the
statues of two freethinking Colonial women who were punished for
their views on religious freedom: Anne Hutchinson, who was banished
from Boston, and Mary Dyer, who was hanged.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon also pointed across the street to Augustus
Saint-Gaudens' high-relief sculpture on the edge of the Common,
which honors Col. Robert Gould Shaw and his regiment of black
soldiers, all of whom died in the Civil War. But she didn't have
time to fill out all the appropriate artistic associations _ the
sculpture has inspired prose, poetry and music by artists from Ives
to Robert Lowell _ because the tour, which goes on to the Boston
Public Library before heading to Cambridge and Concord, was a bit
behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   As the other participants boarded the trolley, my wife and I
decided to peel off and spend some time at the Saint-Gaudens
sculpture, and to read from Lowell's poem about it, ``For the Union
Dead'':
</P>
<P>
   Their monument sticks like a fishbone
</P>
<P>
   in the city's throat.
</P>
<P>
   Its Colonel is as lean
</P>
<P>
   as a compass-needle.
</P>
<P>
   He has an angry wrenlike vigilance,
</P>
<P>
   a greyhound's gentle tautness;
</P>
<P>
   he seems to wince at pleasure,
</P>
<P>
   and suffocate for privacy.

c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   As the fall 1999/winter 2000 women's ready-to-wear collections
drew to a close in Paris, two thoughts were uppermost in the minds
of those who had followed the fashion trail from New York through
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   First was that U.S. designers had undoubtedly best captured the
mood of today's women and that the cohesiveness of the Americans'
showings of luxurious casual wear was exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   The second thought, of a more puzzling nature, was what about
the millennium? Where was the barrage of futuristic dressing that
had been anticipated?
</P>
<P>
   Fashion designer Rudi Gernreich, the man who gave the world
topless swimsuits for women, once proclaimed that the Space Age
ended when man landed on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was correct, for there were scant signs of Space Age
dressing on the runways, really only Helmut Lang's casualized
spacesuits in soft, comfy fabrics with flattering padded collars,
all shown in New York.
</P>
<P>
   What Paris proved, however, is that futuristic fashions do
exist, and in the French fashion capital, Alexander McQueen was the
designer most attuned to 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In a show with music that was a homage to Stanley Kubrick's
``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' the runway and stage were paved and
backed with mirror-finished materials. The fashions were even
better.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen is a mean tailor, shaping shoulders and waists to his
will, and for once he's got the shoulders right, setting their
softness or sharpness off with pyramidal wigs of a type worn by
ancient Egyptian royalty.
</P>
<P>
   Suits had wide, white bindings, perhaps a little too much of a
takeoff on Andre Courreges' old designs, but McQueen's dresses and
catsuits with reflective prints _ a cross between hieroglyphics and
computer circuit boards _ were dazzling, a tour de force of design.
</P>
<P>
   More important, these were clothes not beyond the realm of what
real women might wear.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps McQueen's hooded jackets festooned with lighted
circuit-board patterns weren't exactly wearable, but at least
McQueen is not asleep at the wheel. He, for one, realizes that if
the first Space Age is dead, the second, this time guided by
computer, is alive and on target.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, for the first time, clothing beyond contemporary
casual _ sleeveless tops, severe skirts and stretch khaki pants _
begins to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   One of the labels leading the way is, in reality, playing an
encore. Paco Rabanne, the man who made a name for himself decades
ago with dresses and tunics of linked-together metal discs, is at
the head of the house's new design team.
</P>
<P>
   This time around it bridges the gap between casual and
futuristic. Tunics have triangles of vinyl bradded onto wool. A
jumpsuit is made of gold metal mesh, while gold is also used as
belts or accents on other clothing. And instead of a total
made-in-metal show, the Rabanne fashions are wisely into leather
and hides, with circles cut out of the materials, then metal-linked
back into place.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Issey Miyake's designs of permanently wrinkled and
pleated fabrics qualify as millennium-minded. Not only do they go
anywhere, arriving in the same shape in which they departed, but
they also can often be cut to desired lengths and shapes by the
clients.
</P>
<P>
   And Miyake's designs are colorful. For a while, fashion
observers were fearful that this century would end with women in a
dourful shrouds accessorized with Earth shoes and messenger bags.
But now it appears colorful. Miyake's creations almost took second
place to their vibrant colors.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Lacroix, never a shy violet in the color department,
stuck to his palette of hot pinks, purples, red, orange and lime,
even adding neon brights. And as if color were not enough, he sewed
on huge paillettes and crystals as large as thumbnails, and then
pasted on flat bows wherever the mood struck.
</P>
<P>
   Color and shine together was a recurring theme, whether the
colorful fabrics were satin or charmeuse or they were encrusted
with sequins or crystals. For Loewe, Narciso Rodriguez meticulously
covered shell tops and dresses with garnets, peridots and rose
quartz, then teamed a garnet shell with a bright red, patent
leather skirt.
</P>
<P>
   At Cerruti, the line's new Greek designer, Peter Speliopoulos,
sent out futuristic patchworks that were shiny squares and other
shapes sewn onto dresses and skirts in geometric or haphazard
patterns.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature vs. NASA'' is how Speliopoulos described his designs,
although most had more in common with the patterns of modern art.
</P>
<P>
   Costume National sent black down its runway, but black with the
difference of shine. Caught in the headlights, these threads,
finishes and decorations would glow like fish scales.
</P>
<P>
   Silver and aluminum finishes on fabrics and accessories were
another way designers subtly moved fashion forward. Karl
Lagerfeld's designs for Chanel were the best of these, with silver
leather skirts, dresses and pants, softened with recognizable
Chanel woolen jackets, then toughened with huge link belts.
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. designers now working for big Paris labels found a
way to fold their comfort clothes _ aka American sportswear _ into
the trend to shine. Michael Kors topped a black sweater and camel
pants with deep red shiny coat with fur hood for Celine. Marc
Jacobs put together all that bright plasticized luggage for Louis
Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   Although not the pervasive theme it was in New York, sportswear
was indeed a major trend in Paris. Even John Galliano tipped his
hat to sweaters and knits _ and it was a big howdy.
</P>
<P>
   For Christian Dior, there were way-oversize Aran Isle, or
fisherman knit, sweaters. Colors ranged from red, lime, yellow and
robin's egg blue to ivory and black and white, the latter mostly
with African-inspired patterns.
</P>
<P>
   For his signature collection, Galliano showed more oversize
black and white coats and capes, but he chose more form-fitting
knits, too. His saucy suits in fuchsias and caution yellow were
showed to best advantage played against his theme of a construction
zone.
</P>
<P>
   The prolific use of fur, leather, suede and cowhide, all highly
resilient materials, continued in the Paris shows, with next fall
and winter shaping up to be a season when animals should run for
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Fur was used, as in Milan and New York, as a fabric, with fur
shells, fur skirts, fur dresses, coats and handbags. Fur trims
remain popular, but usually worked in new ways, not just the same
old fur collar. Think fur hoods, fur muffs, tiny fur edging or wide
bands of fur at hemlines.
</P>
<P>
   Hippie looks from the '70s returned to Paris runways, with
Emanuel Ungaro showing the master's touch. Ruffles, prints, peasant
blouses and long skirts were not hippie garments per se, but worn
together and accessorized with artsy-craftsy feather necklaces and
high boots, they longed for guitar music and free love.
</P>
<P>
   Even Valentino, a designer whose swirling and diaphanous evening
creations are usually sought after by charity ball chairwomen,
loosened up for fall. Metallic lace and charmeuse tap pants with
the Valentino label are meant to be worn with a loose cashmere
sweater and tights. Or a crystal-pleated satin skirt might be
topped with a tie-on scarf at the bodice.
</P>
<P>
   This is sportswear but certainly of a different ilk, a new
height of luxuriousness more than seen on other runways.
</P>
<P>
   This was a season of change in Paris, with Israeli-born designer
Alber Elbaz moving to take over Yves Saint Laurent's Rive Gauche
line and Dutchman Ronald van der Kemp filling Elbaz' shoes at Guy
Laroche. Neither designer turned in a stellar performance, although
both showed promise.
</P>
<P>
   Elbaz took too many cues from YSL's former designs. The best of
what he showed, however, were Asian-inspired ensembles on which
thin cord belts defined the waists.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no photos of Jean-Paul Gaultier's collection _
photographers boycotted the show due to dangerous working
conditions _ he was one designer who had the right idea on how to
work today's sportswear into a millennium theme.
</P>
<P>
   Starting an onstage clock at the year 0, he sent out African,
Asian and Caucasian couples, then mixed things up with multiracial,
multiethnic and same-sex couples. The years _ and fashions _ crept
towards 2000, ending with a gray-haired couple in quilted silver.
</P>
<P>
   Gaultier's biggest theme was a duvet coat for two, more like
wearing your bedspread than an overcoat. Talk about comfort
clothes! &QL;

   The Lure of Cambridge
</P>
<P>
   At this time, the trail's guided tour doesn't stop in Cambridge
though the trolley goes past significant spots, like the formidable
Longfellow House at 105 Brattle St., a national historic site that
is currently closed for renovations. Guides with Old Towne continue
a narration, with audio-visual help.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case, literary Cambridge _ past and present _ is a
complicated, insular world that one has to penetrate on one's own,
over the course of years, by ways of chance and imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Many lovers of American literature have favorite writers who
attended Harvard University: Emerson and Thoreau, T.S. Eliot,
Norman Mailer and John Updike. It's fun to stroll Harvard Yard and
imagine those favorite writers as young people _ serious, uncertain
and brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, I've returned to Divinity Hall, one of
the university's oldest buildings, where Emerson lived in 1825 and
I lived in the late 1970s; I've sat on the steps of Widener
Library, reading through the poems of Elizabeth Bishop, who taught
at Harvard for many years, as did Robert Lowell and as does Seamus
Heaney.
</P>
<P>
   I've gone back into Memorial Hall, an imposing, endearing Gothic
structure, and recalled hearing Lowell give a sad, magical reading
just months before he died in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   I've spent hours in Mount Auburn Cemetery, walking, marveling at
the statuary of different eras, trying to identify birds and trees
(with the aid of pamphlets available at the entrance) and tracking
down the graves of Longfellow, historian Francis Parkman,
Buckminster Fuller and, most movingly, Bernard Malamud. (``Art,''
his stone says, ``celebrates life and gives us our measure.'')
</P>
<P>
   But for me, literary Cambridge is primarily a present-tense
landscape. It's going into my favorite bookstore, the dusty
hole-in-the-wall Grolier Poetry Book Shop, on Plympton Street, and
finding a British volume for which I'd been searching for years.
It's going to a reading at the Sackler Museum by the slyly
visionary Irish poet Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill, then finding out that she
lives just down the road from me, and teaches at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   It's failing to get into what proved to be a powerful reading at
Harvard by the great, too often overlooked British poet Geoffrey
Hill, who teaches at Boston University, but then being introduced
to him by the priest at my church. It's sitting on the lawn of the
Longfellow House with my sons and taking turns reciting ``Paul
Revere's Ride'' and ``The Village Blacksmith,'' the subjects of
which _ man and ``spreading chestnut tree'' _ lived just down the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Off to Concord
</P>
<P>
   On that crisp, cloudless afternoon last week, I dreaded the
drive to Concord, despite the glorious weather. My memories of the
town from childhood and college days were of tourist buses, clogged
sidewalks and a cloying preciousness in the way the area's complex,
inspiring political and literary history was presented.
</P>
<P>
   My first stop this time, following the lead of the trail's
guidebook, was at the Concord Museum, which sits across the road
from the Emerson House in what used to be Emerson's apple orchard.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, I was pleasantly surprised to find exhibits that deftly
explained the intellectual and practical ingredients that helped
the combustion of revolution against the British and, later,
against the remnant dictates of Puritanism and the institution of
slavery. The museum's best treasure, though, is a reassembling of
Emerson's study, with furniture, artworks and, naturally, books
placed exactly as they were when he wrote his great essays on what
he called the ``natural history of the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged, I left the museum and drove to Wayside, a charmingly
kooky house that was home to the Alcott family, then to Hawthorne
and finally to Harriett Lothrop, who as Margaret Sidney wrote the
``Five Little Peppers'' children's books. Wayside's doors were
locked, but through the windows I could see workers polishing lamps
and otherwise preparing for its April opening. (Many New England
historic sites don't open until Patriot's Day, the third Monday in
April, which commemorates the battles at Concord and Lexington.)
</P>
<P>
   Driving past the inevitable crowds at Orchard House, I made my
way to Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, which was virtually empty, then got
out of my car and hiked up the small wooded hill known as Author's
Ridge. These days, Sleepy Hollow is not the well landscaped or
cared-for cemetery that Mount Auburn in Cambridge is, but
nevertheless I felt a shudder of awe as I strolled past the graves
of Hawthorne, Thoreau, the Alcotts and Emerson. On the jagged rock
marking Emerson's grave are these words: ``The passive master lent
his hand to the vast soul that o'er him planned.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, I drove to the North Bridge parking lot. Clutching
my ``Portable Emerson,'' I crossed the road and walked up the path
to the bridge across which shots were fired on the first day of the
Revolution. I had planned to read Emerson's ``Hymn: Sung at the
Completion of the Concord Monument'' (1836) while standing on what
it calls the ``rude bridge,'' but I crossed and leaned against the
Minuteman monument instead. As I read, I looked up and across a
meadow to the Old Manse, Emerson's grandfather's house, where the
poem was written, and I glanced over to the poem's ``soft stream''
as it still flowed by.
</P>
<P>
   Back in my car, now elated with my journey to Concord on this
brilliant day, I picked up my copy of ``Walden'' and read the
closing words: ``Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There
is more day to dawn. The sun is but a morning star.'' I decided to
skirt Concord's tony shops and head straight to Walden Pond.

CHINESE TREASURES  
 RAISING THE FLAG  
 AMERICAN IN PARIS  
 A NEW VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Texas, Calif., N.Y., France)  (js) 
 BY CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chinese art has attracted a flurry of attention recently. Over
the last two years the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum, the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco and the
Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, have given it considerable time and
space. Now the National Gallery of Art in Washington is weighing
in.
</P>
<P>
   It announced this week that together with the Nelson-Atkins
Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., and the State Administration of
Cultural Heritage and Art Exhibitions in China, it has put together
``The Golden Age of Archeology: Celebrated Discoveries from the
People's Republic of China.'' The show, to be on view in Washington
from Sept. 19 through Jan. 2, will travel to the Museum of Fine
Arts in Houston and the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery is calling the show ``the greatest survey
of Chinese art and archeology ever lent by the People's Republic of
China.'' The show commemorates the 50th anniversary of the People's
Republic. It will have about 200 examples of recent archeological
discoveries, objects dating from 6000 B.C. to A.D. 960, as well as
sculpture, ritual implements, musical instruments, paintings and
calligraphy, plus decorative objects made of jade, stone, wood,
bamboo, gold and bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very different from other Chinese shows in the U.S.
because it focuses on archeological finds of the last 20 years,''
said Earl A. Powell III, director of the National Gallery. ``It's a
fascinating and beautiful show that tracks the evolution of Chinese
art.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 the National Gallery presented a similar exhibition,
``Archeological Finds of the People's Republic of China.'' The
forthcoming show is expected to present new perspectives on early
Chinese civilization and art, documenting the most recent
excavations and theories while showing the various ancient cultures
that flourished simultaneously throughout China.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said the show would demonstrate that Chinese civilization
sprung not only from the valley of the Yellow River, as previously
thought, but from the interaction and achievements of various
cultures throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the Flag
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since he painted his first flag in 1954, Jasper Johns
has created nearly 100 versions of what is now his most famous
image. He has drawn flags, painted flags, produced flags in
watercolor and as prints and created lead and bronze-relief
sculptures of them. With so many examples of Johns' flags in such a
variety of guises, why do auction houses consider it a coup when a
Johns flag painting comes on the market?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an icon of American art,'' said Franck Giraud, who heads
Christie's 19th- and 20th-century art departments worldwide.
``Flags just don't come on the market that often.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, at Sotheby's in New York, a small 1959 ``Flag''
drawing that was was estimated to bring $500,000 to $700,000 sold
for nearly $1 million. In February 1998 Christie's in New York sold
a collage of a ``White Flag'' from 1960 for $1.2 million, twice its
$600,000 high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   On May 13 Christie's in New York will auction a ``Flags''
painting from 1973. It is made of two sets of three canvas panels,
and depicts two vertical flags in red, white and blue. The work is
estimated to sell for $7 million to $10 million. Some art experts
suggest that the price may be high; they recall that in November
Sotheby's unsuccessfully pushed its luck by offering ``White
Numbers'' (1958), an important Johns encaustic on linen painting of
numerals in a progression from 0 to 9, with a $7 million to $9
million estimate. No one was willing to pay more than $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Giraud said the estimate for ``Flags'' was justified because of
``the tremendous popularity of the three Johns' we sold from the
Ganz collection last year, each for way above their estimates, and
for the rarity of the object.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting has been for sale before. In 1989, at the height of
the auction market, Sotheby's in New York sold it for $11 million
to Bo Alveryd, a dealer who purchased the painting on behalf of
Renault, the French car manufacturer. While officials at Chrisite's
will not identify the current seller, art world experts who know
the painting say it is being sold by Renault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flag is Johns' most desirable image,'' Giraud said. In
October the Metropolitan Museum acquired a ``White Flag'' from 1955
directly from the artist. It has become one of the jewels in the
museum's 20th-century collection.
</P>
<P>
   American in Paris
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the super-contemporary $41 million Frank Gehry
building that had housed the American Center in Paris from 1994 to
1996 has been completed. The French Ministry of Culture bought the
building for about $21 million and plans to turn it into a film
center, with three screening rooms, a film library and spaces
devoted to a museum, educational activities and a film and video
research center. A lack of money forced the American Center to put
its large building, in eastern Paris, up for sale in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Center has continued out of a small office in
Paris and now it will have an endowment,'' said Frederick B. Henry,
the center's chairman. ``We will be a grant-making foundation,
which will support a variety of artistic endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said that the exact focus of the grants has not been
determined, but that the center was committed to ``innovative
philanthropy.'' He added that the institution may join with two or
three other arts organizations or foundations to develop special
projects.
</P>
<P>
   A New Venture
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alexander Apsis, a 25-year veteran of Sotheby's, who
for the last five years has headed its department of Impressionist
and modern art in New York, has resigned. He is to become a partner
of C&AMP;M Arts, the Manhattan gallery on East 78th Street that was
founded seven years ago by Robert Mnuchin, a retired investment
banker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent my whole working life at Sotheby's, and I wanted a
new challenge,'' Apsis said. When he starts his job in May, Apsis
will concentrate on Impressionist and classic 20th-century art.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a sudden downsizing of an oft-reworked show, 20
cast members of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' were told this week that
their services would no longer be needed in yet another version of
the show, which is to tour this summer and open at the Neil Simon
Theater in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The musical, which underwent a major overhaul last fall, is to
close its run at the Minskoff Theater on May 30, rehearse a
slimmed-down version, tour and reopen in September. The Minskoff is
booked for the musical ``Saturday Night Fever,'' which is to open
in October.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, actors were told that the new version will have a
cast of 29 as against the current 41. In addition, eight other
roles will be recast.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hawkins, executive producer, said the reason for slimming
down the production was that the Neil Simon, which seats 1,366, is
significantly smaller than the Minskoff, with 1,621.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the theater is smaller, the production will be
rescaled in order to make it the right show for that space,''
Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Eisenberg, executive director of Actors' Equity, said the
move had been approved two weeks ago by the union's production
committee. But it angered cast members, who said Equity had not
informed them that the changes were coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This came totally out of the blue,'' said one member, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``Equity didn't talk to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cast members were also upset that the union had made an
exception to a long-standing contractual rule. Under the standard
Equity production contract, producers cannot reduce the size of a
cast without first closing a production for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, Eisenberg said the union would allow
``Pimpernel'' to close on May 30 and begin rehearsals for the
slimmed-down version in early June without compensation for the 20
actors who have been released. The exception was made in this case,
Eisenberg said, because ``Pimpernel'' officials offered a higher
rate of pay for the touring company and because the show's
producers were also considering closing in mid-April, rather than
May 30, to avoid a conflict with the six-week rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was better to provide six weeks of employment to
the current actors under the production contract to the end of
May,'' he said, ``and then send the tour out under the production
contract rather than under a stock agreement,'' which pays less.
</P>
<P>
   The change is just the latest for the musical. Last fall, after
Cablevision purchased the show from its original producers,
``Pimpernel'' was rewritten and rerehearsed. Two of the three leads
were changed. The new version of the musical opened on Nov. 4;
critics generally approved. Sales have also improved, though the
show is still millions from recouping the original investment.
</P>
<P>
   For the actors whose jobs were eliminated, the move smacked of
corporate thinking. ``We're dealing with people whose absolute
bottom line is profit,'' one cast member said. ``These aren't
people who love theater. These are corporate people.''
</P>
<P>
   Heaven Didn't Help
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, there was light. In the end, there just
weren't enough people to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, producers of ``The Most Fabulous Story Ever
Told'' told their cast that the show would be posting a closing
date of May 2. The Bible-based comedy, by Paul Rudnick, received
good reviews in December when it opened at the nonprofit New York
Theater Workshop; it subsequently moved to a commercial run at the
Minetta Lane Theater.
</P>
<P>
   But ticket sales in the last month have slumped. Recent weeks
have seen losses of $10,000 to $15,000, said Tom Viertel, one of
the show's producers. ``I just don't think we've found the audience
for it,'' he said. ``We've done a ton of promotional stuff and some
other forms of advertising, but we've really hit a wall.'' He said
costs from extensive recasting had also taken their toll. One
possible candidate for the theater's next tenant is ``Betty's
Summer Vacation,'' Christopher Durang's searing satire on modern
media, which closes its run at Playwright's Horizon on April 18.
</P>
<P>
   A Complete Circle
</P>
<P>
   In a strange way, Jim Norton's role in ``The Weir'' has been a
sort of homecoming. The 60-year-old actor, who plays the feisty old
rustic, Jack, left his native Ireland in 1969 to pursue acting in
London.
</P>
<P>
   There, Norton found success in a wide variety of plays,
including several productions at the Royal Court and on the West
End. But he avoided certain roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was determined not to be seen as an `Irish' actor,''
he said, in an accent that sounds more English than Gaelic. ``I
kind of deliberately chose not to play Irish parts.''
</P>
<P>
   His stay in London lasted 20 years. In the late 1980s, suffering
from what he said was a midlife crisis, Norton moved to Los Angeles
and made a healthy living on roles in television and film. Then,
about three years ago, he took roles in two plays in Dublin, where
he had been born and bred but had not lived full-time in almost 30
years. While there, Norton was cast in ``The Weir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the part and took a walk,'' he said. ``When I got back,
I called my agent and said, `If I don't do the part, I'll die.'''
</P>
<P>
   Norton said he had found inspiration for the role in memories of
his Irish uncles and friends. In fact, a photograph hanging on the
wall of the set is of his grandparents and his uncle. ``Whenever I
get nervous, I look over at that picture,'' Norton said. ``Compared
to those people, I have it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect some butterflies on Monday at about 3 p.m. That's when
this season's Pulitzer Prize for drama will be announced. Both
``Wit,'' playing Off Broadway, and ``Side Man,'' on Broadway, have
been mentioned as possible contenders. Of the two, ``Side Man'' is
more in need of any potential boost in revenue. Box office sales
dropped to $84,684 last week, the lowest of any Broadway show.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Public Theater will offer a free public reading of new
plays by Tony Kushner, Suzan Lori-Parks and David Greenspan as part
of its ``New Work Now'' festival beginning on April 19.

COMPANY'S EMPLOYEES REFLECT CONCERNS, PHILOSOPHIES OF PERSON

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Great service comes in many forms.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the way a customer's purchases were replaced free
after she left her bag in the parking lot and drove away, later
returning to find the bag gone.
</P>
<P>
   Or in the way an airline uses china plates and cloth napkins,
offers free wine or champagne and bakes cookies right on board the
plane _ and not just for first class.
</P>
<P>
   Or the way an office furniture sales representative sits down
with a customer, discusses her needs, fits her budget, lets her
choose colors and fabrics, immediately sends the order to the
factory via computer and has 200 furniture systems ready within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Great service is not random or unusual, says Leonard L. Berry,
Texas A&AMP;M University marketing professor and chairman of retailing
studies. Great service is part of the soul of a company, from its
top officers to its dishwashers. It's consistent and impresses
customers every day.
</P>
<P>
   After studying 14 successful service companies, Berry discovered
that the basic elements, or drivers, of great service can be found
in virtually any industry. The companies he reviewed were as
diverse as a mattress distributor, a minor-league baseball club and
an airline. But their common elements can be imitated by any
company.
</P>
<P>
   That common ground is the basis of Berry's latest book,
``Discovering the Soul of Service: The Nine Drivers of Sustainable
Business Success'' (Free Press, 269 pages, $26.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Services are performances,'' he writes, ``and the challenge of
sustaining the performers' energy, commitment, skills, and
knowledge day after day, week after week, month after month, year
after year _ especially as the organization grows and becomes more
complex _ is daunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry identifies nine drivers of sustainable success in service
business from his extensive research into such companies as Charles
Schwab, Midwest Express Airlines and The Container Store. Eight
drivers connect to a central driver of excellence, which he calls
``values-driven leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Values-driven leaders infuse their values into the fabric of
the organization,'' Berry writes. ``They lead not with commands,
not with a thick rule book, but with a set of core values _ what
the firm represents and aspires to be. The more these values tap
into employees' own core values, the more they guide individual
decision-making and inspire personal achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers Berry identified include terms often not heard in
the typical business lexicon. Ideas such as generosity, trust-based
relationships and investment in employee success are as important
as the more businesslike ideas of strategic focus, brand
cultivation and excellence, Berry theorizes.
</P>
<P>
   Treating employees in a humane way at all levels is vital to the
success of the service business, Berry says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In services performed directly for customers, such as in
retailing, education, health care, and transportation, the service
is inseparable from the people performing it,'' he writes. ``An
inept salesperson is an inept store; a nurse's personality may send
patients in search of a new doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mutual respect, honesty'' and ``integrity'' are some of the
words Berry uses to describe the relationship between the company
leaders he studied and their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Such values will be seen repeatedly in the split-second
decisions that employees make every day.
</P>
<P>
   These companies ``use the power of values-driven leadership to
sustain their success,'' Berry writes. ``The leaders of these
companies recognize that every employee makes countless decisions
each day that directly or indirectly affect customers and
strengthen or weaken the company's reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry makes a strong case for this theory, which is well
supported with other schools of thought from the likes of Peter
Drucker and Noel Tichy. Berry has done his homework and research
well, and his book provides a clear picture of how to run a
successful service company.

   The authors, all consultants with Mercer Management, have
written a 432-page book about strategy. Their premise is that
everything successful has a pattern, and that the ability to see
those patterns and react to them is something they call ``Strategic
Anticipation.'' The authors outline 30 patterns that are changing

   Think about the best speakers you've heard lately. Did they
perform as if in a play, or did they talk to you as if you were
sitting next to them at a table? Speaking consultant Lee Clickstein
is betting the latter. His book evolves around the idea of relating
one-on-one to your audience, which coincidentally takes the fear
out of speaking as well. Although this work is geared toward the
public speaker, even shy people can benefit from Clickstein's
ideas.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The rumbles of yet another nationalist earthquake are shaking
the former Yugoslavia. Rising from the fetid hovels of Pristina and
the concrete-block family farms of rural Kosovo is the newest
political and military force to beset the Balkans _ the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA), known to Albanians as the Ushtria Clirimtare
e Kosoves.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of this militant armed group, now numbering
several thousand fighters, has dimmed hopes that even a compromise
agreement with Belgrade could be successfully implemented.
Emboldened by NATO's March bombing of the Serbian military, the KLA
will wage a protracted guerrilla war in the Serbian province that
could ignite a wider war in neighboring Macedonia and Albania,
potentially even dragging in Greece and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is uncompromising in its quest for an independent Kosovo
now and a Greater Albania later. And it has, to the consternation
of Washington's would-be peacemakers, supplanted the ineffectual
leadership of the moderate voice of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority, Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is important out of all proportion to its size _ not
merely because it will probably eventually get Kosovo to secede
from Serbia, but because it now represents the aspirations of most
Kosovar Albanians. To understand the current conflict in Kosovo and
America's stakes in its resolution, one must understand the KLA,
how it came into being, who leads it, what drives it and why it now
speaks for a majority of Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Even a truly vicious, Bosnia-like wave of atrocities by the
Serbs in reprisal for NATO's attacks will only pour fuel on the
separatist fire. The grim reality is that we had better get to know
the KLA _ because it is not going to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's Albanians have grown increasingly embittered. By
attempting to include the KLA in the peace process that began in
February at the French chateau of Rambouillet, the Western alliance
is working feverishly _ even as it bombs the Serbs _ to blunt the
momentum toward a war of independence.
</P>
<P>
   The allies want NATO troops to separate the province's warring
factions, although Belgrade is wary. The underlying idea behind
creating a theoretically temporary, NATO- enforced military
protectorate in Kosovo is to buy time for a three-year transition
period in which ethnic Albanians will be allowed to elect a
parliament and other governing bodies _ meeting enough of their
aspirations, it is hoped, to keep Kosovo from seceding.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Western alliance's response to the
Kosovo crisis, however ragged, shows that some lessons have been
learned from the bumbling in Bosnia. The Europeans no longer talk
about handling matters alone but demand the presence of the United
States. Threats have been backed up by force.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a consensus that if some kind of a solution is not
found soon, the fighting inside Kosovo _ an area the size of
Connecticut _ will accelerate and make future intervention
difficult, if not impossible. Even the Pentagon officials who
fought like wildcats to keep U.S. forces out of Bosnia accept that
some 4,000 U.S. troops will have to be deployed in Kosovo to make
any peacekeeping force credible.
</P>
<P>
   But, as in Bosnia, the West is wedded to a solution that might
have worked earlier in the conflict but is now untenable. Serbian
ethnic cleansing has taken on a somewhat different character in
Kosovo than in Bosnia. In Kosovo, Serbian ethnic cleansing is to a
large degree tactical, designed to deny the rebels succor from
civilians and therefore aimed primarily at the inhabitants of KLA
strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serb campaign has been more than brutal enough to make
autonomy for Kosovo a nonstarter. The ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
who make up 90 percent of its 2 million inhabitants, cannot remain
in Serbia after the horrific recent bloodshed, the displacement of
a quarter of a million people, and the razing of scores of
villages.
</P>
<P>
   They do not trust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic or the
Serbs _ and given Belgrade's bloody campaigns against ethnic
minorities over the past decade and its habit of breaking
agreements, who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians have been radicalized, and their new voice is the
KLA. Rugova, the old pacifist, is more a symbol of outmoded
moderation than a leader.
</P>
<P>
   By ignoring the plight of the Kosovar Albanians for nearly a
decade, the West lost much of its credibility before NATO began
bombing. Many Albanians feel let down by the world and their own
meek leaders. What is most striking, then, about the KLA
insurrection is not that it occurred but that it took so long to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA fighters are the province's new power brokers. Whatever
political leadership emerges in Kosovo will come from the rebel
ranks, and it will be militant, nationalist, uncompromising and
deeply suspicious of all outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies, preoccupied with tracking militant
Islamist groups and Iranian agents in Bosnia, were caught off guard
by the Kosovo rebel force's emergence, strength and popularity.
Indeed, some diplomats argued as late as last year about whether
the shadowy group really existed _ even as small armed bands roamed
Drenica in central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The first KLA armed attack took place in May 1993, killing two
Serb police officers and wounding five more. But the rebel group _
its membership largely drawn from a few clans in Kosovo and
radicals in the Albanian diaspora _ was founded eight years ago.
Most of its leadership has spent years in prison for separatist
activity, many having been jailed earlier by Tito's communist
government.
</P>
<P>
   Like all revolutionaries who have spent years underground or in
jail, the KLA leaders are wary of the outside world and given to
secrecy, paranoia and appalling mendacity when they feel it serves
their interests, which is most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA splits down a bizarre ideological divide, with hints of
fascism on one side and whiffs of communism on the other. The
former faction is led by the sons and grandsons of rightist
Albanian fighters _ either the heirs of those who fought in the
World War II fascist militias and the Skanderbeg volunteer SS
division raised by the Nazis, or the descendants of the rightist
Albanian rebels who rose up against the Serbs 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although never much of a fighting force, the Skanderbeg division
took part in the shameful roundup and deportation of the province's
few hundred Jews during the Holocaust. The division's remnants
fought Tito's Partisans at the end of the war, leaving thousands of
ethnic Albanians dead.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by KLA commanders to dress their police in black
fatigues and order their fighters to salute with a clenched fist to
the forehead led many to worry about these fascist antecedents.
Following such criticism, the salute has been changed to the
traditional open-palm salute common in the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   The second KLA faction, comprising most of the KLA leaders in
exile, are old Stalinists who were once bankrolled by the
xenophobic Enver Hoxha, the dictator of Albania who died in 1985.
This group led a militant separatist movement that was really about
integration with Hoxha's Albania. Most of these leaders were
students at Pristina University after 1974, when Belgrade granted
the province autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Freed from Yugoslav oversight, the university imported thousands
of textbooks from Albania, all carefully edited by Hoxha's
Stalinist regime, along with at least a dozen militant Albanian
professors. Along with its degree programs, Pristina University
began to quietly school young Kosovar leaders in the art of
revolution. Not only did a huge percentage of the KLA leadership
come out of the university, but so, ominously, did the ethnic
Albanian leadership in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The two KLA factions have little sympathy with or understanding
of democratic institutions. Split bitterly between radical left and
radical right, they are now arguing over whether to carry the
fighting to the pockets of ethnic Albanians who live in western
Macedonia and neighboring Montenegro. The only thing they agree on
is the need to liberate Kosovo from Serbian rule. All else,
menacingly, will be decided later. It is not said how.
</P>
<P>
   Given these deep divisions, it is no accident that the KLA has
failed to create a political organization or even a vague platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think we have an ideology,'' Jakup Krasniqi, the
KLA's mercurial spokesman, told the Albanian-language daily Koha
Ditore on July 12, 1998. ``And in fact we do not have time for such
things even if we were interested in them, because we have our main
job to do, which is the task of liberation.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   I first stumbled into the Kosovo Liberation Army in February
1997, shortly after a police car was ambushed by armed
``terrorists,'' as the Serbs called them.
</P>
<P>
   Three uniformed ethnic Albanians equipped with automatic weapons
were killed in the firefight. I took a taxi that had seen better
days to attend the wake for one of them.
</P>
<P>
   As I approached the village of Orlane, a few lean men in track
suits were standing about 20 feet apart on either side of the dirt
road. Several of the mourners proved hostile, lashing out at my
translator as a ``spy'' for Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic
Albanian leader.
</P>
<P>
   That day in Orlane, with its crude outhouses, simple wooden
structures and roaming flocks of goats and noisy chickens, offered
a glimpse into an armed rebellion that was still a year away.
</P>
<P>
   The slain man, Zahir Pajaziti, 34, had studied English at
Pristina University before dropping out. He had never held a steady
job and had been on the run for several months, appearing
unannounced at night, armed and in uniform, to visit his family and
then disappearing before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   He and his two companions had been stopped by police, who
apparently were looking for them, and were killed inside their car.
Mourners told of other small bands setting up roadblocks to collect
``war taxes'' and holding political meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to penetrate the group from the inside. Only in
Switzerland, where there was less danger in speaking with a foreign
reporter, did it prove possible to establish links with the
organization. This proved easier than I expected, in large part
because the KLA had then built close ties or melded with much of
Rugova's League of Democratic Kosovo (LDK).
</P>
<P>
   Once the rebellion erupted a year ago, local LDK leaders
immediately picked up weapons and became commanders of village
units. By the time of the uprising, Rugova had lost control of his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   Through the LDK, I arranged a meeting with a rebel commander in
Geneva _ the first such meeting with the press. My interlocutor was
nearly killed some months later when two men with ski masks arrived
at his unmarked office in Geneva and pulled out pistols with
silencers. The assistant who answered the bell, although shot in
the stomach, managed to slam shut the security door, no doubt
saving the official's life. The would-be assassins were never
apprehended. The office has since been closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel a deep, deep sense of betrayal,'' the KLA man told
me, echoing a sentiment that seemed to speak for most ethnic
Albanians. ``We mounted a peaceful, civilized protest to fight the
totalitarian rule of Milosevic. We did not go down the road of
nationalist hatred, always respecting Serbian churches and
monasteries. The result is that we were ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton peace negotiations, which dealt with Bosnia but not
Kosovo, ``taught us a painful truth, (that) those that want freedom
must fight for it. This is our sad duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovar Albanians, with understandable rage, did not grasp
why the Bosnian Serbs, responsible for some of the worst acts of
genocide since World War II, were handed nearly half of Bosnia at
Dayton. The recognition of Radovan Karadzic's gangster statelet,
Republika Srpska, was the final insult. It shattered all hopes for
peaceful change in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Young Albanians have bitterly repudiated not only Serb rule but
also Rugova's older, urbane and educated leadership. Pristina's
elites, they say, have betrayed the Albanian cause.
</P>
<P>
   On April 6, 1998, in the town of Jablanica, 30 miles north of
Dakovica, I bumped into a group of surly KLA fighters, dressed in a
motley collection of uniforms and equipped with an odd assortment
of hunting rifles, pistols, automatic weapons and hunting knives.
Killings by Belgrade, and the the humiliation of 10 years of abuse,
had left them seething with resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our territory,'' said a gaunt, nervous rebel with a
scraggly black beard and a chrome-plated pistol protruding from his
belt. ``We are through with these Albanian intellectuals in
Pristina, with journalists, diplomats, and everyone else. No one
saved our women and children from slaughter. Now it is up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the uprising in Kosovo last spring, the KLA had only a
couple hundred members. The most prominent inside Kosovo was Adem
Jashari, a gruff, taciturn peasant who, with his brother Hamza, had
been on the run from Serb authorities for months. They were among
the handful of militants who founded the KLA in 1991 before it
mushroomed into a popular army, much like the Islamist resistance
in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, they came closest to running the
organization, and many of their lieutenants and relatives _ at
least the ones that have survived _ now run the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   I had tried fruitlessly over three days in late 1997 to speak to
the Jasharis, spending one afternoon pleading with Shaban, their
70-year-old father, to pass on a message. He refused. His sons were
increasingly wanted men. Just a few weeks before, on Nov. 28, 1997,
uniformed KLA fighters had, for the first time, appeared before a
large crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Before some 20,000 mourners at the funeral of a schoolteacher
slain by the Serbs, two KLA leaders delivered a rousing call for
liberation that was greeted with a roar of approval and thunderous
chants of ``KLA! KLA! KLA!''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after Ramadan ended I was called to Geneva and told
that on Feb. 17, I should be waiting outside the old religious
school in Pristina at 8 a.m. I would be allowed to bring a
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   At the assigned hour, Wade Goddard, our photographer, and I
stood in the cold as two young men, both in jeans and wearing
combat boots, walked swiftly toward us. ``Be here at three o'clock
tomorrow, and make sure you are not followed,'' said one in broken
English. In less than a minute, they had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the next morning darting in and out of taxis and
walking through back alleys to make sure we were not being tailed.
A KLA official in Switzerland, in an insight into what has become a
respectable intelligence network, had thoughtfully provided me with
the name of the undercover cop who hung out in my small hotel in
Pristina to report on my activities.
</P>
<P>
   As we traveled the next day to Prekaz, the small town in central
Kosovo that was the Jasharis' headquarters, the group's well-oiled
underground network was evident. Men along the road signaled with
their hands that the way was clear of Serb checkpoints. When we
entered Prekaz, the driver honked the horn three times, and a group
of about a dozen men emerged from a shed to watch us.
</P>
<P>
   We turned up into a field covered with a thin layer of snow and
were stopped by a half-dozen heavily armed men in camouflage
uniforms. All wore on their shoulders the red-and-black KLA patch
with the double-headed Albanian eagle.
</P>
<P>
   We were escorted through the fields and along dirt roads. As our
patrol walked over the thin layer of snow, I noticed that no one
seemed to find the presence of the rebels unusual; even the
children hardly gave us a glance. We reached a small stone
farmhouse surrounded by a wooden fence.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, on cushions set on the floor along the wall, were Adem
and Hamza Jashari. The room, filled with acrid cigarette smoke, was
lit by a single kerosene lamp. Two burly bodyguards, clutching
automatic weapons, stood by the door. The two dirt roads leading
into the village had also been closed after we passed by bands of
armed fighters.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the first and last interview the Jasharis would
give to a reporter. In three weeks, I would be standing over their
bodies in a warehouse. Adem's neck had been slit, probably after he
had died of multiple bullet wounds. Shaban, his elderly father with
whom I had spent an afternoon, lay not far away.
</P>
<P>
   There were 51 corpses, 20 of them members of the Jashari clan,
many of them shot in the head at close range. About two dozen of
the victims were women and children, and some of the bodies were
blackened by the flames that had engulfed their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But that day, the encounter with the Jasharis offered a
revealing look at the contrasts within the KLA. Adem, with his
drooping bandito mustache and hostility, had none of Alban's
polished charm. The fighters around him were suspicious peasants,
prone to lash out at everyone, including Rugova, who was not part
of their inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted that they would never flee from the village if it
came under attack. Most, in fact, died in their homes, as have
scores of other Kosovar Albanians who have yet to master the basic
tenets of guerrilla warfare.

<P>
   As late as April 1998, Belgrade, blind to the looming rebellion
of young Albanians against Serb brutality, blithely continued to
rule Kosovo like a colonial backwater. On several occasions, as a
foreign correspondent for The New York Times, I saw two or three
beefy Serb police officers walloping young ethnic Albanians with
their clubs in the center of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   I once watched a cop shove a young boy of about 10, who held a
small wooden tray of individual cigarettes for sale, onto the
sidewalk. The cop laughed as the frightened child scrambled to
rescue the cigarettes from the mud puddles. Many of the Serb police
were sent to Kosovo as a demotion or a punishment for misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   One of their favorite pastimes was to set up roadblocks and
collect money from a long line of cars for invented traffic
violations. Drivers that did not have money or did not pay had
their documents seized.
</P>
<P>
   All this, however, paled in comparison with the brutal treatment
in Serb jails. People were beaten, tortured (usually while chained
to radiators) and held incommunicado for days and weeks. Some
simply vanished. Bejram Shehi, 39, a laborer in Switzerland, came
home last year to visit his family and was arrested by Serb police.
They accused him of carrying in money for the KLA. He had a black
hood pulled over his head, was handcuffed and was then pushed
through the back door of the police car onto the car floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They joked that they were taking me to see the Kosovo
Liberation Army,'' he said. ``We drove for about an hour. I was
taken out and brought to a basement, where I was stripped and
handcuffed to a radiator. I stayed like this for five days. They
beat me until I fainted, all the time asking about the Kosovo
Liberation Army, who belonged to it, how it raised money abroad,
and where it got its weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth day he was forced to sign a confession. ``I
promised to collaborate with them, and they gave me the name of a
police contact,'' he said, unfolding a small slip of white paper
from his wallet with a Serbian name and phone number written in
pencil.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, meanwhile, lived as if Kosovo were the raj, with all
civil and state jobs and a private police force to ensure their
privileged status in the birthplace of modern Serb nationalism.
Milosevic, presiding over a decaying economy, clung to the millions
of dollars a year in hard cash brought in by Kosovo's massive
Trepca mine complex, valued at $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The mine alone made him loath to give up the province to the
ethnic Albanians; the ultranationalist bigotry he had ridden to
power reinforced his obstinacy. Kosovo came to have the elements of
a political time bomb, ticking louder and louder while the world
looked the other way.
</P>
<P>
   I had my first encounter _ indeed the first interview by any
reporter _ with a rebel commander in April 1997. I'd been standing
with one of the top officials of Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate
Albanian leader. We were in front of the McDonald's in downtown
Geneva on a rainy afternoon. He told me that at 6 p.m., in the
Buffet des Premieres Classes at the Geneva train station, I would
find a man seated in a front booth with a copy of the Journal de
Geneve. The paper, I was told, would be completely unfolded. I was
to come alone. The conversation would take place in French.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few ethnic Albanian reporters had spoken to the
Jasharis, the clan that made up much of the KLA at the start of the
rebellion, none dared write about them or the KLA. This deeply
angered the Jasharis and aided my efforts to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   I walked into the station and saw a lean man in his late
thirties dressed in black jeans, a gray jacket and a purple
T-shirt. He looked up and motioned for me to follow him out the
door. We weaved quickly through the crowds outside the station
until we came to another cafe, where he took a seat along the back
wall facing the door.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel, who gave his nom de guerre as Alban, would within a
year lead a group of a few hundred fighters over the border from
northern Albania into Kosovo. The last I heard, he was commanding a
large unit in the province.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke quietly and without rancor. He said that, like most of
the leadership, he had spent years in prison for separatist
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no Tito,'' he said. The KLA leadership, he told me,
was divided between about 30 people, with no paramount leader.
These men were drawn primarily from the 5,000 or so ethnic
Albanians who had fought for the Muslim-Croat Federation in Bosnia
against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In another era the Jashari clan, which oversaw a large
black-market smuggling network, would have faded away into local
folklore. The Balkans are filled with small-time renegades who
combine criminal activity with thin, separatist ideologies.
Instead, by leveling Prekaz with 20 mm antiaircraft cannons and
killing more than 50 people, including many old people, women, and
children, the Serbs made the Jasharis into martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 23, 1998, U.S. Special Envoy to the Balkans Robert
Gelbard gave what many have interpreted as a green light to
Belgrade to go after the rebel bands by announcing in Pristina that
the KLA ``is without any question a terrorist group.'' He went on
to add that the United States ``condemns very strongly terrorist
activities in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks Serb forces had turned Prekaz into a smoldering
ruin, killed close to a hundred people, and ignited the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the Jashari compound was flattened with mortar
and cannon shells, I wandered among the piles of brick and cement.
In the ruins of one room lay a blackened book with a map that
showed a Greater Albania that included Kosovo, parts of Serbia,
much of Macedonia and parts of present-day Greece and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The map was drawn up on July 1, 1878, when the bajraktars, or
clan chieftains, from the Turkish realms of the southwest Balkans
founded the League for the Defense of the Albanian Nation. The book
was a potent reminder of what the war was about _ especially since,
with most ethnic Albanians concentrated in homogeneous areas
bordering Albania, the drive to extend Albania's borders remains
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   That drive is not only a wider threat to European stability but
also to Albanian moderation. Kosovar Albanians in exile _ and even
some who have gone back to fight _ express deep frustration at the
provincialism of the leadership within Kosovo, but to little avail.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the KLA, especially those who have not lived abroad,
are convinced that they have embarked on the century-long dream of
a Greater Albania. Many KLA commanders tout themselves as ``a
liberation army for all Albanians'' _ precisely what frightens the
NATO alliance most.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians were spurred by the collapse of Tito's Yugoslavia.
Croatia and Serbia, whose political ideology is often overtly
racist, unleashed a war in the early 1990s largely against unarmed
civilians to try to form ethnically ``pure'' enclaves and states.
Militias stormed through minority communities in drunken frenzies,
looting, burning, raping and murdering. They set up detention
centers, carried out mass executions and ignored tepid
international protests.
</P>
<P>
   But after Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989, Rugova
insisted on a very different road to independence, a Gandhi-like
plan to withdraw from all state institutions and create a parallel
government. His was to be a peaceful revolution and an example of
civility and tolerance that would earn the backing of the Western
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The former literature professor, with his glasses constantly
sliding down his nose and a scarf loosely draped around his neck,
has the distracted look of an aging Left Bank poet. Remote and out
of touch, he rarely leaves his small office in Pristina, even to
attend a funeral a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rugova's leadership, the ethnic Albanians had set up their
own schools, clinics and a shadow administration that levied taxes,
drawing on the resources of a diaspora of more than 600,000 ethnic
Albanians in Europe and some 300,000 in Canada and the United
States. The civil resistance lasted nearly a decade. Streams of
delegations from Kosovo traveled to Scandinavian countries to take
expenses-paid seminars in nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   But the protest, unsustainable in the long term and a victim of
international indifference, collapsed. Its death notice came after
the 1995 Dayton agreement was swiftly followed by the European
Union's recognition of Yugoslavia _ even though Yugoslavia had
failed to meet an EU demand to first resolve the Kosovo issue.

<P>
   Both the Serbs and the ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo are now
confident that force of arms can solve the impasse between them.
Despite NATO's air strikes, neither side has much incentive to lay
down its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have huge stockpiles of heavy weapons they have yet to
unleash, while the KLA has a large reserve of volunteers and a
porous border with Albania to smuggle in supplies and newly trained
recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Settling in for a long fight, the KLA probably has 30,000
automatic weapons, made available at bargain prices after Albanian
military arsenals were looted in the chaos after the spring 1997
economic meltdown. The rebels have made a concerted effort to
acquire German antitank weapons, heavy machine guns, sniper rifles
and rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, by launching the current rebellion, taking on
the Serbs and drawing international attention to the conflict, the
rebel group has done more in a year to further the cause of
independence for Kosovo than Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate leader,
was able to do over the preceding decade.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Washington insists on adhering to the principle that
all states in the former Yugoslavia be multiethnic, there is little
hope of a resolution. And as long as Belgrade is permitted to
station troops in Kosovo, which is part of the current agreement,
neither NATO soldiers nor Kosovar Albanians will be safe. Building
any kind of lasting peace or democratic institutions will be
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomatic efforts designed to keep the Serbs and the
ethnic Albanians in the same country mirror the fruitless peace
efforts carried out during the first three years of the Bosnian
war. The refusal to accept the creation of ethnically ``pure''
enclaves _ a decision that is strategically and morally
understandable _ leaves diplomats paying homage to multiethnic
institutions, however hollow, and lofty democratic ideals that
nearly all Balkan leaders detest.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo can remain a Serbian province and the two groups can live
together, this reasoning goes, if only the ethnic Albanians are
given a little more freedom. Given that between 1966 and 1989 an
estimated 130,000 Serbs left the province because of frequent
harassment and discrimination by the Kosovar Albanian majority,
this is at best naive.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement for which NATO went to war proposes to
deploy some 30,000 NATO troops and allow ethnic Albanian police to
take over security functions in Albanian-majority areas. The plan
would gradually cede local police control to the KLA, which would
probably comprise most of the force.
</P>
<P>
   But Serbia would keep troops in the province and handle security
along the borders _ especially the border with Albania, where the
KLA has set up logistics bases and smuggling routes for weapons and
fighters. The plan also calls for a phased disarming of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would be extremely hard to implement under a rebel
command that has spent the last three years preparing for war. The
KLA is wildly unlikaely to hand over its guns, especially given
Milosevic's pattern of ignoring formal agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The latent nationalism among most Serbs, coupled with the
disturbing belief that they were the real victims in Yugoslavia's
wars, is aroused by each Western attack. Belgrade knows that NATO
has no desire to become the air wing of the KLA. Anything much
short of all-out war on Yugoslavia only consolidates Milosevic's
grip on power and allows him to unleash his forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The West's blundering peace initiative has reminded the KLA not
to rely too much on NATO. The alliance was palpably reluctant to
move against the Serbs, although they have flagrantly violated the
agreement made last October to cease hostilities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the October pact, NATO bombed to get Belgrade to sign
on to the Rambouillet deal _ a shift not lost on the Kosovar
Albanians. Milosevic, for his part, has driven NATO crazy since the
Kosovo crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hill, the current U.S. Kosovo mediator, has carried out
fruitless shuttle diplomacy since last spring; on his latest trip
to Belgrade, Milosevic did not even meet with him. Put bluntly, the
Serb leaders stiffed the United States. The KLA is correctly
distrustful of Western intentions and resolve.
</P>
<P>
   That distrust led to the decision by the KLA not to sign the
Rambouillet agreement in the first round of talks last February _
which, in turn, let the alliance off the moral hook. Kosovar
intransigence gave the West the excuse it was looking for not to
implement the October agreement and deepened the already wide rifts
within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   If the West's peace push eventually dies, as now appears likely,
the KLA leaders will swiftly become utterly disenchanted with the
West and turn to Islamic radicals ready to back another battle by
Muslims against Orthodox Christians. The Serbs, whose information
is admittedly often unreliable, say that Islamic charities in the
Persian Gulf are giving millions to the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they have detected ties to Islamist
organizations and suspect that some money has been forwarded to the
KLA. I saw bearded mujahideen, who did not look Albanian, wandering
around the staging areas in northern Albania, a hint that there may
be some truth to these assertions.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs also contend that the KLA has about 1,000 foreign
mercenaries from Albania, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Bosnia
and Croatia, as well as British and German instructors. Most of the
mercenaries are probably Albanian nationals, especially former
Albanian army officers, police officers and members of the state
security services.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is clearly preparing for a long slog. It has tried to
recruit ethnic Albanian veterans in Croatia, who formed two
battalions in Croatia's war against the Serbs. In early February,
Yugoslav officials said that they had seized $500,000 worth of
weapons, ammunition and uniforms for the KLA that were smuggled in
from Croatia in a truck.
</P>
<P>
   There are rebel training camps now in Albania _ apparently in
Ljabinot, near Tirana _ as well as ones I saw in Tropoja (near the
Yugoslav border), Kuks, and Bajram Curi.
</P>
<P>
   Were the conflagration to result in the deployment of
peacekeeping NATO ground forces _ a proposition that should not be
taken lightly _ it would have risks that were not faced in Bosnia.
Kosovo, unlike Cyprus and Bosnia, has no fixed lines dividing the
antagonists. The province's battle lines resemble the constantly
shifting sands of Central America's 1980s guerrilla wars: a stretch
of road that is safe in the morning can be deadly in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is an insurrection rather than a war between
armies, rebels can be farmers one day and combatants the next. They
will be impossible to define.
</P>
<P>
   To muddy the waters further, the KLA is poorly led, with no
central command and little discipline. Many villages have formed ad
hoc militias that, while they identify themselves as KLA, act
independently.
</P>
<P>
   I found that KLA commanders often spent as much time trying to
find out what these militias were doing _ closing down unauthorized
roadblocks and curbing excesses by local warlords _ as they did
fighting the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem facing any peacekeeping force will be
defining who belongs to the KLA and who does not. The Serb soldiers
and special police, in uniform and headquartered in barracks, will
prove far easier to monitor, if not always control. But the overall
picture is one of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, by contrast, the front lines had changed little by
late 1992, and the war often resembled World War I clashes on the
western front, albeit on a much smaller scale. Hundreds of people
were wounded or killed in the trench warfare, but the trenches
themselves moved little.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, at least by the fall of 1995, conditions were much
riper for peacemaking. The Bosnian Serbs, battered by two weeks of
heavy NATO bombing, were a spent and broken force. On the other
hand, even after this spring's NATO air strikes and ruthless
Serbian attacks, Kosovo's combatants may still have vigor to spare.
Kosovo has not yet been granted the dubious blessing of exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs appear to believe that the problem requires not
negotiation but more force. Morale among the Serbs is low, and
there are steady reports of desertions. The heavily mechanized Serb
patrols stick to the blacktop roads while the KLA controls a
network of back dirt roads that often skirt police checkpoints. And
Belgrade's decision to scorch villages is only flooding the rebels
with recruits.
</P>
<P>
   At this late stage in the game, a NATO deployment _ if Milosevic
can somehow be bombed into accepting it _ will over the short term
save lives, just as it did in Bosnia. But it will not bring back
the autonomy that Tito, the last of the Habsburgs, oversaw with
such skill.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the stationing of international troops may prevent
all-out fighting and provide the breathing space to negotiate a
workable solution. But given the deep rifts between the sides, the
latter is hardly likely.
</P>
<P>
   The international community would then face the stark choice
between remaining in Kosovo for a long time or pulling out after
the proposed three-year period, with the likelihood that those on
both sides of the divide would again pick up their guns.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it will come to this: Led by the KLA, Kosovo will
separate from Serbia, whether by negotiations or by violence.

   As someone who has always been a chronic sufferer of
foot-in-mouth disease, I can't say how much I wish Ronna
Lichtenberg's new book had come across my desk sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work Would Be Great If It Weren't for All the People''
($12.95, Hyperion) is subtitled ``Making Office Politics Work for
You.'' And while Lichtenberg comes from the kind of cubicled
corporate world that Dilbert calls home _ she's a former senior
vice president at Prudential Securities and now runs a marketing
and strategy consulting firm _ she manages to cram in information
relevant to almost any office environment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a selection of some of the more valuable tidbits you
should remember before wading into the shark pool:
</P>
<P>
   _In a new job, beware the first person who wants to be your
friend. The odds are there's a good reason for this, and that it's
generally not good for you.
</P>
<P>
   _Friends are what you have outside the office.
</P>
<P>
   _Snitching is like planning the perfect murder: It's hard to
pull off.
</P>
<P>
   _Even if you're doing everything else right, if you're doing
time wrong (i.e., slacking off), you're toast.
</P>
<P>
   _Always treat people above you as though they were your main
clients.
</P>
<P>
   _If you don't have anything nice to say, don't write it down in
a memo.
</P>
<P>
   _Control your lying, and lie sensibly. It's better to lie about
your feelings than about reality.
</P>
<P>
   _Everyone speaks from his or her own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   _Do as much as you can for the right people before being asked.
</P>
<P>
   _Just because Spouse pops up the hood does not mean that Spouse
can fix the engine (i.e., don't always take your spouse's advice on
your work problems).
</P>
<P>
   _If your boss isn't talking to you about your future, then you
probably don't have one.
</P>
<P>
   _Even when you're sure someone hates you, the odds are good
you're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   _If you always eat with people junior to you, it communicates a
message, as does eating only with people senior to you.
</P>
<P>
   _Most people are defeated not by other people but by their
reactions to other people.
</P>
<P>
   Paranoid yet? Good. Now I've gotta go pick up my boss's
dry-cleaning.

<P>
   The rumbles of yet another nationalist earthquake are shaking
the former Yugoslavia. Rising from the fetid hovels of Pristina and
the concrete-block family farms of rural Kosovo is the newest
political and military force to beset the Balkans _ the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA), known to Albanians as the Ushtria Clirimtare
e Kosoves.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of this militant armed group, now numbering
several thousand fighters, has dimmed hopes that even a compromise
agreement with Belgrade could be successfully implemented.
Emboldened by NATO's March bombing of the Serbian military, the KLA
will wage a protracted guerrilla war in the Serbian province that
could ignite a wider war in neighboring Macedonia and Albania,
potentially even dragging in Greece and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is uncompromising in its quest for an independent Kosovo
now and a Greater Albania later. And it has, to the consternation
of Washington's would-be peacemakers, supplanted the ineffectual
leadership of the moderate voice of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority, Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is important out of all proportion to its size _ not
merely because it will probably eventually get Kosovo to secede
from Serbia, but because it now represents the aspirations of most
Kosovar Albanians. To understand the current conflict in Kosovo and
America's stakes in its resolution, one must understand the KLA,
how it came into being, who leads it, what drives it and why it now
speaks for a majority of Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Even a truly vicious, Bosnia-like wave of atrocities by the
Serbs in reprisal for NATO's attacks will only pour fuel on the
separatist fire. The grim reality is that we had better get to know
the KLA _ because it is not going to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's Albanians have grown increasingly embittered. By
attempting to include the KLA in the peace process that began in
February at the French chateau of Rambouillet, the Western alliance
is working feverishly _ even as it bombs the Serbs _ to blunt the
momentum toward a war of independence.
</P>
<P>
   The allies want NATO troops to separate the province's warring
factions, although Belgrade is wary. The underlying idea behind
creating a theoretically temporary, NATO- enforced military
protectorate in Kosovo is to buy time for a three-year transition
period in which ethnic Albanians will be allowed to elect a
parliament and other governing bodies _ meeting enough of their
aspirations, it is hoped, to keep Kosovo from seceding.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Western alliance's response to the
Kosovo crisis, however ragged, shows that some lessons have been
learned from the bumbling in Bosnia. The Europeans no longer talk
about handling matters alone but demand the presence of the United
States. Threats have been backed up by force.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a consensus that if some kind of a solution is not
found soon, the fighting inside Kosovo _ an area the size of
Connecticut _ will accelerate and make future intervention
difficult, if not impossible. Even the Pentagon officials who
fought like wildcats to keep U.S. forces out of Bosnia accept that
some 4,000 U.S. troops will have to be deployed in Kosovo to make
any peacekeeping force credible.
</P>
<P>
   But, as in Bosnia, the West is wedded to a solution that might
have worked earlier in the conflict but is now untenable. Serbian
ethnic cleansing has taken on a somewhat different character in
Kosovo than in Bosnia. In Kosovo, Serbian ethnic cleansing is to a
large degree tactical, designed to deny the rebels succor from
civilians and therefore aimed primarily at the inhabitants of KLA
strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serb campaign has been more than brutal enough to make
autonomy for Kosovo a nonstarter. The ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
who make up 90 percent of its 2 million inhabitants, cannot remain
in Serbia after the horrific recent bloodshed, the displacement of
a quarter of a million people, and the razing of scores of
villages.
</P>
<P>
   They do not trust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic or the
Serbs _ and given Belgrade's bloody campaigns against ethnic
minorities over the past decade and its habit of breaking
agreements, who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians have been radicalized, and their new voice is the
KLA. Rugova, the old pacifist, is more a symbol of outmoded
moderation than a leader.
</P>
<P>
   By ignoring the plight of the Kosovar Albanians for nearly a
decade, the West lost much of its credibility before NATO began
bombing. Many Albanians feel let down by the world and their own
meek leaders. What is most striking, then, about the KLA
insurrection is not that it occurred but that it took so long to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA fighters are the province's new power brokers. Whatever
political leadership emerges in Kosovo will come from the rebel
ranks, and it will be militant, nationalist, uncompromising and
deeply suspicious of all outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies, preoccupied with tracking militant
Islamist groups and Iranian agents in Bosnia, were caught off guard
by the Kosovo rebel force's emergence, strength and popularity.
Indeed, some diplomats argued as late as last year about whether
the shadowy group really existed _ even as small armed bands roamed
Drenica in central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The first KLA armed attack took place in May 1993, killing two
Serb police officers and wounding five more. But the rebel group _
its membership largely drawn from a few clans in Kosovo and
radicals in the Albanian diaspora _ was founded eight years ago.
Most of its leadership has spent years in prison for separatist
activity, many having been jailed earlier by Tito's communist
government.
</P>
<P>
   Like all revolutionaries who have spent years underground or in
jail, the KLA leaders are wary of the outside world and given to
secrecy, paranoia and appalling mendacity when they feel it serves
their interests, which is most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA splits down a bizarre ideological divide, with hints of
fascism on one side and whiffs of communism on the other. The
former faction is led by the sons and grandsons of rightist
Albanian fighters _ either the heirs of those who fought in the
World War II fascist militias and the Skanderbeg volunteer SS
division raised by the Nazis, or the descendants of the rightist
Albanian rebels who rose up against the Serbs 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although never much of a fighting force, the Skanderbeg division
took part in the shameful roundup and deportation of the province's
few hundred Jews during the Holocaust. The division's remnants
fought Tito's Partisans at the end of the war, leaving thousands of
ethnic Albanians dead.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by KLA commanders to dress their police in black
fatigues and order their fighters to salute with a clenched fist to
the forehead led many to worry about these fascist antecedents.
Following such criticism, the salute has been changed to the
traditional open-palm salute common in the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   The second KLA faction, comprising most of the KLA leaders in
exile, are old Stalinists who were once bankrolled by the
xenophobic Enver Hoxha, the dictator of Albania who died in 1985.
This group led a militant separatist movement that was really about
integration with Hoxha's Albania. Most of these leaders were
students at Pristina University after 1974, when Belgrade granted
the province autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Freed from Yugoslav oversight, the university imported thousands
of textbooks from Albania, all carefully edited by Hoxha's
Stalinist regime, along with at least a dozen militant Albanian
professors. Along with its degree programs, Pristina University
began to quietly school young Kosovar leaders in the art of
revolution. Not only did a huge percentage of the KLA leadership
come out of the university, but so, ominously, did the ethnic
Albanian leadership in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The two KLA factions have little sympathy with or understanding
of democratic institutions. Split bitterly between radical left and
radical right, they are now arguing over whether to carry the
fighting to the pockets of ethnic Albanians who live in western
Macedonia and neighboring Montenegro. The only thing they agree on
is the need to liberate Kosovo from Serbian rule. All else,
menacingly, will be decided later. It is not said how.
</P>
<P>
   Given these deep divisions, it is no accident that the KLA has
failed to create a political organization or even a vague platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think we have an ideology,'' Jakup Krasniqi, the
KLA's mercurial spokesman, told the Albanian-language daily Koha
Ditore on July 12, 1998. ``And in fact we do not have time for such
things even if we were interested in them, because we have our main
job to do, which is the task of liberation.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   I first stumbled into the Kosovo Liberation Army in February
1997, shortly after a police car was ambushed by armed
``terrorists,'' as the Serbs called them.
</P>
<P>
   Three uniformed ethnic Albanians equipped with automatic weapons
were killed in the firefight. I took a taxi that had seen better
days to attend the wake for one of them.
</P>
<P>
   As I approached the village of Orlane, a few lean men in track
suits were standing about 20 feet apart on either side of the dirt
road. Several of the mourners proved hostile, lashing out at my
translator as a ``spy'' for Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic
Albanian leader.
</P>
<P>
   That day in Orlane, with its crude outhouses, simple wooden
structures and roaming flocks of goats and noisy chickens, offered
a glimpse into an armed rebellion that was still a year away.
</P>
<P>
   The slain man, Zahir Pajaziti, 34, had studied English at
Pristina University before dropping out. He had never held a steady
job and had been on the run for several months, appearing
unannounced at night, armed and in uniform, to visit his family and
then disappearing before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   He and his two companions had been stopped by police, who
apparently were looking for them, and were killed inside their car.
Mourners told of other small bands setting up roadblocks to collect
``war taxes'' and holding political meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to penetrate the group from the inside. Only in
Switzerland, where there was less danger in speaking with a foreign
reporter, did it prove possible to establish links with the
organization. This proved easier than I expected, in large part
because the KLA had then built close ties or melded with much of
Rugova's League of Democratic Kosovo (LDK).
</P>
<P>
   Once the rebellion erupted a year ago, local LDK leaders
immediately picked up weapons and became commanders of village
units. By the time of the uprising, Rugova had lost control of his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   Through the LDK, I arranged a meeting with a rebel commander in
Geneva _ the first such meeting with the press. My interlocutor was
nearly killed some months later when two men with ski masks arrived
at his unmarked office in Geneva and pulled out pistols with
silencers. The assistant who answered the bell, although shot in
the stomach, managed to slam shut the security door, no doubt
saving the official's life. The would-be assassins were never
apprehended. The office has since been closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel a deep, deep sense of betrayal,'' the KLA man told
me, echoing a sentiment that seemed to speak for most ethnic
Albanians. ``We mounted a peaceful, civilized protest to fight the
totalitarian rule of Milosevic. We did not go down the road of
nationalist hatred, always respecting Serbian churches and
monasteries. The result is that we were ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton peace negotiations, which dealt with Bosnia but not
Kosovo, ``taught us a painful truth, (that) those that want freedom
must fight for it. This is our sad duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovar Albanians, with understandable rage, did not grasp
why the Bosnian Serbs, responsible for some of the worst acts of
genocide since World War II, were handed nearly half of Bosnia at
Dayton. The recognition of Radovan Karadzic's gangster statelet,
Republika Srpska, was the final insult. It shattered all hopes for
peaceful change in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Young Albanians have bitterly repudiated not only Serb rule but
also Rugova's older, urbane and educated leadership. Pristina's
elites, they say, have betrayed the Albanian cause.
</P>
<P>
   On April 6, 1998, in the town of Jablanica, 30 miles north of
Dakovica, I bumped into a group of surly KLA fighters, dressed in a
motley collection of uniforms and equipped with an odd assortment
of hunting rifles, pistols, automatic weapons and hunting knives.
Killings by Belgrade, and the the humiliation of 10 years of abuse,
had left them seething with resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our territory,'' said a gaunt, nervous rebel with a
scraggly black beard and a chrome-plated pistol protruding from his
belt. ``We are through with these Albanian intellectuals in
Pristina, with journalists, diplomats, and everyone else. No one
saved our women and children from slaughter. Now it is up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the uprising in Kosovo last spring, the KLA had only a
couple hundred members. The most prominent inside Kosovo was Adem
Jashari, a gruff, taciturn peasant who, with his brother Hamza, had
been on the run from Serb authorities for months. They were among
the handful of militants who founded the KLA in 1991 before it
mushroomed into a popular army, much like the Islamist resistance
in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, they came closest to running the
organization, and many of their lieutenants and relatives _ at
least the ones that have survived _ now run the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   I had tried fruitlessly over three days in late 1997 to speak to
the Jasharis, spending one afternoon pleading with Shaban, their
70-year-old father, to pass on a message. He refused. His sons were
increasingly wanted men. Just a few weeks before, on Nov. 28, 1997,
uniformed KLA fighters had, for the first time, appeared before a
large crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Before some 20,000 mourners at the funeral of a schoolteacher
slain by the Serbs, two KLA leaders delivered a rousing call for
liberation that was greeted with a roar of approval and thunderous
chants of ``KLA! KLA! KLA!''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after Ramadan ended I was called to Geneva and told
that on Feb. 17, I should be waiting outside the old religious
school in Pristina at 8 a.m. I would be allowed to bring a
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   At the assigned hour, Wade Goddard, our photographer, and I
stood in the cold as two young men, both in jeans and wearing
combat boots, walked swiftly toward us. ``Be here at three o'clock
tomorrow, and make sure you are not followed,'' said one in broken
English. In less than a minute, they had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the next morning darting in and out of taxis and
walking through back alleys to make sure we were not being tailed.
A KLA official in Switzerland, in an insight into what has become a
respectable intelligence network, had thoughtfully provided me with
the name of the undercover cop who hung out in my small hotel in
Pristina to report on my activities.
</P>
<P>
   As we traveled the next day to Prekaz, the small town in central
Kosovo that was the Jasharis' headquarters, the group's well-oiled
underground network was evident. Men along the road signaled with
their hands that the way was clear of Serb checkpoints. When we
entered Prekaz, the driver honked the horn three times, and a group
of about a dozen men emerged from a shed to watch us.
</P>
<P>
   We turned up into a field covered with a thin layer of snow and
were stopped by a half-dozen heavily armed men in camouflage
uniforms. All wore on their shoulders the red-and-black KLA patch
with the double-headed Albanian eagle.
</P>
<P>
   We were escorted through the fields and along dirt roads. As our
patrol walked over the thin layer of snow, I noticed that no one
seemed to find the presence of the rebels unusual; even the
children hardly gave us a glance. We reached a small stone
farmhouse surrounded by a wooden fence.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, on cushions set on the floor along the wall, were Adem
and Hamza Jashari. The room, filled with acrid cigarette smoke, was
lit by a single kerosene lamp. Two burly bodyguards, clutching
automatic weapons, stood by the door. The two dirt roads leading
into the village had also been closed after we passed by bands of
armed fighters.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the first and last interview the Jasharis would
give to a reporter. In three weeks, I would be standing over their
bodies in a warehouse. Adem's neck had been slit, probably after he
had died of multiple bullet wounds. Shaban, his elderly father with
whom I had spent an afternoon, lay not far away.
</P>
<P>
   There were 51 corpses, 20 of them members of the Jashari clan,
many of them shot in the head at close range. About two dozen of
the victims were women and children, and some of the bodies were
blackened by the flames that had engulfed their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But that day, the encounter with the Jasharis offered a
revealing look at the contrasts within the KLA. Adem, with his
drooping bandito mustache and hostility, had none of Alban's
polished charm. The fighters around him were suspicious peasants,
prone to lash out at everyone, including Rugova, who was not part
of their inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted that they would never flee from the village if it
came under attack. Most, in fact, died in their homes, as have
scores of other Kosovar Albanians who have yet to master the basic
tenets of guerrilla warfare.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As late as April 1998, Belgrade, blind to the looming rebellion
of young Albanians against Serb brutality, blithely continued to
rule Kosovo like a colonial backwater. On several occasions, as a
foreign correspondent for The New York Times, I saw two or three
beefy Serb police officers walloping young ethnic Albanians with
their clubs in the center of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   I once watched a cop shove a young boy of about 10, who held a
small wooden tray of individual cigarettes for sale, onto the
sidewalk. The cop laughed as the frightened child scrambled to
rescue the cigarettes from the mud puddles. Many of the Serb police
were sent to Kosovo as a demotion or a punishment for misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   One of their favorite pastimes was to set up roadblocks and
collect money from a long line of cars for invented traffic
violations. Drivers that did not have money or did not pay had
their documents seized.
</P>
<P>
   All this, however, paled in comparison with the brutal treatment
in Serb jails. People were beaten, tortured (usually while chained
to radiators) and held incommunicado for days and weeks. Some
simply vanished. Bejram Shehi, 39, a laborer in Switzerland, came
home last year to visit his family and was arrested by Serb police.
They accused him of carrying in money for the KLA. He had a black
hood pulled over his head, was handcuffed and was then pushed
through the back door of the police car onto the car floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They joked that they were taking me to see the Kosovo
Liberation Army,'' he said. ``We drove for about an hour. I was
taken out and brought to a basement, where I was stripped and
handcuffed to a radiator. I stayed like this for five days. They
beat me until I fainted, all the time asking about the Kosovo
Liberation Army, who belonged to it, how it raised money abroad,
and where it got its weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth day he was forced to sign a confession. ``I
promised to collaborate with them, and they gave me the name of a
police contact,'' he said, unfolding a small slip of white paper
from his wallet with a Serbian name and phone number written in
pencil.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, meanwhile, lived as if Kosovo were the raj, with all
civil and state jobs and a private police force to ensure their
privileged status in the birthplace of modern Serb nationalism.
Milosevic, presiding over a decaying economy, clung to the millions
of dollars a year in hard cash brought in by Kosovo's massive
Trepca mine complex, valued at $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The mine alone made him loath to give up the province to the
ethnic Albanians; the ultranationalist bigotry he had ridden to
power reinforced his obstinacy. Kosovo came to have the elements of
a political time bomb, ticking louder and louder while the world
looked the other way.
</P>
<P>
   I had my first encounter _ indeed the first interview by any
reporter _ with a rebel commander in April 1997. I'd been standing
with one of the top officials of Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate
Albanian leader. We were in front of the McDonald's in downtown
Geneva on a rainy afternoon. He told me that at 6 p.m., in the
Buffet des Premieres Classes at the Geneva train station, I would
find a man seated in a front booth with a copy of the Journal de
Geneve. The paper, I was told, would be completely unfolded. I was
to come alone. The conversation would take place in French.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few ethnic Albanian reporters had spoken to the
Jasharis, the clan that made up much of the KLA at the start of the
rebellion, none dared write about them or the KLA. This deeply
angered the Jasharis and aided my efforts to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   I walked into the station and saw a lean man in his late
thirties dressed in black jeans, a gray jacket and a purple
T-shirt. He looked up and motioned for me to follow him out the
door. We weaved quickly through the crowds outside the station
until we came to another cafe, where he took a seat along the back
wall facing the door.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel, who gave his nom de guerre as Alban, would within a
year lead a group of a few hundred fighters over the border from
northern Albania into Kosovo. The last I heard, he was commanding a
large unit in the province.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke quietly and without rancor. He said that, like most of
the leadership, he had spent years in prison for separatist
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no Tito,'' he said. The KLA leadership, he told me,
was divided between about 30 people, with no paramount leader.
These men were drawn primarily from the 5,000 or so ethnic
Albanians who had fought for the Muslim-Croat Federation in Bosnia
against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In another era the Jashari clan, which oversaw a large
black-market smuggling network, would have faded away into local
folklore. The Balkans are filled with small-time renegades who
combine criminal activity with thin, separatist ideologies.
Instead, by leveling Prekaz with 20 mm antiaircraft cannons and
killing more than 50 people, including many old people, women, and
children, the Serbs made the Jasharis into martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 23, 1998, U.S. Special Envoy to the Balkans Robert
Gelbard gave what many have interpreted as a green light to
Belgrade to go after the rebel bands by announcing in Pristina that
the KLA ``is without any question a terrorist group.'' He went on
to add that the United States ``condemns very strongly terrorist
activities in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks Serb forces had turned Prekaz into a smoldering
ruin, killed close to a hundred people, and ignited the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the Jashari compound was flattened with mortar
and cannon shells, I wandered among the piles of brick and cement.
In the ruins of one room lay a blackened book with a map that
showed a Greater Albania that included Kosovo, parts of Serbia,
much of Macedonia and parts of present-day Greece and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The map was drawn up on July 1, 1878, when the bajraktars, or
clan chieftains, from the Turkish realms of the southwest Balkans
founded the League for the Defense of the Albanian Nation. The book
was a potent reminder of what the war was about _ especially since,
with most ethnic Albanians concentrated in homogeneous areas
bordering Albania, the drive to extend Albania's borders remains
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   That drive is not only a wider threat to European stability but
also to Albanian moderation. Kosovar Albanians in exile _ and even
some who have gone back to fight _ express deep frustration at the
provincialism of the leadership within Kosovo, but to little avail.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the KLA, especially those who have not lived abroad,
are convinced that they have embarked on the century-long dream of
a Greater Albania. Many KLA commanders tout themselves as ``a
liberation army for all Albanians'' _ precisely what frightens the
NATO alliance most.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians were spurred by the collapse of Tito's Yugoslavia.
Croatia and Serbia, whose political ideology is often overtly
racist, unleashed a war in the early 1990s largely against unarmed
civilians to try to form ethnically ``pure'' enclaves and states.
Militias stormed through minority communities in drunken frenzies,
looting, burning, raping and murdering. They set up detention
centers, carried out mass executions and ignored tepid
international protests.
</P>
<P>
   But after Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989, Rugova
insisted on a very different road to independence, a Gandhi-like
plan to withdraw from all state institutions and create a parallel
government. His was to be a peaceful revolution and an example of
civility and tolerance that would earn the backing of the Western
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The former literature professor, with his glasses constantly
sliding down his nose and a scarf loosely draped around his neck,
has the distracted look of an aging Left Bank poet. Remote and out
of touch, he rarely leaves his small office in Pristina, even to
attend a funeral a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rugova's leadership, the ethnic Albanians had set up their
own schools, clinics and a shadow administration that levied taxes,
drawing on the resources of a diaspora of more than 600,000 ethnic
Albanians in Europe and some 300,000 in Canada and the United
States. The civil resistance lasted nearly a decade. Streams of
delegations from Kosovo traveled to Scandinavian countries to take
expenses-paid seminars in nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   But the protest, unsustainable in the long term and a victim of
international indifference, collapsed. Its death notice came after
the 1995 Dayton agreement was swiftly followed by the European
Union's recognition of Yugoslavia _ even though Yugoslavia had
failed to meet an EU demand to first resolve the Kosovo issue.

   Both the Serbs and the ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo are now
confident that force of arms can solve the impasse between them.
Despite NATO's air strikes, neither side has much incentive to lay
down its weapons.

   The Serbs have huge stockpiles of heavy weapons they have yet to

porous border with Albania to smuggle in supplies and newly trained
recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Settling in for a long fight, the KLA probably has 30,000
automatic weapons, made available at bargain prices after Albanian
military arsenals were looted in the chaos after the spring 1997
economic meltdown. The rebels have made a concerted effort to
acquire German antitank weapons, heavy machine guns, sniper rifles
and rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, by launching the current rebellion, taking on
the Serbs and drawing international attention to the conflict, the
rebel group has done more in a year to further the cause of
independence for Kosovo than Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate leader,
was able to do over the preceding decade.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Washington insists on adhering to the principle that
all states in the former Yugoslavia be multiethnic, there is little
hope of a resolution. And as long as Belgrade is permitted to
station troops in Kosovo, which is part of the current agreement,
neither NATO soldiers nor Kosovar Albanians will be safe. Building
any kind of lasting peace or democratic institutions will be
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomatic efforts designed to keep the Serbs and the
ethnic Albanians in the same country mirror the fruitless peace
efforts carried out during the first three years of the Bosnian
war. The refusal to accept the creation of ethnically ``pure''
enclaves _ a decision that is strategically and morally
understandable _ leaves diplomats paying homage to multiethnic
institutions, however hollow, and lofty democratic ideals that
nearly all Balkan leaders detest.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo can remain a Serbian province and the two groups can live
together, this reasoning goes, if only the ethnic Albanians are
given a little more freedom. Given that between 1966 and 1989 an
estimated 130,000 Serbs left the province because of frequent
harassment and discrimination by the Kosovar Albanian majority,
this is at best naive.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement for which NATO went to war proposes to
deploy some 30,000 NATO troops and allow ethnic Albanian police to
take over security functions in Albanian-majority areas. The plan
would gradually cede local police control to the KLA, which would
probably comprise most of the force.
</P>
<P>
   But Serbia would keep troops in the province and handle security
along the borders _ especially the border with Albania, where the
KLA has set up logistics bases and smuggling routes for weapons and
fighters. The plan also calls for a phased disarming of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would be extremely hard to implement under a rebel
command that has spent the last three years preparing for war. The
KLA is wildly unlikaely to hand over its guns, especially given
Milosevic's pattern of ignoring formal agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The latent nationalism among most Serbs, coupled with the
disturbing belief that they were the real victims in Yugoslavia's
wars, is aroused by each Western attack. Belgrade knows that NATO
has no desire to become the air wing of the KLA. Anything much
short of all-out war on Yugoslavia only consolidates Milosevic's
grip on power and allows him to unleash his forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The West's blundering peace initiative has reminded the KLA not
to rely too much on NATO. The alliance was palpably reluctant to
move against the Serbs, although they have flagrantly violated the
agreement made last October to cease hostilities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the October pact, NATO bombed to get Belgrade to sign
on to the Rambouillet deal _ a shift not lost on the Kosovar
Albanians. Milosevic, for his part, has driven NATO crazy since the
Kosovo crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hill, the current U.S. Kosovo mediator, has carried out
fruitless shuttle diplomacy since last spring; on his latest trip
to Belgrade, Milosevic did not even meet with him. Put bluntly, the
Serb leaders stiffed the United States. The KLA is correctly
distrustful of Western intentions and resolve.
</P>
<P>
   That distrust led to the decision by the KLA not to sign the
Rambouillet agreement in the first round of talks last February _
which, in turn, let the alliance off the moral hook. Kosovar
intransigence gave the West the excuse it was looking for not to
implement the October agreement and deepened the already wide rifts
within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   If the West's peace push eventually dies, as now appears likely,
the KLA leaders will swiftly become utterly disenchanted with the
West and turn to Islamic radicals ready to back another battle by
Muslims against Orthodox Christians. The Serbs, whose information
is admittedly often unreliable, say that Islamic charities in the
Persian Gulf are giving millions to the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they have detected ties to Islamist
organizations and suspect that some money has been forwarded to the
KLA. I saw bearded mujahideen, who did not look Albanian, wandering
around the staging areas in northern Albania, a hint that there may
be some truth to these assertions.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs also contend that the KLA has about 1,000 foreign
mercenaries from Albania, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Bosnia
and Croatia, as well as British and German instructors. Most of the
mercenaries are probably Albanian nationals, especially former
Albanian army officers, police officers and members of the state
security services.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is clearly preparing for a long slog. It has tried to
recruit ethnic Albanian veterans in Croatia, who formed two
battalions in Croatia's war against the Serbs. In early February,
Yugoslav officials said that they had seized $500,000 worth of
weapons, ammunition and uniforms for the KLA that were smuggled in
from Croatia in a truck.
</P>
<P>
   There are rebel training camps now in Albania _ apparently in
Ljabinot, near Tirana _ as well as ones I saw in Tropoja (near the
Yugoslav border), Kuks, and Bajram Curi.
</P>
<P>
   Were the conflagration to result in the deployment of
peacekeeping NATO ground forces _ a proposition that should not be
taken lightly _ it would have risks that were not faced in Bosnia.
Kosovo, unlike Cyprus and Bosnia, has no fixed lines dividing the
antagonists. The province's battle lines resemble the constantly
shifting sands of Central America's 1980s guerrilla wars: a stretch
of road that is safe in the morning can be deadly in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is an insurrection rather than a war between
armies, rebels can be farmers one day and combatants the next. They
will be impossible to define.
</P>
<P>
   To muddy the waters further, the KLA is poorly led, with no
central command and little discipline. Many villages have formed ad
hoc militias that, while they identify themselves as KLA, act
independently.
</P>
<P>
   I found that KLA commanders often spent as much time trying to
find out what these militias were doing _ closing down unauthorized
roadblocks and curbing excesses by local warlords _ as they did
fighting the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem facing any peacekeeping force will be
defining who belongs to the KLA and who does not. The Serb soldiers
and special police, in uniform and headquartered in barracks, will
prove far easier to monitor, if not always control. But the overall
picture is one of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, by contrast, the front lines had changed little by
late 1992, and the war often resembled World War I clashes on the
western front, albeit on a much smaller scale. Hundreds of people
were wounded or killed in the trench warfare, but the trenches
themselves moved little.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, at least by the fall of 1995, conditions were much
riper for peacemaking. The Bosnian Serbs, battered by two weeks of
heavy NATO bombing, were a spent and broken force. On the other
hand, even after this spring's NATO air strikes and ruthless
Serbian attacks, Kosovo's combatants may still have vigor to spare.
Kosovo has not yet been granted the dubious blessing of exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs appear to believe that the problem requires not
negotiation but more force. Morale among the Serbs is low, and
there are steady reports of desertions. The heavily mechanized Serb
patrols stick to the blacktop roads while the KLA controls a
network of back dirt roads that often skirt police checkpoints. And
Belgrade's decision to scorch villages is only flooding the rebels
with recruits.
</P>
<P>
   At this late stage in the game, a NATO deployment _ if Milosevic
can somehow be bombed into accepting it _ will over the short term
save lives, just as it did in Bosnia. But it will not bring back
the autonomy that Tito, the last of the Habsburgs, oversaw with
such skill.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the stationing of international troops may prevent
all-out fighting and provide the breathing space to negotiate a
workable solution. But given the deep rifts between the sides, the
latter is hardly likely.
</P>
<P>
   The international community would then face the stark choice
between remaining in Kosovo for a long time or pulling out after
the proposed three-year period, with the likelihood that those on
both sides of the divide would again pick up their guns.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it will come to this: Led by the KLA, Kosovo will
separate from Serbia, whether by negotiations or by violence.

<P>
   ``Foreign policy leadership'' has become an ambiguous phrase. It
once meant leading the American people in the formation and
execution of national policy.
</P>
<P>
   But some now use it to state a less obvious idea: the United
States leading other nations in the international arena. Why should
other nations follow U.S. leaders rather than their own?
</P>
<P>
   Leadership involves some common stake between the leader and the
led, some basis for agreement on goals to be sought and prices to
be paid. The more recent meaning of foreign-policy leadership has
thrust itself to the fore because of America's claim to be ``the
leader of the free world.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim arose during World War II, when the United States was
the de facto leader of the Allies. It made sense to have a dominant
partner in the military alliance for the duration of the war
effort. Even after 1945 there have been military alliances, such as
NATO and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, in which the
United States could properly be called the leader.
</P>
<P>
   But the term ''leader of the free world'' came to have a more
grandiose meaning, extending to nations with no formal alliance
with the United States. In the global struggle between two
ideologies, only the capitalist nations could be described as free.
We aspired not only to lead them all but to entice socialist
countries to join us as well.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a more universal agenda. America was the
champion of freedom anywhere freedom was valued or challenged or
losing _ covering all situations for all peoples. The United States
considered itself not only a legitimate leader but actually more
legitimate than indigenous leaders who did not meet the U.S.
definition of freedom-loving behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Washington ``led'' people by removing inauthentic leaders _ the
enemies of freedom _ even when the people had chosen them. Over
time, American leadership substituted for that of Muhammad Mossadeq
in Iran, Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, Ngo Dinh Diem in South
Vietnam, Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, Manuel Noriega
in Panama and many others.
</P>
<P>
   This is what was considered leading the free world. But however
justified these acts may have been strategically, they cannot be
called leadership. Leaders persuade followers. The United States
used covert action, sabotage and threats. What is the proper
description of what the United States was doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Imperialism'' does not seem the right word, since an empire
usually absorbs subject states and takes their natural resources,
markets or labor. The United States, in contrast, wanted a network
of perches for military action against the Soviet Union. It did not
want to annex the countries but to use them _ call it ``security
imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach began with the Strategic Air Command, whose bases
had to be guaranteed if the U.S. military was to be able to deliver
nuclear weapons. Naturally, any facility servicing U.S. planes or
warships had to be protected by the United States, even if it was
on foreign soil.
</P>
<P>
   And America clearly needed friendly regimes at those sites. From
this it was a short step to removing unfriendly officials or
promoting subservient ones. All this was done in the name of
freedom, and it did not look sufficiently like old-fashioned
imperialism (at least to us) for Americans to question it. Instead,
it was called leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ``leader of the free world'' came to infect American
language and thinking. Even with the end of the Cold War, many have
not jettisoned the idea, although it is heard less often.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's only superpower, America is told that it must act
like ``a great nation,'' which still means defending freedom around
the world. That is a difficult enough task for any nation. It is
even more difficult for America, not only because of its
established Cold War pattern but also because of its longstanding
tradition of holding aloof from international partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The view that the United States acts authentically only when it
acts independently has recurred, from Thomas Jefferson's warning
against ''entangling alliances'' through the Monroe Doctrine,
manifest destiny and rejection of the League of Nations to the
current distrust of the United Nations, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), the International Criminal Court and any agencies set
up to monitor seas, pollution or land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else this suspicious attitude does, it cripples
America's ability to lead other countries. A leader must understand
followers and be able to enlist their energies so that they are
willing to do something for the greater good. Force, subversion and
defiance are not the traits of a leader. No one can lead people
without listening to them, reasoning with them, and showing respect
for them.
</P>
<P>
   The wisest diplomatic advice in America's founding period is
also its most neglected. It was enunciated by James Madison in The
Federalist, No. 63:
</P>
<P>
   ``An attention to the judgment of other nations is important to
every government for two reasons. The one is that, independently of
the merits of any particular plan or measure, it is desirable, on
various accounts, that it should appear to other nations as the
offspring of a wise and honorable policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the concerns of others should be taken into
account regardless of the particular policy at issue. If support
cannot be elicited, at least there should be no needless hostility
aroused or misunderstandings fostered.
</P>
<P>
   But Madison, not content to say just that, continues:
</P>
<P>
   ``The second is that, in doubtful cases, particularly where the
national councils may be warped by some strong passion or momentary
interest, the presumed or known opinion of the impartial world may
be the best guide that can be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, if we listen, we may learn something, discover our own
error or, at the least, learn what objections it would be wise to
consider. Now that is leadership talk.
</P>
<P>
   Madison was talking about the need to have a senate of older
members with longer tenure who could ponder foreign relations with
some knowledge of other countries in order to deal with them
intelligently _ an institution lacking in the unicameral Congress
of the Articles of Confederation.
</P>
<P>
   States under the Articles ignored or defied international
agreements on foreign debts, Indian relations and navigation,
actions that should sound familiar at a time when the United States
is refusing to pay its share of the U.N. budget.
</P>
<P>
   But how many politicians today would say that the United States
should go to international forums to learn rather than to dictate?
World opinion, Americans are constantly told, should be defied when
it does not match the U.S. view of reality. (Of course, one reality
this view most needs to acknowledge is that there is a world
outside the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, for example, the fact that world opinion advised
America to leave Vietnam became an argument for staying there: Are
we to be led by others' views? We must go our own way.
</P>
<P>
   What can explain this unwillingness to accept partnership, a
prior condition of leadership? Travelers often notice the contrast
between foreign papers' coverage of international affairs and
America's exiguous reporting on things beyond its borders. Even the
best newspapers have skimpy reports of any but a few international
events.
</P>
<P>
   This stems partly from the fact that the United States has so
few immediate neighbors. The nations of Europe jostle along in
close proximity to a dozen other countries and languages, while
Americans refuse to school themselves in any foreign tongue, even
in the Spanish of their nearest neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor behind this ignorance of other nations may be
America's lack of an overt empire. European habits of reporting
began when uncles and grandfathers remembered serving in India or
the Congo or Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   American elections are decided mainly on domestic issues, except
in times of war. Even then, public interest in the world is so
minimal that the relevant geography is fuzzy. How long did it take
for Americans to discover where Laos was, or Cambodia? Who can tell
exactly where Kosovo is? How many citizens have atlases that
reflect the extensive changes in national boundaries over the last
decade?
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that foreign affairs become matters of
electoral concern only when they project domestic disputes.
</P>
<P>
   When the people lack interest in foreign affairs, foreign-policy
elites tend to conclude that the subject is beyond the capacity of
all but a few. Not only does the U.S. government dismiss world
opinion, it dismisses the opinion of its own voters. Yet leading
the American people is the necessary prelude to addressing others
in the world. And a necessary condition to leading Americans is
consulting them, recruiting their support and persuading them when
they doubt or hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   If, as President Clinton says, the United States should be at
the nexus of trade exchanges, it must also place itself at the
points of political intersection. National security will depend on
the ties that bind people together.
</P>
<P>
   But America cannot bring other nations into any kind of dialogue
until its internal discourse is active and informed. Until
America's leaders address the American people and other nations
with that kind of respect, attention and persuasion, we shall lack
foreign policy leadership of any sort.

between foreign papers' coverage of international affairs and
America's exiguous reporting on things beyond its borders. Even the
best newspapers have skimpy reports of any but a few international
events.
</P>
<P>
   This stems partly from the fact that the United States has so
few immediate neighbors. The nations of Europe jostle along in
close proximity to a dozen other countries and languages, while
Americans refuse to school themselves in any foreign tongue, even
in the Spanish of their nearest neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor behind this ignorance of other nations may be
America's lack of an overt empire. European habits of reporting
began when uncles and grandfathers remembered serving in India or
the Congo or Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   American elections are decided mainly on domestic issues, except
in times of war. Even then, public interest in the world is so
minimal that the relevant geography is fuzzy. How long did it take
for Americans to discover where Laos was, or Cambodia? Who can tell
exactly where Kosovo is? How many citizens have atlases that
reflect the extensive changes in national boundaries over the last
decade?
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that foreign affairs become matters of
electoral concern only when they project domestic disputes.
</P>
<P>
   When the people lack interest in foreign affairs, foreign-policy
elites tend to conclude that the subject is beyond the capacity of
all but a few. Not only does the U.S. government dismiss world
opinion, it dismisses the opinion of its own voters. Yet leading
the American people is the necessary prelude to addressing others
in the world. And a necessary condition to leading Americans is
consulting them, recruiting their support and persuading them when
they doubt or hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   If, as President Clinton says, the United States should be at
the nexus of trade exchanges, it must also place itself at the
points of political intersection. National security will depend on
the ties that bind people together.
</P>
<P>
   But America cannot bring other nations into any kind of dialogue
until its internal discourse is active and informed. Until
America's leaders address the American people and other nations
with that kind of respect, attention and persuasion, we shall lack
foreign policy leadership of any sort.

`BERKELEY SQUARE': ANOTHER JOURNEY UP AND DOWNSTAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Imagine a world so bizarre that nannies are hired without even
meeting the children, much less getting their approval, a place so
exotic that a lady can cover her infidelity by pretending she is
going to the theater to see Sarah Bernhardt.
</P>
<P>
   This world of pure escapism is delivered in the delightful,
frothy Edwardian soap opera ``Berkeley Square,'' a breezily
successful ``Upstairs, Downstairs'' clone. The first two hours of
the BBC series will be shown this Saturday on Channel 13, with
hourlong episodes running for the next eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With its spunky characters drawn from the realms of lords and
ladies, housemaids and footmen, the series taps into the essential
quality that made ``Upstairs Downstairs'' so appealing; this is a
world of surface order and underlying chaos, which we can envy and
feel superior to at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening episode, set in London in 1902, three young women
are hired to work in Berkeley Square households. Each story is set
up separately, with an efficient though slightly clumsy structure.
Matty Wickham, a levelheaded, experienced nanny, arrives to care
for the St. John children, whose pretty blond mother goes riding in
the park with men not her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the country, Hannah Randall has been dismissed as
a maid to Lady Harmonsworth and banished from the estate because
she bore a child by Lady Harmonsworths' son. (She loves him, of
course; she is a heroine, not a trollop.) Alone in London with her
infant, Hannah is befriended by Mrs. Bronowski, a sympathetic and
eminently commonsensical Polish immigrant who cares for the baby
while Hannah goes to work as a nursemaid for poor, neglected little
Albert Hutchinson. ``Be the very best of boys for Mama,'' Mrs.
Hutchinson will tell the child in a future episode, giving him a
peck on the forehead as she and her husband blithely take off for a
year's posting in India.
</P>
<P>
   And Lydia Weston is a spirited, good-hearted farm girl taken
into the household of the Lamson-Scribeners, whose very name
suggests the overload of breeding and social arcana that will
eventually topple. Hired to help the aging Nanny Collins, who has
been with the family for 50 years, Lydia is so green that she
mistakes the butler for the master of the household, Lord George.
Fortunately, she is employed by one of the series' most winning
characters, the American-born Lady Connie, who brings an air of
egalitarianism to Berkeley Square with her belief that the lower
classes deserve opportunities, too. Lady Connie's philosophy is: If
you don't teach them, how are they to know? Turning up next week is
Hugh Scammon, Lord George's grown son from his first marriage, who
does not disappoint: He is a handsome rogue.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Saturday's second episode, the three nannies have
met in the park and become friends, the series' structure has
become smooth and its intrigues have taken off. Will the St. Johns'
vinegar-faced housekeeper, Mrs. McClusky, succeed in bringing her
disreputable son into the household as a footman? Will the
Hutchinsons discover that Hannah has forged her letter of reference
from Lady Harmonsworth? More troubling still: how do the women
balance those architecturally challenging hats?
</P>
<P>
   In large and small roles, the cast is vibrant, with many faces
(if not names) familiar from years' worth of Masterpiece Theaters.
Rosemary Leach exudes comfort as Nanny Collins, and Judy Parfitt
(who enters next week) is elegantly vicious as Hannah's nemesis,
Lady Harmonsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Reassuring though it is to vanish into this world of surface
calm, a strong undercurrent works subtly to affirm contemporary
assumptions about family. These Edwardian aristocrats are
emotionally icy, a breeding ground of family dysfunction; they are
not to be envied despite their wealth. Only those born outside the
English upper classes escape such coldbloodedness. Hannah is
devoted to her son. And Lady Connie, that bold American, actually
breast feeds her own child.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Connie gets to have the best of both worlds, and ``Berkeley
Square'' puts the American viewer in much the same soothing if
slightly condescending position. We can enjoy this indulgent
fantasy while congratulating ourselves on how far we've come. It's
a nonguilty pleasure.

`GO': PULP FRICTION, WITH DRUGS, ENERGY AND ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Borrowing truckloads of inspiration from ``Pulp Fiction,'' Doug
Liman's ``Go'' has three interrelated sections. It begins and ends
at the same time and place, turns a banal spot into its central
setting (supermarket instead of coffee shop), flirts with drugs and
violence and lets its characters riff amusingly on assorted trivia,
in the manner of ``le Big Mac.'' But derivative as it is, ``Go''
has a powerful personality of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Before the opening Columbia Pictures icon has even finished
brandishing her torch, the film erupts into a hyperkinetic rave
scene and it keeps on flashing that kind of energy throughout. If
Liman breaks no ground here, he does not simply appropriate the
familiar. More often than not, he takes it by storm.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Go'' has no character as ingratiating as the one played
by Jon Favreau in the director's ``Swingers,'' its ensemble cast is
young, quick-witted and loaded with attitude. Just the way Ronna,
the cashier played with improbable grace by Sarah Polley, sullenly
asks, ``Paper or plastic?'' on the supermarket checkout line is
enough to signal a film in which nobody is dull. Sure enough, even
when the screenplay by John August embroils Ronna in a botched drug
deal, she remains a sufficiently sharp-eyed Alice to make her trip
through a grunge Wonderland worth following. And Liman, who shot
the film as well as directed it, gives all the characters' exploits
their distinctive visceral kick.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those exploits are tired. (This is yet another movie in
which a group of guys sprint off to Las Vegas and get into a mess
involving strippers and gunplay, culminating in a chase dramatized
by the town's neon lights.) And some turn nasty, but ``Go'' mostly
sustains a nicely sardonic sense of adventure. It all begins when
Ronna is asked by an English co-worker, Simon (Desmond Askew,
making a memorably funny American debut) to take his place in a
drug buy while he goes out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ronna, who badly needs rent money, decides to deal some
Ecstasy on her own. Her ingenuously pretty friend Claire (Katie
Holmes of ``Dawson'Creek''), decries this as ``an evolutionary
leap,'' adding, ``You're moving up the drug food chain without
permission!'' The next thing she knows, Claire is being parked as
collateral in the lair of a colorfully menacing dealer named Todd
(played with offbeat flair by Timothy Olyphant while Ronna gets
into additional trouble of her own.
</P>
<P>
   In a film whose characters often size up one another with
all-too-justifiable suspicion, Ronna escapes a much too eager trio
of customers (Scott Wolf, Jay Mohr and William Fichtner, the film's
most enjoyable weirdo) before getting revenge of sorts by dealing
baby aspirin at a rave. ``Go'' leaves her there and spirals back to
the supermarket, where it picks up the thread of Simon's story: the
Vegas spree, in which the smoothly appealing Taye Diggs plays a
major role. Then it's another trip to the store to follow a third
subplot, the one that introduced Ronna to her rogue customers in
the first place. Along the way, ``Go'' is a jaundiced comedy of
manners that toys with who may or may not be gay, and has a white
character tell a black one that ``color's just a state of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Artfully executed, druggy flights of fancy include a
hallucinatory macarena in a supermarket, a mind-reading black cat
and a smart visual approximation of how it feels to be on the verge
of throwing up. Here and elsewhere, Liman manipulates speed, light,
editing and point of view vigorously and keeps the radio humming.
He creates a film that lives up to the momentum of its title and
doesn't really need much more.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Go'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It includes profanity, topless dancers and
frequent references to drug use.
</P>

   Poetry doesn't sell many cars, not even bad ad copy doggerel.
This month, though, Volkswagen is using cars to sell poetry.
</P>
<P>
   The American Poetry and Literacy Project is putting a copy of
its 61-page book, ``Songs for the Open Road,'' on the driver's seat
of each new VW sold. Or, said Andrew Carroll, executive director of
the campaign, ``pay $20,000 for the book and get the VW for free.''
</P>
<P>
   A second group, the Catch the Poetry Bug Campaign, is sending
three VW Beetles to 30 schools in April _ National Poetry Month _
each with about 1,500 words on magnetic stickers, like refrigerator
magnets, that can be arranged to make poems. The poetry bug, said
Todd Boss, a spokesman for the campaign, is ``a virus for learning
the language arts.'' The campaign is run by Magnetic Poetry of
Minneapolis, which sells the magnetic stickers; sponsors are VW and
Landscape Structures of Delano, Minn., a company that makes
playground equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The book, copies of which can also be had by calling (800)
374-8389, has standard travel epics like ``The Road Not Taken'' by
Robert Frost and ``Ulysses'' by Alfred Lord Tennyson. A less
familiar poem, ``The Sacred'' by Stephen Dunn, might sell a car, or
at least win over a car lover. In it, a teacher asks ``if anyone
had a sacred place.''
</P>
<P>
   . . . the most serious of them all said it was his car,
</P>
<P>
   being in it alone, his tape deck playing
</P>
<P>
   things he'd chosen, and others knew the truth had been spoken
</P>
<P>
   and began speaking about their rooms,
</P>
<P>
   their hiding places, but the car kept coming up, the car in
motion
</P>
<P>
   music filling it, and sometimes one other person
</P>
<P>
   who understood the bright altar of the dashboard and how far
away
</P>
<P>
   a car could take him from the need
</P>
<P>
   to speak, or to answer, the key in having a key
</P>
<P>
   and putting it in, and going.''

INTERNET BECOMES A PROPAGANDA TOOL IN KOSOVO CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 11)   (EDs: With KOSOVO-INTERNET-SITES)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just as television brought the startling realities
of warfare into living rooms during the Vietnam conflict, the
Internet is providing an intimate view of the struggle over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Through chat rooms, electronic mail and Web sites brimming with
colorful photos and propaganda, people with Internet access can
eavesdrop on or offer an opinion about a struggle in a distant
corner of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The availability of information is like nothing the world has
ever seen,'' James Wesley, a specialist on information and war at
Georgetown University in Washington, said in referring to the
Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight years since the Gulf War with Iraq, when the
Internet was a fledgling public medium, home computer use has
skyrocketed along with access to cyberspace. Today an estimated 150
million people, 60 million in the United States, have access to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A few strokes on the keyboard can link Belgrade to Boston in the
time it takes to make a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the propaganda war that intensified with the
outbreak of NATO air raids on Yugoslavia quickly moved to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Groups such as the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebels fighting
the Serb-dominated government of Yugoslavia, and the Serb
government, which has ruthlessly targeted the ethnic Albanian
population of Kosovo, have home pages on the Internet. Each posts
its views on the war.
</P>
<P>
   At the official Yugoslav Foreign Ministry Web site, the blue,
white and red flag of Yugoslavia ripples above colorful pictures
and icons. A quick click on the highlighted ``NATO Aggression''
icon brings up a list of government press releases on the conflict,
maps and pictures showing the damage done by the NATO bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a barbaric attack of NATO air force planes against the town
of Vranje on Monday, two people were killed, 23 injured,'' reads an
April 7 Yugoslav press release on the bombing of a village about 30
miles from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The site also provides telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of
Yugoslav press officials.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, the official site for the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization allows computer users to choose from an array
of options, including press releases, texts of speeches,
photographs and videos of NATO air attacks against Serb positions.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want immediate updates on the action, NATO also
can send press releases via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In a counterattack against NATO, hackers in Belgrade disabled
the NATO Web site for several hours on March 28, bombarding the
site with e-mail and computer queries that made accessing the site
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the 28th of March, the service from our Internet home
page has been erratic, to say the least,'' NATO spokesman Jamie P.
Shea said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet provides more than information from government
Web sites. Because of the availability of e-mail, large numbers of
people from all sides of the conflict can and do communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That a regular person in Seattle can write on a daily basis
with someone in Belgrade is unlike anything in the history of
warfare,'' Wesley said.
</P>
<P>
   At eGroups, a global e-mail clearinghouse, messages from both
Serbs and Albanians are posted for computer users around the world
to read and answer.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail posted on April 7 from Emilija Nackov, who identified
herself as a doctor living in Belgrade, states: ``NATO bombs are
killing innocent people all over Yugoslavia. When will they stop?
Do they want to kill us all?''
</P>
<P>
   Another e-mail from the Kosovo capital of Pristina, posted on
March 28 by a person under the signature V., states: ``The army
ordered hundreds of Albanian families in my neighborhood to leave
their houses yesterday so the army can use them to hide from
attacks. Any store owned by an Albanian was destroyed. I don't know
where the families are, but they are not here anymore.''

MICHAEL MOORE BACK TO ROUSE RABBLE ON BRAVO 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Break out the Old Milwaukee and pretzels. Michael Moore is back
on TV, pestering everyone he doesn't like.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't like Republicans. He doesn't like the rich and
powerful. And he doesn't like bigots.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in his rabble-rousing heart, though, Moore surely
loves them all. They made him famous for ``Roger &AMP; Me'' and for
``TV Nation.'' They may even have made him rich and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after ``TV Nation'' petered out at NBC and Fox, Moore
has revived his TV fortunes on the Bravo cable network, and in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Awful Truth,'' his new series, premieres Sunday on Bravo.
Though its look is entirely American, the half-hour show is
co-produced by the BBC, which also airs it. Anyone familiar with
Moore, or his work, knows that he can be mean-spirited, demagogic
and juvenile in his ambush attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who likes his stuff also knows that most of his
targets could stand to lose a little stuffing from their shirts.
They know too that Moore's best material is screamingly funny. And
they're probably tickled to see a TV show with a point of view,
along with sharp teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Awful Truth'' begins with easy targets on Sunday, as Moore
takes on Washington, Ken Starr and Bill Clinton's Republican
tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by a troupe of actors in Puritan garb, Moore leads a
Salem-style witch hunt on the streets of Washington and halls of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tinge of rueful satisfaction _ I speak for myself, of
course _ in seeing him clap a microphone in front of Representative
Asa Hutchinson, one of the Republican impeachment managers, and ask
him, ``Have you sinned? Are you a fornicator, congressman?''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's second segment is more macabre. Moore goes to bat for
Christopher Donahue, a 34-year-old diabetic whose health
maintenance organization has refused to pay for a pancreas
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Without the transplant, Donahue will die. So Moore and Donahue
go to the HMO's headquarters in Louisville, Ky., for a run-in with
a PR guy who tries to coax them out of the building. Eventually,
``The Awful Truth'' stages a mock funeral on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   I am duty bound to report that the next week, Moore outfits a
hot pink Winnebago with gays and lesbians for a ``Sodomobile''
excursion to states with anti-sodomy laws.
</P>
<P>
   When the ``Sodomobile'' pulls within range of the Rev. Fred
Phelps, in Kansas, grand fun ensues. Phelps is the hate-monger who
came to San Francisco five years ago to picket the funeral of gay
journalist Randy Shilts, who died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea. If you ever laughed at the old notion of
tossing snowballs at the top hats of rich men, ``The Awful Truth''
is for you. If you thought the snowball tossers should be rounded
up and sent to the slammer, you might want to browse some other
channel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   _ Also Sunday, the Fox animated comedy ``Family Guy'' makes its
premiere, following its ``sneak preview'' after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's episode is as briskly paced and even funnier than the
January pilot, a sign that ``Family Guy'' is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The main story line involves Dad, Peter Griffin (the voice of
series creator Seth MacFarlane), who crashes his car into a
satellite dish and deprives an entire city of television.
</P>
<P>
   But over on the side, there's always baby Stewie. Stewie (also
MacFarlane's voice) is the dangerously precocious toddler, who
appears to have gotten over his desire to kill his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Now the enemy is broccoli, and Fox invites you to see Stewie
fuming at an inert broccoli crown and hissing, ``Stop mocking me!''

   BKN-SPURS-KERR _ SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ He had spent the entire
game on the bench, and now Steve Kerr was summoned by his coach to
produce some magic during the final seconds, maybe pull a
three-point shot out of his warmup jacket sleave. The San Antonio
Spurs needed one late in a recent game against Toronto. Kerr never
did get the chance to shoot. But Kerr believes that had the flow of
the game enabled him to pop open for a split second with the ball
in his hands, he could have nailed the shot, even having come into
the game cold. ``That's going to be my role on this team _ to go in
there every once in a while and hit one shot,'' Kerr said. Those
are encouraging words for San Antonio coach and general manager
Gregg Popovich, who signed the 6-foot-3-inch, 180-pound Kerr in
January with hopes that he could make the critical jump shots that
other Spurs missed last season. Jaren Jackson, signed by the Spurs
for his defense last season, missed important perimeter shots at
the end of playoff losses to Phoenix and Utah. (Rosner, Austin

 FISH COMPANY TO TRY OZONE AS BACTERIA-KILLER

   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Sure, ozone can shield Earth from the sun's
harmful rays.
</P>
<P>
   But can it protect a tuna fillet?
</P>
<P>
   That's what scientists starting a study later this month at a
Wilmington seafood company want to know.
</P>
<P>
   With a $31,300 grant from N.C. Sea Grant, researchers from N.C.
State University and the National Food Processors Association are
going to investigate whether ozone would make a good sterilizing
agent for fish shipped on ice to grocery stores and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The team will set up a portable ozone generator that will pump
ozone into water at Hanover Packing Inc. During the experiment,
fish fillets will be rinsed with the treated water before they are
inserted into air-tight packages.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at N.C. State's Seafood Laboratory in Morehead City
will then test the fish for taste, color and how long it takes to
spoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flattering that they're going to use our facility,'' said
Hanover Packing owner Peter Mairs. ``If they endorse this
procedure, perhaps more processors like myself will really get some
real benefits from the process.''
</P>
<P>
   A layer of naturally occurring ozone in Earth's atmosphere
deflects much of the sun's ultraviolet rays. Ozone is also created
as a byproduct of internal combustion engines and contributes to
the smog that chokes residents of urban centers like Mexico City
and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Synthetically produced ozone has also shown potential for
cutting bacteria on raw fillets and extending the shelf life of
seafood, said Barry Nash, a seafood technology and marketing
specialist with N.C. Sea Grant.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Grant-funded study, which will be completed by March
2000, should document how real those effects are and whether the
ozone treatment detracts from the food's taste, odor or color, Nash
said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have chosen to test tuna, which is representative of
red fish, and bluefish, which should indicate how most oily fish
will react to ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Synthetic ozone's bacteria-killing properties have led some
countries in Europe to use it for cleaning drinking water. And
experiments on raw poultry have shown it can extend the shelf life
of chicken by up to two days, Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   Recognized as a safe sterilizing agent by the U.S. Food &AMP; Drug
Administration in 1997, ozone isn't without its possible drawbacks,
however.
</P>
<P>
   While decreasing the number of some spoiling agents, ozone could
allow other disease-causing bacteria to flourish, Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do what we can in this state to improve the safety
factor for seafood in the long term,'' he said. ``We're looking at
all angles.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mairs, it's all about having a product that will stay
fresher longer. Hanover Packing's business depends on keeping that
fresh-off-the-boat taste for customers in the Carolinas and
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Mairs has tried nitrogen treatments, but found that the added
day of shelf life wasn't worth the resulting ``balloon-like''
packages that allowed the fish to slosh around and eat up space
during shipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this will work better,'' he said. ``Everybody's looking
for extended shelf life.''

LUCAS MAKES DEMANDS  
 COMING SOON FROM OMAHA  
 BORN TO PERFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Md.)  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ They're counting the days here.
</P>
<P>
   No film will arrive in movie theaters this summer with the same
dizzying expectations as George Lucas' ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The
Phantom Menace,'' which is to be released by 20th Century Fox on
May 19. The 130-minute, $115 million epic is the first of three
planned ``prequels'' to ``Star Wars,'' and will center on young
Anakin Skywalker's rise to Jedi Knight and his surrender to the
dark side.
</P>
<P>
   The normally reclusive Lucas has gone on a publicity blitz for
the movie. And who can blame him? It will probably open to a record
weekend box office _ estimates run over $100 million for the first
five days _ but there is still uncertainty that it could eventually
surpass the $1.8 billion in worldwide ticket sales taken in by
``Titanic.'' Lucas could earn more than $400 million. He already
owns all merchandising rights for ``Star Wars,'' which has
delivered about $4.5 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 54-year-old filmmaker and the studio, hoping to
guarantee the widest possible audience, have made some unusual
demands of theater owners. Daily Variety reported that they would
have to pay a penalty, or even have their prints confiscated, if
the strict requirements were not met. Theater exhibitors, eager to
show the film, are not expected to balk, but they are not expected
to like the demands either.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions include these: The film must run in the largest
auditorium in a complex and cannot move to a smaller one without
Fox's permission; minimum runs of the film are eight to 12 weeks;
if an exhibitor commits to playing the film on two or three screens
in a multiplex, the film must stay on those screens for a minimal
run; theaters are not to honor any passes for the first eight
weeks; paid onscreen advertising is prohibited in the first two
weeks; no more than eight minutes of trailers are to run before the
film; theaters can begin showing the film at 12:01 a.m. on May 19,
and advance tickets may not be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Fox declined to comment on the conditions. But an executive
close to the film said the measures were suggestions, not demands.
If there were problems, the executive said, they would be worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some distributors objected to the ban on advance
ticket sales. The studio and Lucas said that this was sought to
prevent scalping, but that if theater owners had contracts with
companies selling advance tickets, arrangements would be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to work with them, not against them,'' the executive
said.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Lucas has controlled production and the film's
release. He financed the movie, as he did ``The Empire Strikes
Back'' and ``The Return of the Jedi.'' And he avoided casting the
most expensive Hollywood superstars. Instead, he hired Liam Neeson
as the Jedi master, Qui-Gon Jinn; Ewan McGregor as the young
Obi-Wan Kenobi; Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala and Jake Lloyd as
young Anakin. Except for showing the film to some friends,
including Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola, the movie is
off-limits to the press and Hollywood executives until just before
its release.
</P>
<P>
   Even top Fox executives haven't seen the film, and probably
won't until just before its release. Asked when studio executives
would see it, one executive laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown Boy
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen has New York. John Waters has Baltimore. And
Alexander Payne has ... Omaha!
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much is shot there at all, and most filmmakers seem to
have grown up in New York or L.A.,'' said Payne, the
director-screenwriter of the new film ``Election,'' which is set in
Omaha, Neb., his hometown, and will open on April 23. His previous
movie, ``Citizen Ruth,'' an acclaimed offbeat comedy that dealt
with abortion, was also set in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omaha is a place I understand,'' said Payne, who now lives in
Los Angeles. ``I walk around and feel these early connections, and
you don't see the Midwest represented accurately in films. Often
the people who make films there don't understand it and you can see
the difference; either it's kind of the noble savage, all those
hard-working, salt-of-the-earth people, or it's, `Look at all this
dysfunction.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' is a comedy-drama about the most popular teacher in
an Omaha high school, played by Matthew Broderick, who puts his
career and reputation on the line for a student election. He is
pitted against an alarmingly ambitious go-getter student, played by
Reese Witherspoon, who views the election as the first step in a
career that winds up _ where else? _ in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Payne, who wrote the script with his writing partner, Jim
Taylor, spent years struggling to make films after graduating from
Stanford University and earning a master's degree in filmmaking at
UCLA. His thesis film, ``The Passion of Martin,'' about an
obsessive love, was screened at more than 20 festivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' is based on a novel of the same name but set in New
Jersey, by Tom Perrotta.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was sent the novel, I didn't read it for a while; I'm
not so interested in high school,'' Payne said. ``But when I read
it, I thought it was funny and sad, kind of like life. There was
this sense of melancholy to it. I knew it would be an easy
transplant to Omaha.''
</P>
<P>
   As Payne began filming, he said, he increasingly identified with
the character played by Broderick, a man muddling through life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's about my age,'' said Payne, who is 38. ``I have friends
who teach in high school. I have friends in other jobs. And there's
a certain sense now of what you've accomplished at this point in
your life and what you haven't accomplished and the frustrations
you feel. This film could have been made 20 years ago, or it could
be made 20 years from now. The themes are kind of timeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he was nervous about the opening of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but think there are people like me who are hungry
for intelligent films,'' he said. ``I'm not saying I make great
films, but I do know I want to do things that are different from
anything I've ever seen before. And I don't think you've seen
`Election' before.''

 UNDATED: `Election' before.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feeling Blessed
</P>
<P>
   No actor has had quite the life _ and career _ of Charles
Dutton.
</P>
<P>
   A sought-after character actor with a booming voice and
often-gentle presence, the 48-year-old Dutton has worked nonstop in
recent years. He is in two films that are to be released later in
the year. One is ``Detox,'' with Sylvester Stallone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a murder-mystery thriller,'' Dutton said. ``I play Sly's
partner; we're FBI agents.''
</P>
<P>
   The second film is ``Random Hearts,'' in which he plays Harrison
Ford's police partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm everyone's partner,'' Dutton said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Dutton is appearing as Willis in ``Cookie's
Fortune,'' the whimsical comedy-drama directed by Robert Altman.
Altman and the screenwriter Anne Rapp wrote the script with Dutton
in mind for the role of Willis, who is accused of a murder that no
one in town believes he committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was attractive to me was that although this was set in
the South, in the state of Mississippi and all that entails, it was
about a black man totally devoid of anger and rage and
bitterness,'' Dutton said. ``It's one of the first times in film
I've gotten to play a complete human being, with a range of
emotions and nuances, and not just somebody's partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutton has also had a notable Broadway career in the August
Wilson dramas ``Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'' and ``The Piano
Lesson,'' and he has starred in a television series, ``Roc.''
</P>
<P>
   As a black actor, Dutton said, he is no longer bothered by the
notion that his race worked against him in finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I felt that five years ago, even two years ago,'' he
said. ``But I don't dwell on it anymore. There's a scarcity of work
in this business for everyone, white actors as well as black. The
few of us who actually work and make a good living at it should
consider ourselves extremely lucky and blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutton never considered himself lucky. He grew up in a Baltimore
housing project, and his childhood was bleak. At 17, he stabbed and
killed someone he said had attacked him and went to prison. He
spent seven and a half years in the Maryland Correctional
Institution for homicide and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In prison, Dutton began reading plays and helped form a drama
group. He also entered a high school equivalency and junior college
program.
</P>
<P>
   After an early release, he studied theater at Towson State
University in Maryland. One of his teachers there suggested he
apply for a scholarship after graduation in 1978 to the Yale School
of Drama. He was accepted, and soon began his successful career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I discovered theater in prison,'' Sutton said, ``I said
to myself, `OK, this is it _ I will pursue this with whatever
talent I've been blessed with.' When I began acting and directing a
ragtag bunch of inmates who'd never done a play, I knew, I just
knew, this was what I was born to do on this planet.''

ETHNIC SLAUGHTER IN BOSNIAN WAR  
 A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER NEVER CRIES  
 DETROIT 9000   
 APT PUPIL  
 ONE TOUGH COP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ETHNIC SLAUGHTER IN BOSNIAN WAR: The father addresses his
daughter, a young woman named Vera, who is holding her newborn.
``You should have killed yourself,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried, but they stopped me,'' she replies.
</P>
<P>
   He hands her a gun. ``No one is stopping you now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't, Papa,'' she answers. ``I have a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I am going to kill you both,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then catching up with movies on video provides an
unusually reflective experience. That is certainly the case with
``Savior,'' about the 1995 conflict in Bosnia. Stark and riveting,
Peter Antonijevic's film, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York
Times, ``conveys the nihilistic essence of war with the force of a
kick in the gut.''
</P>
<P>
   To dramatize the senselessness of ethnic hatred, Antonijevic,
who is Serbian, keeps the identity of Serbians, Croatians and
Muslims deliberately vague. In the film they are virtually
interchangeable, with each group slaughtering the others so
routinely it hardly seems to matter who is who.
</P>
<P>
   Vera (Natasa Ninkovic) and her father (Miki Krftovic) are
Serbian. Captured by Muslims, she was raped and impregnated. To the
Serbians that deserves the death penalty. A Serbian soldier calls
her a Muslim whore, stomps her and stands ready to shoot the baby
as it is born. An American mercenary (Dennis Quaid) fighting for
the Serbians has had enough and shoots the soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Later the people in Vera's village, her father among them, are
led off, presumably to their execution, by Muslim soldiers. Near
the end of the film prisoners are clubbed to death by a giant who
walks among them wielding a huge mallet as routinely as if he were
in a sheep pen. Traumatized, they submit to their fate. They are
Muslims and he is Croatian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Savior,'' to be released on Tuesday by Columbia Tri-Star,
often is not easy to watch. Used sparingly and circumspectly, the
violence imparts horror. ``The audience crosses from feature to
documentary,'' Antonijevic said in an interview. Just the sight of
soldiers in fatigues is enough. ``You know what direction it's
going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's major concession to movie convention is the situation
around Guy, the American mercenary superbly portrayed by Quaid.
Antonijevic wanted to speak through an American so he planted one
in the middle of the hostilities, not as an observer but as a
combatant.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after one of many real-life mercenaries fighting then
and now in the former Yugoslavia, Guy arrives by way of the French
Foreign Legion. At the outset of the film his wife and son are
killed by a bomb blast in a French cafe. Suspecting Muslims, Guy
walks into a mosque and shoots a few. Ever since he has been on the
run as a soldier of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   If that seems a little formulaic, given the fine, dark
originality of the rest of the film, it at least gets him into
position physically and spiritually. A bitter, empty blank of a
man, Guy steadies his weapon and picks off a Muslim child as if he
were a can on a fence.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he rediscovers his humanity. That also may be
standard film procedure, but it is important to Antonijevic. Now
40, he was reared in Yugoslavia when it was whole. ``We were taught
that differences between people didn't matter,'' he said. ``Back
then it seemed to be quite a successful experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER NEVER CRIES: Based on an autobiographical
novel by Kaylie Jones, daughter of the novelist James Jones, James
Ivory's film chronicles the life of the daughter of a famous writer
as she comes of age in Paris and the United States. A war veteran,
Bill Willis (Kris Kristofferson) reminds young Channe Willis
(Leelee Sobieski) about soldiers' daughters but allows that
writers' daughters cry all the time. Written by Ivory and Ruth
Prawer Jhabvala, the story sprawls at a loosely anecdotal pace,
but, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, conveys ``with
abundant sensitivity the experience of growing up in the shadow of
literary celebrity.''

   DETROIT 9000: Resurrected by Quentin Tarantino 25 years after it
was made, Arthur Marks' film says much about current racial
attitudes. Two detectives, one white and one black, investigate a
theft, but the true heart of the matter lies in the dynamic between
Lt. Danny Bassett (Alex Rocco), white, blunt and trained on the
street, and Sgt. Jesse Williams (Hari Rhodes), black, educated and
a good guy. ``That he and Bassett never resolve their relationship,
like the latter-day team of Danny Glover and Mel Gibson in the
`Lethal Weapon' series, is telling'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).

   APT PUPIL: A cool (chilly, not hip) teen-age schoolboy named
Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) discovers that his hometown has its very
own Nazi war criminal living incognito in its midst. After some
surveillance that would put the CIA to shame, Todd confronts Kurt
Dussander (Ian McKellen) with his true identity and then reveals
his own: a strange and sadistic brat with a taste for the macabre.
Fascinated with all things Nazi, Bowden forces the old man to
relate his past. But then the tables turn in a film adapted by
Bryan Singer from Stephen King's novella with ``dazzling
craftsmanship and clinical precision'' (Maslin).

   ONE TOUGH COP: Although strongly acted and pungently written,
Bruno Barreto's film demonstrates how much television police drama
surpasses the big-screen variety. When a nun is raped and tortured,
the detective Bo Dietl (Stephen Baldwin) investigates against
orders, getting himself tangled with federal agents and in trouble
because of his old low-life associations. Caught up with choices
facing people in extreme circumstances, the narrative is freighted
with ``more story than it can comfortably handle, and as it goes
along it grows progressively less believable'' (Stephen Holden).

   THE FARM: LIFE INSIDE ANGOLA PRISON: ``You can learn to help
other people,'' says Bones, an old inmate who lies dying of lung
cancer in the hospital at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at
Angola. A former slave plantation and arguably the toughest prison

WALT DISNEY COMBINES ITS ADULT BOOK DIVISION WITH ABC NETWORK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moving to exploit the synergy of books, entertainment and news,
the Walt Disney Co. restructured its publishing group Thursday by
combining its adult book division, Hyperion, with the ABC network.
</P>
<P>
   With that step, the children's side of the publishing group,
Buena Vista Publishing, will change names to become Disney
Publishing Worldwide with the aim of increasing the coordination of
Disney's publishing efforts in more than 100 countries, according
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Miller, who was promoted to managing director of
Hyperion, said the company had decided to make Hyperion a unit of
ABC to take advantage of the network's research and talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity for us to tap into a wealth of new
writers and research and material and to work with a great group of
people,'' said Miller, who added that Peter Jennings' best-selling
book, ``The Century,'' was a superb example of what they might be
able to do. The book, which was published by Doubleday, grew out of
the research for a documentary series on the events of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping we'll develop a lot of material out of the wealth
of research that's done for the division that never works on the
air,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Hyperion had published other successful entertainment
books such as titles by the television comedians Tim Allen and Drew
Carey.
</P>
<P>
   On the international side, Steven Murphy, the newly promoted
managing director of Disney Publishing Worldwide, said the
company's aim was to increase its global reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're consolidating under one management by which we can
publish across regions globally designed products, books and
magazines,'' Murphy said.

   ``Stop Urban Cleansing!'' __ Hand-lettered sign in the window of

are going up.

</P>
<P>
   My teenage nephew got on the wrong bus the other day and ended
up in an unfamiliar and scary neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a bomb hit it,'' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I said, we've got a lot of those kinds of places in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   If you've spent any time at all here _ and this is true of a lot
of big cities today _ you've seen the pockets of rubble and decay
and desolation. These areas are so bleak as to seem without hope.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you come from just such a place; maybe you live there now.
Maybe your old stomping grounds, the place where you grew up, has
turned into one of those ``bombed-out'' no man's lands.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've only seen the gravel lots and the boarded-up houses
and the crumbling projects from the relative safety of your car as
you tried to figure out how to get back on a main road or the
expressway.
</P>
<P>
   Every big city, no matter how magnificent its downtown and its
parks and its skyline, has these pockmarks. They dot the landscape
like BB holes in a stained-glass window.
</P>
<P>
   I think about such neighborhoods every time we get involved in
some conflict overseas and we try to make the world a better place,
because after all that's our job as the wealthiest and most
powerful country in modern times. I think about how readily we vow
to clean house elsewhere, when there's still a heck of a mess in
our own basement.
</P>
<P>
   Each time America jumps into a conflict, most of us have to dive
for the Atlas and dig into the handy maps provided by the
newspapers. Where's Somalia? Remind me where Kuwait is again. Can
somebody pinpoint Bosnia, Lebanon, the Panama Canal, Grenada, Iraq,
Iran?
</P>
<P>
   That's what's happening right now, on a daily basis. We read the
reports of the latest bombing or the most recent counterattack in
Yugoslavia, and we turn to the accompanying maps so we can get our
bearings. All right, I know where Skopje is, but where's Tetovo?
</P>
<P>
   And there's always a new Hitler to be defeated, or so we're
told. Amin, Ghadafi, Hussein, Milosevic. Our leaders draw the
Hitler comparison, not to insult those who remember the Holocaust,
but to provide easy shorthand for those who don't. Equating some
modern potentate-thug with the most hated man of the century is an
easy way to get the semi-interested populace emotionally involved
in the cause. If this guy is as evil as they're saying he is, we
have to step in!
</P>
<P>
   As the pictures are beamed into our living rooms, we shake our
heads at the barbarians on the other side of the world. Why are
those people still fighting one another? How can they treat their
own people like that? What kind of civilization needs to be saved
from itself?
</P>
<P>
   We conveniently forget that someone might have the same thoughts
while watching CNN's coverage of the riots in Los Angeles, or a
documentary about crack babies in Chicago, or a news report about
the murder rate in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Our world is not a simple place, and the United States of
America's place in this era is more complicated than at any time in
history. We can't just announce we're no longer the bodyguard of
underdog nations and peoples; we can't just take the $2 billion
that would be spent on the construction of a top-of-the-line
stealth fighter and redistribute it to the worst neighborhoods in
Detroit. It doesn't happen that way, and it never will.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a kind of controlled insanity in the way things
work. Americans have been told by NATO and by our president that
Kosovo is now the most important region in the world _ even though
you can find horrific examples of ethnic cleansing, oppression,
starvation and injustice in three or four dozen other areas around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Try that logic out on a 10-year-old girl who has to ride her
bike in the fence-enclosed walkways of her inner-city high-rise
because the sidewalks outside and below are too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows how long we'll stay there, and how much net value our
involvement will yield. Our track record in these affairs since
Vietnam is spotty at best. Last time I looked, Saddam Hussein was
still strutting tall and talking tough, eight years after Operation
Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   This much I'll guarantee: We'll get out of Kosovo one day, and
then we'll turn our full attention to some other godforsaken
outpost _ but it won't be the Bronx or South Central or the West
Side of Chicago.

ELLIOTT SADLER STARTING TO TUNE UP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger (Lakeland, Fla.)   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 23, Elliott Sadler has been plucked out of the Busch ranks to
drive one of the most-storied cars in Winston Cup, the No. 21 Ford
prepared by Wood Brothers Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am excited, but more nervous than anything about the
upcoming season,'' Sadler said back then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wood Brothers are taking a big chance on me and I hope I
can turn things around for them,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Once the racing began, though, Sadler seemed to forget the last
part of that, the part about turning things around.
</P>
<P>
   Because the simple truth is the Wood Brothers' Ford running now
is not the car Cale Yarborough and David Pearson drove when they
were dominating the superspeedways.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the late '60s and through the '70s, the Wood Brothers
didn't run the entire circuit, preferring to concentrate on the big
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   But when they showed up, especially with Pearson, they were
usually awesome. In 1973, Pearson entered 18 races and won 11. In
1976, he ran 22 and won 10.
</P>
<P>
   But much of this happened before Sadler was even born. In recent
years, the Wood Brothers' Ford has been just another car.
</P>
<P>
   It has only won twice in the '90s, the last time in March 1993
at Atlanta with Morgan Shepherd driving.
</P>
<P>
   In Sadler's mind, though, he was striving to reach a standard
set by Pearson, a level of excellence which has escaped the Wood
Brothers since Pearson got out of the car in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler had to use a provisional to get in his first race, the
Daytona 500. In the first five races this year, he could finish no
better than 31st, at the March 15 Cracker Barrel 500 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very down,'' Sadler said. ``I felt as bad as you could
feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we had a good enough team to run in the top 20,''
Sadler said. ``And I felt like I was not doing my part on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sadler felt pressure, it was not because of his sponsor,
Citgo, which has been backing Wood Brothers for 15 years despite
their lack of success.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly wasn't from the second generation of Woods now
running the team _ Eddie and Len _ who understand how difficult it
is to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   They are the sons of Glen Wood, who started Wood Brothers Racing
in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler was putting the pressure on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest fear in life is being a failure as a race car
driver,'' Sadler said. ``The first couple races, we didn't do too
great. I got in situations I probably shouldn't have been in and
got in wrecks. I'd look in a mirror and wonder if I was gonna make
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Woods have been great about it and Mike Beam has been
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Beam left Bill Elliott to become Wood Brothers' crew chief this
year. After seeing how much Elliott, once the dominant driver on
the circuit, has struggled recently, he understood what Sadler was
up against.
</P>
<P>
   ``His expectations are so high,'' Bean said. ``I kept telling
him, `Don't focus on the negative. Focus on the positive. Just do
your part and don't worry about anything else.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't easy for Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worried about my job being in jeopardy,'' he said. ``I was
pretty hard on myself. When I don't do something, I get down. I
worried I wasn't doing the job they brought me in to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd try to just go race, but it was hard to put out of my
mind,'' Sadler said. ``I'd see all those pictures of that car in
victory lane, and that puts a lot of pressure on you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was my job to get them back in that situation, even
though I know it's probably not going to happen this year,'' Sadler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the Food City 500 in Bristol, Tenn., this week,
though, Sadler is breathing a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   In the last race _ the Primestar 500 at the Texas Motor Speeday
_ Sadler finished 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like a win for us,'' Sadler said. ``It took a load off
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, it took a load off the driver, who knows he's got a long
way to go, but finally may be feeling like he has a chance to get
there.

FOUR DRIVERS TO WATCH IN THE COMING YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The (Lakeland, Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is racing's new role model, on and off the track, and he is
making millions both places.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, 27, has replaced Dale Earnhardt, 47, as racing's
poster boy. Earnhardt is a throwback to what racing was. Gordon is
the image of racing's future.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new generation of drivers, all roughly Gordon's age or
younger, is coming along to challenge him. One, in fact, is
Earnhardt's son, Dale Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   So which ones are most likely to succeed? The top four might
look something like this:
</P>
<P>
   NO. 1: TONY STEWART, 27
</P>
<P>
   Experienced driver who has done it the right way, moving from
open wheel to Busch ranks last year. He has the talent to compete
with Gordon and, driving for Joe Gibbs as Bobby Labonte's teammate,
will have good equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest asset: Perhaps more than any of the challengers, Stewart
understands how difficult it is to get to the top and stay there.
He is extremely focused and that, combined with his talent, will
make him successful.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 2: MATT KENSETH, 27
</P>
<P>
   Battled Earnhardt Jr. for the Busch championship last year and
finished second, but many think he is more advanced and maybe more
talented. Signed by Jack Roush, who owns Fords driven by Mark
Martin and Jeff Burton, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest asset: Has made slow, steady climb through stock car
ranks and has not moved up until circumstances were right.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 3: KENNY IRWIN, 29
</P>
<P>
   In second season driving for Robert Yates. Dale Jarrett's
teammate, Irwin has a ton of talent, but was inconsistent his
rookie year. That might have been because everything has come
pretty easily for him on the way up. Another open wheel star who
chose Winston Cup, he will move up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest asset: Natural ability. There is no doubt Irwin can
drive a race car, a fact Robert Yates noted when he made Irwin, a
relative unknown with virtually no stock car driving experience,
his choice to replace Ernie Irvin in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 4: DALE EARNHARDT JR., 24
</P>
<P>
   Exploded on the Busch circuit in 1998, winning seven races and
the championship in his first full season. So highly sought after
by Winston Cup teams that his dad drew up a legal contract with him
after operating on pretty much of a handshake deal. Already has
big-league sponsor, Budweiser, for Winston Cup debut in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest asset: Has one of the sport's greatest drivers, his dad,
for a teacher and what's more important, he listens to him. Will
have grade A equipment.

`AMONG GIANTS' IS POIGNANT ROMANCE FROM WRITER OF `FULL MONTY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Among Giants'' is an affecting and unlikely romance that owes
a huge debt to its lead actors.
</P>
<P>
   Though the gravelly voiced _ and faced _ Pete Postlethwaite
(``In The Name Of the Father'') is hardly be anybody's idea of a
romantic leading man, it's his very cragginess that gives his
performance weight as well as pathos.
</P>
<P>
   Add the unorthodox gutsiness and sexiness of Australian actress
Rachel Griffiths, who was recently nominated for an Oscar for
``Hilary and Jackie,'' and ``Among Giants'' radiates tremendous
appeal, if on a small, intimate scale.
</P>
<P>
   The film was written by Simon Beaufoy, the previously gave us
``The Full Monty.''
</P>
<P>
   Here he follows another motley group of Englishmen _ five
reprobate characters who are hired by Ray (Postlethwaite) to paint
high-wire electrical towers on an isolated 15-mile stretch of
English moors. Ray's best mate is handsome and brash young Steve
(James Thornton), a daredevil who enjoys rock climbing on the
Sheffield cliffs in his time off.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic between this bunch of misfits radically changes when
Gerry (Griffiths), a hiker trekking through England on a
``spiritual quest,'' asks Ray for a job. A triangle forms between
Ray, Gerry and Steve and, when Ray and Gerry embark on a love
affair, their actions lead to surprising consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is prepared for commitment _ Ray has just been divorced
and Gerry is a free spirit who shuns being tied down and indeed,
often unwittingly wreaks havoc on the lives of those around her.
But soon Ray, confused by the intensity of his attraction, asks
Gerry to marry him _ an act that forces each to evaluate and
confront demons and desires.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Postlethwaite and Griffiths, who even daringly display
themselves naked in one scene, the real star of ``Among Giants'' is
the tone and sense of restlessness evoked by Beaufoy, director Sam
Miller and cinematographer Witold Stok.
</P>
<P>
   It's the closest thing to capturing the mystique of a dying way
of life _ the ``western'' loner anti-hero _ that the movies have
given us for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Directors and actors have been so intent upon turning that
mystique into a caricature of itself that most films fail to convey
the true loneliness and pain in the lifestyle. ``Among Giants''
allows us to feel the rootlessness and the high price of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   And until the final scenes in the film, which are jarringly out
of place in such a yearning work, it lives up to Ray's explanation
as to why he's taken on such a reckless existence. ``I'm king up
here, lass,'' he says to Gerry, and for awhile, we actually believe
him.
</P>
<P>
   Among Giants. Directed by Sam Miller. Written by Simon Beaufoy.
Cast: Pete Postlethwaite, Rachel Griffiths, James Thornton. Fox
Searchlight Pictures. 94 minutes. Rated R for nudity, sexual
content, language.

BICYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS SHOULD AVOID MALE DRIVERS

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Safety experts have known that although male and
female drivers have roughly equal numbers of car crashes per mile
driven, men are 70 percent more likely to be driving in a crash
when someone is killed. But that statistic lumps the fatalities
together, whether the victim is the driver, a passenger, a person
in another vehicle or someone on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Now a study in New York City has produced new data on the sex of
the drivers involved when a pedestrian or a cyclist is killed. The
data suggest that pedestrians might do well to get off the street
when a male driver is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Male drivers are involved in crashes that kill pedestrians three
times more often than female drivers, per mile driven, according to
the study. In crashes that kill bicyclists, men are involved
roughly 10 times more often as women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising,'' said Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for
the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. ``Males are
over-represented in fatal crashes _ period.''
</P>
<P>
   The definitive national count is published by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the Transportation
Department, which integrates data on crashes with information on
how many people of each sex are licensed to drive, and how far, on
average, they do drive. Its most recent report, released in
January, covers 1996; it showed that per 100 million miles driven,
male drivers were involved in 562 crashes and female drivers in
611.
</P>
<P>
   But for crashes in which someone died, men were involved in 3.11
per 100 million miles, and women in a little more than half that
many, 1.81.
</P>
<P>
   That research carves out only one subset of the universe of
fatal crashes: accidents in which the driver died. It found that
1.4 men died per 100 million miles driven, compared with 0.8 women.
</P>
<P>
   But the gender disparity in crashes that kill pedestrians is
more striking. Charles Komanoff, a transportation consultant and
advocate for bicyclists and pedestrians, recently published a study
of all the crashes in 1994-97 in New York City that killed a
pedestrian or a bicyclist. (New York is one of the few places in
the country where most of the people who die in traffic crashes are
outside vehicles, but such deaths are a significant problem
nationwide, running about 15 percent of total motor vehicle
deaths.)
</P>
<P>
   Komanoff found 1,020 deaths of pedestrians and cyclists on city
streets, but the driver's identity could be established in only 820
of those. In that group, 747, or 91 percent, were men; 73, or 9
percent, were women.
</P>
<P>
   The study is available on the Internet at
http://www.rightofway.org. The Transportation Department study is
available at http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/ncsa/ &QL; 
agesex.html.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soccer moms notwithstanding, men do more than half of all
driving. Nationally, they account for about 63 percent of miles
driven, according to Federal statistics. Komanoff's group, called
Right of Way, calculated that because nearly all taxi and bus
drivers in New York City are male, and because those two categories
account for a high proportion of the total miles driven, men do
about 75 percent of all the driving in New York City. (He limited
his analysis to city streets, excluding highways.)
</P>
<P>
   But even when that extra driving is factored in, men are heavily
over-represented in accidents that kill pedestrians, and especially
bicyclists.
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``The easy answer would be aggressiveness, risk-taking,''
said Tad Lee, a spokesman for the National Association of
Governors' Highway Safety Representatives. Aggressive driving is a
harder problem to solve than behavioral problems like drunken
driving or failing to buckle up, he said. For those problems, he
said, ``first you raise awareness, then people become aware of the
dangers of what they're doing, and then, because of pressure by
society, they become ashamed for going against society and doing
things wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we haven't gotten to that point yet with aggressive
driving and risk taking,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Lee acknowledged that he had no evidence. ``That's the easiest
explanation,'' he said. ``I don't know if it's actually true.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Arizona takes aggressive driving very
seriously, and last year enacted the nation's first law that
defines aggressive driving and sets penalties. The offense is
defined as speeding plus two of the following: passing on the
right, failing to observe a traffic light or stop sign, tailgating
and failing to signal. But Alberto Gutier, director of the
Governor's Office of Highway Safety in Phoenix and an author of the
law, said, ``I have not heard the comment from any officer that
`we've got fatalities or major injuries because an aggressive
driver hit a pedestrian.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Komanoff's study got a quick response from
the Dutch Pedestrian Association, which analyzed the 114 pedestrian
deaths in the Netherlands in 1995. Willem Vermuelen, a psychologist
with the group in The Hague, said that 88 percent were killed by
male drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Vermuelen said that men behave more dangerously than women, ``or
are more clumsy.'' That is demonstrated both by drivers and
pedestrian victims; ``more than 1.5 times as many men are killed as
pedestrian or cyclist,'' he said, although women actually cycle and
walk more. Men take risks and break rules more often, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said female drivers ``better identify with the role of the
unprotected participants'' _ that is, pedestrians. ``The men tend
to behave in a more hierarchical way, in which the car-driver is
superior to cyclist or pedestrian.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rochman, of the Insurance Institute, said that the locus of
pedestrian deaths is at intersections, where drivers fail to give
the right of way. That, she said, is an established characteristic
of male drivers. ``People are trying to catch a stale yellow light
or go through a red light, and red-light runners tend to be male,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance rates reflect this trend for young male drivers, who
pay far more because insurers find they are involved in more
claims. Gender generally plays a smaller role in rates as drivers
get older.
</P>
<P>
   Komanoff said that men and women had roughly equal numbers of
crashes ``because the vast majority of accidents are
fender-benders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's just not that much skill difference between men
and women drivers, but men are more inclined to take risks and act
aggressively behind the wheel,'' he said. ``It's the risk-taking
and aggressiveness that translate into fatalities.''
</P>
<P>
   If everyone driving a vehicle in New York City drove like a
woman, Komanoff calculated, the annual death toll among pedestrians
would drop to about 100, from 250 now. The number of bicyclists
killed would fall to 2 or 3, from 18 a year now.
</P>
<P>
   Komanoff has his own theory about bicyclists. ``Bicyclist
fatalities are not just a product of cyclists' recklessness or
carelessness, but a male driver resentment _ if not rage,'' he
said. ``Men want the bicyclists to get out of their way.'' &QL;

`GO' A JOYRIDE THAT RARELY DOWNSHIFTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Swingers pushed first-time director Doug Liman into the
limelight. ``Go'' will keep him there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swingers'' was an acquired taste, and people either loved or
hated it (I was in the second group), but ``Go'' displays Liman's
storytelling as well as moviemaking abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he borrows from the ``Pulp Fiction'' school of structure,
dividing his tale of six young people from Los Angeles who share
one night of crime and chaos, into three intertwining chapters. But
he also constructs _ from a script by John August _ a scary, darkly
funny and suspenseful film that surprises and engages at every turn
and became an audience favorite at this year's Sundance Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go'' features a terrific up-and-coming cast. Canadian Sarah
Polley, who was so good in ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' Scott Wolf from
TV's ``Party Of Five,'' Jay Mohr, Katie Holmes from ``Dawson's
Creek,'' William Fichtner, Desmond Askew, Taye Diggs and Timothy
Olyphant are among the ensemble who wreak havoc through L.A. and
Liman's favorite haunt, Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Ronna (Polley) is a supermarket clerk who is on the verge of
being evicted from her apartment. Her co-worker, Simon (Askew),
offers her some money up front if she'll take his shift so he can
go to Vegas with his buddies. Claire (Holmes) is the bystander who
becomes embroiled in Ronna's scheme to score some extra bucks.
</P>
<P>
   When two TV stars, Zack (Mohr) and Adam (Wolf), show up at the
store looking for Simon, who has been their drug dealer in the
past, Ronna decides she can turn the deal instead, especially since
Simon is out of town. She cajoles Simon's supplier, Todd Gaines
(Olyphant), into giving her the stash. But everything goes awry
when Ronna smells a rat and Todd finds he's been stung.
</P>
<P>
   Over in Vegas, Simon discovers that idle hands are truly the
devil's playthings. After he runs out of money at the casino, he
takes up with a couple of young women while best pal Marcus (Diggs)
is still at the tables. Simon's over-enthusiasm lands all the
friends in trouble and soon they've stolen a car, shot a strip club
bouncer, and are being pursued at high speed through the Vegas
streets.
</P>
<P>
   These disparate pieces manage to fall into place and create a
throroughly enjoyable, fast-paced movie that reminds us what it's
like to live on the edge and to react with the impulsive energy of
youth.
</P>
<P>
   While the best thing about ``Swingers'' was Liman's use of the
camera, he's equally up to the task here. He gives us a Los Angeles
that is as eerie and unworldly as it is familiar and his ability to
use cinematography as a storytelling tool has refined and
developed.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, most of the credit must go the vibrancy of
August's script and a cast whose lively performances even manage to
make unlikeable characters accessible. ``Go'' is a joyride that
rarely downshifts; it's unpredictability is its strongest asset.
</P>
<P>

Diggs, Katie Holmes, Breckin Meyer, Sarah Polley, Scott Wolf.

`COOKIE'S FORTUNE' A MOST LIKABLE ALTMAN FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Altman once said that his basic philosophy of filmmaking
was to gather the best possible ensemble of actors, take them to
some interesting location, allow them to play with their roles and
improvise some of their dialogue, and then hope something magical
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it does _ witness such classics as ``MASH,'' ``McCabe
and Mrs. Miller'' and ``The Player.'' Sometimes, perhaps more
often, it doesn't _ witness such travesties as ``Popeye,''
``Buffalo Bill and the Indians'' and ``Quintet.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, ``Cookie's Fortune'' _ Altman's 33rd feature film in 42
years of trying _ is one of his most magical brews. Indeed, it
would be hard to think of a more completely likable Altman film or
one in which the chemistry of his cast seemed more perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the (real) small-town of Holly Springs, Miss., it's a
rambling, amiable story about what happens when a pipe-smoking
Southern dowager named Cookie (Patricia O'Neal) commits suicide in
order to join her beloved late husband.
</P>
<P>
   Stumbling upon the body, Cookie's scheming, slightly crazed
niece, Camille (Glenn Close), eats the suicide note and concocts a
string of ``evidence'' to make the death look like murder _ because
``suicides don't happen'' in their family.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately (and unintentionally), this concocted evidence
gradually points to Cookie's handyman, Willis (Charles S. Dutton),
an easy-going, middle-aged black man who has been sharing the house
with her in a kind of ``Driving Miss Daisy'' relationship.
</P>
<P>
   This is the set-up of the movie, and at this point we might
naturally expect the proceedings to turn into one more
heavy-handed, self-righteous indictment of racism in the small-town
South _ especially since Willis is so downright lovable and such an
obvious potential martyr.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Cookie's Fortune'' goes against all expectations to be a
lazy, irresistibly good-natured little comedy in which race is
ultimately not much of an issue, and just about everyone in this
small town _ excluding Close's character _ is a fairly decent human
being. It's Mayberry, not Mississippi Burning.
</P>
<P>
   As usual in an Altman movie, a wide assortment of characters
wander in and out of the storyline: Ned Beatty as a sheriff who'd
rather be fishing; Donald Moffat as the town's affable only lawyer;
Courtney B. Vance as a frustrated state prosecutor; Julianne Moore
as Camille's addled sister and co-conspirator.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as in only the best Altman, every character seems to click
into place. As Cookie's free-spirited grand-niece, Liv Tyler has
never been more movie-star radiant. As Cookie, veteran movie-great
O'Neal gives a blissfully broad and fearless performance. Even
Chris O'Donnell _ the town's Barney Fife of a deputy _ is a welcome
part of this inspired ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   The film comes together to be less the wild farce and scathing
satire that its publicity promises than a mellow comedy of
character that communicates a gentle acceptance of human nature in
general and family eccentricity in particular _ a film that likes
its characters so much that it's impossible not to feel the same
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, ``Cookie's Fortune'' has the same kind of uncanny
authenticity that Altman was able to give 1902 Puget Sound in
``McCabe and Mrs. Miller,'' '90s Hollywood in ``The Player'' and
'70s Nashville in ``Nashville.'' Few directors convey a sense of
time and place so convincingly, and this most convincing vision of
the post-civil rights Mississippi is a place that's definitely
worth a two-hour visit.
</P>
<P>
   Cookie's Fortune. Directed by Robert Altman. Screenplay by Anne
Rapp. Cast: Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Liv Tyler, Patricia
O'Neal, Charles S. Dutton, Chris O'Donnell, Ned Beatty. October
Films. 118 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual references.

`SCHOOL OF FLESH' A HAUNTING CHARACTER STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   French critics are forever crying that Hollywood values are
destroying their beloved national cinema but, in at least one
respect, U.S. movies seem to have little or no impact: Gallic films
are still packed with great roles for women.
</P>
<P>
   While you can count the number of solid star vehicles for
actresses in Hollywood films each year on one hand, almost every
French film has a great woman's role. Why is this? Clearly, they
like women more than we do. They think they're fascinating
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the chief pleasure of seeing Benoit Jacquot's
``The School of Flesh'' is the close-up spectacle of Isabelle
Huppert in almost every second of its 100 minutes. It's not that
she eats the scenery, either. She actually underplays the role in a
performance of immense subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   Based on one of the many novels of twisted passion by Japan's
Yukio Mishima, it's the story of Dominique (Huppert), a rather
cold-blooded, fortyish career woman who goes to a club one night
and falls in quiet, smoldering lust with Quentin (Vincent
Martinez), a young, part-Arab bartender.
</P>
<P>
   It's soon apparent the young man is bad news _ a cruel, abusive,
game-playing user and part-time male prostitute to boot. But she
doesn't care: she likes the unromantic, even mechanical approach he
brings to the sex act; she enjoys her humiliation at his feet; and
begs to become his ``sugar daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   The script follows the stumbling stages of their off-and-on
affair, which comes to a crisis after an abortive holiday in North
Africa when he meets and finds himself attracted to the nubile
young daughter (Roxanne Mesquida) of Dominique's best friend
(Marthe Keller).
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar story, and, frankly, the script doesn't do
anything remarkably new with it. As insouciantly played by Martinez
(younger brother of French star Olivier Martinez), Quentin is
simply never interesting enough for us to care much one way or
another who gets him.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the movie is mesmerizing _ in the same way that almost
any '40s Hollywood vehicle of Bette Davis or Joan Crawford is
mesmerizing. Jacquot's camera stays firmly riveted to Huppert's
face as it conveys her character's every thought and emotion.
Inadequate as the film may be in other respects, it's a haunting
character study and a terrific star vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The School of Flesh. Directed by Benoit Jacquot. Written by
Jacques Fieschi, from a novel by Yukio Mishima. Cast: Isabelle
Huppert, Vincent Martinez, Marthe Keller, Vincent Lindon.
Stratosphere Entertainment. 101 minutes. In French with English
subtitles. Rated R for sex scenes.

`NEVER BEEN KISSED' PREDICTABLE, RARELY FUNNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore's first foray as executive producer in ``Never
Been Kissed'' certainly gives her a lot of close-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In this predictable Cinderella story of a nerdy Chicago
Sun-Times copy editor who gets her big chance by going back to high
school to write an undercover expose on student/teacher relations,
Barrymore stacks the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Her character is so intent upon repairing her own traumatic
teenage experience that she can barely do her job. By focusing on
becoming popular, she ignores deadlines, and finds true love.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to give Barrymore credit for portraying herself as
the ungainliest of geeks, but as a newspaperwoman she's about as
believeable as Julia Roberts' hooker in ``Pretty Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Never Been Kissed,'' Barrymore plays Josie Geller, a nerdy,
virginal 25-year-old copy editor on one of Chicago's two big daily
papers. She might have her own office, which is a feat in itself,
but Josie hasn't even been ``properly kissed,'' she tells her
libidinous best friend, Anita (Molly Shannon).
</P>
<P>
   Her dream is to be a reporter, but she can't get her editor, the
seasoned Gus (John C. Reilly), to give her a chance. Then the
paper's owner (played by Garry Marshall) assigns her to an
undercover expose: She has to find a story somewhere in the
hallowed halls of high school.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her joy, Josie has a problem. She was a total zero with
braces in school, humiliated on prom night and called ``Josie
Grossie'' by the other kids. Her brother, Rob (David Arquette) was
the popular kid, though his life is now on the skids. This could be
her big chance to redeem herself from her nightmares and bad
memories. But will history repeat itself or will Josie finally get
a date with the most popular guy in school?
</P>
<P>
   It's not too tough to see what's coming in this only
occasionally amusing romantic comedy. Barrymore goes out on a limb
to act the geek and, indeed, those are the films best (and meanest)
moments.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no real conflict or friction at the story's core and
there are so many incidental bits that the lessons Josie learns
feel hackneyed and tacked on. We know what will happen within the
first half hour. Barrymore is whinily bland, as is Michael Vartan,
in a thankless role as the school's handsome, popular English
teacher, who takes an interest in Josie.
</P>
<P>
   It's a small role by LeeLee Sobieski, who gave an impassioned
performance in last year's ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,''
that stands out. She's Josie's new best school friend, an offbeat
chemistry and calculus whiz named Aldys. When Josie finally
achieves status and becomes everything she never was the first time
around, the pain of rejection is evidently clear on Sobieski's
face. She scoops Barrymore in every scene of this painfully tepid
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Never Been Kissed. Directed by Raja Gosnell. Written by Abby
Kohn, Marc Silverstein. Cast: Drew Barrymore, David Arquette, Molly
Shannon, LeeLee Sobieski. 20th Century Fox. 100 minutes. Rated
PG-13 for language, sexual content.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The silence is so taut that it hurts. It descends
around 11 p.m. at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, the resounding
soundlessness of a crowd of hundreds scarcely daring to breathe,
much less cough or whisper or unwrap one of those notorious
lozenges.
</P>
<P>
   A question has been asked on the stage, the home of the new
revival of ``The Iceman Cometh,'' and Kevin Spacey, playing the man
who must answer, breaks off in midresponse to pause. The pause
keeps growing; it becomes an ocean. And Spacey, for those wide,
penetrating seconds, seems like the most powerful man on earth.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time you heard that kind of hush in a theater?
That this one occurs four hours into the performance of ``Iceman,''
which officially opened April 8, is a testament to the abiding
potency of Eugene O'Neill's great, lumbering barroom metaphysics
lesson of a play and to the hypnotic pull of this production, which
arrives by way of the Almeida Theater in London and is directed by
Howard Davies.
</P>
<P>
   In the land of the puny attention span, here is an American
audience, still wide awake after prime time and hanging on to an
actor's pause as though it were the edge of a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   The question that inspires this moment is one of many asked in
the course of ``Iceman,'' O'Neill's down-in-the-depths masterwork
from 1946. By the time it is posed, the play's plot-driving
mysteries, never that impenetrable to begin with, have already been
uncovered, and its philosophical queries remain what they were in
the first act.
</P>
<P>
   But when Harry Hope (James Hazeldine), the owner of the grimy
saloon where the work is set, eagerly asks Theodore Hickman
(Spacey), the charismatic salesman known as Hickey, to confirm that
he, Hickey, has lost his mind, it is the highest-stakes question of
all. What hangs in the balance is nothing less than the ability of
Hope and his cronies to go on living, not happily, mid you, but
with some degree of serenity, in the state of mind that O'Neill
famously summed up as a ``pipe dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The finest achievement of this slightly rough but always
engrossing ``Iceman'' is its complete evocation of the appeal of
its characters' pipe dreams, of illusions nourished and sustained
by alcohol. They are what is threatened by the arrival of Hickey, a
preacher of the gospel of self-knowledge, given shimmering,
scalpel-edged life by Spacey, who turns everyone he touches from a
fluttering ghost into a truly dead soul.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's bar may be, as one of its inhabitants puts it, ``the No
Chance Saloon.'' But it is also a place of profound comfort and
even beauty. A character in O'Neill's ``More Stately Mansions''
gives voice to its author's contention that existence is ``without
any meaning whatever _ that human life is a silly disappointment, a
liar's promise.'' Life at Harry's is the life of anesthesia, an
extreme form of the delusions that let everyone get from day to
day. There is poetry in pipe dreams and the soothing rhythms of a
lullaby.
</P>
<P>
   From the production's opening images, in which the denizens of
the bar stagger to the chairs in which they sleep, Davies and his
cast convey those rhythms beautifully. There's a sleepy, stylized
lilt to many of the actors' movements, as though they were walking
underwater. Even the spasms of delirium tremens somehow register as
balletic.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Crowley's majestically squalid set is a counterpoint of
enclosed and limitless spaces, of gritty realism and dreamscape.
The room is confined by curving panels on either side of the stage,
but the bare brick walls, on which float pieces of furniture and
battered luggage, stretch skyward, with the aspiration of a Gothic
cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in Crowley's fraying costumes, and bathed in the
Scotch-colored lighting by Mark Henderson, the ensemble brings to
mind a tableau of glowing drunkards by Velazquez rendered in sepia,
with the melting-faced Paul Giamatti, as the aptly named Jimmy
Tomorrow, at its center. In contrast, the tableau that begins the
fourth and final act is a harshly lighted vision of living corpses,
battered, smeared and bruised.
</P>
<P>
   All of the members of this familial band of losers, from a
once-brilliant law student to a trio of prostitutes who insist they
are merely tarts instead of whores, are saddled with their own
great lies, built on fantasies of happy, successful pasts that can
always be resurrected. The bar's self-styled Jeremiah in residence,
Larry Slade (Tim Pigott-Smith), growls sardonic, purple
declarations abot this land of illusions. A onetime political
anarchist, he is now free of ideals, he says, and waiting only for
death. That, of course, is a lie, too.
</P>
<P>
   The talk in ``Iceman'' is long and repetitive, its symbols
ponderous. On the page, it can be leaden. It isn't meant only to be
read, any more than sheet music is. And it is music indeed that
emerges when the people of ``Iceman'' speak.
</P>
<P>
   Davies is a first-rate orchestrator, bringing out the operatic
motifs in the often-told stories with which the characters
entertain each other, contrasted by the abrupt staccato sounds,
ranging from shattering glass to keys being flung onto a counter,
that disrupt them. He also finds the sweetness, as well as the
pathos, in the barflies' melodies.
</P>
<P>
   Even Larry, a character usually played as a flinty old prophet,
has been given a cozy, sentimental edge by Pigott-Smith. It is an
approach that verges on cuteness, but it pays off when Spacey's
Hickey arrives to celebrate Harry's birthday toward the end of the
first act, radically altering the tempo of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey is the man for whom the people at Harry's have been
waiting, much as Beckett's tramps waited for Godot. And when Spacey
hits the stage like a string of firecrackers going off, you
understand why. Here, it seems, is indeed the one-man good-time
caravan of the bar's local mythology.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the first impression, and it fades as soon as
you look into Spacey's eyes. There is something both dead and
restless behind them. When Hickey starts in on his spiel about his
recent discovery of the inner peace that comes with the shedding of
illusions, it has the slap of cold water. Small wonder that Harry's
regulars complain that their booze suddenly has no kick.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a movie actor in films like ``The Usual Suspects'' and ``L.A.
Confidential,'' Spacey has made a specialty of intricately layered
characters with a secret at their center. He was, in short, born to
play Hickey, and the intelligence he brings to the role, obviously
grounded in a microscopic reading of the text, is breathtaking. You
can almost see Hickey's trenchant mind clicking away as he assesses
those around him, shifting gears to play on their respective
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Spacey conjures a man who is on the run from
himself. Has any Hickey ever spoken quite this fast, like a
carnival barker on speed? Spacey isn't rushing toward an early
curtain. He is delivering a canny portrait of someone trying to
outrace his thoughts with his words. When he loses, it's not a
surprise. Spacey has prepared us too well. But that doesn't make
the defeat any less harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Spacey doesn't dominate the proceedings like an
allegorical Titan, as Hickeys sometimes can. He and Davies
understand that ``Iceman'' is not so much about Hickey per se as
his role as a catalyst. The world of the bar, which is the world at
large, is the true center of ``Iceman,'' and this production never
forgets that.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is a mixture of actors from the London production and
newcomers, and an ideal balance among them has not been completely
realized. As Don Parritt, the son of an anarchist mother who
carries his own corrosive secret, Robert Sean Leonard, a fine and
sensitive young actor, is perhaps too much the leading man to
present the requisite irritating mixture of defensiveness and
eagerness to please. And the central, death-courting triangle made
up of Hickey, Larry and Parritt lacks its essential grit.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Emerson, late of ``Gross Indecency,'' brings a deeply
haunting, German Expressionist presence to the role of a washed-up
Ivy Leaguer, though he could bring it down a notch or two. Tony
Danza, as the whore-running bartender, is solid if a shade too
brilliantine in his mannerisms. Clarke Peters, in the risky role of
the show's single black character, and Jeff Weiss are terrific as
very different spinners of threadbare yarns, as are Skip Sudduth
and Katie Finneran as a pair of sweet-and-sour lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Hazeldine's Harry Hope is perfection. More than anyone else, he
becomes the crucial barometer of the changes wrought by Hickey's
proselytizing, sliding slowly from posturing misanthropy to a
bleakness just a degree away from death. There is a moment in the
third act when Harry, finally forced to own up to his sustaining
personal lie, goes absolutely ashen and his breathing becomes
labored. You're tempted to stand up and cry ``Enough!'' and demand
that Hickey be banished.
</P>
<P>
   That your responses can still be so keen so late in the evening
says much about this ``Iceman,'' which manages to entertain even at
its darkest and preachiest. O'Neill spoke of the play as
representing ``a big kind of comedy that doesn't stay funny very
long.'' Yet when this ``Iceman'' turns somber, it never tastes like
medicine. What is served at Harry Hope's saloon may indeed be
rotgut, but this production has the rich, warming flavor of
single-malt scotch.

 &HT;    Think tank aims to boost black churches
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The formation of a center that may revolutionize the
way black churches do business in the next century was announced
Thursday by the Atlanta-based Interdenominational Theological
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The think tank, called the ``ITC/FaithFactor,'' is being created
with the belief that the effective black pastor of the next century
must be interested not only in private virtue but in public policy
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to prepare effective congregation leaders, but we also
want those leaders to be sophisticated,'' said ITC President Robert
Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   The ITC, a predominately black group of six seminaries, is
located near downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The think tank, funded by such groups as the Ford Foundation and
the Lilly Endowment, will include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A technology program, already pledged to donate 30,000
computers to black churches, that will teach participants how to do
everything from set up computer learning labs to create their own
World Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An outreach program that will teach church officials how to
provide technical skills to people in need of training and
employment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An educational program that will teach churches how to
establish after-school programming and Christian academies.
</P>
<P>
   The think tank will also serve as a national clearinghouse for
the nation's estimated 70,000 black churches, according to Cicero
Wilson, the executive director of the program and head of its staff
of eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must create a communication system that will allow us to
share our best practices,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ITC officials hope the new center will usher in a day when the
black preacher will become a ``public theologian,'' someone who can
quote the lastest study or survey as well as Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must prepare someone not just to preach, but we must also
show them how to manage,'' Wilson said.

 &HT;    `Pilot's Wife' latest to score on Oprah book club
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Big Game jackpot is enticing to ordinary folks, but authors
have their own lottery. It's called the Oprah Winfrey Book Club,
and the latest winner is Massachusetts writer Anita Shreve. ``The
Pilot's Wife'' (Harvest Books, $13.95, paperback), Shreve's novel
about a widow's discovery of her dead husband's secret life, has
been chosen as Winfrey's April selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful,'' Shreve says from her home in Longmeadow,
Mass. ``Life was already great. Now it's better.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Pilot's Wife,'' the protagonist attempts to clear her
husband's name after he is blamed for a fatal air crash. Her
discoveries force her to realize she really didn't know her husband
of 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Shreve has just finished a new book, ``Fortune's Rocks,'' that _
coincidentally _ takes place in the same house as ``The Pilot's
Wife.''
</P>

   ``It's set about a hundred years earlier,'' Shreve says. ``It's
about a 15-year-old girl who falls in love with a 42-year-old
married doctor. It's like a 19th-century novel with a huge cast of
characters. It's written in 19th-century language, which is
familiar to me because I wrote `The Weight of Water' in that
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, three of Shreve's earlier books _ ``Strange Fits of
Passion,'' ``Eden Close'' and ``Where or When'' _ have been
optioned for films.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING THE LIST: Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in Full'' was a big book
(in size and sales) last year, but it wasn't the biggest. Wolfe,
whose Atlanta-centered novel sold 1.26 million copies, finished
fourth on the Publishers Weekly 1998 list, behind John Grisham's
``The Street Lawyer,'' Tom Clancy's ``Rainbow Six'' and Stephen
King's ``Bag of Bones.''

<P>
   MORE PULP: Jacqueline Susann and Grace Metalious are dead, but
fans can still get a dose of their trademark glitz this summer.
Northeastern University Press is reissuing a paperback edition of
``Peyton Place'' 43 years after Metalious' scandalous (at the time)
classic was published. In her introduction, Maine professor Ardis
Cameron writes, ``Metalious tweaked the mythologies of tourist New
England, turning the familiar postcard portrait into a voluptuous
pinup poster.'' Meanwhile, resurrecting Susann's 1966 novel
``Valley of the Dolls'' wasn't good enough for one publisher.
Publishers Weekly reports that Crown has hired a pseudonymous
author, Rae Lawrence, to use some of Susann's notes _ made for her
next book project _ to write a novel in Susann's style. Titled
``Jacqueline Susann's Shadow of the Dolls,'' the novel will be
published next year after the remake of the film ``Valley of the
Dolls.''

   DOWNSIZING: Any independent bookseller will tell you the market
is shrinking, but apparently books are, too. Publishers from
Abbeville Press to Running Press are turning to minibooks to
generate more income. Publishing Trends reports that the tiny books
_ available in Crate &AMP; Barrel stores as well as traditional outlets
_ have produced net sales of $20 million in the past five years.
Some of the best selling titles have been Abbeville Press'
miniature museum books, Running Press' ``Star Wars'' books, and Ten
Speed Press' minicookbooks, ``Totally Garlic'' or ``Totally Crab.''
``What you're getting is not just the gimmick of the little format,
but really delicious, usable recipes,'' says Veronica Randall,
editor of Ten Speed Press. Even Christian booksellers are getting
into the act, with ``God's Little Instruction Book'' and ``One
Minute Pocket Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   IN THE NEWS: Georgia writer Deborah Smith, who moved from
romance novels to mainstream fiction with ``A Place to Call Home,''
has signed a $1.25 million two-book deal with Little, Brown. The
first, ``The Iron Bear,'' will be published next summer.

 &HT;    Home is where the heart is for beloved writer, 90, who found a
wealth of characters just outside door
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 11.

   ``I am a writer who came of a sheltered life. A sheltered life
can be a daring life as well. For all serious
</P>
<P>
   daring starts from within.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Eudora Welty,
</P>
<P>
   ``One Writer's Beginnings''
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ The curtains are open, the shades are up and a
light glows in a downstairs room of the house at 1119 Pinehurst St.
Someone has gathered dead leaves and branches and stuffed them in
black garbage bags that sit by the mailbox. Cats loll on the
concrete walkway. Across the street, the students of Bellhaven
College dart in and out of classes, their shouts softened by the
distance across the campus lawn.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine a living legend is just beyond the screen
door.
</P>
<P>
   Even without an exact address, it would be easy for Eudora
Welty's readers to recognize this house from her description of it
in 1983's ``One Writer's Beginnings'':
</P>
<P>
   ``The house was on a slight hill (my mother never could see the
hill) covered with its original forest pines, on a gravel road then
a little out from town, and was built in a style very much of its
day, of stucco and brick and beams in the Tudor style.''
</P>
<P>
   Welty has lived most of her life in this home, moving here with
her family as teenager, returning to it from New York at 22 to be
with her newly widowed mother and staying ever since. The road out
front is paved now, and the Bellhaven neighborhood, then new, is
being considered for a historic designation.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Welty's 90th birthday, which is Tuesday, the house
has become the writer's entire universe. Confined by poor health
alluded to only in the vaguest terms by her friends and family,
Mississippi's grande dame of literature and Jackson's most hallowed
resident is rarely seen these days. Round-the-clock nurses tend
her, and only close friends and relatives visit.
</P>
<P>
   Though she always liked the peace and familiarity of her
childhood home, Welty is not reclusive by nature. Until recently,
she had her daily routines in Bellhaven, and often she dined out
with friends or went to the theater. She traveled, visiting friends
and lecturing, and always getting to New York at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eudora used to say she was underfoot locally,'' says Pearl
Amelia McHaney, a professor at Georgia State University who has
published the Eudora Welty newsletter for 22 years and edited a new
collection of essays, ``Eudora Welty: Writers' Reflections Upon
First Reading Welty.'' ``She might not have made a stir, but she
was always active.''
</P>
<P>
   She is missed around town. Yet, even as she is nowhere to be
seen, Welty is everywhere in Jackson. By choosing to stay here all
her life, Welty is in the air, palpable in her old haunts like the
lingering perfume of someone who just left the room.
</P>
<P>
   For Eudora Welty the woman, Jackson has been, quite simply,
home. For Eudora Welty the writer, Jackson has been what Oxford,
Miss., was to William Faulkner, a small but ample playground for
her imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Her characters were always here, waiting to be heard by the
woman with an uncanny ear for the cadences of small-town small
talk, and an almost eerie capacity to walk a spell in another's
shoes. Beauty parlor harpies and jazz singers, country folk and
city folk, black and white, freakish and all-too-normal, all were
Welty's fellow Mississippians. And the stories they inhabit _
masterpieces such as ``Why I Live at the P.O.,'' ``Powerhouse,''
``A Worn Path'' and her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, ``The
Optimist's Daughter'' _ came into being by the light of her bedroom
window in the house on Pinehurst Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in Jackson has anchored her in the voices of the people
she's chronicled in her fiction,'' says William Ferris, chairman of
the National Endowment for the Humanities and a Mississippi native
who has known Welty since he was 12. ``These are the voices of
people she's come across all her life in the Jitney Jungle and in
the beauty parlor.''
</P>
<P>
   And the relationship is reciprocal. Unlike Faulkner, who was
tolerated at best by Oxford during his lifetime, Welty is loved
like an aunt and worshipped like a patron saint in Jackson. It is
as difficult to imagine Jackson without Welty as it is to imagine
Welty without Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's important where you set your story. The
important thing is to be so familiar with it that you don't have
stop and say, `what would be blooming there in July?' I know.
(Jackson) sets my stage and then I can push off from that base.''
</P>
<P>
   _From a 1984 interview in
</P>
<P>
   The Memphis Commercial Appeal
</P>
<P>
   What's it like to have a world-famous writer in town? The
residents of Jackson know. Eudora Welty has lived among them for 90
years, buying newspapers and groceries one day, receiving the
Pulitzer Prize or the French Legion of Honor the next.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Nobles, manager of Parkins Pharmacy in Bellhaven, used to
see her every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to come in here and buy her New York Times,'' says
Nobles. Now called MediStat since it was bought by a national
chain, it remains much as it was when it opened 75 years ago.
There's a post office window, a soda fountain and a lunch counter,
along with the usual aisles of greeting cards and toothpaste.
Nobles knows most of his customers by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, she used to come in here all the time, until she quit
driving,'' he continues. ``But a friend still comes in every day to
get her New York Times. She always wanted that New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   The pharmacy is next to the Jitney Jungle, where Welty would buy
her groceries. People used to shop at Parkins and the Jitney Jungle
just for the chance of catching a glimpse of Welty.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd get so excited over Miss Eudora,'' Nobles says. ``Not
the people of Bellhaven _ they were used to her _ but people from
other parts of Jackson or from out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers used to ask Nobles to get Welty's autograph for them,
but Welty asked him to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not because she minded, but because she didn't want me to be
bothered with that,'' he says. ``That's just how she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Welty's sister-in-law, Mittie Welty, stops in to mail a letter.
She recalls fondly when the aging author was more active.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, she went everywhere,'' she says. ``She liked going out at
night with her friends. She liked the movies, and the New Stage,
the community theater here in Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite place was Bill's Tavern, a casual restaurant with
paper menus and crackers in baskets that serves fresh seafood and
Greek specialties. On her 85th birthday, one of many she celebrated
at Bill's, a belly dancer performed; she had ``Eudora Welty I Love
You'' written on her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Welty's niece, Mary Alice White, remembers when she was too
young to know Welty was famous. She was simply the favorite maiden
aunt who took her on the train to New York to see Broadway plays
and drove in the carpool.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just a wonderful aunt,'' says White, admissions
director at Jackson Preparatory Academy. ``Then I'd open an English
book, and there would be my aunt's story to study.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how it is with Welty in town. She is at once neighbor and
celebrity, aunt and literary legend, casual listener and
immortalizing chronicler.
</P>
<P>
   All around town are small shrines to Welty. The municipal
library is named after her. There is a bust of her at Lemuria
Bookstore, an independent bookseller. A Mississippi governor once
decreed her birthday to be ``Eudora Welty Day.'' Much of her life's
work is stored at the state archives, including her manuscripts,
the photographs she shot while at her first job as a publicity
agent for the Works Progress Administration and the war bond
newsletter she wrote in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   At Jackson Prep, a glass case in the library is filled with
photographs of Welty and first editions of her books. Diann
Arinder, librarian and English teacher at the school, recalls when
White's daughter, Welty's grandniece, invited her in 1996 to see
Welty receive the French Legion of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to meet Eudora Welty, and I thought I would just melt in
my shoes,'' Arinder says. ``She waved her long, delicate fingers at
me, and I couldn't believe those fingers had pounded on a
typewriter all these years _ and she preferred a manual.''
</P>
<P>
   Welty asked Arinder which books her grandniece liked to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that just like her to want to talk about someone else
besides herself?'' Arinder says.

   JACKSON, Miss: Arinder Says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lamar Life tower is overshadowed now, and you can no
longer read the time on its clocktower from all over town, as he'd
wanted to be possible always, but the building's grace and good
proportion contrast tellingly with the overpowering, sometimes
brutal, character of some of the structures that rise above it.
Renovators have sandblasted away the alligators that graced the
entrance. But the Company still has its home there, and my father
is remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   _From ``One Writer's Beginnings''
</P>
<P>
   Though the small town of 25,000 of Welty's youth has grown into
a small city of more than 200,000, many of the landmarks of her
childhood have endured.
</P>
<P>
   The Lamar Life Building, dubbed ``Jackson's first skyscraper''
in 1924, was Welty's father's pride and joy. He was an officer in
the insurance company and oversaw the construction of the building.
Today, it is dwarfed by New South architecture, but its white
marble facade and elaborate Gothic style hold their own in a city
increasingly made of steel and glass. A metal plaque at the
entrance says ``Home Office of the Lamar Life Insurance Company.
H.S. Weston, President; C.W. Welty, Vice President and General
Manager. Erected 1924.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a block or so from downtown, Welty's birthplace is still on
Congress Street, a dollhouselike Victorian home with a comfortable
porch and a small yard. A plaque marks the house as her birthplace
and says it was built in 1908 by Christian and Chestina Welty,
Eudora's parents. Now butter yellow, the two-story house has
offices in it, as do most of the homes on the street. Next door are
the headquarters for Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove's race for governor;
up the street is Welty's elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Welty's presence has been invaluable to Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the foremost contribution in Jackson from a literary
perspective,'' says John Evans, owner of Lemuria Bookstore, where
Welty signed several of her books.
</P>
<P>
   Welty has brought people to Jackson who otherwise never would
have come, he says. Writers, journalists and just plain fans
trooped in and out of the house on Pinehurst Street for decades.
Henry Miller, Reynolds Price, Anne Tyler, The New York Times and
Vanity Fair, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has introduced writers, photographers, researchers and
journalists to Mississippi life,'' Evans says. ``And she has opened
the doorway for other writers from Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she is like compared with the other writers he's met
through the years, Evans becomes passionate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one more special, there's no one more gracious,
more genuine, more caring, and there may not be a more well-read
writer. And she has been so well-loved by the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewers love to ask Welty why she stayed, and her answer is
always simple. It is home, and it is familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved the place and the people, beginning with her
parents,'' says longtime friend Ferris. ``She felt a relationship
there that was unique and was wise enough to know that pull of her
heart was an instinct that should be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel awfully selfish living here alone, and I can't afford
to keep it up the way I should, but I can't imagine moving. And
it's home.''

</P>
<P>
   RECOMMENDED READING
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Optimist's Daughter.'' Winner of the Pulitzer Prize,
this slender, partially autobiographical novel tells the story of a
young woman named Laurel who had left the South but returns to New
Orleans as her father is dying.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A Curtain of Green.'' First published in 1941, the stories
in Welty's debut collection are undiminished by time. Her best
stories are here: ``Petrified Man,'' ``Powerhouse'' and the most
celebrated of all, ``Why I Live at the P.O.,'' which writer Fred
Chappell once described as ``an extravaganza of ventriloquism,
dramatic irony and sheer slapstick.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``One Writer's Beginnings.'' This soft-spoken memoir of a
happy childhood and a writer's evolution grew out of a series of
lectures Welty delivered at Harvard University in 1983. It has
become standard reading for anyone aspiring to be a writer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``One Time, One Place: Mississippi in the Depression, a
Snapshot Album.'' During the Great Depression, as adept with a
camera as a pen, Welty traveled throughout her home state taking
photographs for Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress
Administration. The 100 duotone pictures in this volume capture the
faces and scenes of a lost time.

 &HT;    A spirited ride set amid raves, deals and, of course, Vegas
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go has the energetic, late-night delirium of a Chinese fire
drill. It's a whirl of wired young adults running in circles before
the traffic light turns green. The title comes from the word
mouthed by one character to another at a crucial point in the
story. It could just as easily derive from the film's headlong
momentum: ``On your mark, get set, go!''
</P>
<P>
   A three-part comedy-drama unfolding on a single Christmas Eve,
it's directed and shot by Doug Liman (``Swingers''). You could
think of it as a movie built on X's. We get Xmas, exhilaration,
exhaustion, excitement and the drug called ecstasy, better known as
X.
</P>
<P>
   The movie kicks off with grocery clerk Ronna (Sarah Polley)
trying to make some extra bucks to pay rent. When two strangers
named Adam (Scott Wolf) and Zack (Jay Mohr) ask her if she can, uh,
hook them up for a party that night, Ronna figures she can buy 20
hits of X from snarling dealer Todd (Timothy Olyphant) and sell
them back to the guys at a substantial markup.
</P>
<P>
   Things don't turn out as planned. The scenario escalates into a
tense encounter with the law, a wild rave, a drug overdose, some
gunplay and a hit-and-run accident. And that's only the first part
of the movie. The second follows Simon (Desmond Askew), a Brit who
works with Ronna, on a road trip to Las Vegas with three pals,
including Marcus (Taye Diggs). Their adventure includes a blazing
hotel room, a trip to a strip club (for the gratuitous T&AMP;A every
``hip'' moviemaker seems obliged to include), more gunplay, more
car disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Part 3 returns us to Adam and Zack, who turn out not to be the
people we thought. Their complex relationship is strained by dinner
with a policeman (William Fichtner) and his wife (Jane Krakowski).
Paced with the offbeat rhythms of a David Lynch movie, the
funny-creepy scene is charged with a sexual tension that playfully
turns out to be something else entirely.
</P>
<P>
   This segment solves the narrative threads dangling from the
first two parts. So, after all this, what have we learned? Not
much. But it's been fun, thanks to an engaging cast and
occasionally riotous touches. The funniest involves a hallucinating
kid, a house cat and subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   First-time screenwriter John August's script borrows the
wraparound chronology of ``Pulp Fiction.'' But it doesn't match the
high stakes of that movie or ask questions any deeper than ``Are we
having fun yet?'' It's more like a late-millennial ``American
Graffiti,'' with attitude replacing nostalgia. The movie's subtext
seems to be the aimless emptiness of the characters' lives, but
it's an idea that's never really addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go'' is basically a picaresque plot machine that sends its
characters spinning through misadventures. Though it wraps itself
in independent-film cachet _ it was a Sundance Festival hit _ the
movie is as calculated in courting its target audience as more
crassly commercial teen pics like ``She's All That'' and ``Wing
Commander.''
</P>
<P>
   The film writes its own description in the opening scene, as
another grocery clerk (Katie Holmes) tells a friend at a diner,
``You know what I like about Christmas? The surprises.'' That sums
up ``Go.'' It's a bright, shining package. And though it turns out
to be pretty empty, you can't help admiring how cleverly it's
wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sarah Polley, Scott Wolf, Katie Holmes and
</P>
<P>
   Jay Mohr. Rated R for strong drug content, sexuality, language
and some violence. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Like the rave at its center, it's a blast while it
lasts, though you may feel let down when it's over.

 &HT;    National Prisoner of War Museum marks first anniversary
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDERSONVILLE, Ga. _ After 56 years, Marge Best remembers the
moment the telegram came ``like it just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw mother, and she was crying so,'' said Best, 71. ``We
knew what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The telegram said her father, Harold ``Pop'' Thomas, was missing
in action. Later, another brought the news he was a POW in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Best had come to this tiny, out-of-the-way Georgia town to visit
the National Prisoner of War Museum, a $5.8 million shrine to the
800,000 Americans held as POWs since 1776. The federally operated
museum opened a year ago today, and _ like the more famous and more
accessible Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington _ it has touched
thousands of veterans and their families, who walk slowly through
its grim corridors, full of relics that point out the unspeakable
horrors of POW life.

   Before last year, almost all visitors to Andersonville were
Civil War buffs who came to see the long rows of tombstones of
Union soldiers who died at the infamous Confederate prison. After
the museum opened, 6,600 more people a month are making the trek
through the rural countryside to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stories on the new museum were in papers all over the country,
on network news, and people of all ages were just taken with it,''
park Superintendent Fred Boyles said. ``People come now because
they realize we owe them, and all veterans, a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected consequence has been the donation of 1,561 relics
and mementos by ex-POWs who salvaged eating utensils, hand-made
weapons, diaries and even German and Japanese flags that flew over
their World War II prison camps. The museum owns about 8,000
relics, 200 of which are on display. Some of the newly donated ones
will eventually go into glass displays designed to protect them
from light, humidity, heat and bacteria; for now they're being kept
in a climate-controlled warehouse at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Curator Eric Reinert is charged with taking care of all the
artifacts, and he's awed by what he's seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really something,'' he said, gingerly unfolding a huge
Nazi flag donated by Betty Hammel, 76, of Syracuse, N.Y. Hammel's
brother, the late Lt. John Hull, secreted the banner out of a
German prison camp. ``It's in great shape, kept folded in a closet
drawer all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   He dons white gloves, then opens a gray box containing a book
titled ``A Wartime log,'' in which Lt. Joseph Klingenberg of Villa
Hills, Ky., faithfully recorded his daily experiences in a German
camp after being shot down on Feb. 4, 1944. He donated the diary
along with a scrapbook kept by his wife, Aylyn, full of War
Department telegrams and censored letters the Germans allowed him
to send home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the best diaries I've ever seen,'' said
Reinert, thumbing through Klingenberg's log. ``The writing is
clear. He drew caricatures of friends. He recorded small details.''
</P>
<P>
   Klingenberg, 79, and a retired Xavier University chemistry
professor, said he realized as a scholar that the documents ``could
be used by students in the future to study the war.''
</P>
<P>
   His children didn't want the diary or scrapbook, he said. ``I
decided this is going to be a safe place. I know they'll take care
of it. And everyone needs to know what happened to us and what all
POWs endure, like those three young soldiers in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   With American World War II vets dying at a rate of 35,000 a
month, Klingenberg and his contemporaries are more willing to go
public with their memories than they used to be. ``After we got
home, we were too busy raising families,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered the priceless books in person and his visit to the
museum impressed him. ``We need to make sure everyone is aware of
what we went through. It's too easy to put material like this in an
attic and let it waste away.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by others who've made donations, such
as Joseph Sturniolo, 75, of Sun City Center, Fla. He recently
handed Reinert a small lump of hardened brown bread. The bread came
not from his own experience in World War II, but from World War I,
when his late father, David Sturniolo, was held as a POW in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped in newspaper, the bread was made from potato skins,
wheat flour and sawdust. His father had skipped his rations so he
could bring it home to show his family. The younger Sturniolo
didn't want the bread to get lost or deteriorate, and he feared his
children wouldn't appreciate its significance.
</P>
<P>
   Not all donors have delivered their relics personally to the
curator. Some have mailed them in, and at least one person left a
memento anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, when the museum opened, somebody left a Japanese
flag _ just brought it in and left it on a table,'' Reinert said.
``No name, only this inscription: `Torn down by L.R. Scoggin and
Russell Rawlins.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some relics are from more recent conflicts. There are cigarette
pouches and a brick from the ``Hanoi Hilton'' in Vietnam, and the
flight suit of Lt. Col. Rhonda Cornum, an Army physician who was
wounded and held prisoner during the Persian Gulf War. Cornum also
donated casts wrapped around her broken arms by Iraqi doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But by far, most donations have been from the World War II-Korea
era.
</P>
<P>
   Captured at Anzio, Italy, on Feb. 22, 1944, Henry Kaufman, 78,
of Los Angeles, was held in several POW camps before the Germans
found out he was Jewish and sent him to the infamous Dachau
concentration camp. As German discipline fell apart near the end of
the war, Kaufman slipped into a Gestapo captain's bedroom one
morning, took the officer's pistol from the bedpost, killed him and
escaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so bitter with anger for him trying to kill me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman traveled to the museum to donate the pistol, its holster
and a full clip of bullets _ minus the one he fired into the
German.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the museum was packed with visitors, its parking lot
full of cars from more than a dozen states and several tour buses.
Men, women and even children dabbed at their eyes with tissues as
they viewed videotapes of POWs telling their stories or peered with
horror at duplicates of small cells in which captured men were
caged in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe the things those men went through,'' said
Zach Osterman, 12, of Atlanta, visting with his mother and
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bowers, 74, of Atlanta, was a crew member of a B-24
bomber, shot down on his first mission Sept. 27, 1944, and held
until war's end. He pointed toward the museum's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children would never know about World War II if we didn't
have this,'' he said. ``People should know.''
</P>
<P>
   Marge Best, choked with emotion, said her father was 35 when he
was captured and is 91 now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still puts his hand over his heart when the national anthem
is played, and I know he'd like to come here. This museum is such a
wonderful memorial to all POWs, men who have lost their lives, to
all people who serve their country,'' she said. ``It's just
beautiful. He'd really appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I do.''
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE
</P>
<P>
   From Atlanta take I-75 south past Macon and Perry to the
Henderson exit. Go west on Ga. 26 to Oglethorpe, then south on Ga.
49. The National Prisoner of War Museum is on Ga. 49, nine miles
north of Americus. It and the Civil War cemetery, which is at the
same site, are open from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily except
Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free.
Information: 912-924-0343.

   `The Corruptor'
</P>
<P>
   This movie gives New York's Chinatown a bad name. Chow Yun-Fat
gives honest cops a bad name. And Mark Wahlberg gives acting a bad
name. There's plenty of action and violence but not much else. It's
not worth missing your supper to go see ``Corruptor.''

   `October Sky'
</P>
<P>
   This is an inspiring story about the efforts of a group of
students who dared to dream of escaping the stranglehold gravity of
the mines. Based on a true story, it has such an authentic look
that I was transported back to the time that I too, at age 12,
looked up and saw that first artificial satellite.

   `Never Been Kissed'
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a slow and frighteningly boring movie proved
to be nothing more than that. The plot had its weaknesses,
including numerous scenes with an annoying Drew Barrymore crying
about her traumatic teenage years. The movie went on to prove that
it should have ``Never Been Made.''

   `8MM'
</P>
<P>
   Besides being too dank and even more disturbing than David
Fincher's superior ``Seven,'' ``8MM'' is one of the most intriguing
thrillers of the past few years. It shows the porn industry with
probably more realism than ``Boogie Nights'' did and features a
fine performance by Nicolas Cage.

   YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MAIN _ WASHINGTON _ NATO allies said Friday they were
committed to continuing the air war against Yugoslavia, while hopes
dimmed for an early release of three American soldiers held
prisoner there. (Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-AID _ RINAS AIR FORCE BASE, Albania - Relief workers had
planned to send in enough food for several hundred thousand ethnic
Albanian refugees on a temporary basis. Now, they find they must
feed up to 500,000 for the foreseeable future. That has left them
frantically searching for a way to keep pace with the growing
refugee problem. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CHEMICAL _ WASHINGTON - NATO ground troops entering a
hostile Serbia could face the threat of chemical weapons, the
Federation of American Scientists said on Thursday. The former
Yugoslavia has four facilities producing toxins and possibly
rockets to launch them, which Serbian President Milosevic could use
as a ``trump'' card if NATO invaded. (Malone, Cox News Service)

   BUSH-BUCHANAN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ History says Pat Buchanan can't
be elected president, but he can make life miserable for other
folks who want the job. In 1992, he scared then-President Bush in
the New Hampshire primary. In 1996, Buchanan knocked Texan Phil
Gramm out of the race and won the New Hampshire primary. Now,
Buchanan, who has promised to be nice to opponent GWBush, is
bringing his fire-and-brimstone campaign to the heart of Bush
country. Buchanan will campaign next week in Midland. (Herman,

exist, according to a study released Thursday by the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities. (Lipman, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   EDs: Localized stories for Cox states have MOVED.

   BLACK-TECH _ WASHINGTON - Students at historically black
colleges and universities have less access than other students to
the computer technology that is a key to today's cutting-edge jobs,
experts are saying at the annual conference of the National
Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education. (Mollison,
Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   RECYCLE _ WASHINGTON _ Efforts to get Americans to recycle

billions of dollars in tax subsidies to the raw material industries
against which recycled products must compete, recyclers and tax
reform groups declared Thursday. (Cox News Service).

state. (Montgomery, Cox News Service).

this weekend. (Williams, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   POW-MUSEUM _ Before the $5.8 million National Prisoner of War
Museum opened a year ago today in this tiny southwest Georgia town,
most visitors to Andersonville were Civil War buffs who came to
gawk at the 12,920 marble tombstones of Union soldiers who perished
at the Confederate prison whose name has become synonymous with
cruelty. But since last April 9, it's become a hallowed mecca for
tens of thousands of veterans, most wrinkled, limping on canes or
pushed in wheelchairs by aging sons and daughters through the dark
corridors of the grim museum, full of relics that point out the
horrors of life as a POW. Attendance skyrocketed more than 20
percent in just the first six months, and Park Superintendant Fred
Boyles expects 12-month figures to show a 40 percent jump over the
previous fiscal year. And an unexpected consequence has been the
donation of a flood of 1,561 relics by ex-POWs who salvaged eating
utensils, hand-made weapons, diaries and even German and Japanese
flags that flew over their camps when they were liberated.

will hold a press conference Thursday to announce the details for a
new think tank that will become a clearinghouse for the black
church. The ITC/Faith Factor will offer technical assistance and

   NEWORLEANS-WARM _ NEWORLEANS _ As if it weren't bad enough that
New Orleans is the fattest city, the most heart-disease-ridden
city, now it's the city most at risk for global warming, according
to a new report. Because New Orleans is actually below sea level,
the Big Easy would become the Big Ocean if temperatures keep
climbing and the sea level rises. The solution? Money! Billions
would be needed to revamp the levees that keep the mighty
Mississippi from rolling over the city. The National Environmental
Trust issues the report, called ''Cities at Risk,'' in a telephone
news conference Thursday. (Konigsmark, Atlanta

plan clears a major hurdle as the Senate approves a variety of
sales tax cuts. (Elizondo, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TEX-LEGIS-LANEY _ AUSTIN _ House Speaker Pete Laney is the last
of the big Democrats and could be the linchpin of the 1999
Legislative session. As the Senate sends bills to the House at a
fast clip, the unassuming Democrat from West Texas is in a unique
position to make or break legislation. But will he use his power?
Colleagues say that's not his style, but he could easily kill
legislation privately. We explain how. (Greenberger, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   TEX-LEGIS-TORT _ AUSTIN _ Tort reformers' key bill is expected
to be voted out of a legislative subcommittee on Thursday, but it
might be too late. The bill languished for at least three weeks in
a special subcommittee created by Lt. Gov. Rick Perry to handle all
tort reform legislation. The subcommittee is chaired by Perry's
boyhood friend, Troy Fraser, who has positioned himself as the key
tort reform champion this year. Yet, he was unable to quickly get
the bill out of his own committee. The bill relates to how juries
assess blame _ and monetary damages _ against employers for civil
liability. (McCarthy, Austin American-Statesman).

EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK SLASHES INTEREST RATES
</HEADLINE>
   (ac) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Confronted with an economic slowdown across
Europe, the European Central Bank surprised almost everybody
Thursday by cutting interest rates to one of the lowest levels the
continent has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in the central bank's benchmark rate, from 3.0
percent to 2.5 percent, came hours after a smaller cut by the Bank
of England. It reflected a growing alarm that growth is stalling
across much of Europe and needed a boost by lowering the cost of
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   There had been some expectation that rates would be lowered
Thursday. But the European Central Bank's cut was twice as deep as
had been anticipated. The announcement at about 12:20 p.m. Eastern
time, which came after European financial markets had closed,
ignited a broad rally on Wall Street, and major market indexes all
closed at record highs.
</P>
<P>
   The rate reduction also appeared to be a measure aimed at
Europe's political leaders, many of whom have pressured the bank
for months to juice up economic growth as a way to reduce
joblessness, which averages more than 10 percent across the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they reduced borrowing costs to such low levels, bank
officials warned once again that in their view, the only real
solution to high unemployment is through reforming Europe's heavy
regulation and costly social welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monetary policy is not the cause of structural unemployment,
nor is it the solution,'' said Wim Duisenberg, president of the
European Central Bank. ``Now it will become demonstrably clear that
monetary policy is not the solution to those problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's move marks the first major policy decision by
Europe's new central bank, which assumed its powers with the launch
of Europe's new single currency, the euro, on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   It came after months of pressure from political leaders,
particularly in Germany and France, for lower interest rates. Until
recently, bank officials had only stiffened their resistance at
each new call for cheaper money.
</P>
<P>
   But a stream of bleak economic data had made it increasingly
clear that European growth has slowed much more dramatically than
that of the United States. At the same time, inflation has all but
evaporated and many experts have begun to worry about a
deflationary price spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inflation is not a danger, which enabled us to pay more
attention to the second objective of the European Central Bank,
which is to support the economy,'' said Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
   He said the bank, which is governed by a board that includes the
central bank presidents of all 11 countries in the euro-zone,
decided to act more boldly than expected in order to put an end to
the second-guessing about future rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were afraid that only a smaller move would have led to
expectations in the future of more small moves,'' Duisenberg. ``Now
you can be sure: this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of England's decision to reduce its benchmark rate from
5.50 percent to 5.25 percent was done independently of the European
Central Bank and was the latest in a series of reductions over the
past half year. There is some expectation that the Bank of England,
which does not coordinate its rate cuts with the rest of Europe,
might reduce rates further.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mayer, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt,
said Duisenberg clearly intended to put new pressure on European
political leaders to push ahead with economic changes aimed at
stimulating growth and job creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threw the ball back into the politicians' court,'' Mayer
said. ``From now on, they won't be able to put the blame on
monetary policy.''
</P>
<P>
   At least initially, the decision seemed to have no real impact
on the euro. The euro has fallen more or less steadily against the
dollar, from $1.17 at its debut in January to about $1.07 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Though a rate reduction can lower the value of a currency, the
euro essentially remained stable Thursday because investors had
already anticipated a cut of some sort. Indeed, in a display of
buying on the rumor and selling on the news, the euro climbed
slightly before the bank made its announcement and then eased back
again later.
</P>
<P>
   European political leaders quickly expressed their pleasure at
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This signal can only boost confidence among economic actors
and international partners in the European Union's ability to
return to strong growth,'' said the European Commission, in a
statement released Thursday evening in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   In France, a spokesman for Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn praised the rate cut as ``part of a rebalanced
European policy mix more supportive of growth and employment.''
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg insisted that the bank had not capitulated to
political pressure or changed its basic approach, which places top
priority on price stability. While lower rates can invigorate an
economy, they also can increase inflationary pressure.

   ``I want to deny that in any way we switched our monetary
policy,'' Duisenberg said. With inflation stable at less than 1
percent a year, he said, the bank now had the ``leeway'' to
stimulate the economy by lowering rates.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg also said he was not concerned by the euro's slide
against the dollar. Indeed, he said, based on the value of a
``synthetic euro'' _ a hypothetical currency made up of the 11
national currencies before the euro officially was introduced _ its
value is about the same as it was one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But most economists were skeptical that the rate cut will do
much to strengthen European growth, because the problems derive
more from structural issues within Europe, such as high taxes and
rigid regulations, and from declining exports to Asia, Russia and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth here was not weak because of high rates,'' said Mayer
of Goldman Sachs.

   DELL _ AUSTIN, Texas _ At its spring meeting with analysts in
New York, Dell officials say they'll continue to build on Dell's
fledgling relationship with IBM, but stop short of confirming some
analysts' speculation that it will take over IBM's personal
computer business. In the short term, they say, Dell will continue
to expand its personal computer business, server business and to a
lesser extent, its service business to continue to grow at rates
that are better than the industry. (Mahoney, Austin

 &HT;    GROUP CITES CHEMICAL WEAPONS RISK IN KOSOVO
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If U.S. and allied ground troops invade Kosovo,
they could face the threat of chemical weapons produced and stored
at facilities in Serbia, a scientific group warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Federation of American Scientists said it has confirmed the
existence of four facilities currently involved in the research and
development of chemical toxins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises the concern as yet unreported in the press that
(Yugoslavian President Slobodan) Milosevic may be planning to use
or threatening to use, as a last resort, chemical weapons in Kosovo
or in greater Serbia, especially if NATO ground troops enter the
conflict, which is becoming increasingly possible,'' the federation
said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Pentagon said, ``we don't have any
knowledge'' of the chemical weapons plants beyond news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The group identified sites in the Serbian towns of Baric,
Lucani, Krusevic, and Potoci. It said that the plants were
producing toxins such as sarin gas, mustard gas, and the vomiting
agent BZ in a weapons research program that dates back to the
1960s, when the region was controlled by a communist regime. Most
of the material is thought to be stored at Lucani.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited a 1991 Yugoslav public document which claimed
that the Yugoslav army had warheads with chemical weapons, a rocket
launcher system, and thousands of rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch, an international humanitarian group, first
reported on the chemical weapons facilities a year ago and
complained that U.S. officials were covering up the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kavanaugh, spokesman for the Federation of American
Scientists, said that his group followed up with an investigation
helped by intelligence sources, Bosnians and two technicians who
had worked at the weapons plants. He said that his group was
publicizing the facilities now because the risk has not been
included in the debate over NATO action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy situation, but with the talk of ground
forces, I'd like to see the government address it,'' Kavanaugh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kavanaugh said allied bombers could try to destroy the
facilities, but ``I don't think it could be done safely.'' He said
that he was concerned that ``inadvertent bombing may cause the
chemicals to leak to the civilian population.''

   NEWS REPORT ON SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM TRIGGERS CONGRESSIONAL
INVESTIGATION
</P>
<P>
   Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Montgomery and Elliot Jaspin
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service 1999
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Reports of possibly tainted food in the nation's
School Lunch Program have triggered a congressional investigation
into the Department of Agriculture's management of all federal
nutrition programs, Sen. Tom Harkin announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter, Harkin, D-Iowa, asked the General Accounting Office
to ``examine, with respect to the prevention of food borne illness,
the procurement practices and procedures used in acquiring meat and
poultry for these programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin took the action after a Cox Newspapers investigation into
an elementary school E. coli outbreak revealed the meat suspected
in the illnesses was purchased by the Agriculture Department from a
plant with a history of food safety violations. The Agriculture
Department donated the meat to the school for the School Lunch
Program.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve students at Finley Elementary School in rural Washington
fell ill within days of eating a taco lunch for which the donated
meat was used. Four of them required hospitalization 200 miles away
at Seattle's Children's Hospital, and one spent days on dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   State and local health officials concluded that the school's
taco lunch caused the illness, though tests of unused taco meat
failed to provide conclusive proof.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials knew the meat had been purchased by the USDA
from Northern States Beef in Nebraska as part of the federal lunch
program. But they didn't know the plant had been cited by federal
inspectors 171 times for critical sanitation violations in the 18
months before the purchase. Or that it had been linked to an E.
coli outbreak in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for ConAgra, the agribusiness giant that owns
Northern States, said that without scientific proof the plant can't
be blamed for the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Still, federal regulations require that the Agriculture
Department ``take into account'' such things as a plant's
sanitation history before allowing it to sell commodities to
federal nutrition programs. The Cox investigation found no such
evaluation was done of Northern States.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Harkin called the revelation that a plant with a
history of contamination violations could sell meet to the School
Lunch Program ``shocking.'' He specifically asked the GAO to
investigate whether the Agriculture Department's purchasing system
``adequately takes into account'' histories of plants.
</P>
<P>
   USDA operates several nutrition programs that provide meat and
poultry to such things as the Emergency Food Assistance Program and
the Nutrition Program for the Elderly. In addition to providing
food for the needy, the programs also prop up commodity prices
because of the USDA's high-volume purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Solomon, a spokesman for the USDA, said the agency is proud
to provide the ``safest food supply in the world,'' and said they
look forward to the review to be done by the GAO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome any efforts to make it even better,'' he said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An urban flood advisory was issued Thursday for San Francisco as
moderately heavy rains, some punctuated by peals of thunder,
heralded the arrival of a potent jet stream disturbance from the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, bursts of heavy snow will accompany the system as it
swings slowly eastward across the southern Rockies. In its wake,
gusty winds from the west-northwest will buffet the deserts of
Arizona, kicking up sand and dust. High winds will then shift into
New Mexico and parts of west Texas as the system moves over the
Plains later Friday and Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will erupt in parts of Nebraska and
Kansas by Friday evening as the disturbance arrives overhead.
Though humid air was pushed southward into Texas Thursday night in
the wake of the low-pressure system that spawned severe weather
across the central Plains Thursday, Friday's storms in Kansas and
Nebraska may nonetheless reach severe levels, given the potency of
the system.
</P>
<P>
   Large hail and damaging wind gusts are possible. Farther south,
thunderstorms will develop across north Texas, east Oklahoma and
southwest Missouri later Friday or Friday night as returning humid
air from the Gulf of Mexico is lifted by the cold front associated
with the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms will develop from the upper
Ohio River Valley to the northern Middle Atlantic states as the
system that barraged the Plains Thursday forges eastward. Though
considerably weaker, this system will still have the capability of
generating isolated severe thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Fire Danger After Rain
</P>
<P>
   Despite morning rain across parched parts of eastern New York
state and western New England on Thursday, the danger from
wildfires rose dramatically in the afternoon. With little foliage
on trees and a lack of underbrush, the rain, which did not tally
one-tenth of an inch in any place, rapidly evaporated under full
sunshine that shone on forest floors. Moreover, dry afternoon winds
from the west averaging 15 to 30 miles an hour boosted rates of
evaporation, thereby heightening the risk of fire after morning
rain. Danger will remain high in these areas through much of the
weekend. &QL;

 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIMLA, India _ Their love was forbidden, and for three years
they furtively indulged it, meeting in the wheat fields at the
village's edge. Desh Raj was 23, Nirmala 17. The end of their lives
began on March 27, the day they eloped.
</P>
<P>
   The young man had made many mistakes, but surely one of the
bigger ones was to seek shelter in a nearby village with Pappu, his
brother-in-law. Pappu was appalled and ashamed. This was not a love
he could abide. He unmasked it.
</P>
<P>
   In two days, the couple were dead, their bodies mauled with
sticks and scythes by members of the girl's family. A huge crowd
watched the bloody spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Nirmala's body was carried on her father's shoulder to the
village's funeral pyre. Desh Raj's was dragged through the streets.
No chanting was done, no ritual spreading of herbs and sugar and
oils. The wood was hurriedly lit, the sooner to launch the bodies
into their graves of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter ran away, and our whole family was humiliated,''
Gansahi, the girl's mother, said a few days later. ``We killed her
to protect our honor.''
</P>
<P>
   She was kneeling as she talked, and sorrow filled her eyes. Her
husband and 14 other members of their extended family had been
arrested for the slaying. To Gansahi, this seemed an impossibly
unjust result for so understandable a killing.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, a man named Chandrabhan, was standing nearby and spoke
up in the family's defense. Like many people in Shimla, he uses
only a single name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened had the support of the village,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All societies have rules for love, including who is allowed to
marry whom. In India, the rules vary from region to region and even
village to village. In much of south India, the marriage of people
from the same village is commonplace. Weddings are often arranged
between first cousins.
</P>
<P>
   But Desh Raj and Nirmala lived in the north, here in Haryana
state, where the prevailing rule is that a husband and wife must
come from different villages.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the brick hovels and small ponds here in Shimla, this
requirement is especially important. Each caste in the village is
thought to belong to a single gotra, a clan descended from a common
male ancestor. No matter how distant that ancestry _ whether it
goes back 10 generations or more _ marriage within the gotra is
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a marriage is a crime against nature,'' said Inder Singh,
Desh Raj's older brother. ``A man and woman from the same gotra are
like brother and sister.''
</P>
<P>
   However secret the long romance, the couple's parents had their
suspicions. Such things are not spoken of freely within the
village, but Reshma, the young man's mother, said she had warned
the girl's parents a few times of the shame they all risked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easier to control a daughter than a son,'' Reshma said,
sure where the blame should be placed.
</P>
<P>
   When Pappu, the brother-in-law, disclosed the couple's
whereabouts, word of the love affair raced through Shimla's
cobblestone alleys and rutted dirt roads.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the disgraced families were dalits, the lowest rung in
India's caste hierarchy, but punishing the couple was of concern to
nearly all 7,000 residents of Shimla.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting of the village council was convened. People left their
water buffalo lolling in the shallow ponds. They left their creaky
wooden carts. The council did not deliberate long. The judgment was
that Desh Raj would be exiled from Shimla for five years. Nirmala
could return, though presumably her parents would marry her off
outside the village and she would be gone as well.
</P>
<P>
   The news was taken to the couple, and the girl was taken home.
The young man brooded, and the brooding led him to liquor. Within
hours, he was drunk, witnesses said, and he too returned to Shimla.
He stood in the narrow lane outside Nirmala's front gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my wife!'' people recall him ranting.
</P>
<P>
   For more than an hour, he stomped and paced, always returning to
Nirmala's house ready with a fresh volley of invective.
</P>
<P>
   Another council meeting was called, but before it could begin
the girl's angry family had picked up handy weaponry to impose
their own death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Some here say Desh Raj's family agreed to this outcome, though
they deny that, and some wonder if the slaying of the girl was an
intended part of the blood lust or merely an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think after they killed the boy they may have realized: if
we don't kill the girl, people will think this is unjust,'' said
Rajinder Singh Mor, another of the village leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A constable's office was only a few miles away, but no one
reported the killings for 15 hours. The complaint finally was filed
by Desh Raj's family. They had been debating what to do, concerned
about bringing yet more shame to the village.
</P>
<P>
   ``We blame the girl,'' said Reshma, Desh Raj's mother. ``Why did
she go with him? It is always the girl who instigates these things.
And she knew this marriage could never be.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the couple may have deserved to die, she said, the killing
was done too quickly. It was like a lynching by a mob. ``Even when
you want to kill a dog, some people will oppose it,'' she said.
``But when my son was killed, no one cared.''
</P>
<P>
   Reshma's sons and daughters had crowded around her in the
family's two-room house. The air was heavy with heat. Flies danced
in every shaft of light.
</P>
<P>
   Reshma's husband, who is nearly blind, sat silently outside, by
a brick wall spotted with his son's blood. Ribbons of red also
stained the stone at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are under pressure from the village to drop our
complaint,'' Reshma said nervously. ``We are told the important
thing is that everyone live together in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Randhir Singh, the station house police officer in nearby
Kalait, said too much attention was being been paid to so small a
matter. Such vigilante justice is rare, but it does happen, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This couple was guilty of a social evil,'' the policeman said.
``But it is over now. The village has already taken care of it.''

DOUG'S FIRST MOVIE 
10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU 
EDTV
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doug's First Movie
</P>
<P>
   An animated film based on the ABC Saturday morning series
``Disney's Doug'' &QL; 
with the voices of Thomas McHugh, Fred Newman, Chris Phillips,
Constance Shulman, Frank Welker, others.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Maurice Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   Rated G.
</P>
<P>
   87 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Any movie that tries to link a Valentine's Day dance with a lake
monster has much ground to cover and this one bustles right along.
Doug Funnie, not so much a geek as a sweet guy, is sure he has
spotted something weird swimming around in Bluff Lake, the
principal body of water in the town of Bluffington and receptacle
for pollutants flowing from Bluffco Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Concomitant is the dance at the high school. Doug wants to help
plan the event as a means of getting quality time with the cute and
nice Patti Mayonnaise. A complicating element here is that Patti is
being pursued by Guy Graham, the breezily insolent editor of the
school paper, who is so cocksure of himself that he writes his
stories in advance of the events they report.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the monster turns out to be a cuddly big blue thing
grounded by the toxic soup. Doug names him Herman Melville and they
become friends. The media go crazy. Herman goes underground (or
under Doug's bed). Later he dons a blond wig and shows up as an
exchange student at school.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bluff, Bluffco's founder, chafes at the bad publicity and
determines to get rid of Herman. But Bill's weakness is his brash
daughter, Bebe. What Bebe says Daddy does, and later on little Bebe
will want Daddy to stop being such a jerk.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, though, Bluff enlists Guy Graham to help do in
Herman, but the editor telegraphs the plot by writing up the
results beforehand. Can Doug save his friend? And how is it going
with Patti?
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: A robot acts up but none too scarily. ``Violence is
only for those who have run out of good ideas,'' Doug says.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   Ages 3-8. This is truly a film for the littlest ones. The
situations are drawn simply enough to hold interest and
consistently bring guffaws.
</P>
<P>
   10 Things I Hate About You
</P>
<P>
   Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Larisa
Oleynik, Andrew Keegan, Larry Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Gil Junger.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   94 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare can't get a rest these days. Here he's at Padua High
School, near Seattle, for the taming of a teen-age shrew named
Katarina Stratford (Ms. Stiles).
</P>
<P>
   Kat is actually a headstrong girl who speaks plainly and has
little use for adolescent banalities. That gets her kicked out of
class a lot and makes her anathema with schoolmates, especially
boys, who don't rank highly in Kat's estimation and wouldn't
approach her on a bet.
</P>
<P>
   At home her aversion to the opposite sex is a relief to her
father, Walter (Miller), an obsessively protective obstetrician who
craves, as he puts it, ``the deep sleep of fathers whose daughters
aren't out being impregnated.'' But his no-dating policy distresses
Kat's sweet younger sister, Bianca (Ms. Oleynik), who would just
like to enjoy her teen-age airheadedness in peace and see a boy now
and then.
</P>
<P>
   Walter thinks he's slamming the door on that notion when he
agrees to let Bianca date if Kat dates. How likely is that? Even
the slightest possibility interests Cameron (Levitt), who is deeply
smitten by Bianca. In developments too convoluted to detail,
Cameron teams with a vain model (Keegan) to buy the services of a
roguish fellow named Patrick Verona ( Ledger). Verona's job is to
soften up Kat to the point where she will go out with him.
</P>
<P>
   Verona is rumored to have set a state trooper on fire. Like Kat,
though, he's really a decent person who finally wins her with a
boffo rendition of ``Can't Take My Eyes Off of You,'' which he
belts out over a public address system while being chased around
the football stadium by security guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet love renew thy force,'' someone says. Kat composes a
sonnet for Verona and the Stratford girls head out on big dates.
``No ritual animal slaughters,'' Walter warns. But other treachery
is ahead.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: There's some scuffling at the prom but nothing
serious.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: The subject is often referred to, and in a couple of
instances people are on the verge of indulging.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: A good amount.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   Under age 9? No.
</P>
<P>
   Ages 10-12? The language may be objectionable, but the film is
good clean fun, or clean enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ages 13 and up? This is their movie.

 UNDATED: their movie.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EdTV
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson, Sally
Kirkland, Martin Landau, Ellen DeGeneres, Rob Reiner, Dennis
Hopper, Elizabeth Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Ron Howard.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   120 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``The Truman Show'' opened the territory, but here's a
warmer, fuzzier comedy about taking an ordinary person and putting
his every move on television. Cynthia the programming executive
(Ms. DeGeneres) has the idea. ``Put a guy on TV and watch his head
roll down the highway,'' she says. He doesn't have to be any good.
In fact, it's better if he's bad.
</P>
<P>
   At first bad doesn't quite describe Ed Pekurny (McConaughey),
the good-looking if otherwise undistinguished 31-year-old video
clerk selected for the project. With cameras everywhere in his
life, Ed responds by scratching his erogenous zones when he wakes
up in the morning and recommending ``Smokey and the Bandit'' to
patrons at the store.
</P>
<P>
   The network is about to pull the plug. ``Yes, Whitaker, I know
they shoot horses,'' Cynthia tells her boss (Reiner). But hold on.
The country is getting hooked. Ed's loudmouth brother, Ray
(Harrelson), has a sensitive girlfriend named Shari (Ms. Elfman).
Soon she takes up with the gentle Ed, with cameras recording every
clinch.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the country doesn't like Shari, who gets a 71
percent disapproval rating in USA Today. Heartbroken, she removes
herself from camera range, or tries to.
</P>
<P>
   In parallel story threads, Ed's mother (Ms. Kirkland), her
companion (Landau) and Ed's estranged father (Hopper) get their
linen washed spectacularly before an enthralled nation. But Ed is
fed up and wants to quit. Trouble is, Whitaker won't let him.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: None.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Ed has a steamy tussle with a model (Ms. Hurley) on a
dining room table and there is some nudity.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: Much.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   Ages 3-9: Inappropriate for obvious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ages 10-12: The usual guidelines apply according to individual
rules and tastes. Keep in mind that for all the profanity and the
like, this is a down-to-earth movie about people who make some
interesting discoveries about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ages 13 And Up: Teen-agers are more than ready.

   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade) _ The Yugoslav government asserted
Thursday that ``peace has been restored in Kosovo,'' declared an
end to its military offensive and urged all refugees to return home

The government announcement said that under an accord between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the non-violent Kosovo
Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, ``a process of return of displaced

 Interesting proposition, but no sale  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Believing that one suit, one pair of shoes, one shirt and a
necktie are wardrobe enough for any practical man, I rarely darken
the doorway of a clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, though, I chanced upon a sale too attractive to pass
up. And it wasn't in a store at all, but right out in the open air.
</P>
<P>
   A man in a sidewalk stall was selling sleeveless shirts _ tank
tops, I believe they're called _ under a sign that said,
(ital)Exercise your constitutional right to bare arms.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``They're marked way down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far down?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Drastically,'' he said. ``It's a Proposition B morning-after
special.''
</P>
<P>
   I held one up for size, though with tank tops one size pretty
much fits all.
</P>
<P>
   On the front was the outline of a human figure, with a
bull's-eye in the middle, and the admonition, (ital)Ask questions
later.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The printing on the back said, (ital)A machine gun means peace
of mind.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' I told the man. ``I'm not wild about the
color.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean you're against freedom?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' I said. ``But I really don't care to make a
political statement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen,'' he said, ``you can't sit this one out on the
sidelines. You have to take a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   I could tell from the funny little shine in his eyes that he was
a man I wouldn't care to aggravate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your position on trench mortars and shoulder-fired
missiles?'' he wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell the truth, I really haven't thought that one
through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And how do you see Charlton Heston?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was Moses, you know. In `The Ten Commandments.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. I saw it 30 nights in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You must have loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, actually, after about the third or fourth time I
(ital)hated it!(end ital) It was 40 years ago, and I was staying in
a cheap pension in a poor little town in Spain. They were showing
it outdoors on the wall of a building across from my room, and it
went until 1 or 2 o'clock every morning. By the time that month was
over I knew the whole sound track _ every line. In English and
Spanish both. It cost me a lot of sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Moses was no pushover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A (ital)non sequitur(end ital) perhaps, but I certainly
wouldn't argue with you,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moses was no pushover, and neither is Charlton Heston. He sees
the danger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That Janet Reno and her minions will come into our homes and
places of business and confiscate the weapons that we need to have
if we're going to maintain a well-regulated militia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's where we part company,'' I told him, as gently
as I could. ``I just don't see Janet Reno coming to take away my
hunting gun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How about her minions?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Them either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I take it you voted against Proposition B.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How I voted is my business. Let's just say I did my duty as a
citizen, as I saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, then,'' he said, ``what about turkeys?''
</P>
<P>
   The shift from Janet Reno to turkeys threw me a little
off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild turkeys,'' he said. ``Will you be out there after them
this spring?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, yes, of course. I never miss a season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then maybe we'll run into each other in the woods,'' he said,
proving that people can disagree, even about big things, and still
find common ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I won't sell you a shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all right. The color's wrong anyway,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   And walked quickly on.

RESTAURANT OWNER IS HIGH ON `HOOF' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When Rod Anderson acquired the Hereford House
in 1987, he issued five W-2 forms for each position at the
restaurant. That's an average of five persons filling a single job
in a year. That's a lot of staff turnover.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 440 persons filled 250 positions at the original
location and the newer Leawood, Kan., location _ less than two
persons for each position.
</P>
<P>
   His turnover turnaround lies partly in the acronym HOOF, short
for Helping Others Obtain a Future.
</P>
<P>
   Some background: Restaurants are notorious for high turnover.
Some people make restaurant work a career, but many others use it
as an interim job while in school or training. Turnover of 200 to
300 percent a year is common.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson wanted to reduce turnover by improving incentives for
long-term and transient employees. He improved health- and
life-insurance benefits and provided 401(k) investment
opportunities for employees 21 and older who worked at the company
at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Then he focused on the transient employees _ typically students
working their way through school.
</P>
<P>
   Through his plan, Anderson last year contributed $38,000 to help
at least 30 employees pay for their education. Tuition
contributions are based on the number of hours worked, and the
amount increases with each year the student works for the company.
Contributions max out at $600 a semester, or $1,200 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Burak, a University of Missouri-Kansas City history
major, joined the plan four months after taking a Hereford House
job. She said it was the reason she applied there, and the reason
she's still there after three years.
</P>
<P>
   Community college students are finding that HOOF contributions
can cover their full tuition costs, Anderson said. Students who
pursue more expensive education or training _ he's had everything
from chiropractic to barber students _ still have a valuable
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The company benefits, too. The HOOF expense pays for itself by
keeping experienced workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experienced servers sell more food. Their bills average $1
higher per visit than those of inexperienced servers,'' Anderson
said. ``If the experienced server has 150 visits a week, averaging
$1 more per check, it doesn't take long to see why keeping
experience pays.''
</P>
<P>
   HOOF also helps attendance, he said. Because it reimburses
tuition based on hours worked, students ``tend to come to work
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have turnover, sure,'' Anderson said, ``but this
helps keep workers at least for the duration of their education.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateurs, like all service providers, compete for capable,
dependable help. Anderson thinks the program allows him to tap into
a pool of motivated student workers.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity has been word of mouth. But, as any business operator
knows, word of mouth is powerful. Five workers moved to the
Hereford House from another restaurant after one of them learned
about HOOF.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all in school and all still here,'' he said. ``When
they know they can get up to $1,200 a year from me, that counts for
something.''
</P>

DEPOSITIONS IN THE MICROSOFT CASE TO BE MADE PUBLIC  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The judge trying the antitrust case against
Microsoft Corp. is likely to find himself in the unusual position
later this month of reading articles about testimony in the trial
that has not yet been heard in court.
</P>
<P>
   That is one result of two orders Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
of U.S. District Court issued over the last week to comply with a
1913 law giving the public access to depositions taken in antitrust
cases.
</P>
<P>
   One order, issued on Wednesday evening, makes public transcripts
of more than 100 depositions taken by both sides over the last year
or so. Some have been entered into evidence in court, but many
others have not.
</P>
<P>
   These documents, tens of thousands of pages of testimony, will
be given to lawyers representing various news organizations,
including The New York Times, that petitioned the court for access
under the 1913 law. Copies of the depositions will also be given to
the government Printing Office, which will make them available to
those who pay a printing fee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a second order issued on April 1 allows members of
the public, including members of the news media, to attend when new
depositions are taken in the coming weeks in preparation for
rebuttal testimony, which will be heard in court beginning next
month. That means news organizations will be able to publish
articles about the testimony before any of it is entered into
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It also means that Jackson, who is trying the case without a
jury, may read about statements made in depositions that the
lawyers trying the case would rather not use in court because the
statements do not help their cases.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Jackson has heard only the excerpts from depositions
that lawyers have found useful to show him. He has indicated that
he does read some news articles about the case. He has referred to
news articles in questions he has asked witnesses or lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, citing the 1913 law, several news organizations
asked to be allowed to attend when Justice Department lawyers took
a deposition from Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman. Jackson
reluctantly agreed, but Microsoft appealed his ruling to the U.S.
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the appeals court upheld Jackson's ruling, and over
the following months the parties worked out the details of how the
depositions would be made public.

   &QL;  AND THEN THERE WERE TWO: PARK SERVICE BLAMES A PAIR OF BEAVERS
FOR TREE DAMAGE
</P>
<P>
   By Lisa Fine
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, April 8, -- Call them the Bonnie and Clyde of the
Blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   The Tidal Basin terrorizing beaver who officials thought had
acted alone in eating through four of the beloved cherry blossom
trees, and nearly gnawing down four others, is now believed to have
an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   A National Park Service officer spotted the couple yesterday as
they went for a swim together in the Tidal Basin. The pair had been
lying low, causing no further damage Wednesday night, following a
day of intense publicity about the tree-toppling spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a quiet night, but we are not out of the woods yet,''
said Julia Long, a National Park Service biology technician. ``Now
that we know there are two, which could mean the start of a colony,
we need to get them away from here and to a more appropriate
location.''
</P>
<P>
   The brazen beavers have eluded park officers for the last week
while enjoying a reign of terror on the celebrated trees at the
height of the Cherry Blossom Festival. The beavers have also eaten
through five white cedar trees -- one right in front of a National
Park Service office.
</P>
<P>
   Park Service officials yesterday hired Adcock Trapping Service,
a Maryland-based professional trapping service, for $1500 to
humanely trap the beavers, said park service spokesman Earle
Kittleman.
</P>
<P>
   The trappers will likely begin work Monday. Officials hope to
catch the beavers in a trap that looks like a suitcase opened on
its side, by luring them in with some branches -- not from cherry
blossom trees.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers typically mate for life, and start colonies, which
produce dams in waterways. They eat tree bark, and use the trees to
build their dams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about the trees and the beaver both,''
Kittleman said. ``The beavers are not adversarial, they just need
to be moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Park officials have been trying to discourage the beavers by
encasing the gnawed tree trunks in wire mesh, so they can't finish
the job. Each time a beaver topples a tree, it is quickly removed
and the stump is cut low. That way the beavers can't use the trees
to build a dam.
</P>
<P>
   To park service officials who have tried to balance the desire
to protect the trees and the wildlife, the beaver situation has
been particularly taxing.
</P>
<P>
   The trees, a gift from Japan in 1912, attract thousands of
tourists to Washington D.C., when the pink and white flowers
blossom in the Spring. The trees were at the peak of their full
bloom this past week, when the beavers struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beavers live near water and eat trees, which makes the Tidal
Basin an appealing and beautiful home,'' Long said. ``But the trees
happen to be cherry blossoms.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Managed health care plans and the Medicare program have had some
success slowing growth in spending for doctors, hospitals and home
care agencies. But managed care has been much less successful
reining in spending on new life-enhancing medical devices and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in technology _ from laser treatments to the latest
surgical procedures with miniature instruments _ are one of the
main reasons for the re-acceleration in the overall costs of health
insurance, after several years of slow or zero growth. Sales of new
medical devices in the United States rose 30 percent the last five
years, outpacing the 22 percent rise over all in health care
spending and all other categories except prescription drug sales,
which were up 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``About half the growth in real per-capita health costs is
associated with medical technology'' including advances in
procedures and drugs, said Mark Freeland, deputy director of the
National Health Statistics Group in the Health Care Financing
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Increased medical costs were cited Thursday by Humana Inc., a
managed care company with 6.2 million members, as it announced that
its first-quarter earnings would fall below Wall Street's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, many of the new procedures are promoted as
reducing costs: a $3 million laser device that provides an
alternative to brain surgery can pay for itself by reducing the
costs that surgical procedures and lengthy hospital recoveries
would have previously required. But health plans are finding that
over all, technology costs are surging, in large part because the
new procedures are more available or more attractive to more people
_ fostering a demand that insurers cannot stem.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who are hesitant about traditional open surgery, for
example, will eagerly agree to minimally invasive procedures with
miniature instruments to repair heart valves or remove defective
gall bladders.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern was clear at Health Partners, a big, nonprofit
Minnesota health maintenance organization. In only two years, from
1996 to 1998, the HMO counted double-digit growth in the number of
procedures for every thousand members in eight categories,
including some of the most expensive: brain and nervous system
procedures, heart and artery surgery, orthopedics like hip and knee
replacements and organ transplants. Premature infants were another
big-ticket item.
</P>
<P>
   At Children's Hospital in Minneapolis, where many patients are
tiny premature babies, ``there has been a technological explosion
and a tremendous increase in survival rates and the good news is,
we did not have an increase in extremely damaged children,'' said
Dr. Ronald Hoekstra. But with the advances, he added, costs are
bound to go up.
</P>
<P>
   One of Hoekstra's patients, Simon Hagman, a strapping 30-pounder
who celebrated his third birthday late last month, has already made
a personal contribution to the economics of high technology health
care. Health Partners, his family's plan, spent $1.2 million on
life-saving care for Simon, whose birth only 22.5 weeks after
conception was dangerously premature.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, born weighing 1 pound, 4 ounces and only 12 inches in
height, lived for 14 months in the neonatal unit at Children's
Hospital. With the help of sophisticated procedures and technology,
he overcame three heart attacks, several bouts of pneumonia and a
threat of blindness. He went home, with 24-hour nursing, still
dependent for a time on an oxygen system that augmented his
miniature lung power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miraculously, Simon survived without brain damage,'' said his
mother, Tracey Hagman.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years ago, there would have been small hope for an
infant with Simon's precarious medical profile. For premature
babies with severe problems who did qualify for the less-advanced
treatments available then, the medical charges were about $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new drugs and procedures were welcomed as essential to
excellent care. ``It's the right thing to do, but it's very
expensive,'' said George Halvorson, chief executive of Health
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, our premiums are going to go up, and people are
going to have to pay more for care,'' he added. There were 345
cases in 1998 on which Health Partners spent $50,000 or more. That
was more than double the number in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While some experts say the spread of managed care will slow the
introduction of advanced devices, that is clearly not the case at
many HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extraordinarily difficult for HMOs to put up barriers
for care that is valuable,'' said Michael Chernew, a health
economist at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Most big managed care plans rely on advice from panels of
medical experts to recommend acceptance or rejection of new
technology. For example, a Blue Cross advisory panel endorsed a
number of new developments last year, but the group determined that
a heavily marketed new electron beam CT scanner was not as
effective in diagnosing heart disease as the older methods, said
Dr. Alan Garber, a professor of medicine at Stanford University who
is a member of the the panel. Such panels appraise the scientific
value of products and procedures; insurers typically weigh the
recommendations as well as cost-effectiveness in deciding whether
to approve the innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the advanced devices are big and complicated. Among the
most popular are stents, the tiny metal tubes that prop open
clogged blood vessels. In part because of new competition that cut
the price, sales of stents exploded last year to $1.4 billion, up
40 percent from 1997, said Vivian R. Wohl, a health care securities
analyst with Merrill Lynch. Sales of implantable defibrilators,
which shock faltering hearts, rose 20 percent, to $1.2 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other new products are in demand: a roboticly assisted gamma
knife to attack tumors deep inside the brain, lasers to improve
vision by sculpting corneas, ultrasensitive blood oxygenators to
keep premature infants alive and inch-long metal spinal implants to
relieve back pain.
</P>
<P>
   And there is much more to come. Medical devices still being
tested include one to position a functioning heart in what is
called beating heart surgery; minimally invasive devices to thwart
blood clots and prevent strokes, advanced insulin pumps that
continuously adjust to changes in a diabetic's blood sugar; devices
that use microwaves, lasers or ultrasound to treat enlarged male
prostate glands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see a flood of these things,'' Garber said.
``Most of these new technologies do contribute something to improve
health,'' he added. ``But the cost pressures are enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Health care costs, to be sure, are rising for a number of
reasons, including an aging population. While the cost pressures of
many factors can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, technology
is a moving target, with some prices falling and the number of
sophisticated procedures rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the biggest impacts are not clear until years after a
procedure is introduced, as it gets better and physicians find more
uses for it,'' said Paul B. Ginsburg, president of the nonprofit
Center for Studying Health System Change in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And a new procedure can often be used by a larger pool of
patients than before, raising overall costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get better at doing a procedure, through experience,
you are willing to do it on older people and frailer people, as
happened with coronary bypass grafts,'' said Joseph Newhouse, a
health economist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Bypasses were also improved in ways that made them more
expensive. ``The product in 1999 is not what it was in 1990,''
Garber noted. Defying expectations, the number of open heart bypass
surgeries kept on growing, even after a wildly popular alternative,
the angioplasty balloon-and-stent procedure to repair arteries,
took off, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking far out, there are some possibilities that new kinds
of technologies might be so powerful as to reduce the cost of
health care,'' said Stuart Altman, a Brandeis University professor
who is chairman of the Council on the Economic Impact of Health
System Changes, a nonprofit group supported by the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation. ``But for the next 5 to 10 years, if not
longer, the general consensus is that technology will continue to
increase health care spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, however, studies have shown that some of the latest
drugs and devices can save money. Last month, scientists at the New
York University Medical Center said that patients who required
surgery for defective heart valves spent four fewer days in the
hospital after a minimally invasive procedure, compared with
traditional open chest surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And in brain surgery, 45 American hospitals and surgery centers
have purchased $3 million gamma knife systems, which use radiation
instead of a risky cutting procedure to zap tumors.
</P>
<P>
   One patient, Joseph Keenan, had put off surgery for years on a
tumor that was interfering with his hearing and balance. Keenan,
55, a professor of family medicine at the University of Minnesota,
finally had the procedure done about a year ago with a gamma knife.
</P>
<P>
   He checked into the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., at 5 a.m.,
had the procedure and was sent home by 10 the same morning. Two
days later, he flew to China for a long-scheduled lecture tour and
a round of golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
   At Health Partners, new devices are screened by expert
committees in each area, said Dr. George Isham, chief health
officer of the Minnesota HMO. The gamma knife reviewers, for
example, included a brain cancer specialist from Mayo, a radiation
oncologist and a brain surgeon from the University of Minnesota, a
brain surgeon from the Park Nicollet Clinic, a big Twin Cities
medical group, and a neurologist from Health Partners' own medical
group.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing scientific reports, the experts concluded that
the knife was effective. The HMO then decided to pay for the
procedures, Isham said.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which pioneered
gamma knife surgery in the United States, Dr. L. Dade Lunsford said
that studies had shown an ``enormous return on the initial
technological investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunsford, who is chairman of neurosurgery, said the gamma knife
was increasingly used to destroy hearing-nerve tumors like
Keenan's. Typically not cancerous, they are a problem for 2,000
Americans each year.
</P>
<P>
   Patients return to work in days instead of months, he said.
Complications are rare and the need for additional surgery has been
eliminated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total cost of traditional surgery was $30,000,'' he said.
The charge for Keenan at Mayo was $18,000, paid by Health Partners.
</P>
<P>
   As for Simon Hagman, the premature baby, he is ``very well
nourished and improving with time,'' said Hoekstra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can put a price on a life,'' Simon's mother
said. ``It was worth every dollar spent.''

 &HT;    WESTERN POWERS RUSHING IN RATIONS FOR 500,000 EXILES WHO MAY
STAY IN ALBANIA
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service (at)

<P>
   RINAS AIR BASE, Albania Nearly overwhelmed by refugees from
Kosovo, the Western powers and aid agencies on Thursday were
rushing in food to sustain up to half a million ethnic Albanian
exiles who they fear may land permanently inside this poor and
lawless country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I am down to a 36-hour supply of rations,'' said
Ramiro Lopes-DaSilva, the chief of logistics for the U.N. Food
Program, the main agency that is keeping the 280,000 Kosovo
refugees already in Albania from starving.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the U.N.'s stockpiled rations in Albania
dwindled toward exhaustion. Then at noon last Saturday, NATO
launched a military special operation from Ramstein Air Base,
Germany, aimed at airlifting hundreds of tons of ready-to-eat meals
to replenish the U.N. stockpiles before hunger set in.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 48 hours, NATO military transports and chartered
jets have been landing or taking off about every 15 minutes at this
former Albanian Air Force fighter base, hauling in 107 tons of
emergency rations from U.S. military depots in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Huge Albanian commercial flatbed trucks rolled onto the runway
every few hours and the crates were hoisted aboard by olive-painted
forklifts operated by U.S. troops from NATO bases in Europe. Most
of the trucks headed off for the 10-hour road trip to the largest
concentration of Kosovo refugees, spread out at a string of
makeshift camps near Kukes in northeast Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Lopes-DaSilva, a veteran of U.N. emergency refugee relief crises
from Rwanda to Angola, estimated that the 107,000 daily rations
flown in by NATO will feed the masses of Kosovo refugees in Albania
for only about 18 hours. More food is en route to Albania by ship
and air.
</P>
<P>
   With rain and lightning expected for the next three days, aid
workers were making emergency plans to rush supplies to a new
cluster of 14,000 Kosovo refugees who suddenly materialized
overnight in a remote border region of southern Albania, near the
town of Korce.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said they had been transported to Korce by
authorities in the neighboring Serb-majority nation of Macedonia,
whose politically shaky government has decided to close several
temporary transit camps rather than grant permanent sanctuary to
Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Another 20,000 Kosovo refugees were expected to cross on
Thursday into Korce from Macedonia, and the number from Macedonia
could ultimately reach ``just less than 100,000,'' Lopes-DaSilva
said.
</P>
<P>
   For several hours Thursday, three Swiss helicopters sat idle
next to a runway, with crates of American ready-to-eat meals
stacked on pallets waiting to be transported to Korce for the new
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In the early afternoon, U.N. officials were forced to scrub the
Korce flights, probably until Friday. Western officials at the air
bus said top Swiss military authorities in Tirana and Switzerland
had not approved a U.N. request for the flights and were checking
on the safety of flying to a potentially hostile border region.
</P>
<P>
   One source of unease about helicopter flights to Korce is that
the refugees were clustered very close to the Macedonian frontier.
A NATO colonel waiting by the runway said that the Korce landing
zone may be within the range of SA-7 and SA-14 shoulder-mounted
anti-aircraft missiles thought to be in the hands of Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   As the numbers in Korce swelled, another stream of terrified
ethnic Albanian refugees was entering Albania by crossing south
across the border from Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 refugees a day have been leaving Montenegro, the
semi-autonomous province of Serbia whose fragile democratic
government has been shaken by rumors of a military coup engineered
by Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always did expect some spillover from the conflict in
Kosovo, but the stocks have been depleted much faster than we
expected. Right now, we are working on a worst-case scenario of
having to feed half a million refugees here in Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, the UN Food Program had stockpiled enough food
in and near Albania to feed 200,000 Kosovo refugees for one month,
he said. But optimism surrounding the American-engineered
Rambouillet peace conference in February led the U.N. to slash its
stockpile dedicated to a potential Kosovo crisis. By the time the
Rambouillet talks collapsed, the U.N. Food
</P>
<P>
   Program had stockpiles to sustain just 60,000 refugees for one
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we got it all wrong, and our stockpile went
down much faster than expected,'' said Lopes-DaSilva.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Air Force Col. Clifford Bray, a military special ops
veteran who was dispatched here from Germany last weekend to
oversee the airlift, expressed apprehension Thursday that bustling
air traffic at this lightly defended air bus could attract the
attention of Serb commandos or anti-American terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albania is one of the highest terrorist threat environments in
the world,'' said Bray in an interview. ``We feel it is almost a
critical situation from a terrorist perspective, and we are taking
aggressive steps to increase security.''
</P>
<P>
   As food crates were being unloaded, U.S. Air Force troops were
also busy preparing to ring the air base with stronger fences,
obstacles against truck bombers and shields against snipers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is, among other things, a sizable criminal element in
some regions,'' said Bray. ``We have some evidence that they are
already observing us.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most tangible concerns, said one senior NATO officer
at the base, is that the Saudi revolutionary Osama bin Laden is
reported to have active affiliates in Albania's mafia-plagued
northern regions. Bin Laden is the accused mastermind of last
year's American embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby Albanian capital Tirana, meanwhile, international
aid chiefs also expressed worries about thousands of missing
Kosovar Albanians who had been fleeing Serbian police and military
actions inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 60,000 to 70,000 fleeing Kosovar Albanians had been
trapped in a no man's land in Kosovo, outside the Macedonian
border. After urgent pressure from NATO and from United Nations'
relief agencies, the Macedonians began transporting the refugees
into camps mostly in Albania on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can account for between 50,000 to 55,000 of these people,''
said Nicholas Morris, special envoy to the region for the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   His agency is investigating what happened to the missing
refugees and holds ``the greatest concern for anybody who was
actually expelled back into Kosovo,'' Morris said at a news
conference in Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day the border crossing in Kukes in northern
Albania was closed on Thursday, and relief officials have expressed
fears that fleeing refugees were turned back there to be used as
human shields to stop NATO bombing in Yugoslavia.

 &HT;    TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES SAID TO DISCOURAGE RECYCLING
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    With attached fact box
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The recycling movement in America is being hindered
by government subsidies and tax breaks for industries whose
products compete with recycled materials, a coalition of tax reform
advocates, environmentalists and recycling groups charged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And other taxpayers are picking up the tab to the tune of $2.6
billion every year, says a report issued by the GrassRoots
Recycling Network, Friends of the Earth, Taxpayers for Common Sense
and the Materials Efficiency Network.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Welfare for Waste,'' called for elimination of tax
breaks and subsidies for the timber, mining and energy industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting these federal taxpayer subsidies for timber, mining
and energy will save taxpayers $13 billion over the next five years
and is essential to leveling the playing field for recycling
businesses,'' said Bill Sheehan, coordinator of the GrassRoots
Recycling Network, a group based in Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Annual federal support for timber, mining and energy industries
totals $811 million, $496 million and $1.3 billion, respectively,
the report charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is real money to real people who pay taxes,'' the report
said. ``While the dollar level may seem relatively small, that kind
of preferential economic treatment is immensely significant when
compared to its potential impact on the much smaller recycling and
reuse industries.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of all used materials furnished to recycling
manufacturers has ranged from $16 billion to $19 billion a year for
several years, the critics of the subsidies and tax breaks said.
Thus, the purported $2.6 billion in subsidies to competing products
is worth roughly 15 percent of the value of the recycling
industry's feedstocks.
</P>
<P>
   The tax breaks and subsidies have been attacked for years by
environmentalists and taxpayer advocacy groups. They are defended
by the favored industries on a variety of grounds, including the
preservation of American jobs, maintaining energy independence and
protection of vital industries.
</P>
<P>
   The report released Thursday is the first to relate the
controversial provisions to efforts to encourage recycling in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing owners of timberland to pay capital gains taxes on
their timber sales, rather than the higher federal income taxes,
costs other taxpayers an average of $635 million a year, the report
said. In addition, so-called ``below cost'' federal timber sales
cost an estimated $111 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only slightly more than 40 percent of the paper discarded in
the United States is recycled,'' the report stated. If wood
products were not subsidized, recycled paper would be more
competitive, the four groups said.
</P>
<P>
   Recycled aluminum consumes 95 percent less electricity than
aluminum smelters. However every ton of newly smelted aluminum is
the beneficiary of a $200 government subsidy in cut-rate power that
the Bonneville Power Administration provides aluminum smelters --
and every other power customer in its service area.
</P>
<P>
   The report also charged that petroleum depletion allowances,
passive loss tax shelters, special tax credits for ethanol and
other ``alternative fuels'' and other government breaks give the
petroleum-consuming virgin plastics industry an unfair advantage
compared to recycled plastics.
</P>
<P>
   The report is available for free on the Internet (after 9 AM EDT
April 8th) at http://www.grrn.org, or in printed form for $10
(including shipping and handling) from the GrassRoots Recycling
Network, P.O. Box 49283, Athens, GA 30604-9283.

N.H. SENATE OK'S MLK HOLIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ New Hampshire has moved closer to joining the
other 49 states by honoring slain civil rights leader Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. with a holiday bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 19 to 5, the Democrat-controlled state Senate
passed legislation Thursday that would add King's name to the Civil
Rights Day the state celebrates on the third Monday in January. The
bill now goes to the more conservative House, which has stopped
similar Senate bills three times.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, the measure's backers are more optimistic of
victory than at any time since the bill was introduced in 1979. In
1997, the move to add King's name to the holiday failed by one vote
in the 400-member House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on a one-vote loss two years ago and based on the
polling that's being done we think there's a majority,'' said
Arnold Alpert, president of the Martin Luther King Day committee
that has lobbied for the holiday for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King Day became a federal holiday in 1986. In
1992, Arizona adopted the holiday, leaving New Hampshire as the
only state that did not celebrate it.
</P>
<P>
   That has brought nationwide attention. In 1996, a
Mississippi-based white supremacist group held a rally on the State
House steps to applaud the state for its solitary stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, when the Boston (sic) Patriots were thinking
about a new home, I called Bob Kraft in his office and talked to
him about moving his team to New Hampshire,'' Senate President
Clesson Blaisdell told his colleagues moments before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the questions he asked me was: `How, senator, do you
believe the black players on the Boston (sic) Patriots would like
playing in the state of New Hampshire, which doesn't recognize
Martin Luther King Day?'.'' Blaisdell said.
</P>
<P>
   The long fight has meant that the King holiday, if it comes,
will be even more meaningful, Alpert said. ``But as Jim Splaine,
the representative who first sponsored the bill in 1979 says, New
Hampshire won the race to be last, and now it will always have that
distinction,'' he said.

SEN. GREGG PUTS IN A GOOD WORD FOR GEORGE W. BUSH JR. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush Jr. plans to visit New Hampshire as soon as the
Texas Legislature adjourns for the year, and will campaign with the
kind of personal interaction that every other presideneital
candidate must demonstrate in the state, according to New Hampshire
Senator Judd Gregg.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to show people he wants to win and is willing to
get in the fray and mix it up,'' said Gregg, who has taken a
leading role in the Texas governor's campaign in the Granite State.
``That means going out and meeting people on Main Street and
letting people ask him questions and hear his responses.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said he decided to endorse Bush earlier than usual.
Indeed, Bush has not formally announced that he is running for
president yet. But Gregg said the frontloaded primary process has
made New Hampshire more important than ever, and requires more
campaigning and organizing earlier than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize we're a good distance behind many of the other
candidates in the state,'' said Gregg, mentioning Patrick J.
Buchanan in particular. ``We're going to run a grass-roots effort
and we're going to run an aggressive campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Bush acknowledged that he is getting a late
start compared to many of the other Republican candidates. ``Yet
winning Senator Gregg's endorsement brings great credibility to my
exploratory effort,'' said Bush. ``I am greateful for his support
and I look forward to visiting New Hampshire early this summer once
I have completed my work in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Thursday said he has written to Republican activists
across the state urging them to elect Bush as president.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Gregg, the letter was signed by former governor Steve
Merrill, Executive Councillor Ruth Griffin, former Republican party
assistant chair Barbara Russell, and Rob Thompson, who was
grass-roots chairman for Merrill's 1992 campaign.

   TIRANA, Albania _ The Bllaca family was dining on pasta and
beans when the masked Serbian policemen kicked in the kitchen door
of their home in Kosovo, jamming the butt of a rifle into Mehdi
Bllaca's head.
</P>
<P>
   All the neighboring villages had been emptied, so a sense of
foreboding had been hanging over their dinner table. Every 15
minutes, a Serbian patrol car glided ominously by their house, in
Dushanova. They could barely converse. When would it be their turn?
</P>
<P>
   The moment, when it came eight days ago, was rapid-fire. Blood
streamed down Bllaca's forehead, his elderly mother screamed, his
wife and children threw down their spoons and in minutes they fled
the land their family had lived on for 40 years. They were too
scared to take one final look back before the wooden house they had
built with their own hands burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to count the steps to the Albanian border, to see how
many it would take to get back home,'' Fatmira Bllaca, 25, said
Thursday. ``My brothers and sisters told me, `Let's save our lives
first. Let's go forward.' I stopped counting at 4,000. We walked
for 10 more hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Bllaca swept the dirt in front of her family's new home _
Tent No. 40 in the main refugee camp in Tirana _ with a brush
fashioned from pine needles. Under a brilliant midday sun, she laid
out a blanket for a lunch of donated bean soup and bread. And then
she summoned her parents, her grandmother, two sisters and three
brothers _ ``Lunch is served!'' _ to gather with plastic spoons
around a tin pot.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week's time the Bllacas (pronounced BLAH-tza), like
many others, have found the strength to adapt to their terrible new
reality. Their village, Dushanova, has reconstituted itself inside
the tent city; they have decorated their tent with blankets. It is
a far cry from their 15-acre property in Kosovo, from their
gardens, their cows and their family history.
</P>
<P>
   They have convinced themselves that their displacement is
transitory; within a month, they will be home, they said, or at
least back at the charred remains.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the Bllacas and their neighbors lined up to have their
photographs taken for new identity cards; their old ones were
issued by Serbs so they were glad to be rid of them, they said. The
men, sitting on army cots, sipped espresso from tiny china cups.
The children played soccer inside an empty, cracked swimming pool.
The women scrubbed clothes in a fetid fountain, gossiping.
</P>
<P>
   Seven days ago, Miss Bllaca trekked to the Albanian border,
fearful that the forced march would end in their slaughter. ``We
thought maybe our journey would end in a mass grave,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs who lined the road were pulling out young men and
roughing them up, so she and her sisters formed a human circle
around their brother, Miftar, 17, to hide him. It made the arduous
trip incredibly awkward, too.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, her freshly washed hair piled atop her head with a
bandana, Miss Bllaca read a novel by Ismail Kadare, a leading
Albanian writer. Her smallest brother, Valon, who is 10 and a
gifted artist, sketched by her side. She admired his effort: he had
really captured the tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel free today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Fatime, 47, said: ``For the last two years, we were
not free in our house or in our town. I was afraid every time my
oldest boy left home. The Serbian police would gesture to him,
twisting their hands, like they were ripping his head off.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Bllaca returned with news that clouded their
faces: no word yet about his oldest daughter, a university student
studying medicine, whose whereabouts are unknown. She was at school
when the family was chased from their town, and they do not know
where she is or if she is alive.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Outside their tent, just when they were starting to feel anxious
again, there were screams. ``A snake! A snake!'' people shouted. It
was the third one of the day, and the refugees smashed it dead with
rocks. In the Bllaca house, the uplifted mood was broken.
</P>
<P>
   Selvie Bllaca, who is 68 but looks much older, dropped her face
in her hands. ``What are we going to do?'' she moaned. ``Maybe God
will help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only God and Clinton can save us,'' Bllaca said. ``All we have
now are our bare hands, and they are not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the Bllacas lived a life firmly rooted in their
family land. They grew most of their own food and drank milk from
their cows.
</P>
<P>
   Bllaca had worked in a state shoe factory for 23 years, until
Kosovo lost its autonomy in 1989 and all the ethnic Albanians were
fired, losing their pensions. He started a small shoemaking
business, operating in his own house. All his neighbors became
similar businessmen, if they were clever enough.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 of the 800 families in their village were Serbian,
but the Serbs were the authorities. They taxed them for everything,
Bllaca said. They closed school buildings, and many of the Bllaca
children studied in makeshift schools organized by neighbors in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Bllaca became a seamstress, a ``housegirl,'' she said, who
was not nearly as independent as her older sister, the university
student. Miss Bllaca would never go to a discotheque, she said; she
was not educated enough, and the others would look down their noses
at her.
</P>
<P>
   Her younger sister, Shpresa, 19, had hoped to become a medic,
but the Serbs would not let Albanian students intern at the
hospitals or on ambulances, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bllaca's business proved successful. Two years ago, the
family built a new house, two stories with 10 rooms, wood-paneled
with wall-to-wall carpeting that was white with a floral border.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've done, all I've saved for in 30 years, was taken away
from me,'' Bllaca said Thursday. ``It's a huge disaster. What I
achieved I will never have again. I created a good situation for
everyone in the family. Every month, I gave my oldest daughter
money for school. Now I don't know if I have an oldest daughter
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the family's life was oriented toward Albania. They
watched Albanian television, listened to Albanian radio, and read
Albanian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always wanted to come to Albania, too,'' Miss Bllaca said.
``But not like this.''

BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF GUCCI HEATS UP AS COMPANY REJECTS OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Gucci Group NV rejected a sweetened
takeover offer Thursday from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the
French luxury-goods company, intensifying one of Europe's most
bitter takeover battles.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH, which is headed by Bernard Arnault, raised its offer on
Wednesday to $85 a share from $81, a 9 percent premium to
Thursday's closing price of 71.75 euros, or $78, in Amsterdam. But
Gucci, which is headed by Domenico De Sole, contended that the new
offer, worth $8.3 billion, was ``unacceptable'' because it would
undermine independent shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci's action sets the stage for a new round of court battles
in Amsterdam. Gucci is based in the Netherlands for tax purposes
but has most of its operations in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to remain free of Arnault and LVMH, Gucci sold a 42
percent stake last month to one of Arnault's biggest rivals,
Francois Pinault, head of Pinault-Printemps-Redoute.
</P>
<P>
   On March 22, an Amsterdam court ordered Gucci and LVMH to
negotiate. Arnault had not originally sought to acquire all of
Gucci, but after Gucci's deal with Pinault he came back with a bid
of $81 a share for the entire company.
</P>
<P>
   Now the fight amounts to a three-way struggle between Gucci,
LVMH and Pinault. In its latest offer, LVMH proposed offering $85 a
share for Gucci if the deal included the newly issued stock that
Pinault bought for $75 a share several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Pinault, who owns several luxury brands including Yves Saint
Laurent, does not want to sell and probably has enough shares to
retain effective control of Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, LVMH proposed that Gucci issue millions of new
shares that would essentially dilute Pinault's voting power. LVMH
executives argue that their offer is the only one that gives
ordinary shareholders a fair price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LVMH proposals would have enabled shareholders to access
the only control premium that has been proposed to them to date,''
the company said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   De Sole of Gucci, in an interview, insisted that he negotiated
in good faith with LVMH and simply wanted an ``unconditional''
offer for all the shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything we could to make this transaction fair for
LVMH, but we cannot accept a conditional offer,'' De Sole said. The
LVMH proposal would violate Gucci's agreement with Pinault, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnault is now heading back to the Amsterdam court, which is
scheduled to review the entire situation once again on April 22. &QL;

PLENTY OF FANS WATCHING WRESTLING ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about perplexing choices. It's almost impossible to say
which is more amusing: pro wrestling, or the people who see it as a
neon sign of the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, let's go with wrestling, if only because the
people who worry themselves silly over it have already had their
say in every publication on the planet, except maybe Food &AMP; Wine.
And you can bet Food &AMP; Wine is hanging fire for the day when some
rassler named The Great Gewurztraminer threatens to decant his
opponents with the flying corkscrew of death. As soon as it
happens, those wacky oenophiles will be on it like spandex on a
Nitro Girl.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling, the faux kind, has been around since the beginning of
time, which occurred around the late 1940s. Some years later, after
evolution and the invention of the remote-control device, a female
comedian observed that the only reason men like to channel-surf is
to increase their odds of finding a station that shows naked women
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution is still under way, so we don't yet have the Bare
Bimbos Brawling Network. But we're close. USA Network, home of
Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation, has been known to
include a medley of popular thongs in its World Wrestling
Federation telecasts. Such cheekiness is one of the things that
sets the WWF apart from World Championship Wrestling, the tamer
entry in the grappling galaxy. WCW is a Ted Turner enterprise (seen
on both TNT and TBS), and while Ted seems to like his cheesecake as
much as the next mouth-breathing couch potato, he does have
standards. WCW's answer to the WWF's nearly bare babes are the less
revealing but no less buxom Nitro Girls.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suggesting that pro wrestling has standards is like arguing
that the Mariners have the pitching to go all the way. After all,
it's an enterprise built on violence, sex, violence, bad acting and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone needing confirmation just has to watch the tube. On
Monday nights alone, there are five hours of flying knee drops,
reverse eye gouges and belly-to-belly suplexes filling the screen.
Never mind that it seems inadvisable to have a belly-to-belly
suplex done on an outpatient basis. This is not Ozzie Nelson coming
into your living room. More like his odd cousin, Full, and Full's
half-brother, Half.
</P>
<P>
   For those requiring proof in the flesh, both the WWF and WCW
road shows arrive in the Northwest in the next week. WCW visits
Tacoma on Sunday and Yakima on Monday; the WWF stops in Seattle
Thursday and Vancouver, B.C., next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stone Cold Steve Austin and Sable, two of the WWF's
leading lights, won't make the trip here (Austin is slated to be in
Vancouver), connoisseurs of the movement _ we can't really call it
a sport, can we? _ aren't likely to be disappointed. Sunday's WCW
event at the Tacoma Dome will include Hollywood ``Hulk'' Hogan, Ric
Flair, Diamond Dallas Page and Goldberg, who looks a lot like the
governor of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of acolytes, anyone with a pulse knows the resurgence
of pro wrestling is one of the biggest pop-culture stories of the
'90s. The merchandising of manufactured celebrities like Austin,
whose falling out with WCW helped ``legitimize'' the WWF, has
created an enormous following among the masses, which in turn has
made the wrestling industry hotter than any high-flying stock that
has dot-com after its name.
</P>
<P>
   With other-worldly characters who satisfy America's insatiable
appetite for low-brow entertainment, the two organizations have
created programs that share the highest ratings on cable-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a parent who thinks it's OK for a young child to wear
a Steve Austin T-shirt with profanity splashed on its back deserves
a couple of vertical splashes from one of Austin's WWF colleagues,
a 400-pound piece of human furniture named Sexual Chocolate. Still,
it's a free country, where stupid parents can sit next to smart
ones and enjoy the cathartic release that audiences for millennia
have enjoyed wherever savvy promoters could provide a steady diet
of conflict, resolution, conflict, resolution, and maybe a little
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the end of our society, as the doomsayers fear?
</P>
<P>
   Not likely. But if it were, it would probably sell out in a
minute. And be available on pay-per-view.

N.H. HOUSE NEGOTIATES ANOTHER SCHOOL TAX PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N. H. _ Leaders of the 400-member N.H. House of
Representatives say they have reached bipartisan agreement on an
$825 million tax plan that will fund the state's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers, however, described the plan Thursday as a
starting point, something to bring to a negotiating conference
between the House and Senate. They do not see it as a final plan
likely to win approval from the Democratic Senate, Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen and ultimately the N.H. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Last December the court, in the so-called Claremont suit,
ordered the state to end its reliance on local property taxes to
pay for public education by April 1. The deadline passed and
lawmakers have yet to agree on a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fitch IBCA, an international bond rating agency,
Thursday placed $622 million in outstanding state bonds and $57.4
million in obligations issued by the city of Nashua on its
RatingAlert Negative list. The move is a warning that bond ratings
could be lowered, raising interest rates. Moody's Investor Services
made a similar move earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's plan, announced jointly by House Speaker Donna Sytek
and Minority Leader Peter Burling, relies on a smorgasborg of
unappetizing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The plan includes an increase in business taxes, a 2 percent tax
on all car sales, a 50 percent increase in the tax on the sale of
real estate, a 25-cent cigarette tax increase and the state's first
entertainment tax. That tax would be levied on everything from
video rentals and tickets to sporting events to golf greens fees
and health club memberships. Ski areas would be exempted.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are already predicting the plan will not pass. ``They
are willing to go anywhere just to get to a committee of
conference,'' said Rep. Frank Sapareto of Derry. ``There is
something in it for everyone to hate.''
</P>
<P>
   The House will hold hearings on the bill Friday, followed by a
vote early next week.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails, it will not have been the first. So far, the only
plans to have won any legislative approval have included what would
have been the state's first general income tax. With Shaheen
pledged to veto an income tax, however, it failed on its second
appearance in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Days later the House overwhelmingly rejected a plan that would
have raised money by, among other things, legalizing video slot
machines at race tracks and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Schools will stay open until the end of the school year,
although many districts are already unable to hire new teachers or
sign contracts with purveyors of school supplies, transportation
and other services.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Mark Joyce, a spokesman for the N.H. Association
of School Administrators said that if the fiscal impasse continues,
the state will violate a federal law that requires school districts
to make firm plans to provide summer programs for special needs
students by April 30. And that, said Joyce, could trigger a
class-action lawsuit.

COURT HEARS CASE AGAINST MINISTER ACCUSED OF GENOCIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A federal judge said Thursday that an elderly
former pastor from Rwanda is likely innocent of genocide and crimes
against humanity stemming from a brutal ethnic feud in his central
African homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing before a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court
of Appeals marked the latest round in a 2 1/2-year legal battle
pitting the Justice Department against former Attorney General
Ramsey Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Clark represents Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, 75, in his battle
against facing a United Nations war crimes tribunal in Tanzania
that is prosecuting suspects in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The case marks the first time the United States has arrested
someone on its soil to be turned over to an international tribunal
established by the U.N. Security Council, Clark told the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are setting a precedent that could be very dangerous,'' he
argued.
</P>
<P>
   He challenged the court to consider whether the United Nations
has the authority to establish a war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 71, the attorney general under President Lyndon Johnson,
said the tribunal was created illegally and that the United States
needed to have a congressionally approved treaty to warrant
surrendering his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribunal itself is illegal,'' Clark said. ``We have never
extradited anybody without a treaty _ to do so would threaten
liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana, who has stomach and throat problems, would likely
die behind bars if he were tried, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 20 years of hearing cases, you develop some instincts
and radar,'' Appeals Court Judge Robert Parker said from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am persuaded the probability is great you (Clark) represent
an innocent man,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court panel isn't deciding Ntakirutimana's
innocence, but whether it is legal for the United States to hand
him over and whether there is reason to believe he committed a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides believe the precedent-setting case is headed to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. tribunal charges that Ntakirutimana, the former head of
the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Rwanda, led attackers armed
with grenades, machetes and guns in April 1994 assaults on hundreds
of people who had fled into his church compound for safety.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rwanda was in the throes of a bloody feud between
the country's dominant ethnic groups, the Hutus and Tutsis, strife
that killed an estimated 500,000 and sent 2 million refugees
fleeing to neighboring nations. Most of those killed, including
those in Ntakirutimana's church, were Tutsis. Ntakirutimana is a
Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana was allowed to legally emigrate to the United
States later that year. He remains behind bars in Laredo, where he
has family, after his arrest by FBI agents in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors said the United States has an obligation to
enforce U.N. mandates and that there is more than enough evidence
to believe Ntakirutimana was involved in the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prosecute people who do terrible things,'' said Sara
Criscitelli, assistant director of the Justice Department's Office
of International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a terrible thing,'' Criscitelli said outside the
federal courthouse in San Antonio.

BEWARE TELEMARKETING CHARGES ON CREDIT CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE HADLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Read your credit card bill recently?
</P>
<P>
   You'd be wise to do so, say some Washington state consumers who
complain that their credit card companies are allowing businesses
to bill them without permission for goods they don't want.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card companies are providing key information they have
collected about you _ including your credit card number _ to
marketing firms.
</P>
<P>
   And savvy telemarketers are then using some of that information
to lure you into accepting ``trial memberships'' that many
customers don't realize they have agreed to until a $60 charge
shows up on their bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington state Attorney General's Office is so concerned
about the practice that it has begun an investigation of one
marketing firm _ BrandDirect Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers say the system has cost them money and, in some
instances, potentially their good credit rating.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Davis, a Vancouver, Wash., insurance agent, was surprised
recently when he opened his Traveler's Bank credit card bill and
found a lone charge of $59.95 for ``Outdoor Explorer Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Davis and his wife not recognize the club, they say
they never received any products or services from it.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle resident Dennis Petersen said in his complaint to the
Attorney General's Office that he was billed without his agreement
for Outdoor Explorer Club on his Chase Manhattan Bank Visa card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never buy anything over the phone and certainly not
something like this that I'd never use,'' Petersen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both Traveler's Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank produced audio
tapes indicating that Petersen and Davis' wife apparently agreed to
sign up for trial memberships.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say, because the company that markets both clubs,
BrandDirect Marketing, of Shelton, Conn., does not record the
entire conversation with consumers it calls.
</P>
<P>
   And David Medine, associate director for financial services at
the Federal Trade Commission, says that without hearing the entire
conversation, it is impossible to know whether consumers have been
duped.
</P>
<P>
   Medine said telemarketing companies sometimes tape only the
portion of the conversation confirming the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the misrepresentations occur off the tape,'' he said.
``You have to see the full nature of the transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant State Attorney General Dave Horn agreed. He finds it
``suspicious'' when only part of the phone call is taped.
</P>
<P>
   Horn said if a company's practices are determined to be
deceptive, the company could be sued under the state's Consumer
Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan spokeswoman Charlotte Gilbert-Biro says that the
bank approves BrandDirect's telemarketing scripts and spot-checks
calls.
</P>
<P>
   But even if a transcript contains the correct words, a sales
pitch can still create a false impression with consumers in the way
it is delivered by trained telemarketers, Horn says.
</P>
<P>
   BrandDirect Marketing General Counsel Stephen Geissler said it
was the company's policy not to talk to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The tape produced by Chase Manhattan included only the last part
of the conversation confirming Petersen's acceptance of a trial
membership.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, the telemarketer told Petersen that his membership
kit would arrive shortly and that he would receive ``quarterly
certificates worth $40 in gas at the station of your choice simply
for joining today.''
</P>
<P>
   The telemarketer continued, ``As I said, you'll have the next 30
days to use the service risk free. If you decide not to continue
your membership beyond the first 30 days, simply call our toll-free
number. Otherwise, we'll extend your membership privileges for a
full year and conveniently bill the $59.95 annual membership fee to
your Chase credit card account.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert-Biro, the Chase spokeswoman, said, ``It's a perfect
call. The offer was straight-forward. The customer clearly accepted
it. The rep didn't in any way pressure Mr. Petersen.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the transcript of the tape, a baffled Petersen
said, ``I guess I did OK it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Traveler's bank played the tape for Davis, he said it
sounded as if his wife had agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Why were these and other consumers so unaware of what they were
doing?
</P>
<P>
   The experience of one man who filed a complaint with the
Attorney General's Office provides one possible explanation.
</P>
<P>
   It suggests that the answer could lie in the ambiguous meaning
of ``trial membership'' and the fact that consumers haven't given
out their credit card number and therefore believe they haven't
agreed to be billed.
</P>
<P>
   What the consumers don't know is that BrandDirect Marketing
already has either their credit card number or the means to bill
their credit card without the number.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said when he called Traveler's Bank to inquire how Outdoor
Explorer Club could have billed his account without his agreement,
a supervisor there told him that ``Outdoor Explorer Club does
operate a little differently'' and as long as they ``make contact
with the home,'' they are allowed to automatically sign people up
unless people call to cancel.
</P>
<P>
   A ``trial membership'' that puts the burden on the consumer to
cancel _ known as a ``negative option'' _ is very lucrative for the
business offering it, said Gerri Detweiler, education adviser for
Debt Counselors of America, a non-profit Internet-based agency that
helps people get out of debt
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect this company as well as other companies make a lot
of money on people who didn't even realize they bought something,''
said Detweiler.
</P>
<P>
   The vendors who use negative option are correctly assuming that
many people will not notice the charge on their card or will not
remember to cancel it, Detweiler said.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that seemed to mystify and anger the complaining
consumers the most was how BrandDirect Marketing got their credit
card account numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan provides its cardholders' credit card numbers to
BrandDirect, Gilbert-Biro said.
</P>
<P>
   Traveler's Bank gives BrandDirect the name, address, and
telephone number of its cardholders, and after contacting the
cardholders, BrandDirect tells Traveler's which of those
cardholders are to be be billed.
</P>
<P>
   In its faxed response to inquiries from the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, Exxon said it gives vendors ``a portion of the
cardholder file.''
</P>
<P>
   Most card issuers tell consumers when they sign up for cards
that they'll receive promotions from the issuer or affiliated
companies. Cardholders who fail to notify the card-issuer in
writing that they do not want to receive promotions may end up
doing business, wittingly or unwittingly, with companies like
BrandDirect Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert-Biro of Chase Manhattan said the marketing practice is
widespread and legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was able to have the charge taken off his bill.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, Traveler's and Chase all said they carefully monitor
vendors and require them to follow the law. They stressed that if a
consumer wants a charge removed, it is to be promptly removed.
</P>
<P>
   Tips for avoiding unwanted credit card billings:
</P>
<P>
   -Check your credit card bill carefully each month and make sure
you know exactly what you're being billed for.
</P>
<P>
   -Pare down the number of credit cards you have. Eliminate cards
you rarely or never use. You must notify the card issuing company
in writing that you are canceling the card, even if it was never
activated.
</P>
<P>
   -Contact your card issuer to find out if any of your cardholder
information can be given to partners or affiliates of the card
issuer. If so, ask for the address to write to cancel this
authorization.
</P>
<P>
   -Be cautious about ``trial memberships.'' Refuse the offer if
you will be billed and later have to cancel if you don't like the
product. Recognize that even if you do not give out your credit
card number, you might still be billed.
</P>
<P>
   -Report unauthorized billings to the Consumer Protection
Division of the Attorney General's Office at 1-800-551-4636.
Complaint forms can be found at the Attorney General website at

MORE THAN ONE PLAYER INVOLVED IN BILLING

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Complaints about unauthorized billings to credit cards
are not limited to BrandDirect Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   At least two consumers in Washington state have complained about
a club called SmartSource that is offered by MemberWorks of
Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lancaster of Wenatchee and Celia Congdon of Vashon
Island say they were billed for membership in SmartSource, a
service that provides discounts and advice on buying electronic
items, yet they were not aware of ever having agreed to it.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster said in his complaint to the Washington state Attorney
General's Office that he called the number given to him to cancel
``time after time and they always give me the run-around and play
music, then hang up.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Lancaster filed the complaint with the Attorney
General's Office, which contacted SmartSource. Lancaster's
membership was then canceled.
</P>
<P>
   When she called SmartSource about the charge on her bill,
Congdon was horrified to discover that she had been billed for the
membership a year ago and had not noticed it. The latest $69.90
membership, a $10 increase over last year's cost, was an automatic
renewal.
</P>
<P>
   SmartSource agreed to remove the latest charge after Congdon's
husband called to protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine a large percentage just don't call and that's what
they're banking on,'' said Congdon. ``It's really frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   MemberWorks did not respond directly to inquiries from the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer about Congdon's and Lancaster's
complaints, but faxed a ``policy statement'' saying consumers have
the option to cancel the program at any time and to receive a
refund.
</P>
<P>
   Other MemberWorks clubs are Travel Arrangements, Leisure
Advantage, Money Master, and Connections.

AS CYPRIOT LEADER TRIES TO WIN FREEDOM FOR CAPTIVE SOLDIERS, U.S.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cypriot leader Spyros Kyprianou tried Thursday to
win the release of the three American soldiers being held captive
by Yugoslav forces, but Serbia's vice premier threatened to try
them as terrorists unless NATO ends its bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they hope Kyprianou's mission can
succeed if he is allowed as promised to meet Friday with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, NATO and U.S. officials continued to stress that
the soldiers' release must be unconditional. In the meantime, they
said the bombing of Serb military targets would continue until
Milosevic gives in to allied demands that he withdraw his forces
from Kosovo and accept the return of Kosovar refugees under the
protection of an international security force.

   Kyprianou flew to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade on Thursday
aboard a Greek Air Force plane after NATO called a brief halt in
some of its bombing missions to allow for the aircraft's safe
passage. The plane returned to Greece last night, but Kyprianou,
who was told upon arrival that the Americans' release was ``out of
the question,'' stayed behind in anticipation of making a direct
appeal to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Kyprianou said he still hopes to win the Americans' freedom
during the long Orthodox Easter weekend, which began Thursday. In
return, he told reporters in Belgrade, ``NATO could reciprocate by
responding to the numerous international appeals for a cease-fire
at least over the Orthodox Easter weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said at the White House he would be ``for
anything honorable that would secure their release'' short of
ending the air campaign without Milosevic acceding to NATO's
demands.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appealed for their release, saying they ``never should
have been detained in the first place'' because they were in
Macedonia at the time of their capture last week and ``had nothing
to do'' with the NATO operation against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers _ Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los
Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smith Creek,
Mich.; and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas _ were
captured while on a reconnaissance mission along the
Macedonia-Kosovo border on March 31 as part of the NATO
peacekeeping force stationed in that country. They were reportedly
within Macedonian territory when a Serb patrol opened fire and
surrounded them.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials made it clear to Kyprianou before he left
Cyprus that he was not authorized to negotiate for the soldiers'
freedom. State Department spokesman James Rubin reiterated that
position in his daily briefing Thursday, telling reporters that
``any attempt to use the three as bargaining chips is both illegal
and immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would obviously welcome the release of the servicemen. But
let me be clear. We will accept nothing less than the unconditional
release of these servicemen,'' he said. ``We will not negotiate for
their release. We understand that Mr. Kyprianou is proceeding on
this basis as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen also made it clear that there
would be no concessions to Milosevic during a stop at Aviano,
Italy. Cohen addressed U.S. pilots and other military personnel
participating in the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Milosevic of illegally holding the Americans as
prisoners of war and said the Yugoslav leader would be held
accountable for their safety.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although it was unclear how Kyprianou's efforts would proceed
Friday, U.S. officials were making plans to fly the three soldiers
to Ramstein Air Base in Germany if Milosevic agrees to let them
leave Yugoslavia with the Cypriot leader. The three would likely be
flown out of Belgrade aboard a Greek Air Force plane to Cyprus,
where they would then board a U.S. plane for the trip to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, they would be hospitalized for checkups and
debriefed. Plans were also being made to fly members of their
immediate families to Germany to meet them.

SOME TROOPS FOCUSED ON HUMANITARIAN MISSION  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   TIRANA, Albania _ Strapped into a seat inside a C-130 Air Force
cargo plane, Heather Byington headed into her first combat zone
Thursday, ready for war, clutching an M-16 rifle as the giant gray
aircraft took off from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the men and women around her, she blended into a wall
of camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   But as the plane headed toward Yugoslavia, there were no cracks
about Slobodan Milosevic _ no jokes, in fact, having to do with war
at all.
</P>
<P>
   These were the Air Force humanitarian assistance workers, the
ones assigned to the fringes to coordinate food and refugee aid,
more like missionary workers than GIs on a military mission. That
purpose was exactly why Byington and her Air Force colleagues said
they wanted to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to help people,'' Byington, 25, shouted over the roar
of the engine, smiling. ``I volunteered to go. I've been watching
CNN a lot, and I've been wanted to try and do something. I wanted
to be part of the humanitarian effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget comparing Kosovo to Vietnam _ at least around here.
Seated near Byington, stuffed between cargo loads of water, tents,
and power generators, every Air Force member on the trip described
a similar aspiration.
</P>
<P>
   To them, going to the border of Yugoslavia was not about
becoming a war hero, or killing the enemy. It was about feeding the
hungry and helping the poor _ as far from violence as possible.
</P>
<P>
   And in many ways, that is the changing mission of the military
itself, as the US takes on more and more peacekeeping roles and
humanitarian efforts worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Jess McGraw, 27, a senior airman, said he wanted to go because
he ``saw the need to help.'' Chris Ringland, 30, the plane's cargo
loadmaster, said the Air Force ``trained me for exactly this kind
of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Kenith Franklin, 36, said he wanted nothing to do with
combat. He had been in Desert Storm and had ``been there, done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the great misconceptions about us. We're not
here just for war,'' said Matthew Buchanan, 25, a senior airman
from Jacksonville Beach, Fla., before the plane departed from
Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is better than Desert Storm. This, you don't get much
back, but it does make you sleep good at night, puts a smile on
your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Byington agreed, offering a reason why she and her colleagues
have become so averse to war. ``We're in the Air Force. Maybe our
mission isn't as combat-oriented as the rest of the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, before she had time to consider which military branch is
carrying out airstrikes against Yugoslavia, she curled up in her
camouflage uniform, leaned against the walls of the roaring plane,
and fell asleep.

   KUKES, Albania _ Serbian forces were positioning tanks and
artillery along the Kosovo border Thursday, just one day after tens
of thousands of refugees vanished when the Serbs turned their
convoys back from the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know where they are or what is happening to
them,'' said Laura Boldrini, a spokeswoman for the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees, of the column of fleeing ethnic
Albanians estimated by aid officials to number some 80,000.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny handful of people _ not more than 30 _ who crossed the
border from Kosovo into Albania Thursday reported that the main
highway stretching north, which had been so clogged with the
slow-moving line of people on foot, in cars and in farm carts
pulled by tractors, was absolutely empty of refugees. Ms. Boldrini
said the few families who came across apparently had been let
across because the older family members had been born in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said there was a long, long queue of empty vehicles
burned and destroyed and no one around except the military
positioning guns,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On their side of the border crossing, Serb soldiers were seen
setting up mortars and laying mines in the trenches they dug on
Wednesday. Further back there is believed to be a battery of four
D-30 Howitzers, a light 122-millimeter field gun with a range of 10
miles.
</P>
<P>
   At the now-closed Qafr-e-Prushit border crossing in the rugged
mountains to the northwest, aid workers said they have seen the
Serbs gouging out berms with bulldozers to shelter T-55 tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are digging in furiously all along the border,''
said Eugene O'Sullivan, the chief of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe observer team here.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the unknown fate of the tens of thousands of refugees
suddenly turned back at 3:30 in the morning on Wednesday that most
concerned aid workers here. They are worried that the refugees may
have been brought back to the larger towns that had been collecting
points for some sinister purpose, such as being used as human
shields against NATO forces. Perhaps even worse, they said, the
refugees might have been sent to wander the countryside, where
whole villages and towns have been looted and burned, on foot,
without food or water and at the mercy of Serbian gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   One theory for the sudden change in tactics, suggested
O'Sullivan, is that the Serbs might have decided that at the rate
they were going, they would totally empty Kosovo of its ethnic
Albanians, quite soon, leaving only Serbs, whom NATO might then
attack.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few days on the steep hillsides along the twisting
road from the border, lines of Albanian soldiers in ill-fitting
brown wool tunics that look like they date back at least to World
War I, have been carrying rusty rocket launchers into the crumbling
mushroom-shaped concrete bunkers the late dictator Enver Hoxha
scattered all over the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Albanian Army's weapons, up to and including tanks,
were looted from armories in a wave of civil unrest following the
collapse of a nationwide Ponzi scheme several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the flood of refugees cut off, the camps of people
squatting at the edge of town in farm carts covered with plastic
sheeting has diminished markedly. UNHCR officials say refugees are
being moved out of this remote area at the rate of about 20,000 a
day, and soon nearly all will have been sent down to Tirana, the
capital, and other areas where better care can be provided.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced aid workers who have been to many disasters around
the world have been increasingly stunned by the scope, the
meticulous organization and planning and the utter ferocity of the
Serbian campaign to drive out the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is going to stop this?'' asked Ms. Boldrini helplessly.
``This is a scandal. This is happening in Europe at the
millennium.''

$306 MILLION TAX BREAK FOR FAMILIES CLEARS TEXAS SENATE &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By KATHY WALT 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Senate approved a $306 million tax
break for families Thursday with a measure that would eliminate the
sales tax on diapers and some over-the-counter drugs and that would
suspend sales taxes on school clothing for a two-week period each
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting the sales tax on items like over-the-counter
medicines, diapers (and) school clothing makes everyday life more
affordable for many Texans,'' said Lt. Gov. Rick Perry. ``This tax
cut also puts some of the state's surplus back where it needs to be
_ back into Texans' pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure, Senate Bill 441, was approved without objection and
now goes to the House for consideration, where similar proposals
were approved by the House Ways and Means Committee a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas' sales tax rate takes the most from those who can least
afford it,'' said Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat and sponsor
of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Budget analysts estimate that the bill, which would take effect
Oct. 1 if passed, would cost state coffers $85 million in the first
year of the budget cycle and $166 million in the second year.
Another $55 million would be lost to cities, counties and other
taxing authorities during the two-year time frame.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is opposed by the Texas Municipal League because of its
effect on city revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales tax is as regressive as any tax we have and I think
people on the local level ought to be sensitive to that as well,''
Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is one of several tax-relief proposals working their
way through the Legislature. Gov. George W. Bush has proposed some
similar tax relief measures, including $330 million in sales tax
cuts for diapers, over-the-counter medicine, other health aids and
Internet access as a way to funnel part of a two-year $2.5 billion
budget surplus back to taxpayers. Although a tax exemption on
Internet access is not included in Ellis' bill, it is contained in
a separate bill that has yet to reach the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we are going to get some property tax relief,'' Bush
said Thursday. ``The good news is the House and the Senate appear
to be debating tax cuts. That is a very good start for someone who
wants to see tax cuts passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added that while his whole package included sales tax,
business and property tax proposals, he strongly believes property
tax cuts are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we are going to get property tax cuts,'' he said.
``I also know we need to get sales tax cuts. I support a hefty tax
cut, and I look forward to working with the members of the House
and Senate.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Ellis bill would:
</P>
<P>
   Expand existing tax exemptions on prescription drugs to
over-the-counter medicines, such as children's cough syrup &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Exempt children's diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Exempt clothing and shoes selling for up to $200 per item from
sales tax during a 14-day period in August to help families buy
back-to-school clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that there are a lot of low-income families in Texas
who would prefer to go and buy one suit for their kid as opposed to
buying 20 pairs of jeans,'' Ellis said. ``I don't want to go in and
feel like I have to second guess what a low-income family wants to
do with that money.''
</P>
<P>
   The sales tax relief bills approved earlier this week in the
House committee would extend the back-to-school tax moratorium to
school supplies, while giving families a nine-day sales tax holiday
in August, rather than the two-week period specified in the Senate
bill. The House proposals also would limit sales tax exemptions on
school clothing to items costing no more than $75.
</P>
<P>
   The 6.25 percent state sales tax rate, which can be as high as
8.25 percent when local sales taxes are added, is one of the
highest in the nation, hitting poor families hardest, Ellis' office
said. His proposal would eliminate both state and local taxes on
the items approved Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander said families earning
less than $14,769 a year pay 6.9 percent of their income in sales
taxes, compared with those earning more than $74,357, which pay
about 1.5 percent of their total income on sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis' staff estimates that the back-to-school tax moratorium
could save a family with two school-age children at least $20. They
estimate that the diaper tax break alone would save a family with
one infant $6.60 a month, or nearly $80 a year.

 &HT;    South remains SIDS problem, experts say
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia and other Southeastern states continue to be a
trouble spot in the national public health campaign to reduce
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, say experts meeting in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1997, SIDS deaths nationally declined 43
percent but decreased in Georgia by 25 percent. While Georgia's
numbers represent an improvement (from 149 deaths to 115 deaths),
not enough Southerners are getting the message that babies should
only be put to bed on their backs, said Phipps Cohe of the SIDS
Alliance, a coalition of health department officials and parents
who've lost children to SIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Back to Sleep' campaign has spared about 2,000 babies a
year from dying of SIDS,'' Cohe said. ``So in seven years, we have
done a magnificent job. But we're finding there are still poc-
</P>
<P>
   kets of populations that need to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of much concern are African-American babies, who are three times
as likely to die from SIDS, and day care centers where nearly
one-fifth of SIDS cases have occurred, Cohe said. Surveys have
found African-Americans are twice as likely to place infants on
their stomach, a sleep position that was once standard practice,
and a habit that may be tough for grandmothers and other older baby
sitters.
</P>
<P>
   But research led to the American Academy of Pediatrics' ``Back
to Sleep'' recommendation when it was found babies sleeping on
their stomachs and sides were in more danger of having their
airways blocked, and more at risk for SIDS.
</P>
<P>
   SIDS strikes, without warning or previous symptoms, in infants
under age 1. But why nearly 3,000 apparently healthy infants every
year from SIDS continues to vex doctors and scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are left with the coroner's report that says SIDS, but it
doesn't answer why,'' said Jim Morgan of Suwanee (GA.), who lost
his 94-day-old son, Nicolas James, to SIDS in 1997. He and his
wife, Cheyney Morgan, will speak Saturday on how the death affected
their older son, Joshua.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was only 6 years old at the time, but it was surprising how
he held up,'' Morgan said. ``He was the one who got me through the
funeral. We'd be crying, and he was the one saying, `Don't look (at
the casket.) It'll only make you cry.' ''

   ATHENS, Ga. _ Until 15 years ago, this lively college town was
better known as the home of the Georgia Bulldogs and R.E.M. than as
a literary hotbed. When Philip Lee Williams' first book, ``The
Heart of a Distant Forest,'' was published in 1984, he remembers
being the only novelist in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a book published then was so unusual, it was like
waking up on another planet,'' said Williams, 49, whose 10th book,
``Crossing Wildcat Ridge,'' was just published by the University of
Georgia Press. ``People were coming up to me on the street, asking
me questions, and I was supposed to have opinions on everything. I
didn't know how to act like a writer, and there was no one to tell
me.''
</P>
<P>
   All that has changed. The reasons for this literary blossoming
are tied to the University of Georgia, which established a creative
writing program and expanded its press into areas beyond academia.
It's also due to the ascendance of the Georgia Review under the
leadership of Stan Lindberg, whose reign at the
university-sponsored literary magazine has made it one of the
country's finest. And to the growth of the publishing scene: There
are now four imprints in town. Readings by local and visiting
writers, such as noted nature writer Terry Tempest Williams and
essayist Franklin Burroughs, are routine and well-attended.
</P>
<P>
   But the reasons also include Athens itself. It's a cheap,
low-key place to live, known for its musicians, artists and
tolerance for the offbeat, where you're just as likely to encounter
an award-winning writer as a millionaire musician at Blue Sky
Coffee House downtown or Jittery Joe's in Five Points. People come
here to college _ or just come to visit _ and never leave,
attracted by the lively cultural scene as much as the 19th-century
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have lived and written here have found willing
and interesting audiences of readers,'' said historian Tom Dyer,
55, whose ``Secret Yankees: The Union Circle in Civil War Atlanta''
was published by Johns Hopkins University Press in March. ``Athens
is on more of a human scale than Atlanta; it's smaller. You can
live here and get around and get to know people.''
</P>
<P>
   Poet Barbara Ras, 1998 winner of the prestigious Walt Whitman
Award and executive editor of the UGA Press, learned early on that
Athens' lit lovers are a more passionate breed. She still marvels
that more than 50 people showed up for a poetry reading she gave at
a downtown bar soon after she moved to town, when she knew almost
no one other than her colleagues at the UGA Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an astonishment to me to have that many people turn
out,'' Ras said. ``It showed that the community is hungry for
literary events and is willing to support them.''
</P>
<P>
   A place for like minds
</P>
<P>
   Literary events _ readings and signings _ are where you're most
likely to find a gaggle of those devoted to books and writing. But
because there isn't a front-list bookstore in town, or a place like
the late, lamented Old New York Book Shop in Atlanta's Midtown,
there's no single gathering spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real impediment is that there's no really good bookstore,
and everyone would like to see that changed,'' said poet Kevin
Young, who teaches creative writing in the UGA English department.
Locals long for a place like the Old Black Dog, an independent
bookstore that closed in 1996. During its 10-year run it became the
hub of local literary happenings. Judy Long, now editor of Hill
Street Press, was its manager.
</P>
<P>
   Squeezed into an old house in Five Points, near the UGA campus,
the Old Black Dog was packed stem to stern with books by local and
national authors. Veterinarian John McCormack, author of the
autobiographical ``Fields and Pastures New'' and ``A Friend of the
Flock,'' remembers that before Crown published his books, the Old
Black Dog carried ``Watch for a Cloud of Dust,'' a paperback
collection of columns he had written for a dairying magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Black Dog was a refuge from the world,'' said Judith
Ortiz Cofer, a UGA English professor and a native of Puerto Rico
who often writes about her life there, in New Jersey and in
Georgia. ``It was a place where good writing was valued. Such a
small space _ it offered an intimate setting that was unique.''
</P>
<P>
   At the store, Long and owner Melissa Tufts ``hand-sold books to
just about everyone in town who was interested in books and good
writing,'' said Julie Checkoway, director of UGA's creative writing
program. ``Judy didn't just sell books, she connected us to each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Long knew just about every writer, from McCormack, who had
treated Tufts' horses, to historian Emory Thomas, biographer of
Gen. Robert E. Lee, and UGA children's books expert Sylvia
Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   When Tufts closed the bookstore, Long worried that her
friendships might falter. But with a business called Byhalia Books,
which she calls ``a bookstore without walls,'' she has kept her
hand in the local literary scene, arranging readings, propping up
nervous authors and selling their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judy Long is the glue that holds the entire Athens literary
community together,'' said Checkoway. ``She knows everybody; she's
a human press release. Without her, it wouldn't be a community, it
would be a bunch of writers living in a town.''
</P>
<P>
   Some enchanted evening
</P>
<P>
   One literary gathering that Long hopes to stage involves retired
UGA English professor Coleman Barks, poet and the world's foremost
interpreter of the works of 13th-century Turkish mystical poet
Mavlana Jelaluddin Rumi. Long has heard Barks read Rumi's poetry to
musical accompaniment ``to packed houses in other cities, but not
in Athens,'' she said. So her goal is eventually to produce ``An
Evening With Coleman Barks'' in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Few people in town seem aware of Barks' international
accomplishments, largely because he doesn't tout his own works and
seems not to take himself very seriously. While Rumi is now the
best-selling poet in the United States (and is even in record
stores thanks to holistic healing guru Deepak Chopra's ``A Gift of
Love'' CD with celebrity poetry reciters Madonna and Demi Moore) _
and his Athens translator is almost a cult figure in California _
Barks remains relatively unknown locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I gave a reading in Athens, it would probably just be my
family who would come,'' said Barks, who punctuates his
self-deprecating barbs with a melodious laugh. ``No, that may not
be true. This is a very lively town, just the right size for me.
There's a literary community here, but we're all off in our own
place, working. People leave each other alone, and I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Barks said, he would meet ``on someone's porch''
with groups of other people who were writing, such as poet Paul
Zimmer, former director of the UGA Press; Cofer, who was sharing
stories that later went into ``The Latin Deli''; and Jim Kilgo, who
was just beginning to write the personal essays that make up his
first two books. They would read and then offer one another
criticism and comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were helpful and generous, especially Coleman,'' said
Kilgo. ``He was very supportive. He began taking my work seriously,
even before I did.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, poet Robert Bly, a friend of Barks', handed Barks a
scholarly translation of Rumi's works, telling him ``these need to
be released from their cages,'' Barks recalled. ``They were a
literal translation; they needed to be put in American English. I
had had a literary education, had studied at Berkeley and Chapel
Hill, and yet I had never heard of the great poet of that part of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   After two decades of collaborating with various Persian scholars
to bring Rumi to an English-speaking audience _ usually through his
own Maypop Books or with Threshold Books in Putney, Vt. _ Barks
recently obtained a contract with Viking giving him a six-figure
advance to produce a volume of Rumi's collected works. He said he's
both amazed and bemused at the idea of getting the country's
largest advance, ever, for poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I need? I guess it'll go to my grandchildren,'' he
said. ``And some for travel. I like to travel. I go out about two
times a month, reading.'' He said he finds colonies of Rumi lovers
wherever he goes, from Berkeley to Kalamazoo.

   ATHENS, Ga.: to Kalamazoo.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing support
</P>
<P>
   The UGA Press is a fixture of the local literary landscape.
Since it began accepting fiction in the 1980s, it has published
many Athens writers and has helped sponsor events and appearances
by national authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's extraordinary about the press is the range of its
publishing,'' said Ras, ``because it spans not only scholarly books
that are landmark works in history, civil rights, African-American
studies and environmental studies, but it also publishes fiction,
poetry and other significant works that contribute to the culture
of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina native John Miller, publisher of Orloff Press,
moved from California to Athens in 1997 to be with Karen Orchard,
who is the director of the UGA Press. A writer himself and the
winner of the 1996 California Book Award for ``Jackson Street,'' a
collection of short stories, Miller said he welcomed the arrival of
Hill Street Press last year, adding that ``anything which provides
an outlet for writers and promotes Athens as an arts-friendly city
is good for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Georgia also sponsors the Georgia Review,
whose editor, Lindberg, is responsible for the quarterly's
``position on the cutting edge of contemporary literature,'' said
Rita Dove, a former national poet laureate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan Lindberg is a god,'' declared novelist Williams.
``Basically, he's the greatest literary magazine editor in the
country right now. Generations from now, people will remember him
as the greatest editor, ever, and the Review as the greatest
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   With a circulation of 6,000, the Georgia Review has received
numerous prestigious awards over the years, including the 1986
National Magazine Award for fiction, when it beat out The New
Yorker, Esquire and Harper's. Since then it has been a National
Magazine Award finalist at least eight times. Pieces that it
publishes are routinely included in anthologies.
</P>
<P>
   Checkoway praised the Review for providing ``incredible
training'' for the students employed there as interns. They learn
how to edit and write, she said, often receiving advice from
Lindberg about their own work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mentoring in the true sense of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   The Review's associate editor, Stephen Corey, said the
notoriously selective magazine gets very few local submissions.
Novelist Terry Kay said he hasn't sent anything to the Review for
just that reason _ he doesn't want to put its editors in the
uncomfortable position of possibly rejecting and upsetting him.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Kay remains one of the biggest fans of both the
Review and Lindberg, whom he calls ``the pickiest person I've ever
met. This is the man who rejected John Updike and Robert Penn
Warren.'' But the Review has also published those well-known
writers, as well as Joyce Carol Oates, Eudora Welty, Robert Frost
and Harry Crews.
</P>
<P>
   Kay, who attended the ``Roots in Georgia'' literary symposium in
Athens in 1985 and the gathering of Nobel laureates during the
Cultural Olympiad in Atlanta, both of which were Lindberg's ideas,
said he was ``totally overwhelmed'' and convinced that Lindberg
wasn't receiving enough credit. So Kay and others have created an
award to honor the Review's editor, ``because he's done more to
acknowledge the literary efforts of this state than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-sponsored by the Georgia Center for the Book, the Stanley W.
Lindberg Award will honor someone who has contributed
``substantially to the literary culture of Georgia through a
lifetime body of work,'' whether through publishing, editing,
writing or teaching. The first winner is Pat Conroy, who will
receive the prize April 24 at a black-tie event that's open to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Community comes together
</P>
<P>
   The Roots in Georgia conference is regarded as a benchmark event
both by its organizers and those who attended. ``It made us realize
there was a community here,'' said Lindberg. ``It was a coming
together of people in Athens, a recognition of them and the
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   It consisted of four days of literary readings, panel
discussions, films and lectures and brought to Athens such writers
and Georgia natives as Erskine Caldwell, Harry Crews, Olive Ann
Burns and James Dickey, along with Kay, Williams, Judson Mitcham
and Jim Peterson. Also attending was writer Raymond Andrews, a
Morgan County native who had recently moved from New York to
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Described by his many friends as incredibly generous, Andrews
``was somebody who was from the place, who believed in the place,''
said the Georgia Review's Corey. ``He was an extremely personable,
open kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews made everyone feel as if he was their best friend, said
Williams, and helped cement the writing community in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   All who knew him, including Barks, Kilgo, Long, Lindberg and
Williams, say they think of him ``almost every day'' since his
suicide in 1991 and miss him terribly, wishing he were here to
enjoy their successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd probably give me a hard time,'' laughed Barks. ``He was
pretty grounded in the here and now. He was a wonderful, unique
human being, and he can't be replaced.''

   President Hugo Chavez has threatened to declare a state of
emergency that would allow him to rule by decree. The threat came
after Congress refused to grant him enhanced powers he demanded
after taking office. Relations with Congress turned worse when the
son of a congressional leader was arrested on what he says are
trumped-up arms-smuggling charges. Chavez also said he might

<P>
   Olympic gold medal gymnast Dominique Moceanu and her father
settled their legal fight Thursday by reaching a confidential
financial settlement and dissolving a one-year protective order
keeping the father away from the gymnast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an extremely difficult time for my family, and I
hope that we can now begin to move forward in support of one
another,'' Dominique, 17, said in a press release. ``I know that
deep down my father loves me, and of course I love him, so I need
to find a way in my heart to give him forgiveness. I hope there is
a chance that someday things in my family can be normal again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique's parents, Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu of Spring,
could not be reached for comment. Their attorney, Jimmy Phillips,
said, ``I'm confident they'll be a family again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique's attorney, Ellen Yarrell, released a brief statement
stressing that the 17-year-old gymnast feels safe despite the
dissolution of the Dec. 9 ruling that ordered her father to stay at
least 500 feet away from her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties entered into a settlement which includes a
confidentiality agreement prohibiting discussion of the specific
terms,'' the statement said. ``However, it is important for
Dominique's fans and supporters to know that she is confident that
the settlement assures her personal safety and achievement of her
financial goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Phillips nor Yarrell would comment further, saying a
news release would be issued within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was signed Thursday by presiding Family Law Judge
Patricia Lykos. State District Judge John Montgomery _ who had
issued the one-year protective order _ died Feb. 13 of pancreatic
cancer. His order came after police revealed they were
investigating Dumitru for allegedly trying to hire a hit man to
kill two of his daughter's friends.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu had been ordered by a judge to undergo a
deposition March 10 concerning Dominique's finances, but the
deposition was never held because of the pending agreement,
Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   The family turmoil became public after Dominique sued her
parents Oct. 19 to be declared a legal adult, saying her father had
squandered the money she had earned in her 10-year professional
career. She also said her parents had ruined her childhood by
constantly emphasizing her career and sometimes hitting her at
events.
</P>
<P>
   The gymnast, who had run away from home Oct. 17, was declared a
legal adult Oct. 29. She is training for the 2000 Olympics at the
Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanu parents, Romanian immigrants who were both members
of the that country's gymnastics team before defecting to the
United States, have denied their daughter's allegations of misusing
her money and destroying her childhood.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu, 44, has said all of his daughter's earnings
went into building a 70,000-square-foot gym at 6120 Louetta in 1996
with Dominique's blessings.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu has refused to say how much the gym cost, but
his attorney Katherine Scardino said it was about $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers declined Thursday to discuss the fate of the gym, which
was apparently closed in February.
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanu parents set up a trust fund for their daughter's
earnings which they administer. Dominique did not have access to
the trust until she turned 35.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique sought a protective order against her father after
police told her Nov. 13 they were investigating him for allegedly
wanting to pay someone $10,000 to kill Dominique's friend Brian
Huggins and her former coach Luminita Miscenco.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins, 32, who helped with construction of the gym, and
Miscenco, 26, had helped Dominique run away from home. The parents
had accused the friends of ``brainwashing'' Dominique against them.
Dumitru Moceanu denies any involvement is a plot to kill his
daughter's coach or friend.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique was born in Los Angeles in 1981 and moved to the
Houston area in 1990 to train with famed gymnastics Bela Karolyi,
also a Romanian immigrant. At 14, she was the youngest member of
the 1996 U.S. gold medal-winning gymnastics team at the Atlanta
Olympics.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Erica Aguilar, a Mexican-American born in Denver, is 21
years old and has three children, ages 4, 2 and 8 months. The
children have Medicaid, and for them she uses Denver's La Casa
Family Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Aguilar herself has no health insurance. She works 26
hours a week as a sales clerk at Montgomery Ward for $6.50 an hour,
and as a part-timer, she is ineligible for insurance even if she
could pay her share of the premium. Yet she earns too much to get
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   So for herself and sometimes her children, she uses home
remedies. ``I go by what my grandmother tells me,'' she said. She
douses her eyes with sugar and water to cure eye irritations. To
cure colic, she rubs the baby's stomach with warm oils.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aguilar's story is emblematic of a striking disparity in the
nation's health care. For reasons that are largely economic, but
also cultural, 34 percent of the nation's 31 million Hispanics have
no health insurance, compared with 22 percent of blacks and 12
percent of non-Hispanic whites. Overall, 43 million people in the
nation are without insurance, up from 31 million a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanics _ 64 percent of whom are of Mexican origin _
appear to be gaining in economic and political strength, their lack
of insurance coverage and ready access to professional care is
costly in both the demands they eventually make on emergency rooms
and in public health because of untreated contagious diseases, like
measles and mumps, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has a vast Hispanic community _ non-white Hispanics make
up a quarter of the city's half-million residents, compared with 11
percent nationwide. The city's Hispanics are mostly young, and
mostly from Mexico and Central America. Their lack of professional
health care sustains a thriving, informal system of alternative
care built on religion, tradition and home remedies. Often it
works. But just as often, it delays and impedes crucial care.
</P>
<P>
   Health system officials here and Hispanic community leaders
attribute the disparity in health insurance to the mostly menial
jobs of this relatively young, largely undereducated minority, to
cultural and bureaucratic barriers to both coverage and care, and
to a political climate that has darkened for immigrants, both legal
and illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to be poor,'' said Ann Zuvekas of the George
Washington University Center for Health Policy Research, the author
of several studies of minority health. ``They tend to work for
small employers, in low-wage jobs, cleaning buildings and
gardening, in car washes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cultural differences and language barriers,'' Ms.
Zuvekas added. ``And a number are immigrants. Public policy has
been to make sure that many immigrants don't get insurance.'' Under
the overhaul of the welfare system three years ago, for example,
legal immigrants must wait five years to apply for Medicaid, the
health insurance program for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the $48 billion, 10-year program that Congress and
President Clinton enacted two years ago to expand government
insurance to all groups of poor children, little has been done to
treat the gap in the Hispanic population's coverage. ``We are being
lobbied to improve our children's care,'' said Richard Allen,
director of Colorado's Medicaid program. ``But regarding Hispanics?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   Some who do qualify for programs like Medicaid still won't
enroll for fear that doing so will encourage politicians to use
rising enrollments of immigrants to argue for slowing future
immigration, including relatives of immigrants already here
legally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're frightened,''said Dr. Richard Wright, chief executive
of Community Health Services of Denver Health, the city's nonprofit
health care system. ``They think, `If I enroll, that will work
against me as an immigrant.'''
</P>
<P>
   For most uninsured Hispanics, the disparity in coverage arises
from erosion of job-based benefits. Only half of all Hispanics are
covered through employment, compared with two-thirds of
African-Americans and three-quarters of white workers.
</P>
<P>
   When employers do offer insurance, usually asking their workers
to pay a share of the cost, Hispanic workers are the most likely to
refuse it because they earn less than other workers and have more
mouths to feed on their slimmer wages.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau says that in 1996, Hispanic men earned a
little over $16,000, about $10,000 less than non-Hispanic white
men. And 27 percent of Hispanic families have five or more members,
compared with 12 percent of other families.
</P>
<P>
   While economic reasons dominate, issues of culture also emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``People rely on faith a lot,'' said Luz Collins, who was born
in Mexico and manages the Westside Family Health Center, one of 11
Denver Health clinics. ``They wheel and deal with God. You call it
home medicine. It's our actual medicine. A lot of it's hidden
because we realize it's not accepted by the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Some home medicine tends to be harmless, as in the case of Irene
Chavez's 2-year-old granddaughter. Recently, Ms. Chavez lovingly
displayed a framed photograph of the toddler with her deep happy
dimples and wavy black hair. ``She's a beautiful granddaughter,''
Ms. Chavez says, ``so beautiful that people just can't believe
she's real.'' The beauty, she contends, was the child's undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Whether from spite, envy or admiration, Ms. Chavez said, someone
gazed overly long at her granddaughter and in so doing marked her
with the evil eye, or ``mal de ojo.'' A day or two later the child
fell ill, with vomiting, diarrhea and a high fever. Doctors said
she had a virus. ``They said, `Stop being paranoid,''' Ms. Chavez
said. ```There's nothing wrong with her.'''
</P>
<P>
   Unconvinced, the family called in Louise, their 77-year-old
neighborhood curandera, or healer. Chanting prayers, the woman
rubbed an unbroken egg over the child, tracing signs of the cross.
Then she broke the egg, put it in a cup, placed a cross made of
twigs in the yolk, and put the cup under the head of the child's
bed. By morning the child was well. The egg, Ms. Chavez said, had
exorcised the curse.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But when such efforts fail and patients belatedly show up at
doctors' offices, says Dr. Alicia Vazquez, the primary care
physician at Denver Health's La Casa de Salute clinic, they have
been drinking cocktails of exotic herbs or using cheap,
under-the-counter prescription medicines that bodegas smuggle in
from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 32-year-old female comes in with a five-day history of sore
throat, runny nose and a cough and reports that she's been taking
an antibiotic from Mexico because that's all she could get,'' Dr.
Vazquez says.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vazquez takes a culture of the patient's mouth to see if she
has strep throat. It proves negative. ``But is that because she
does not have strep throat, or is she partially treated?'' she
said. Not knowing which, she said, leaves the doctor with the
choice of treating a condition the patient may not have or waiting
to see if the conditions worsens.
</P>
<P>
   Even the act of going to a clinic is novel to some Hispanics.
``In Mexico, there are so many things around for curing yourself
that you don't go to the doctor,'' said Juvenica Acevedo Flores, a
hearty widow who is 4 feet, 4 inches tall and 87 years old.
</P>
<P>
   She has Medicare but rarely used it until a few years ago when
she was found to have diabetes. Now her daughter takes her to the
Westside clinic for checkups. ``It's necessary,'' Ms. Acevedo said
with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Brodsky, a clinic manager whose grandmother was a
curandera, said the whole notion of insurance could be foreign.
``The culture isn't one to ask for help outside the family,'' she
said. ``Then when something really bad happens, you turn to the
family for money'' to pay for professional care.
</P>
<P>
   Language is also a barrier, both in efforts to get patients to
enroll in health care programs and in communicating with them once
they sign up.
</P>
<P>
   At Denver Health's Community Health Services, which oversees the
clinics and serves a predominantly poor and Hispanic clientele, 83
percent of the 80 physicians are non-Hispanic whites. So are all
eight senior social workers and 84 percent of the 97 registered and
advanced-practice nurses.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said Ms. Collins of the Westside clinic, ``A
Hispanic is given heart medicine and it's not well-explained. They
end up taking it when they have a chest pain, not every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Sanchez-Martin, director of the Center for Community and
Behavioral Health at the Denver branch of the Latin American
Research and Service Agency, says the problem is one of ``cultural
competence,'' not just language. Relations between men and women,
for example, clash with American norms.
</P>
<P>
   At the private, largely church-funded Tepayac Clinic, husbands
sometimes stop their wives from having pap smears. ``If the
doctor's a man,'' said Jim Garcia, chairman of the clinic's board,
``the husband says no. The idea of another man touching his wife is
beyond comprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we try to relieve that,'' said Susan Gallo, a psychologist
and the clinic's executive director, ``by having a female attendant
in the examining room _ a chaperone.''
</P>
<P>
   Barriers like these reinforce Denver's unofficial safety net.
One strand is the neighborhood curandera, and another the bodegas
and four or five botanicas and yerberias that dispense herbs, teas,
incense, powders, charms, sprays and oils, some with proven
medicinal value and often prescribed by curanderas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rick Padilla, a family physician at Westside, estimates that
100 to 200 curanderas serve the city, nearly all working from their
homes and known only by word of mouth. In a random survey of 405
adult Hispanic patients, he found that 29 percent had sought a
curandera's intervention at least once in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some charge nothing, Padilla said. Others accept a meal, or a
donation ranging from $5 to $100. ``They're not very well
regulated,'' he said, ``and there's a lot of potential for abuse.''
But when he feels that Hispanic patients' fears and suspicions
obstruct their care, he refers them to a trustworthy curandera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Latin people think their diseases are related to someone
having put a hex on them,'' said Toni Palma, a Hopi Indian married
to a Mexican and a counselor to the elderly at Westside. A woman
might say she has been cursed and made sick by another who wants
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the disparities in insurance coverage do not
translate into conclusive evidence of a sicker population.
Nationwide, the average Hispanic is a first-generation immigrant,
26 years old _ 10 years younger than the rest of the population _
and less likely to have contracted the diseases that develop later
in life.
</P>
<P>
   Still, among the three largest population groups _ white, black
and Hispanic _ statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention show that Hispanics have the highest rates of diseases
like mumps, tetanus, whooping cough and German measles. They have
lower levels of HIV infection, diabetes and tuberculosis than
blacks but about twice the levels of whites.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight percent of Hispanic children are uninsured, the
journal Health Affairs reports, compared with 18 percent of black
children and 12 percent of white children.
</P>
<P>
   But once Hispanic immigrants have lived in America for a decade
or two, physicians here say, their diets begin to shift from beans,
grains, fruit and vegetables to fast and processed foods.
</P>
<P>
   So once they are settled, said Robin Weinick, social scientist
at the federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research,
``Hispanics tend to be in poorer health.'' And, she said, ``They
have the poorest access to care of any population we measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright of Denver Health said, ``We've got to learn. We've got to
talk to people in the community. We've got to have a dialogue so
our system and their beliefs can be more in sync.''

ROBERT MARSCHALK, EX-DRUG COMPANY HEAD, DIES AT 83  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Fla., Conn., Pa., N.H.)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   H. Robert Marschalk, who rose from a salesman for Vicks Chemical
Co. to president and later vice chairman of its successor, the
Richardson-Merrell Drug Co., died Sunday in West Palm Beach, Fla.
He was 83 and had prostate cancer, said a spokesman for Philip
Morris, where Marschalk was a director for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Marschalk, who had homes in North Palm Beach, Fla., and New
Canaan, Conn., was president of Richardson-Merrell when it marketed
an ill-fated anti-cholesterol drug known as Triparanol, or MER/29,
from 1960 through 1962. The drug was withdrawn because of reports
it could cause cataracts, dermatitis, loss of hair and impotency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963 a federal grand jury indicted the company and three of
its scientists on charges that the company had concealed evidence
of the adverse side effects in reports of laboratory tests before
the drug was approved for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Marschalk said at the time that a ``fair appraisal'' would
vindicate the company. But in 1964 Richardson-Merrell became the
first drug company to be convicted of failing to give complete
information about a drug to the Food and Drug Administration. The
company was fined $80,000, and the scientists received suspended
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The company was also sued by people who used the drug and blamed
it for causing cataracts. One, a retired Pennsylvania furniture
worker, was awarded $117,500 by a jury in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Marschalk was born in New York and raised in New Rochelle. He
graduated from Dartmouth College in 1937 with a degree in business.
He was a lieutenant in the Navy during World War II and was
stationed in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975 Marschalk became vice chairman of the company, which,
after he retired in 1981, was sold to Proctor and Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Philip Morris board, on which he served from
1966 to 1986, he was a director of the World Wildlife Fund and the
Olympic Fund in Stamford, Conn., and was an overseer of the
Dartmouth Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Wynne McKay; a son, Peter
McKay Marschalk of New Canaan; two daughters, Karen M. Viener of
Stuart, Fla., and Andrea M. Scheyhing of Stamford; a sister, Jean
Maguire of Harrison, N.Y.; a brother, Harry C. Marschalk of Sandy
Hook, Conn., and six grandchildren.

   JAMAICA-BEE _ MIAMI _ For 70 straight years, a U.S. citizen won
the annual national spelling bee. But last May, Jamaica's Jody-Anne
Maxwell became the first non-citizen to triumph. This year, though,
Jamaica is out. The island traditionally picks its winner in
August. But new rules disqualify any representative who wins her
regional spell-off before February. That's got a lot of Jamaicans,
as well as African-Americans, charging that racism is at work.

   HOUSE-CONSERVATIVES _ WASHINGTON _ A powerful GOP group is
already attacking the voting records of conservative democrats in
the new Congress. Those on the hit list include Texans Chet
Edwards, of Waco; Max Sandlin, of Marshall; and Jim Turner, of
Crockett. All three represent conservative districts which could be
heavily targeted by the GOP in 2000. It looks like the battle to
control the House is underway _ a cool 18 months before the
election. And the excitement over a George W. Bush candidacy is
fueling GOP dreams of long coattails in conservative Texas
districts. (Moscoso, Cox News Service)

   MILLENNIUM-LUTHERAN _ On Oct. 31, 1517, Martin Luther tacked a
paper to the Palace Church door in Wittenberg, sparking a movement
that changed Christianity. But the church Luther founded finds
itself in deep trouble in Europe, where the Lutheran World
Federation reported a ``general reduction in numbers.'' And the
problem is even greater in Germany, the homeland of Protestanism,
where more than a million people have left the church rolls in
the1990s. (Gwhite, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 67. WITH PHOTOS.

   MILLENNIUM-PROTESTANTS _ Most German Protestants spend little
time in the pews, but the history of northern Germany, the
birthplace of the Protestant Reformation, can be traced through
three churches: The Palace Church in Wittenberg where Luther nailed
the theses that started the Reformation; the Berliner Dom, or great
emperial cathedral, that survived the tremendous forces that shaped
20th century East Berlin; and, St. Michael's in Hamburg, a city
famous for its churches and its red-light district, where the
rebuilding of St. Michael's after World War II has become a major
point of pride for the city. (Gwhite, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 30. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-LUTHER _ Although Catholic monk Martin Luther never
intended to form his own church, millions of Christians around the
world are now in a family of denominations that bear his name.
Millions more are in other groups _ Reformed, Methodist,
Presbyterian _ that are part of the Protestant Reformation Luther
sparked. A brief bio of Luther. Photo. (Gwhite, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 12.5.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-BOX _ Although the government of Germany collects
funds for the Protestant and Catholic churches along with income
tax, many people have chosen to disaffiliate themselves from the
faith. And many of those who still pay money to the church seldom
attend. We take a quick look at the numbers. Gwhite. 7.4''

   COSMOS _ The Hubble Space Telescope and other new instruments
for examining the space we live in have generated a flood of new
discoveries during the 1990s, the fastest accumulation of insights
about the Universe in history, scientists say. Yet, fundamental
questions still exist about science and religion. Was there a Big
Bang? Did something happen before it? Was there a ``before it?''
Did something ``cause'' it to happen? Are human beings the only
``intelligent creatures'' to live in the space that it seems to
have created and to wonder about these things? The American
Association for the Advancement of Science will bring together
scientists and religious scholars from universities in the United
States and Europe next week (April 14-16) to talk these questions
and others. (Nesmith, Cox News Service). WITH GRAPHIC.

   OLY-CONGRESS _ After a brief reprieve, the IOC bribery scandal
is heating up again, this time in the halls of Congress. A
congressional committee begins considering legislation Wednesday
that could cripple the IOC by denying it millions of dollars in
sponsorships. The legislation would strip the IOC's tax-exempt
status in the U.S, limit the amount of Olympic fees sponsors could
deduct and place U.S. TV rights fees _ the single biggest source of
Olympic income _ with the USOC instead of the IOC. The White House
was asked almost a month ago by the U.S. Olympic Committee to
include the IOC under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and an
answer is possible Tuesday. And the Justice Department and the FBI
also are investigating possible violations of federal fraud and tax
laws. (Turner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40.

   MEXICO-UTILITY _ MEXICO CITY _ Each morning, Josefina Cruz sets

can see what she's doing, she plugs a long cable she brings with
her into a electrical socket and clicks on a bare light bulb. The
socket happens to be on a utility pole, courtesy of electrical
workers who charged her to install it and come by once a month to
collect a fee. It's a scene out of Mexico's patchwork electrical
system, where jury-rigged hookups are commonplace. In February
President Ernesto Zedillo proposed privatizing much of this
state-run industry, hoping to bring in millions of private
investment to make it more efficient and expand its capacity.
Zedillo has run into lots of opposition, though. The privatization
of banks and highways has led to some disasters, making
privatization a dirty word in Mexico. (Ferriss, Cox News Service)

   UTPRES-FAULKNER _ AUSTIN _ An elite group of students had
gathered to hear University of Texas President Larry Faulkner
deliver a hard sell on UT. It never came. Instead Faulkner flatly
told the students, ``This setting probably isn't the right setting
for every one of you.'' The scene was classic Faulkner: direct,
low-key, no-frills. In his first year heading the nation's largest
university, Faulkner is getting grades from A plus to incomplete.
Since taking office last April 13, Faulkner has faced ongoing
protests from staff over their pay, an overnight takeover of the
Main Building by angry students and the skepticism of
high-technology executives he wants badly to woo. We give readers a
sense of the job he is doing. (Roser, Austin American-Statesman).

   TEACHER-CREDENTIAL _ About one in five Texas public school
students are taught by teachers who lack proper credentials. And
nobody is required to tell their parents, many of whom have no idea
the problem is so pervasive. Educators have downplayed the problem
but an increasing body of evidence indicates that unqualified
teachers could be the driving force behind poor educational
performance. University of Texas data from the 1996-97 school year
shows that students with properly certified teachers pass the TAAS
at higher rates than their peers with uncertified teachers. The
study also shows that the most affluent schools are more likely to
have properly certified teachers. Uncertified teachers are most
abundant in bilingual education, English as a Second Language and
computer sciences _ three key educational areas in a state that's
increasingly Hispanic and increasingly computerized. (Brooks,

with growing Southern communities. The New Llano commune lasted
just 20 years. A U.S. Army base has survived longer, but it has
never been particularly reliable. It opened and closed long often
enough to flood the town with soldiers preparing for World War II
and wars in Korea and Vietnam. Now, Leesville is struggling again.
Houses, bars, shops and a mobile home park are abandoned. There are

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINOR LANE HEIGHTS, Ky. _ When Louisville International Airport
opened the first of two new parallel runways four years ago,
residents of this town five miles away were offered a chance to
escape the new waves of noise.
</P>
<P>
   They were invited, along with other nearby residents, into one
of the country's most ambitious relocation efforts to alleviate
airplane noise: a $285 million program in state and federal grants
to buy out 3,760 property owners so they could purchase houses in
quieter neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But as the 1,700 residents of Minor Lane Heights considered
their options, they made a demand so unusual that Federal Aviation
Administration officials now say it could be a model for other
communities caught in the noisy path of progress.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than break up lifelong friends and neighbors, officials
here told the airport authorities that Minor Lane Heights residents
would agree to move only if they could stay together.
</P>
<P>
   That meant everything _ the 552 households, the nine-member
police department, Mayor Fred Williams' bright red maintenance
truck, even the Weenie Wagon, which the town purchased to sell hot
dogs at picnics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never encountered this big a deal, a community making a
decision to move this way,'' said Stan Lou, an FAA official.
</P>
<P>
   Noise is a constant challenge for the aviation agency. Each
year, it spends millions of dollars to ease the exposure of
residents near airports to the roar of jet engines. The 1998 budget
for the program was $200 million, a 28 percent increase over 1995.
In some places, the money is used to sound-proof houses. In others,
houses are bought and razed.
</P>
<P>
   Tests in Minor Lane Heights showed that sound-proofing would
have been inadequate. To honor the residents' request to stay
together, the aviation agency set up a special program with a $10
million grant, which the airport matched, to help pay for a new
site for the city.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement enabled the airport to buy 287 acres of
farmland 10 miles southeast of here and hire five home builders. By
this fall, the first 50 families are scheduled to move to their new
community, Heritage Creek, which planners say will include 351 new
houses in the first phase of construction. More homes are planned
over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The community will not be restricted to former Minor Lane
Heights residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of people, noise wasn't the biggest problem,'' said
Carole Cantrall, a City Council member who is credited with
proposing the idea of keeping the city together. ``The major
problem was living in limbo, losing their house and losing their
neighbors. Now, they're thrilled. They get to keep everything
that's important to them, plus they have a new home.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, the houses here are about 1,000 square feet, with
three bedrooms and a single bath, and Williams said they would sell
for $50,000 to $60,000 if airplane noise were not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The relocation program has agreed to buy each house and sell the
owner a lot at Heritage Creek. The owner can use the rest of the
money from the buyout to purchase a house at the new site, where
most of them will have at least three bedrooms, two baths and a
larger lot.
</P>
<P>
   The airport, which needed the runways to accommodate the growing
fleet of United Parcel Service jets that are based in Louisville,
then plans to recoup some of its investment by razing the abandoned
town and reselling land to businesses that need to be near the
airport for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of Minor Lane Heights have already taken buyouts
and moved elsewhere. But many more of the residents are awaiting
construction of their houses. In the small house here that serves
as City Hall, site plans for each section of Heritage Creek sit on
easels, and for the last month or so, residents have stopped in to
pick out lots.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like David Weedman, 34, a truck driver, and three of his
neighbors have selected lots in almost the same relation to where
they live now.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Jane Wilkerson, a City Council member, have
made plans for much bigger houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have a deck, a two-and-a-half-car garage and a
fenced yard,'' Ms. Wilkerson said, naming amenities that the house
she has lived in since 1963 lacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the residents of Minor Lane Heights or the families
living near Heritage Creek are so excited about the plan. James
Roeder, 24, a plumber who has lives here with his mother, said they
were not moving to Heritage Creek. Roeder said his mother would
move in with her ailing 74-year-old mother, who lives nearby but
outside of the area affected by noise. Roeder intends to move to
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my Mom, this had been a real hardship,'' he said. ``She is
hating this. But you've got to do what you've got to do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. David Price, pastor of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist
Church, has lived here for 13 years, presiding over a congregation
of about 40 families. Price and his wife expect to move to Heritage
Creek by 2001, but only if he can find a way to move the church,
too. If he cannot, he might move elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I talk to is going,'' he said. ``I'd just as soon
stay. But we'd be foolish not to move. What would we do for police
protection? What about vandalism? It leaves you open for too many
things.''
</P>
<P>
   People near the new community also have concerns. Some have
hired lawyers to investigate ways to stop the move, fearing that
their rural ways would be forever changed with traffic and noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic alone is going to be an astronomical problem,''
said Richard Vreeland, a real estate agent who lives beside
Heritage Creek on a two-lane road, the widest in the area. ``Having
them here is going to mean no more deer, no more wildlife, no more
peacefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to halt construction have all but stopped.
Ground-breaking ceremonies for the model homes were held two weeks
ago, and Colleen McKinley, a Louisville lawyer representing the
resistance group, said her clients had determined they could not
match the relocation program's financial resources in a legal
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Once Jefferson County approved sewer lines for the new
community, Ms. McKinley said: ``That was the final blow. It was
inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams dismissed objections from his future neighbors, saying,
``There's just a few snooty people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in fields that will soon sprout houses, he said: ``Look
at this place. Isn't it beautiful?''
</P>
<P>
   A plane flew high overhead. It passed by in silence.

`OFFICER AL'S' LECTURE BRINGS HAPPY ENDING TO GUN TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   METHUEN, Mass. _ The kids at the Maplewood Avenue bus stop were
pretty excited to find what looked to them like an old toy gun.
</P>
<P>
   That's why 11-year-old Christopher Beauchesne picked up the
handgun, after finding it while searching for a plastic action
figure he'd dropped while waiting for the school bus.
</P>
<P>
   So many parents in this neighborhood have imagined what might
have gone wrong from that moment. But disaster was avoided when a
first-grade girl remembered a lesson she had learned the day before
from ``Officer Al,'' the town's safety officer, who had visited her
classroom and lectured about handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Morganne Ackroyd began hollering loud enough for the whole block
to hear. ``I screamed: `Don't touch it because your arm will get
blown off,' '' she recalled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She was right: The handgun, which investigators suspect is the
weapon used in a triple homicide eight years ago, was still loaded.
And police believe it was the weapon used by a gunman who, after
killing three woman, later sought refuge in the home of coworker
Bob Beauchesne _ Chris's father.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Beauchesne said Thursday he thought immediately of the
triple-homicide. At the time, police had searched the area but
never recovered a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned back then becuase of all the kids around
here,'' Beauchesne said Thursday. But the killer, in the hours he
stayed with Beauchesne before turning himself in to police, ``told
me, `Don't worry about it, it's nowhere near here,' '' Beauchesne
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquim S. Alemeida, then 49, was sentenced to multiple life
sentences after the 1991 shootings.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, with Morganne Akroyd still shouting, the
eldest Akroyd girl, Kaitlynne, ran home to tell her grandmother,
who called the police.
</P>
<P>
   They recovered it still loaded with three cartridges. After
laying in the ground for years, the handgun, if fired, could have
easily exploded, police say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thank God it turned out this way,'' said Pattie Medore,
whose 11-year-old daughter was at the bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   Methuen oficer Al Torrisi noted he is only one of 35 ``safety
officers'' remaining in Massachusetts; many towns opt not to
finance them. The position is a law enforcement tradition left over
from the 1950s, when police would arrive in classrooms and tell
children not to talk to strangers and how to cross with the light.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Torrisi brings a display of handguns to school,
telling the children how many of them look like harmless toys, and
how dangerous they can be.

 &HT;    Warming risky for Big Easy
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ More bad news for the Big Easy: If the fried
oyster po'-boys don't get you, global warming will.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans, already America's fattest city, now is the U.S.
city most at risk from the effects of global climate changes such
as floods, hurricanes and a rise in sea level, a new report says.
</P>
<P>
   The city lies 3 feet below sea level and is surrounded by the
Mississippi River, Lake Pontchartrain and wetlands. If temperatures
increase and sea level rises 10 inches in the next century, as is
projected, New Orleans would be flooded, according to ``Cities at
Risk,'' a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the International Council for Local Environmental
Initiatives also says industries such as agriculture, shrimping and
fishing would be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life and property are at great risk in New Orleans from an
increase in the occurrence and severity of weather events such as
heat waves and hurricanes due to global warming,'' said Abby Young,
program coordinator for the Toronto-based council.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the scientific community thinks that human-produced
gases are disrupting the Earth's climate through the ``greenhouse
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that temperatures will rise 1.8 degrees to 6.3
degrees Fahrenheit in the 21st century, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Global warming is very much a local issue,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The council is working with 57 local governments to develop
strategies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and gradual global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   A long list of bad circumstances earned New Orleans its latest
dubious achievement award. Besides being below sea level and
surrounded by water, the problems include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The loss of wetlands. For reasons unrelated to global warming,
Louisiana is losing its coastal wetlands at an alarming rate; more
than 1,500 square miles have been lost this century and 3,000 more
will go in the next century, said Gary Groesch of the Alliance for
Affordable Energy in New Orleans. The wetlands provide a vital
buffer when a hurricane hits. Losing them would leave New Orleans
more vulnerable to severe weather, Groesch said. In addition, many
species of wildlife would lose their habitats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Insects. Wetter winters and hotter summers mean more
mosquitoes, Groesch said. And the mosquitoes that carry dengue
fever, a devastating illness normally seen in tropical climates,
have been found in Texas already and will be in Louisiana in the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
   _ High energy use. Louisiana is the second-largest energy user
in the United States behind Texas. That's because the state sells
energy to industries at a massive discount, said Paul Temblet, a
professor of environmental studies at Louisiana State University.
By itself, Louisiana contributes 1 percent of the world's carbon
dioxide production, he said. That's more than many nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industries in Louisiana get their energy at 35 percent below
the national average,'' Temblet said. ``And the industries pay four
times less than Louisiana residents. They won't get more efficient
unless they have to pay more.''
</P>
<P>
   A bill to tax energy consumption was shot down last year in the
state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that we are the state most at risk from global
climate change and yet we are contributing the most to it of any
state,'' Temblet said.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans has assembled a task force to look at the problems
of global warming, said Jerald White, who works in Mayor Marc
Morial's office. The immediate goal is to reduce the city's energy
use by 20 percent and improve hurricane and flooding evacuation
plans.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO's military leaders vowed on Thursday to
bomb state-controlled Serbian television off the air, leading to a
public clash with the alliance's civilian officials, who have not
granted the generals the authority to strike the television
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance diplomats from three different countries said NATO's
supreme commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, had been pressing for
months for authority to bomb Serbian television and radio
transmission towers around the country because, as his military
spokesman put it on Thursday, they were ``an instrument of
propaganda and repression'' for the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Paris on Thursday morning about the French role in
the bombing campaign, Gen. Jean-Pierre Kelche, chief of the French
General Staff, accused the official Yugoslav press of disseminating
``hundreds of items of disinformation.'' He said the allies wanted
to start attacking Serbian television, RTS, which has been
broadcasting official propaganda and images of destruction said to
have been caused by the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to bust their transmitters and their relay
stations,'' Kelche said. ``We consider it an extremely dangerous
tool which is warping Serb opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   But, according to an authoritative official here,
representatives of NATO nations have not given the military command
permission to go after transmission towers that are regarded as
civilian rather than military targets.
</P>
<P>
   And the alliance's top civilian, Secretary-General Javier
Solana, said the only television towers that were being attacked
were those that were linked to military or police transmission
networks. Several such targets have been hit since the bombing
began March 24, but Serbian television screens have not been
darkened.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Kelche's remarks on Thursday afternoon, Air
Commodore David Wilby of Britain, spokesman for Clark, responded
with a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb radio and television is an instrument of propaganda and
repression,'' he said. ``It has filled the airways with hate and
with lies over the years, and especially now. It is therefore a
legitimate target in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If President Milosevic would provide equal time for Western
news broadcasts in its programs, without censorship, three hours a
day between noon and 1800 and three hours a day between 1800 hours
and midnight, then his television could become an acceptable
instrument of public information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he described the statement as ``a public announcement''
and said Milosevic could consider it ``fair warning.''
</P>
<P>
   But the alliance's civilian spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, quickly
moved to qualify the warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the television transmission towers are integrated into
the command and control communications transmission nodes of the
Yugoslav armed forces, and we have been attacking therefore those
military targets, which may have had as a secondary effect damage
or destruction to those TV towers,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   One participant in the alliance's daily decision-making meetings
in the North Atlantic Council later expressed surprise at the
announcement that the television transmitters would be hit.
``That's something General Clark started,'' he said. ``He's been
saying that television is an instrument of the Serb propaganda
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Another diplomat said that because the allies insisted on
keeping civilian casualties in Serbia to a minimum, the North
Atlantic Council had refused to approve Clark's requests to knock
television off the air despite its distortion of NATO's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sensitive issue, because a lot of the allies think they
are civilian targets,'' this official said.
</P>
<P>
   Silencing the adversary's propaganda machine was one of the
first things American, French and British planes did during the
Persian Gulf War in 1991, attacking Iraq's television transmitters
in the first hour of a bombing campaign far larger than the one in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But a European diplomat said on Thursday: ``This is not a war.
It's a limited, precise, use of force to paralyze a repressive
machine.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Serbian television has been particularly irritating for the
allies. Last week, it broadcast images of Milosevic happily
chatting with Ibrahim Rugova, a leading Kosovo Albanian political
figure, as if they both could not be happier despite the bombing
and the fury of the ``ethnic cleansing'' of Rugova's people in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials say their military intelligence insists that
Rugova is in effect under house arrest, and they dismissed
Milosevic's announcement two days ago that Rugova had agreed to
negotiate a political settlement as part of a unilateral Serbian
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian television also broadcast the first images of the
American F-117A stealth fighter that was shot down on the first
weekend of the bombing, and showed the deaths and property damage
caused when a bomb fell 600 yards short of its target, an artillery
brigade headquarters, in Aleksinac.
</P>
<P>
   It has also claimed that allied bombing caused widespread damage
to Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, though Wilby said on Thursday
that the destruction had been done by marauding Serbian units, not
by NATO aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   CNN, the BBC and other Western television news organizations
have also rebroadcast Serbian television shots of bombs going off
at night around Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've used some of the Serb TV pictures, though we always mark
them very heavily,'' Vincent Ray, executive editor of BBC News,
said in a telephone interview from London. ``If they destroy
transmission facilities that Western media use, that would be an
interesting development.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a BBC correspondent, John Simpson, had a crew with him
in Belgrade that used Serbian television facilities to transmit
their own images. ``The problem is the Serbs won't let them go
around and see anything,'' he said. ``But we go to the transmission
facility to send only when we are pretty sure there won't be any
bombing.''

CHINESE LEADER SEES ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a startling addition to the usual Chinese line
on human rights, Premier Zhu Rongji said Thursday there is room to
improve human rights conditions in China and that he is impatient
with the pace of progress.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference with President Clinton, Zhu said neither
he nor President Jiang Zemin is aware of any efforts to steal US
nuclear secrets or to funnel money to Clinton's political
campaigns. He said he and Jiang have questioned Chinese military
leaders on the alleged espionage, and that they too deny any
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, who is extraordinarily animated and candid for a Chinese
leader, said China has agreed to cooperate with the US
investigation ``so long as you can provide some clues.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the two leaders were able to speak ``directly and
openly on matters where we have disagreements,'' and that ``it is
troubling that in the past year China has taken some steps
backwards on human rights'' by arresting people for their political
views. He also expressed regret that little progress has been made
in opening a dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama, the exiled
leader of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that during the talks Zhu agreed that China
would open markets to US citrus, meat products, and Pacific
Northwest wheat, and would direct all its government agencies to
use only licensed software. All these issues have been the focus of
trade frictions. He also said they struck a civil aviation
agreement which will double passenger and cargo flights between the
countries.
</P>
<P>
   However, the leaders acknowledged, agreement still eluded them
on the matter of Chinese entry to the World Trade Organization, a
primary goal of Zhu's visit. The Chinese leader said the gap
remaining between the two sides over what China must do to become
part of the international trading community is not great. The true
problem, he said, is American politics, which he believes is going
through an anti-China period.
</P>
<P>
   The press conference, held in the Old Executive Office Building,
lasted an hour and 45 minutes, one of the longest of Clinton's
presidency. Security was tight, and demonstrators for Tibetan
independence and greater human rights in China could be heard from
the entrances. But there were no incidents, and Zhu was as
good-humored as he was frank, his answers frequently evoking
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Before making his surprising comments on human rights, Zhu first
delivered the Communist Party line, stating his opposition to
American criticism of China's record at the United Nations Human
Rights Commission in Geneva, which he called unfair and ``an
interference in China's internal affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   He said differences in education and income levels also mean
people in the United States and in China have differences in their
definitions and priorities in the human rights area.
</P>
<P>
   ``So every country has its own approach.... One should not get
too impatient,'' Zhu said. ``But to tell the truth, I am more
impatient than you are in how to further constantly improve the
human rights in China.... I concede that there is room for
improvement in the human rights conditions in China.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Chinese are ``willing to listen to you (Americans),
and we are willing to have channels of dialogue on the human rights
question.''
</P>
<P>
   He said much of the rest of his visit to the United States _
which will take him to Denver, Chicago and New York, and will
conclude next Wednesday in Cambridge, Mass. with a speech and
discussion at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology _ will be
taken up with meeting and talking directly with Americans from many
walks of life to explain Chinese views and better understand
American views.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that only friends who say `yes' to you are good
friends,'' Zhu said. ``We believe that maybe the friends who are
able to say `no' to you are the best friends.''

WEB HOAX HITS WALL STREET, SERVES AS WARNING TO USERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: eWatch is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A phony Web site touting a mythical corporate takeover sent
stock prices soaring _ and then plummeting _ on Wall Street
Wednesday. It hammered home an important lesson that is often lost
in the hype about the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   You can't believe everything you read on line _ even when it's
relayed by well-meaning colleagues and friends. Rumors and hoaxes
proliferate in cyberspace, and perfectly reasonable people are
prone to believe them and pass them on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust technology more than the government,'' said Patricia
Turner, a professor of African-American studies at the University
of California at Davis and author of ``I Heard It Through the
Grapevine.'' ``The Internet seems to be a sophisticated purveyor of
information, so we think, `If it comes through expensive hardware,
it must be so.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The bogus Web site, which looked like a page of Bloomberg News
and ``reported'' the sale of an American technology company called
Pairgain Technologies Inc., was obviously the work of a
sophisticated snake-in-the-grass. And the fraud worked: Some
investors were left sheepishly counting their losses, while some
day traders, who use the Internet to capitalize on instant changes
in stock prices, undoubtedly cleared a tidy profit.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers and hoaxers who alter pages or post phony sites are as
old as the medium itself; just this week, a prankster set up a
satiric page designed to convince browsers it was the official
Senate campaign site for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York. And
cyber celebrity Matt Drudge routinely spreads rumors on his widely
read Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But the spread of misinformation on line isn't always malicious,
although it is almost always infectious. As more and more people
are relying on the Internet for information and communication, the
old-fashioned urban legend _ once passed from neighbor to neighbor
by word of mouth _ has proliferated in cyberspace. Tall tales of
horror and doom, of corruption and gloom, breed rapidly, spreading
as fast as a cold virus in a room full of toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these rumors are harmless, like the widely circulated
tale about the upscale department store that charged $250 for a
cookie recipe. Others are annoying, like the chain e-mail that
promises good luck or quick cash. But still others have the
potential to harm businesses or to inspire genuine fear.
</P>
<P>
   A few examples: Have you heard the one about designer Tommy
Hilfiger making racist statements on the Oprah Winfrey show? Have
you been warned about asbestos in tampons or air freshener that
kills pets? Have you been cautioned about kidnappers in mall
parking lots or gang members lurking on highways or needles
infected with the AIDS virus that show up in movie theaters and
coin-return slots? Have you been alerted that the Voter Rights Act
is set to expire in 2007, disenfranchising African-Americans?
</P>
<P>
   None of these stories is true. Repeat: (itals)None of these
stories is true.(unitals) But all of them have been circulating for
years via e-mail and electronic bulletin boards. Enough people
believe them to make these rumors multiply with a few taps on a
keyboard and a click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Folklorists who study such trends say these rumors proliferate
because they tap into deeply rooted societal fears. ``They touch on
our ambivalence about the things we worry about, the things that
concern us,'' Turner said. Rumors about the spread of the AIDS
virus and tall tales about stolen kidneys, for instance, reflect
common anxieties about infectious disease as well as a general
concern about the health care system. And rumors about government
conspiracies, such as the one about the Voter Rights Act, reveal an
overall societal distrust of ``official'' information.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, these stories can also stroke individual egos;
people who pass them on to friends and colleagues often feel as if
they are doing a good deed. ``It feeds a person's sense of
self-importance,'' said Barbara Mikkelson, an amateur folklorist
who with her husband, David, runs the popular urban legends
resource site http://www.snopes.com. ``They think, `If I can warn
you about this big scary thing that is happening in our world, for
that moment, I will feel like I'm in the spotlight a little bit.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The ease of transmission makes it nearly impossible to kill an
Internet rumor, no matter how outrageous, defamatory, or
potentially damaging. The Hilfiger rumor, for one, exploded on the
Internet in 1996, and it's still going strong. According to the
story, long proven false, the designer went on ``Oprah'' and said
he didn't want African-Americans or Asians to wear his pricy
signature clothing. Both Hilfiger and representatives from the show
issued denials _ Hilfiger has never even appeared on the show _ but
the tale simmers down for a while and then reemerges apace.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of story is what experts call a ``diving rumor,'' a
tale that is repeatedly debunked but refuses to die. ``It's like
one of those carnival games, where you have a mallet and you have
to hit whatever comes up,'' explained Gary Alan Fine, a sociology
professor at Northwestern University and author of ``Manufacturing
Tales.'' ``It comes up. It is batted down. Then a few weeks later,
it comes up again in another place.''
</P>
<P>
   A textbook example of a diving rumor emerged late last year.
According to the original tale, Steve Burns, host of the
Nickelodeon children's show ``Blue's Clues,'' had died in a car
crash. The rumor fizzled, but a few weeks ago, it reemerged _ with
dramatic embellishment. The new version claims that the cable
network is covering up Burns's death by using a look-alike in the
show, a tale similar to the ``Paul is dead'' stories that
circulated about Paul McCartney in the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   But this particular story didn't just affect mature adults: It
spread among young children, who were understandably distraught.
``Some people might think this is a joke, but it isn't funny for
these children,'' said Angela Santomero, the show's co-creator and
co-executive producer. ``They regard Steve as a great camp
counselor, and that's why they're so upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Anderson, a psychology professor at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst and a ``Blue's Clues'' consultant, said
the rumors were likely started by cynical adults who are put off by
the show's innocence. ``There is a resentment of the characters
that have special places in the hearts of children,'' he said.
``But these kinds of rumors can be extremely destructive and are
certainly upsetting to young children.''
</P>
<P>
   Some urban legends wreak financial, rather than emotional,
damage. As it turns out, though, one man's rumor is another man's
business opportunity: Several companies have been founded to
monitor rumors on the Internet, providing a sort of electronic
clipping service for corporate clients. In 1994, a company called
eWatch was formed specifically to help corporations track rumors on
line; it has since been bought by the Phoenix-based company
WavePhore Inc. ``Some of these rumors are difficult to kill, and
it's important to know where they're showing up,'' said eWatch
co-founder James Alexander. ``You have to be looking for smoke,
because where there's smoke, there is going to be fire.''
</P>
<P>
   For $13,000 a year, clients receive daily reports, which are
generated by computer software that scans the Internet. In one
high-profile case, eWatch stepped in to do damage control when a
rumor about Mrs. Field's cookies arose in 1995 after the verdict in
the first O. J. Simpson trial. The television show ``Hard Copy''
reported that the cookie company catered a party for the jurors, a
false story that spread like wildfire on the Internet. ``The
company had a single-digit decrease in sales that couldn't be
explained,'' Alexander said. ``The decision was made to respond,
and we went into all the areas where the rumor was appearing and
posted rebuttals. After seven to 10 days, the rumor disappeared.''

PANEL DRAFTS RULES FOR HUMAN EMBRYO STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., N.J., Tenn.)  (mk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Federally financed scientists who wish to study
human embryonic stem cells, the primordial cells from which the
body develops, came a step closer to their goal Thursday as a panel
of biologists and lawyers drafted guidelines under which the
research may go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the cells is contentious because they are derived from
human embryos and Congress has expressly forbidden federal funds to
be used for this purpose. But with enormous medical interest in
studying the cells, the general counsel of the Department of Health
and Human Services ruled in January that federally supported
researchers _ including most university-based scientists _ can
conduct research on the cells, as long as somebody else derived
them, using private money.
</P>
<P>
   But research cannot begin until the National Institutes of
Health, the chief disburser of federal medical research funds, has
issued guidelines drawn up by the director's advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's hearing, before a working group of the advisory
committee, the House Pro-Life Caucus and the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops objected strenuously to the decision to permit the
research. They echoed the position of a letter sent Wednesday by
Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., and eight other senators to Donna
Shalala, secretary of health and human services, saying that in
approving the research she would be sidestepping Congress' clear
intent by administrative fiat.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Shirley Tilghman of Princeton University, the chairwoman
of the working group, rebuffed the legal issue, saying that the
group's only task was to frame research guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Considerable discussion was devoted to arguments raised by
Richard Doerflinger of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
He accused Dr. Harold Varmus, director of the NIH, of playing with
words in defining the embryonic stem cells as ``pluripotent.''
Researchers have often called cells at this stage of development
totipotent, Doerflinger said. A totipotent cell, capable of forming
all human tissues, would be tantamount to an embryo, but a
pluripotent cell, able to make many but not all tissues, would be
something less.
</P>
<P>
   Doerflinger also said that researchers are on the brink of being
able to derive more specialized stem cells, or multipotent stem
cells, from the tissues of a patient's own body, and that these
would be more suitable than embryonic stem cells for
transplantation purposes because they would be compatible with the
patient's own immune system. Research on embryonic stem cells would
therefore be unnecessary as well as illegal, Doerflinger said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Brigid Hogan of Vanderbilt University, a member of the
working group, said that only the fertilized egg and cells from
stages preceding the blastocyst, or pre-implantation embryo, are
now regarded as totipotent. Human embryonic stem cells probably
cannot form the blastocyst's outer sphere of cells, from which the
placenta is derived.
</P>
<P>
   These cells, known as trophoblasts, are now believed to impress
an organizational structure on the embryonic cells which, if grown
by themselves, form a chaotic jumble of different tissue types, Dr.
Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Human embryonic stem cells grown in the laboratory form some
cells that have the characteristics of trophoblasts, Dr. Hogan
said, but even so did not develop into organized tissues like those
seen in a properly developing fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Human embryonic stem cells, the isolation and culture of which
was first described in November, can grow and divide indefinitely.
In principle, a single source could supply many researchers' needs.
For implanting the cells into patients, however, Dr. Hogan said a
bank of about 20 different cell lines would be needed, to include
cells compatible with the majority of human immune recognition
systems.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether embryonic stem cells or the more
specialized multipotent stem cells will prove best for
transplantation. Scientists hope that either type, when injected
into the right site in the body, would mature into the appropriate
cell type for that tissue. Stem cell research thus offers a broad
and novel approach to therapy, that of replacing diseased or worn
out tissues with brand-new source cells.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious application is in Parkinson's disease, caused by a
loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Treatments involving
injection of fetal cells have shown some promise, but embryonic
cells would in many ways be preferable.
</P>
<P>
   The study of human embryonic stem cells is also important to
researchers seeking to understand the steps in human development
and how to prevent birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between totipotent, pluripotent and multipotent
stem cells may grow less significant as research proceeds. The
pluripotent embryonic stem cells mature into the multipotent stem
cells of brain, blood and other tissues under the influence of
certain growth factors, and the multipotent stem cells then
differentiate into the specialized cell types of the body. All
cells carry the same set of genetic instructions, however, and
there is likely to be no fundamental difference between them other
than the internal switch settings occasioned by the various growth
factors to which each class of cell has been exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The draft guidelines being considered by the working group would
permit federally funded research on human embryonic stem cells to
go ahead, subject to the cells being legally and ethically derived,
including having informed consent by the donors. The group's
recommendations require further approvals, including those of the
full advisory committee and the director of the NIH.

SHELL TO GO AFTER 200 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL DEEP IN GULF OF MEXICO &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL DAVIS 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Shell Oil Co. will spend about $900 million to develop
a new deepwater Gulf of Mexico prospect named Brutus, estimated to
hold 200 million barrels of oil, the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to proceed with development on a new field of this
size underscores the industry's stance that deepwater projects will
continue on schedule despite low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Shell acquired the offshore leases for Brutus in 1985 for $15.5
million and has drilled three test and appraisal wells at the site
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deepwater projects don't come along every 90 days,'' said
Frank Knuettel, oil analyst with PaineWebber in New York. ``Just
because there has not been a major deepwater project announced in
some time does not mean anyone is backing away from their deepwater
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Shell is forging ahead in the deepwater Gulf,
officials from Shell Oil's parent Royal Dutch/Shell Group told
analysts in New York Thursday that spending on oil production will
be about $5.7 billion in 1999, down from the $6 billion projected
three months ago and the record $8.3 billion spend in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Brutus will be the 17th Gulf of Mexico deepwater project in
which Houston-based Shell is the operator or has an interest. The
company has partners on many of its other deepwater prospects but
it holds 100 percent of the Brutus project.
</P>
<P>
   Brutus is on Green Canyon Block 158, about 165 miles southwest
of New Orleans. Production is expected to begin by late 2001, and
ultimately reach a peak rate of about 100,000 barrels of oil and
150 million cubic feet of gas per day.
</P>
<P>
   The project will be developed with a tension leg platform in
2,985 feet of water with installation scheduled for mid-year 2001.
It is not the deepest spot in which Shell operates an offshore Gulf
platform; that distinction still is held by Ursa which is in 4,000
feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Tension leg platforms float partially submersed and are tethered
to the sea floor. They are used in depths ranging from 1,500 to
7,000 feet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Brutus has been talked about for the better part of a year,''
said Rich Pattarozzi, deepwater division general manager for Shell
Exploration and Production Co. in New Orleans. ``We have been
working on the evaluation of the type of system we wanted and the
cost. We just recently got project approval and we are ready to
move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The design of the Brutus platform will be similar to that of two
of Shell's other deepwater platforms: Ram-Powell and Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of Brutus, however, will be about $100 million to $200
million less than those projects, largely because the design and
fabrication of Shell's deepwater tension leg platforms are becoming
more generic after four previous similar projects.
</P>
<P>
   Shell is the top oil and gas producer in the Gulf of Mexico with
daily output of 227,000 barrels of oil and 1.3 billion cubic feet
of gas. It is also the largest leaseholder, with an interest in
1,023 leases consisting of about 5.6 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   The $900 million price tag also includes the cost of building
pipelines to move the oil and gas from the Brutus platform to
existing pipelines in the Gulf which will then move the oil and gas
onshore.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The Yugoslav government asserted Thursday
that ``peace has been restored in Kosovo,'' declared an end to its
military offensive and urged all refugees to return home while new
political arrangements are negotiated for the province. NATO
dismissed the statements and said its bombing campaign would
continue.
</P>
<P>
   The government announcement said that under an accord between
President Slobodan Milosevic and the pacifist ethnic Albanian
leader, Ibrahim Rugova, ``a process of return of displaced persons
from Kosovo, predominantly of Albanian nationality, has been
initiated.'' Rugova is reported to be in the Kosovo capital,
Pristina, under Serbian police protection, but it is not clear
under what conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement appealed to all citizens of Kosovo to remain
home or to return there, and ``to live together and cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, which announced a unilateral cease-fire on
Tuesday, called on NATO to stop the bombing, saying, ``Clearly,
NATO's criminal activities are aimed against all those who strive
for a joint life, peace, unity, and understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for NATO and the United States quickly derided the
declaration as double-speak and propaganda. P.J. Crowley, a White
House spokesman, called the declaration part of Milosevic's ``charm
offensive,'' and said, ``Words and propaganda are not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding as they had to Milosevic's cease-fire call, NATO
officials vowed to continue their bombing war against Yugoslavia.
The alliance has declared that the price for an end to the bombing
is for Milosevic to grant full political autonomy to Kosovo,
withdraw the vast part of his forces and allow foreign troops to
police the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   With reporters barred from Kosovo and most of Serbia, it has
been difficult to assess either the effectiveness of the NATO
bombing, or the veracity of Milosevic's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Even the whereabouts of the tens of thousands of Albanians who
were turned back at the Albanian and Macedonian borders, which were
unexpectedly sealed by the Serbs, remain unknown Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   From all available indications, the bombing has done substantial
damage to Yugoslavia's infrastructure and its military. But it is
having no evident effect on Milosevic's refusal to capitulate to
earlier alliance demands that he allow 30,000 NATO peacekeepers
into Kosovo, and popular support for Serbia's stand against NATO
still seems strong.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, for instance, residents of the Serbian city of
Novi Sad gathered again on their one remaining bridge across the
Danube River, thus putting their lives at risk if NATO was to bomb
it. Two other bridges in Novi Sad have been demolished by allied
bombs. Residents of Belgrade have similarly gathered on their
bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley and other Western diplomats said they expected Milosevic
to try to stop the bombing once he had largely completed his
military offensive against the insurgent Kosovo Liberation Army,
which Belgrade terms ``terrorists and separatists.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO said earlier in the day that Yugoslav forces appeared to be
continuing their offensive in Kosovo, laying mines and continuing
to attack dwindling rebel strongholds, while claiming that the
Kosovo Liberation Army was doing its best to fight back with NATO
air support.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance, for its part, has said Rugova is under duress and
is not acting freely in his dealings with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia, which Washington has asked to explore a diplomatic
solution with Milosevic, has already urged the West to build on the
Yugoslav cease-fire, stop the bombing and begin new negotiations
for a lasting settlement. And Russian officials insist that Rugova
is acting as a peacemaker, not a puppet or quisling.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is probably prepared to accept the essence of the
Western-drafted peace plan for Kosovo negotiated at Rambouillet,
France, so long as the issue of foreign troops can be fudged. While
Washington had demanded a NATO-led force of 30,000 troops to enter
Kosovo for three years, the Serbs may accept a smaller force under
the rubric, at least, of the United Nations or the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, where Russia is a full member.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, some Western diplomats believe, is counting on the
desire in the alliance to end this war before NATO's 50th
anniversary celebration in Washington on April 24 and before public
pressure to put ground troops into Kosovo becomes too strong.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be difficult for Milosevic, with his tightly
controlled media, to declare some form of victory, even in partial
defeat. But that task may be harder for NATO, which must be seen to
``win'' its first war against a sovereign nation to maintain its
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   So even Milosevic is unlikely to expect NATO to accept his
proclamation that peace has come to Kosovo, even if it is the peace
of a charnel house.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement nonetheless provided some momentum to the
possibility that three captured American soldiers might soon be
released. If the Yugoslavs, having declared a unilateral
cease-fire, now consider the war over, a Central European diplomat
here suggested, ``there is no reason now to hold these Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the Cypriot Parliament, Spyros Kyprianou, arrived
late Thursday afternoon in Belgrade to try to free the three
Americans, and he is expected to see Milosevic on Friday, which is
the Eastern Orthodox Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO arranged a halt in its air war to enable Kyprianou's plane,
on loan from the Greek Air Force, to land in Belgrade and drop him
off here.
</P>
<P>
   The three U.S. Army soldiers _ Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24,
of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths
Creek, Mich., and Specialist Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville,
Texas _ were captured along the Yugoslav-Macedonia border on March
31. U.S. officials have accused the Serbs of abducting the three,
but the Serbs say the men were captured after entering Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On arrival here, Kyprianou said the Americans might be freed
over the weekend. ``NATO could reciprocate by responding to the
numerous international appeals for a cease-fire at least over the
Orthodox Easter weekend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the three American soldiers are released, they will be flown
to Cyprus, and then are expected to be flown to an American
military hospital in Germany for a checkup and debriefing.
</P>
<P>
   American officials insisted that they would welcome the
unconditional release of the men as a good-will gesture, but that
there would be no cease-fire granted or concessions made to secure
their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said Thursday: ``The release
must be unconditional. These men have been abducted and taken and
are being held improperly and illegally. They should be returned
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said Thursday in
Washington that ``any attempt to use the three as bargaining chips
is both illegal and immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials gave mixed signals earlier Thursday about the
possible release of three captured American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav information minister, Milan Komnenic, promised
``good news'' about the three soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could just tell you, assure you that you will have good
news,'' Komnenic, who is regarded as relatively liberal, told the
France-Info radio station. When asked to explain, he said, ``I
can't say precisely how, in what way, but do not worry.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Serbian deputy prime minister, the hard-line nationalist
Vojislav Seselj, told reporters that freeing the soldiers was ``out
of the question,'' because ``the United States is leading an
undeclared war against Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is Milosevic who will decide.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing the Yugoslav government's statement on Kosovo,
state television also responded to NATO announcements Thursday that
television offices and transmitters might be targeted unless
Western news programming were also shown for six hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   In a long and bitter commentary, Belgrade Television's foreign
editor, Tatjana Lenart, said, ``We know we are your next target.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lenart, who is also a high official of the Yugoslav Left
party of Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic, scoffed at the NATO
demand for six hours of air time. ``We will give them six hours if
they will give us at least six minutes in exchange on their
channels,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know a lot, and we don't hide anything, which is why you
want to shut us up,'' she continued. ``We only have the word, we
only have the truth, and truth is what you find so painful.''
</P>
<P>
   She concluded by saying: ``We are here at Takovska 10, and there
are several thousands of us here. We are here night and day, and we
know you prefer to kill at night.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at night the television center has been largely empty
for fear of bombing, and technicians have been working in wartime
bunkers, employees say.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and China's Prime Minister, Zhu
Rongji, fell short Thursday of reaching a major trade deal that
China has long sought, even though the two leaders said they made
tremendous progress in negotiations to usher China into the
organization that sets the rules for global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Although the announcement by Clinton that ``we are not quite
there yet'' came well short of the hopes both leaders had harbored
for China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, it had the
virtue of giving Clinton and Zhu more time to prepare their
constituencies at home for an agreement that faces fierce
opposition in both capitals.
</P>
<P>
   At a 90-minute news conference Thursday, the blunt-talking
Chinese prime minister blamed what he termed an ``anti-Chinese''
mood in Washington, saying, ``If you want to hear some honest
words, then I should say that now the problem does not lie with
this big difference, or big gap'' in negotiating positions, ``but
lies with the political atmosphere.'' If it were not for that, he
said, China and the United States would be ready to sign ``a
full-package agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Both business executives and China experts expressed surprise at
the scope of some of Beijing's concessions _ some of which may have
as much political resonance as economic impact. For the first time,
for example, China agreed to permit American telecommunications
companies to control Chinese cellular telephone firms and Internet
companies, and operate throughout the vast country of 1.2 billion
people. How China would square that with its efforts to quash
political opposition and limit Internet access was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues left outstanding, though, were some that
directly affect two of President Clinton's most high-profile
constituencies: Wall Street and Hollywood. China has refused to let
American brokerages into its free-for-all stock markets, and it
wants to restrict the number of American movies that can be
released in its theaters, arguing that it must limit what one
Chinese official recently called ``cultural pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   The days of furious negotiations were overshadowed Thursday
afternoon, however, as Zhu used the news conference to take on
China's critics with a vehemence and a directness that no Chinese
leader has ever shown on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   He invoked Abraham Lincoln's use of force to keep the Union
together as an example China should keep in mind as it deals with
Taiwan, which Beijing considers a breakaway province _ a comparison
Clinton stepped in to reject. He derided reports that China stole
nuclear weapons secrets, and mocked allegations that China sought
to influence the 1996 Presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have $146 billion dollars of foreign exchange reserves,''
said the man who has overseen China's profound economic transition
in recent years, ``so I should have put out at least $10 billion
for that purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why just $300,000?'' he asked, referring to the amount of
campaign contributions investigators say originated from Chinese
military intelligence. ``That would be too foolish!'' he said, as
the audience laughed and Clinton cracked a smile.
</P>
<P>
   And even in human rights, the perpetual area of dispute, Zhu
first attacked the American decision to win an international
condemnation of its political crackdown, and then tried disarming
his critics by partially agreeing with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am more impatient that you are'' to change China's human
rights environment, he said, suggesting that his country was still
struggling under the hangover of thousands of years of a feudal
system.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meetings came amid a clear effort by Clinton to
embrace Zhou as the kind of Chinese reformer he can deal with _ an
embrace similar to the one Washington extended a decade ago to the
Soviet Union's Mikhail Gorbachev. Although he is a clear No. 2 to
President Jiang Zemin, who came here a year ago, the 70-year-old
Zhu received most of the trappings of a state visit.
</P>
<P>
   On Washington's first warm spring day, the economic reformer who
talks openly about dismantling Mao's system of state-owned
industries was given a 19-gun salute, full military honors and a
welcome from President Clinton that included thanks for China's
willingness 200 years ago to give ``our newly independent nation
equal standing with the powers of Europe.'' He was clearly
suggesting that the United States, by guiding China into the WTO,
intended to return the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Clinton hosted a glittering official dinner and
invited business executives and academics with ties to China, with
a performance by Yo-Yo Ma, one of the world's premier cellists.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu seemed relieved by the welcome. Asked Thursday why he came
to the United States at this difficult moment in the two countries'
relations, he said: ``Are you asking me to tell you the truth? To
tell you the truth, I was really reluctant to come,'' adding that
he had asked a delegation of American congressmen and senators in
Beijing last week ``Will my `new face' be turned into a bloody
face?''
</P>
<P>
   But he came to Washington as Congress was out of session,
meaning that he did not have to confront China's critics on the
Democratic left and the Republican right, who appear to be joining
forces in opposing China's entry to the WTO. In fact, Clinton's
aides acknowledged Thursday that any trade deal with China would
become enmeshed in the debates about nuclear spying, stepped-up
political repression and a soaring trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting this through the Hill is going to be a killer,'' a
senior administration official said.

 WASHINGTON: official said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton and Zhu met in two separate sessions that, participants
say, was far more sober and businesslike than their public
performance later in the day. They discussed _ and disagreed on _
Kosovo Thursday morning in a small session attended by National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, the cabinet member
who has most frequently encountered the Chinese premier. Chinese
leaders fear that the precedent of international intervention over
a rebellious province could easily be applied to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   At a larger meeting with other aides present, Zhu repeated his
vow not to devalue the Chinese currency, the yuan. Rubin and others
fear that a devaluation could re-ignite the Asian financial crisis.
They argued briefly on Clinton's plans to develop a missile defense
system in Asia, one ostensibly intended to protect American troops
from North Korean missiles, but a system the Chinese believe could
ultimately be used to defend Taiwan against Chinese missiles.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, veering into a discussion of Tibet, Zhu and
Clinton discussed the possibility of using the Vatican as a conduit
for discussions between Chinese leaders and the Dalai Lama, the
exiled religious leader of the Himilayan territory. In public, the
Dalai Lama is denounced as a religious fraud by Chinese diplomats;
the private conversation about opening a secret channel to him,
which White House officials refused to confirm Thursday night, was
calm and businesslike, according to several people familiar with
it.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday evening the main American negotiator on
the trade issues, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky,
described China's willingness to open its markets in agriculture,
telecommunications, banking, insurance and other areas as ``very
sweeping.'' She suggested that final agreement was near _ but that
negotiators had simply run out of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that any of the remaining issues are
show-stoppers,'' she said. ``I would expect fairly rapid
resolution'' that would pave the way for China to join the WTO by
the time it hold a ministerial meeting in Seattle in November.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, executives of several companies said they were
surprised by the last-minute concessions that China made, some of
which are bound to open Zhu up to criticism that he is leaving
Chinese enterprises too vulnerable too soon to foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications agreement _ allowing foreign control of
cell phone networks, Internet providers and other ``value added
services'' _ came as a surprise. But while the business
opportunities for the likes of Motorola Corporation or AT&AMP;T _ along
with their Japanese and European competitors _ are obvious, such
accords usually run into myriad obstacles on the ground. And over
the years, the Chinese have shown that they understand that
Internet connections and a vast cell phone networks are a price of
joining the global economy, even if they dilute Beijing's ability
to control dissent and outside information.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the accord hint at a broadening of economic
freedom. China agreed to allow 100 percent foreign ownership of
commercial banks within five years _ almost all are now joint
ventures _ and they will be permitted for the first time to handle
individual Chinese accounts. That creates the possibility that a
worker in Xian would be able to deposit his savings at Citibank,
even if he would still face restrictions on moving his money
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are things that five years ago the Chinese wouldn't even
talk about,'' Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs
International, said Thursday morning, as Zhu and President Clinton
reviewed the military guard stretching across the South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese were unwilling to let foreign brokerages compete
for Chinese customers. They argue that an uncontrolled flow of
foreign capital worsened the Asian crisis, and they have no desire
to repeat the experience. But administration officials said they
believed China's reluctance had more to do with protectionism,
noting that they could keep in place strict rules on capital flows
in and out of the country.

 JURORS BEGIN DELIBERATING CONTEMPT CASE AGAINST SUSAN McDOUGAL 
 (rk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ A federal jury of six men and six women
began deliberating Thursday whether Susan McDougal is guilty of
criminal contempt and obstruction of justice for refusing to talk
to a grand jury about the Arkansas financial dealings of Bill and
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDougal's trial, now in its fifth week, is one of the
remaining loose ends in the once-sprawling Whitewater
investigation, now evidently winding down. She is almost certainly
the last person to go on trial in Arkansas in connection with the
investigation, which began with an examination of the Clintons'
role in the Whitewater real estate venture and eventually led to
the impeachment drama in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDougal has proved to be one of the most intriguing of
Whitewater figures, having already spent 18 months in jail for
civil contempt because of her unwillingness to testify before the
grand jury. She argued at the time, and then repeatedly at her
trial, that her refusal was principled, based on a belief that
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, was determined
to prosecute the Clintons at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   In her trial testimony, she maintained that she had feared being
indicted for perjury as a result of any grand-jury testimony she
gave that did not implicate the Clintons in wrongdoing. She
compared Starr's tactics to those of the Nazis, a theme that her
lawyer, Mark Geragos, repeated in closing arguments to the jury on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a witness at her trial, Ms. McDougal responded to the
very questions she had refused to answer, telling the jury she had
no knowledge of wrongdoing by the Clintons. Prosecutors tried to
turn this testimony to their advantage, arguing that she had
withheld information that would have helped the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what's absolutely reprehensible,'' Mark Barrett, one of
the prosecutors, told the jury. ``She had information that
exonerated President Clinton, and she kept that information from
the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   In their closing arguments, Barrett and another prosecutor,
Julie Myers, offered a simple outline of their case. Ms. McDougal,
they noted, was given immunity from prosecution and then ordered by
a federal judge to answer questions from the grand jury, and she
refused.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant is a woman given to dramatic posturing, they
contended, and her refusal to testify had more to do with her
eagerness for public attention than with any point of principle she
professed to be making.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDougal and her husband, James McDougal, were partners with
the Clintons in the Whitewater venture, nestled in the Arkansas
Ozarks, when Clinton was governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Among other matters, Starr's prosecutors investigated whether
Clinton had improperly pressed for a federally guaranteed loan to
Ms. McDougal, part of whose proceeds were later used to help prop
up the failing enterprise. This was a chief issue that Ms. McDougal
refused to address before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   That grand jury, here in Arkansas, has already disbanded, as has
the Starr grand jury in Washington, which dealt primarily with the
president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starr's aides have declined to say whether they are wrapping up
their work, but he has only one remaining grand jury, in Virginia,
and after Ms. McDougal the prosecutors are scheduled to bring to
trial only two other defendants: Julie Hiatt Steele, charged with
obstructing justice and making false statements in the Kathleen
Willey episode, and Webster Hubbell, charged with tax evasion in an
indictment that suggests he was paid to remain silent about his
knowledge of the Clintons' business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration of the McDougal case's secondary nature, the
prosecutors here suggested that they might not oppose leniency if
the defendant was convicted. Speaking to reporters, Barrett noted
that Ms. McDougal had already served a year and a half in jail for
civil contempt, as well as three and a half months on her 1996
Whitewater fraud conviction, a term that was cut short because of
her health problems.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would be ``totally appropriate'' to take those
punishments into account in determining a sentence other than
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weeks of testimony and argument, the defense
strategy was to put Starr and his fellow prosecutors on trial with
arguments that they had abused other figures in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Judge George Howard Jr. allowed Geragos, Ms. McDougal's lawyer,
great leeway, even permitting him to call as a witness Ms. Steele,
who has been indicted because of her testimony that Ms. Willey
never told her of being groped by the president. Like Ms. McDougal,
Ms. Steele told the jurors, she has been victimized for not telling
the prosecutors what they wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end Howard told the jury that it was Ms. McDougal,
and no one else, who was on trial. He also instructed the jury that
she could not use as a defense that she had had a moral or ethical
reason for refusing to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors recessed Thursday evening and are to resume on
Friday.

US MAY DROP PLAN TO BRING REFUGEES TO GUANTANAMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Days after pledging to take up to 20,000 Kosovo
refugees at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Clinton
administration officials said Thursday that the plan has been put
on hold and may be shelved.
</P>
<P>
   J. Brian Atwood, the head of the US Agency for International
Development and coordinator of the Kosovo refugee plan, said
Thursday that the transfer of refugees to Guantanamo has been put
on hold for at least this week because the Kosovo refugees don't
want to leave the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't walking back on the strategy,'' Atwood said. ``The
pressure to move people out...isn't as great. We know people would
prefer to stay in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that anyone in our government is that
enthusiastic'' about sending the refugees to the naval base, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, officials insisted the plan to send refugees to
Guantanamo had never been finalized and the initial stage of the
crisis was passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immediate crisis of them having food and some shelter, the
majority of that seems to be take care of,'' said Rear Admiral
Thomas R. Wilson, director for intelligence of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. ``We'll start being more deliberate in where they move, and
the decision for them to go to Guantanamo has not been made yet.''
</P>
<P>
   These optimistic-sounding statements were made even as reports
from the Kosovo region showed that tens of thousands of refugees
are living in squalid conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Guantanamo plan had come under sharp criticism from human
rights advocates, including some who expressed their displeasure to
White House officials Thursday. Some human rights advocates have
said that the conditions at Guantanamo are comparable to a
low-security prison. They have also criticized the administration
for refusing to open US borders to the refugees and allow them to
apply for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration said the plan was being suspended
because the crisis had eased, some foreign policy analysts said the
reason had more to do with a realization by the administration that
the refugee transfer would be a public relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a horrible mistake'' to announce the Guantanamo plan,
said Sherle Schwenninger, senior fellow at the World Policy
Institute. He said US officials probably realized after announcing
the plan that it could be a replay of what happened when Haitian
refugees were housed at Guantanamo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you remember the images of refugees of Haitians behind
barbed wire, this would have been a PR nightmare,'' he said.
Schwenninger said the United States bears some responsibility for
the refugees crisis and has a ``moral responsibility'' to open US
borders to the displaced Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed meeting Thursday with administration officials, more
than 20 non-governmental organizations urged the White House to
reconsider its plans to use Guantanamo for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very strongly that they ought to stop in their tracks
and rethink this whole operation,'' said John Fredriksson,
associate executive director of the US Committee for Refugees, who
did not attend the meeting but was familiar with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that the Cuban government, while
condemning NATO military action against Yugoslavia, has no
objection to the use of Guantanamo as a refugee haven and also
offered to cooperate in providing assistance.

NORTHWEST FARMERS `ELATED' OVER U.S.-CHINA WHEAT AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a major victory for Washington state's
struggling farmers, China yesterday agreed to drop its 27-year ban
on the importation of Pacific Northwest wheat.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and President
Clinton announced at a joint news conference, was greeted with
jubilation by Washington's wheat farmers and elected officials who
have been jealously eying China's 1 billion consumers as a
potential market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are elated over this,'' said Thomas Mick, chief executive
officer of the Washington Wheat Commission. ``This could mean a
real boon for our area.''
</P>
<P>
   Dropping its longstanding objections to Northwest wheat was one
of a series of trade concessions China made as part of its
thus-far-unsuccessful bid to win admission to the World Trade
Organization. China also agreed to relax barriers against the
importation of U.S. citrus and meat products, and agreed to take a
step toward cracking down on computer software piracy, an important
issue to Microsoft, Nintendo, and other Seattle-area companies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the moves ``an important agreement that will open
China's markets for U.S. exports of citrus, meat products, and
Pacific Northwest wheat, all highly important for our farmers.''
Zhu said the concessions ``will further promote the development of
friendship and cooperation between China and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The two countries plan in coming months to continue negotiations
over Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization, with the
White House hopeful of reaching a deal before WTO trade ministers
gather in Seattle in November.
</P>
<P>
   China in the past has refused to accept any wheat that comes
through ports in the Pacific Northwest because of the presence of a
disease-bearing fungus, or smut, called Tilletia controversa kuhn
(TCK), that affects wheat crops. U.S. officials have insisted that
the contamination is minor, could not spread to Chinese wheat crops
because of differing climactic conditions, and is harmless to
people.
</P>
<P>
   Under yesterday's agreement, China agreed to abide by the
findings of international scientists who have found that a low
level of TCK smut does not pose a risk to Chinese wheat crops or
consumers. U.S. wheat growers said they will have no problem
staying below the low level of TCK smut tolerance agreed to by
China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese also agreed to reduce tariffs on U.S. wheat from 20
percent to 1 percent for the first 7.3 million metric tons.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat is Washington state's largest agricultural export, and
both of the state's U.S. senators have devoted considerable energy
to this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., has repeatedly tried to use her
friendship with Clinton administration officials and her belief in
constructive engagement with Chinese officials to push the issue,
while Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has repeatedly hammered the
Clinton administration and China to do more to resolve the wheat
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This potentially means several hundred millions of dollars of
sales of our wheat to China,'' Murray said yesterday. ``Our wheat
farmers have really been hurt in the last several years because of
the Asian (economic) crisis, and this is a major boon for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton was effusive in his praise for the Clinton
administration, and in particular U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time when I've got to offer my congratulations to
the (Clinton) administration, because this is a major
accomplishment,'' Gorton said. ``This is about as good news as
Washington farmers have gotten in years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton warned removing barriers is only half the battle,
because the Chinese still have to decide to make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been occasions when the Chinese have nominally
removed trade barriers and nothing has taken place as a result,''
Gorton said. ``The real proof here will be with the first set of
orders.''
</P>
<P>
   China is a major producer of wheat, but it is also a large
consumer, and frequent weather woes have led it to import large
quantities of wheat in some years. Washington farmers believe that
the soft white wheat grown in the Northwest is particularly
suitable for a number of Chinese dietary staples, such as steamed
bread, a wrapping called suey gow, and various confectionery
products.
</P>
<P>
   Orders by China are likely to depend on many factors,
particularly the weather in China. Over the past decade, China has
imported anywhere from 2 million to 16 million metric tons of wheat
per year from such countries as Australia, Canada and France.
</P>
<P>
   According to Karen Fegley, the director of the Wheat Export
Trade Education Committee, U.S. growers should have a shot at
selling about 8 million metric tons of wheat to China a year.
Currently, wheat is selling for between $120 and $140 a metric ton.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal on software, reached on Wednesday, the Chinese
government agreed to order all government entities to use only
legally purchased software. The U.S. government issued a similar
directive in October 1998, and Paraguay, Thailand, Turkey, the
Philippines, Korea and Jordan have issued similar decrees in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is significant because China has one of the highest
piracy rates in the world _ 96 percent of software in China is
pirated _ and because governments are the largest users of
software,'' said Anne Gavin, spokeswoman for the Business Software
Alliance. Gavin said her group will be monitoring Chinese behavior
to see if the order is enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, said the software
pact could have a trickle-down effect on the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a milestone in China's efforts to increase
intellectual property protection,'' she said. ``The Chinese
government's action ... sets an important example for the Chinese
private sector and for other national governments as well. The
Chinese decree is particularly significant given the size and rapid
expansion of the Chinese market for personal computers, now the
world's fifth largest.''

EUROPEAN RATE CUT SENDS U.S. STOCK GAUGES TO RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Europeans cut interest rates Thursday, igniting stock
markets in mid-session here, and all three major market gauges
climbed more than 1 percent to new records.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were again among the pacesetters, but they were
joined by such recently lagging blue chips as Coca-Cola and
Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing, which have suffered from sluggish
European operations. Another standout was Wal-Mart Stores, which
jumped 4} to 102\, one of several retailers reporting very strong
March sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of the market seems to be coming from the bond
side,'' said Philip Orlando, the chief investment officer at Value
Line Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Lower interest rates not only tend to make stocks relatively
more appealing but also reduce such business costs as carrying
inventory or investing in new machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was little reaction to an early rate cut by the
Bank of England, a larger-than-expected cut by the European Central
Bank shortly after noon galvanized investors and lifted prices
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average had gained 112.39
points to 10,197.70, just over 11 percent higher than at the
beginning of the year. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose
17.09 points, to 1,343.98, and the technology-driven Nasdaq market
rebounded from Wednesday's slump to gain 28.96 points to 2,573.39.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices advanced along a broad front, with the bellwether
30-year Treasury issue rising 26/32 of a point to 97 5/32, to push
its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, down to a
six-week low of 5.44 percent from 5.50 percent Wednesday. Rates on
5-year and 10-year Treasury securities _ the latter a benchmark for
home mortgages _ eased even more.
</P>
<P>
   With inflation in this country remarkably benign in the ninth
year of an uninterrupted economic expansion, U.S. Treasury
securities offer some of the best rates of return among global bond
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Initially in Thursday's session, rates were little changed as
investors looked largely in vain for signs of cooling economic
growth. Another factor was Fannie Mae, which was tapping the market
for $3 billion. Dealers who had sold Treasuries as a hedge suddenly
were forced to scramble for cover as the market rallied on the
larger-than-expected half-point cuts by the European Central Bank.
Fannie Mae's 10-year notes were sold at a price to yield 5.716
percent, or about 59 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage
point, more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate cuts caught those who had set short positions leaning
the wrong way,'' said Daniel Antonellis, market analyst at
Briefing.com, an analytical firm in Menlo Park, Calif. But he added
that they ``gave the market much needed direction, particularly
with the Federal Reserve on hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the financial sector, which included gains of 3{ to 87~
for Chase Manhattan and 3 11/16 to 52\ for Republic New York, hefty
gains were widespread among drug and oil companies. Lilly, Abbott
and Pfizer all rose about 3 points, while Chevron jumped to a
record before closing at 93}, up 3 13/16 points for the day. Oil
prices have rebounded smartly in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's biggest gainer was Union Carbide, which surged 5{ to
51] on revived speculation that the chemical company may be
acquired. General Electric eased | to 113~ after an earnings report
that matched, but did not surpass, profit expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage stocks rose again but generally less than Wednesday.
An exception was a 10-point gain, to 84, for Knight/Trimark Group,
a market-maker in Nasdaq and other securities; it traded as low as
4{ six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest advance did little to remedy what Alan Ackerman,
market strategist at Fahnestock, called a bifurcated market in
which household names keep going up, while most others are ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big-cap stocks are in a bull market, while the small-cap
stocks appear to be in a bear market,'' he said. The S&AMP;P is now up
more than 9 percent so far this year while the Russell 2000,
composed of smaller companies, is down more than 5 percent. The
Russell rose 53/100 of 1 percent Thursday, less than half the 1.29
percent gain for the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange volume expanded to 850.56 million
shares from 816.41 Wednesday.

HUMANA SAYS 1ST QUARTER PROFIT WILL NOT MEET FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Resurrecting concerns about whether managed-care companies do
much real managing, starting with their own businesses, Humana Inc.
said Thursday that its first-quarter profit would come in well
below forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its operating profit would be 20 to 24 cents a
share in the quarter, down 30 percent from earlier projections.
Additionally, the company will take a $90 million charge for a
renegotiated contract with Florida hospitals and reserves to cover
future costs, which will probably lead to a net loss for the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The profit warning comes because underlying costs of care in
hospitals and doctors' offices are rising faster than expected,
faster even than the double-digit percentile increases in premiums
that Humana charged its customers this year.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it seemed like deja vu all over again, replaying
investors' nightmares dating to 1996 when, one after the other,
managed-care companies acknowledged mistakes in their cost
projections. One difference this time: Health insurance companies
are having better success in raising premiums. This year, Humana
raised rates by 11 percent to 12 percent for big health plans and
15 percent to 16 percent for smaller groups with fewer than 100
members. It plans to seek more increases before the year is out.
</P>
<P>
   But expenses are climbing even faster as patients use more
medical services and managed-care companies encounter growing
resistance to cutbacks on payments.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are consolidating, raising their ability to resist
demands for lower fee arrangements. Doctor groups are seeking
higher payments, and some are apparently making up for reduced
payments by seeing more patients more often. And health plan
members are demanding expensive drugs, stimulated by billion-dollar
ad campaigns by drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance companies themselves are increasingly reluctant to
say no to their members' requests for care, especially while
Congress considers patients' right bills that would open health
plans to medical malpractice lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Humana prides itself on knowing its business better than most.
Even so, it was surprised by a 20 percent surge in prescription
drug costs and substantial increases in the length of hospital
stays and visits to emergency rooms. Industry surveys point to
similar cost growth nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Wolf, the company's president and chief executive, said
it was hard to imagine that other managed-care companies would not
face similar problems. He noted that Milliman &AMP; Robertson, a
benefits consulting firm, recently said that health costs rose 8.5
percent in November, exceeding the 6 percent to 7 percent the
firm's actuaries had projected.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a survey by Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette found that
employers were ``already seeing significant medical cost
acceleration,'' Mimi Willard, a Donaldson vice president, said.
</P>
<P>
   On a day of rising stock prices, Humana led a broad decline in
managed-care stocks, plunging $5, or 33 percent, to $10.0625, a
52-week low, before rebounding to $12.1875, still a drop of 25
percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   United Healthcare was down $6 a share, to $44.6875; Pacificare
Health Systems fell $6.4375, to $61.3125; Wellpoint Health Networks
dropped $5.25, to $69.875; Cigna fell $4.4375, to $82.25, and Aetna
slid $2.4375, to $78.0625. But one company, Tenet Healthcare, rose
more than 20 percent even though it reported lower earnings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Humana may have been squeezed harder than most HMO companies. It
said that a new two-year contract with Florida hospitals of
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. would add $50 million to expenses,
while a squeeze on government payments for Medicare HMOs would be
passed along to Medicare beneficiaries in reduced benefits next
year. Humana is one of the biggest operators of Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Many Columbia hospitals trace their origins to Humana, which was
able to negotiate below-market rates in the past, Wolf said. When
Columbia sold its hospitals in places like Louisville, Ky., Chicago
and San Antonio, the chain had less at stake in negotiations with
Humana, threatening at one point to ``walk away'' from its
contract, Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Walter, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that hospital
costs had been rising after several years of ``trending down.'' She
added that hospital companies could not reduce the days that
patients stay in a hospital beyond a certain point. ``There is only
so much you can squeeze out with managed care,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Humana, which was involved in merger and
acquisition talks last year, was still financially strong. Wolf
said Humana's modest 2.7 percent profit margin _ typical in the
industry _ would continue to deteriorate in the second and third
quarters before rebounding in the fourth. He said the company had
``terrific cash flows'' and a strong balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Albers, an analyst with Deerfield Partners, which manages
health care stock funds, said Humana's problems ``show what a lag
this industry has in trying to figure out what costs are.'' HMOs
collect premiums and set aside reserves that they hope will cover
costs when medical bills arrive later. She added: ``It's a
constantly changing picture. You really don't know the real answer
until six months after the fact, or even longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Sherlock, an independent managed-care analyst, said:
``Estimating medical reserves is like shooting a rocket to the
moon. If you're off by one degree, you end up shooting somebody
else's moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said the
managed-care companies would have to ``raise prices faster and do a
better job of managing costs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People get sick and technology gets created and drug companies
want more money,'' he added. ``The question is, when are HMOs going
to charge corporate America for what they want?''

 &HT;    Delta plans to replace some flights with ASA
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines this summer will replace certain
flights in the Southeast with service by Atlantic Southeast
Airlines, the regional feeder in which Delta recently bought a
majority stake.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Delta will expand its own service on long-haul
markets between Atlanta and the western United States.
</P>
<P>
   The moves reflect Delta's plans to use the ASA acquisition to
more closely integrate the two carriers' operations.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta said ASA will add flights between Atlanta
and five Southeastern cities on June 1. Delta still will offer its
own flights on those routes but will reduce the number.
</P>
<P>
   Cities affected are Augusta; Montgomery, Ala.; and Daytona
Beach, Melbourne and Tallahassee, Fla. ASA will use 50-seat
regional jets for the flights, Delta said.
</P>
<P>
   ASA also begins regional jet flights between Atlanta and Islip,
N.Y., on Aug. 1, creating the only nonstop service to the Long
Island airport from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Delta is adding one additional flight to four
Western cities: Denver and San Antonio on June 1; San Francisco on
July 1; and San Diego, July 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``In more closely integrating ASA's and Delta's schedules at the
Atlanta hub, Delta takes advantage of the opportunity to reallocate
larger jets to long-haul markets'' that are often more profitable,
said Mark A.P. Drusch, Delta's senior vice president-network
management.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Delta rival AirTran said it will add a fifth
daily flight between Atlanta and Jacksonville, Fla., and a fourth
daily flight between Atlanta and Greensboro, N.C., on May 16.

 &HT;    Delta set to scrap 'Top of World' ads
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines is coming down from ``On Top of the
World.''
</P>
<P>
   The carrier is ditching its 2-year-old advertising slogan and
has put its agency to work on a new one that will debut this fall
in a fresh image-building campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can bury that tag line at this point,'' said Martin White,
recently installed as vice president for consumer marketing at
Atlanta-based Delta.
</P>
<P>
   He said the slogan, which sought to convey worldliness and
success, instead seemed vague and out of touch _ especially when
packaged in ethereal TV spots with chantlike theme music and
floating balloons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customers didn't understand it, and the employees didn't
buy into it,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ``On Top of the World'' TV spots will keep airing on
a limited basis until the new campaign is ready.
</P>
<P>
   The next tag line and campaign are being developed by Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi, the New York agency Delta switched to in 1997 after 51
years with BBDO South. The ``On Top of the World'' campaign was
Saatchi's first for Delta and was authorized by the carrier's old
management, much of which has been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of Delta's next advertising approach may be seen in a
print-radio campaign starting Monday for the airline's
BusinessElite cabin, which is replacing separate first- and
business-class sections on international planes.
</P>
<P>
   The BusinessElite ads carry no tag line and take a practical
tack. One shows a close-up of a tape measure, with copy touting
extra inches in the new cabins that mean ``52 percent more legroom
than British Airways and 28 percent more recline than American
Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tone does reflect what we're aiming for'' in the fall
image campaign, said White, who came to Delta from US Airways. ``We
want it to be straightforward and not afraid of direct comparisons.
What we don't have yet is an overall theme.''
</P>
<P>
   While the ``On Top of the World'' campaign was seen as an
improvement over BBDO's widely panned ``Delta Marathon'' campaign
for the 1996 Olympics, Delta executives soon conceded its message
was vague. Even before White arrived, plans were being laid to give
customers more specific reasons to fly Delta.
</P>
<P>
   White said Delta's old ``We Love to Fly and It Shows'' slogan
was one of his favorites. He said the new fall campaign may have a
similar focus on employee spirit but added, ``Everything is still
on the table right now.''

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eating a leisurely picnic lunch Thursday under a
canopy of Washington's famous cherry blossoms, Mark Taylor suddenly
snapped to attention. Out there. In the Tidal Basin. Splashing
around. There he was: the beaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up on his back, flipped over and went back under,''
Taylor said. ``I'm sure that was him.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be? While several people have reported spotting a
beaver swimming in the Tidal Basin over the last few days, no one
has confirmed that Taylor's was one of those that have been
confounding the National Park Service for more than a week by
chomping away on some of the 3,700 cherry trees in the area, then
escaping into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Park Service officials, who originally suspected they were
dealing with one beaver, are now fairly sure there are two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a reliable sighting this morning, two of them in the
Tidal Basin,'' said Earle Kittleman, a spokesman for the Park
Service.
</P>
<P>
   As the pink-and-white cherry blossoms reached their full bloom
this week, park service officials were blaming the beavers for
felling nine trees _ four cherries and five white cedars _ and
damaging four others so badly they are not expected to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Teeth marks also have been found on 30 to 40 other trees,
leading park workers to wrap their damaged trunks with chicken
wire.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, as a sparkling sun and 80-degree temperatures greeted
thousands of visitors strolling along the Tidal Basin promenade,
the wired trunks at one spot across from the Jefferson Memorial
drew quite a crowd of people. Some people wanted to know what the
beaver gnawed, and when did he gnaw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize we were at beaver ground zero,'' said Cliff
Lowell, pointing out shredded bark and teeth marks to his wife,
Kerry Koller, and their two young children. ``I'm impressed. You
can tell it's fresh chewing. But if he's trying to dam up the Tidal
Basin, he's in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Other visitors saw sinister forces at work, raising the
possibility of a wag-the-beaver scenario. Sheri Polis of
Alexandria, Va., suggested that the Clinton administration had set
loose the beaver as a way to deflect attention from other problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised this didn't happen during Monica Lewinsky,'' Ms.
Polis said. ``I'm a Democrat, but I'm willing to believe
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily Copening, a sightseer from Louisville, Ky., expressed
sympathy for the beaver. ``I want them to transfer him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer him? To where, she was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm just a tourist,'' she said. ``I don't know what's
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Park Service officials are trying to figure out how to capture
the beavers, which first damaged some of the cherry trees last
year. Kittleman said the task is especially challenging now, one of
the city's busiest tourism weeks of the year. Many visitors come to
Washington just to see the blossoms on the cherry trees, which were
a gift to the United States from Japan in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a crowded area down there,'' Kittleman said. ``I
don't want to say exactly what we're going to do. Anyway, we're
still trying to figure it out, what method to use, what kind of
lure, how to make sure we have a successful relocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Advice is pouring in. The Park Service has heard from
naturalists, wildlife organizations and the National Zoo, as well
as from individual citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Bob Moore's take on things. A tourist from
Sugarland, Texas, who professed to know a thing or two about
beavers, Moore postulated that a beaver was chewing up the trees
because they suited his diet.
</P>
<P>
   To catch the beaver, he said, ``They need another beaver. Or a
fake beaver. Put it near a tree. He might spot it and come up.''

 &HT;    Coke stock up despite snags in Cadbury deal
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. posted its first gain on Wall Street in
nine days Thursday, despite an Australian ruling that blocks part
of its $1.85 billion acquisition of Cadbury Schweppes' beverages
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There also was a report Thursday from Germany that antitrust
regulators there will block the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said the
purchase of Cadbury brands in that country would result in a
substantial reduction in competition as Coca-Cola melds its
powerful brands with Cadbury's Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and the
Schweppes line of mixers. The proposed deal would increase
Coca-Cola's share of the Australian soft drink market to 75
percent, from 65 percent, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies, however, said they have negotiated revisions to
the deal they hope will meet regulatory muster in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies had positive discussions with the ACCC earlier
this week regarding the amended proposal and believe that real
progress has been made towards a successful outcome,'' Coca-Cola
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based beverage giant plans to buy Cadbury brands in
120 countries, excluding France, South Africa and the United
States. Of the 20 or so nations that require regulatory approval,
five have already given it.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies may face antitrust obstacles in about 10
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the daily newspaper Handelsblatt reported regulators
there will block the sale. And in Mexico, the deal also could be
challenged when regulators meet there soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulatory process is a long one,'' said Coca-Cola
spokesman Robert Baskin. ``There are a number of countries that are
reacting to initial proposals. If and when the reactions in
isolated cases are negative, that doesn't mean we can't appeal or
submit another proposal. These are ongoing discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said they do not expect the regulatory
challenges to kill the deal.
</P>
<P>
   John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, believes
the Australian takeover eventually will be approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were laying odds, I would bet the deal goes through, but
in a different configuration from what was originally proposed,''
Sicher said. That could mean Coca-Cola would sell off some of
Cadbury's Australian brands, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, Sicher added, Coca-Cola's key bottler there, Coca-Cola
Amatil, also may sell local brands to win regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   The overall deal in 120 countries is important to Coca-Cola for
two reasons, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   First, it increases the company's sales by 600 million cases a
year. What's more, Cadbury's brands would be distributed through
Coca-Cola's superior network.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means an acceleration of growth for the Cadbury brands
even more in the years to come,'' Sicher said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's stock rose $1.93 3/4 Thursday, closing at $60.87
1/2. It had been losing ground since closing at $65.87 1/2 on March
25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-term buyers saw it below $60 and said things will get
better eventually,'' analyst Caroline Levy of Schroder &AMP; Co. said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Conway expects trading to be in
the $57 to $62 range until the second half of the year when, he
said, sales and earnings growth will accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we believe the worst is over for Coca-Cola,'' Conway
wrote in a research report published Thursday, referring to the
company's problems overseas.
</P>
<P>
   His year-end price target for the stock remained at $75.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Conseil d'Etat, France's highest court, said it
will hear Coca-Cola's appeal today against the French government's
rejection of the company's effort to buy Orangina.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for a ruling on Coke's $830 million bid for
the flavored drink.

 &HT;    Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance a classic in the making
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After four years, the Amelia Island Concours
d'Elegance in Florida has grown to be much more than just another
car show.
</P>
<P>
   It now encompasses three days of activities and is generally
recognized as one of the top events of its kind in the country.
Weekend activities included a road rally, a golf tournament and
social events.
</P>
<P>
   The crown jewel of the weekend was the concours with honorary
chairman Carroll Shelby, a legend in the American automotive
industry. His accomplishments include production of automobiles
such as the 289 and 427 Cobras as well as the Peter Brock-designed
Daytona Coupe. Those cars shared the spotlight with 206 exceptional
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the event's ambience was Packard, this year's featured
marque. On display were Packard cars ranging from a 1904 Graywolf
owned by Atlantan Jim Kaufmann to a 1954 Packard Panther.
</P>
<P>
   The cars were exquisite, but don't expect to see any of them at
next year's concours. A car may be displayed only once, and all
cars are presented by invitation only.
</P>
<P>
   One participant from Pennsylvania commented, ``What I really
like about Amelia Island is that it is more about cars and less
about the social scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the grounds were filled with models strolling in period
costumes that complemented the cars, families with dogs and
children in tow, and guests of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   This year's event had more than 9,000 people attending the
charity functions, which raise funds for Hospice Northeast, based
in Jacksonville, Fla., and serving patients in northern Florida and
southern Georgia. It was originally organized by Bill Warner of
Jacksonville, whose father was cared for by the hospice.
</P>
<P>
   The grandfather of all concours in this country is Pebble Beach,
Calif., which is in its 49th year, followed by Meadow Brook, Mich.,
in its 21st season. Next year's Amelia Island concours is scheduled
for April 10-12.

 &HT;    Southwire selling metal-making unit
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southwire, one of the world's largest cable and wire
makers, is selling its metal manufacturing business, including
smelters in Carrollton and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Southwire is getting out of the metal business to focus on its
cable and wireless business, Mallard Holliday, a Southwire
spokesman, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company will use the money from the sale to upgrade its
factories and expand its cable and wire manufacturing businesses,
he said. No buyer has been named.
</P>
<P>
   Southwire, which has annual sales of $1.4 billion, employs 4,500
people, 2,300 in Georgia. Southwire operates 15 factories, six of
them in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Southwire sold factories in Texas, Malaysia and
England to Knoxville-based Dura-Line. The factories, which made
polyethylene conduit used to protect telecommunications lines,
operated under the name Integral.
</P>
<P>
   The refinery is the United States' largest recycler of scrap
copper, Holliday said. The 380 workers there make 138,000 tons of
sheet copper a year. The copper is used in cable and to wire homes,
businesses and factories for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The company is amid a $125 million expansion of its aluminum
smelting plant, located in Hawesville, Ky., an Ohio River town
southwest of Louisville. The factory makes more than 200,000 tons
of aluminum a year. The near-pure metal is used in cable and to
transmit electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The smelter, running since 1969, employs about 800 people, half
of whom were hired to replace 400 United Steelworkers who went on
strike in June.
</P>
<P>
   Holliday said Southwire's decision to close the factories is not
based on labor issues or metal prices, which are near historic
lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad they didn't reach this decision when metal prices
were higher and would have supported better prices for these
assets,'' said Thomas Van Leeuwen, a research analyst with Credit
Suisse First Boston. ``Metal prices are at absolutely abysmal
levels. It puts tremendous profit pressure on all smelters
worldwide. Inventories for both copper and aluminum are
accumulating. There is more metal there than people need.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has operated the Hawesville smelter, which makes
ingots and bars, with managers and replacement workers since the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   The union offered March 2 to return to work unconditionally, but
Southwire kept the replacement workers and put the strikers on a
waiting list.

 &HT;    Dell expects closer ties with IBM
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dell Computer Corp. will continue to build on its
fledgling relationship with IBM, but Dell officials at an analysts
meeting Thursday stopped short of commenting on growing Wall Street
speculation that it will take over IBM's personal computer
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe our relationship won't be enhanced over
time,'' Dell Chief Financial Officer Tom Meredith said during a
meeting with more than 300 analysts during Dell's annual spring
visit to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Since last month when the companies announced a seven-year, $16
billion deal for Dell to buy IBM technology, there has been
persistent speculation that the next step will involve Dell
supplying PCs to IBM while IBM's vaunted service division expands
Dell's reach around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said the companies began negotiating the current
agreement last summer, several months before an earlier one
expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we could introduce IBM ... technology into the
marketplace faster than their sister company,'' Meredith said,
pointing out that IBM's PC division had revenue of $12 billion last
year, but lost almost $1 billion. In contrast, Dell had sales of
$18.2 billion and made nearly $1.5 billion in profits.
</P>
<P>
   Its relationship with IBM aside, Dell officials assured analysts
that the Round Rock-based computer maker will continue to outpace
the rest of the PC industry in sales growth.
</P>
<P>
   It will do so, they said, by expanding its push into the
consumer market, adding more service offerings _ and maybe even
taking a cue from Apple Computer Inc.'s success with the iMac and
producing more stylish computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the advantages we have are as strong as they
ever have been in our industry,'' Chief Executive Michael Dell
said, adding that there will be a ``massive upgrade cycle'' when
Microsoft Corp. releases its most powerful operating systems this
year or next.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Dell executives are a portrait of confidence about
the company's prospects in an increasingly Internet-driven
industry, they reminded the analysts whose companies advise
millions of investors that Dell is not predicting results.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, executives appeared to be mindful of Wall Street's
disappointment and the selloff of Dell shares that followed Dell's
fourth-quarter earnings report in February.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell's revenue grew a healthy 38 percent over the
year-earlier quarter, some investors were disappointed that it
slipped below 50 percent for the first time in several quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a sustainability of our performance, not
necessarily a change in that performance,'' Don Collis, Dell vice
president for investor relations, told analysts at the Pierre Hotel
near Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Dell expects to add to its service revenues in part by doing
more consulting to large business and government customers, said
Vice Chairman Kevin Rollins.
</P>
<P>
   That includes helping them set up Dell's most expensive and
complex systems linking multiple servers to networks of storage
devices that contain vast amounts of data that must be available at
all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to keep moving up the food chain,'' said Erik
Ridgley, vice president of Provident Investment Counsel of
Pasadena, Calif. ``They can't wait for other people to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a small increase in service work could translate to
significant gains in revenue, said Rollins, who said the service
market is expected to grow from $239 billion in 1996 to $464
billion in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's confidence in its growth prospects stems in part from the
fact that it has about 9 percent of world sales of PC products, and
its conviction that the direct model it pioneered will succeed in
any market. Executives say the company's ``fair share'' of sales is
much higher.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell's consumer business shipments grew 80 percent last
year, Dell accounts for only about 5 percent of sales to those
customers. Many consumers buy computers through retail stores,
which Dell abandoned several years ago. That and Dell's strategy
until recently of not aggressively targeting consumers held sales
back. But Dell's new efforts to reach those customers through
advertising and marketing have substantially increased awareness of
the company in the past 18 months, said Senior Vice President Paul
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers and small businesses account for $3 billion in annual
sales for Dell, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview what Dell's fair share of the consumer
business is, Michael Dell responded, ``How about 30 percent?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Dell complemented Apple Computer Inc. for its
mold-breaking iMac, which has been very popular with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wake-up call for the PC industry,'' Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can expect to see from Dell more consumer-friendly and
stylish-looking products.''

 &HT;    Being a judge at Concours is like picking the best diamond
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This was my fourth consecutive year attending the
Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance, and I have developed a real
fondness for the event. The first year, I didn't even really know
what a concours d'elegance was until I got there.
</P>
<P>
   It is an exceptional display of exceptional cars restored in
many cases to better-than-new condition. It is something that
anyone who has a soft spot in their heart for things automotive, or
who just happens to appreciate beautiful cars, can get into.
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine my surprise when Amelia Island Concours Chairman
Bill Warner called to invite me to be a judge. Astonished, I
replied, ``I'm really honored, but I don't think I'm remotely
qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would put me ``with some other big-name judge'' and I
would do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   It was my impression that judges were automotive gurus who knew
things like what were the appropriate options, proper paint colors
and a host of other details not common knowledge to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to look like an idiot, I sought out some scholarly
advice from Jonathan Stein, editor of the collectors' publication
Automobile Quarterly. He said judging was basically a process of
intelligence, common sense and good taste.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, I attended the judges brunch. Across the table
was Tom Bryant, editor of Road &AMP; Track magazine and part of my
judging team. Also there were David E. Davis from Automobile
magazine and automotive designer Peter Brock.
</P>
<P>
   I also was the only woman in the room, except for honorary
Chairman Carroll Shelby's wife, Cleo. Nope, no pressure here.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was that they gave me a book on how to judge a
car. There are four basic categories: exterior, interior, engine
compartment and presence. The first three are self-explanatory. The
fourth is a polite way of saying ``How much do you like this car?''
There are a couple of options for tie-breakers.
</P>
<P>
   Each car begins with a perfect score in each category, and you
deduct points at your own determined rate for ``flaws.'' As I
progressed down the line of 32 cars we had to judge, I quickly
found I needed to do continual adjustments because each one seemed
to look better than the last.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness for the ``presence'' category. It covered a
multitude of sins.
</P>
<P>
   When we had all arrived at our opinions, we assembled as a group
to compare numbers. To my pleasant surprise, about 95 percent of my
numbers were in line with the rest of the judges'.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow judge Brock Yates quizzed, ``How'd you do?''
</P>
<P>
   My reply, ``This isn't so tough. It's just like going to the
jewelry store and trying to decided which diamond you really don't
care for.''

COMMENTARY: THE CIRCULAR FIRING SQUAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Sentence in bold should be set in italics.)  
(DW) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boy, I sure hope the Clinton team loses this war in Kosovo,
because if it wins, there will be no one to pick up the Nobel Peace
Prize. If I read The Washington Post, New York Times and Wall
Street Journal correctly, everyone in this administration already
has blamed everyone else in this administration for failure in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the front pages, one finds that the Joint Chiefs blame
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for dragging them into a
morass. The State Department blames the Pentagon and the NATO
allies, the CIA says it predicted the war would go badly, the vice
president is worried that it's going to sink his election chances,
the Congressional Democrats want to dump the whole Clinton foreign
policy team for failing to anticipate Serbian behavior, and the
Republicans don't know what they want but they all agree it's Bill
Clinton's fault.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about turbo finger-pointing. You don't even have to leave
this administration and write your memoirs to betray it _ now you
can do it on the job. If the Clinton team were half as good at
targeting the Serbian tanks in Kosovo as it is at targeting its own
members in the press, we would have won this war already.
 &UR; Yo, boys and girls, can we do this later?  &LR;  If this war goes badly,
you're all sunk, and we're all sunk. You have to hang together,
both in appearance and reality, because in this information age,
everyone is watching _ most importantly our allies and Slobodan
Milosevic. If the allies see everyone on the Clinton team blaming
everyone else, how long do you think NATO will stick behind
America?
</P>
<P>
   How is one supposed to conduct a long-term campaign in such an
environment? I guess one should not be surprised. It is scary how
we have seamlessly moved from O.J. to Monica to Kosovo, and treat
each one as just another partisan spectacle. CNN has shamelessly,
and shamefully, aired a steady stream of interviews with every
relative of the three captured U.S. GI's _ as if their fate were
the central issue of the day, as if they were not soldiers sent to
fight but high schoolers abducted while on a picnic in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   This is war, not infotainment. We're not up against JonBenet
Milosevic. We're up against a ruthless dictator who has made
500,000 people homeless. It is going to require ruthless, brutal
staying power to succeed here. Maybe the air war will not be enough
to pressure the Serbs into accepting the minimum diplomatic outcome
we need _ which is that the refugees be allowed to return to their
homes in Kosovo, and run their own lives, protected by
international peacekeepers. But two weeks of bombing is far too
early to determine that.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a perfect analogy, but I was in West Beirut during
the summer of 1982 when the Israeli Army decided not to enter that
city with ground troops to evict the PLO but to rely instead on
air, sea and artillery bombardments. For the first two months there
was solidarity between the Beirut Muslims and the PLO, in the face
of the Israeli siege. But as the summer wore on, as the economy
ground to a halt, the Muslim leadership in West Beirut finally
called Yasser Arafat and said, in effect: ``Yasser, we can't take
this anymore. We said we'd be with you `till the last dog dies.'
Well, it just died. It's time for you to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav Grubacic, one of the most prominent Serbian
journalists, puts out a daily Internet news report from Belgrade,
Yugoslavia. Here's an excerpt from Tuesday, April 6: ``The prospect
of a prolonged bombing campaign is making people depressed and
nervous. However, even if the air strikes stop soon, the reasonable
part of the population fears that living in a devastated and
isolated country without fresh money and help from abroad will be
like living in a concentration camp.''
</P>
<P>
   If the United States wants to return the Albanian refugees to
Kosovo _ without using ground troops _ NATO is going to have to
intensify both its diplomacy and its bombing of Serbia, with no
holds barred.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, to emerge with an acceptable outcome, the Clinton
team is going to have to steel itself for accusations of engaging
in both military ``overkill'' and diplomatic ``appeasement.''
</P>
<P>
   Managing such a tense endgame will require a cool head and a
tight-knit team with a mean streak and steady nerves _ not a group
marching forward while looking over their shoulders at each other.

 &HT;    Pig-borne virus is a killer that baffles experts
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An outbreak of a deadly virus among Malaysian
residents who raise, handle and transport pigs is stumping health
experts who say it does not resemble any known virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen this virus before. But that doesn't mean it
hasn't been there all along,'' said Dr. Pierre Rollin, a virologist
with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has sent
eight specialists to Malaysia to investigate. ``It's probably been
there all along waiting for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of 229 suspected cases reported in Malaysia and Singapore, 111
people have died; 100 in Malaysia and 11 people who handled the
imported pigs in Singapore, the CDC reported Thursday. Most are
adult men who have had close contact with pigs or pig farming, a
mainstay of the country's many rural villages.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts said they believe the virus is not spread from
person to person, but from pigs to humans. ``It starts out with
nonspecific symptoms like the flu but quickly develops into
neurological symptoms,'' Rollin said. ``It's a rapid onset. Within
two to three days, a person can go into a coma and require
respiratory assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus first sickened and killed hundreds of pigs in October,
then spread to workers, killing 15 of them, CDC officials said.
Malaysian health officials initially said the deaths were caused by
the Japanese encephalitis virus, which is transmitted by
mosquitoes. But in late February, villagers and farmers in the
hog-rearing district of Bukit Pelandok in the central Negeri
Sembilan state began dying at an alarming rate, prompting health
officials to seek further help.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lam Sai Kit, from the University of Malaysia's department of
medical microbiology, discovered adults and pigs were succumbing to
the disease. Japanese encephalitis usually affects children.
</P>
<P>
   Despite intense aerial fogging of the hog farms, about 70 people
died within a month, including pig farmers who received
encephalitis vaccines. Lam suspected another virus at work.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian virologists flew to the United States on March 17 with
samples. Lab analyses quickly proved the virus wasn't encephalitis.
Instead, it resembled a rare Hendra virus, first detected in
Australia in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms are the same for both viruses _ high fever, aches,
eventual coma and death.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC finding plunged Malaysia into further confusion. Pig
farmers deserted their homes after police cordoned off their
villages. To curb the outbreak, soldiers dressed like astronauts
swept through a half-dozen pig-farming districts in an attempt to
slaughter a targeted 1 million pigs.

   HANOI, Vietnam _ It is now an official relic of the Vietnam War:
a ragged chunk of an American B-52 bomber, with landing gear still
attached, poking up from the surface of a small pond in the center
of Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   It has lain where it fell for more than 26 years, since the
two-week-long ``Christmas bombing'' of Hanoi in 1972. The flower
farms that surrounded it have given way to urban sprawl, and a new
generation of Vietnamese who do not remember the war has been born.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday it was a conversation piece, the occasion for a
touch of smugness, even triumphalism, as people talked about the
U.S.-led NATO bombing in Yugoslavia and let slide their usual
studied politeness about their defeat of U.S. military might.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vietnamese are heroes! cried Pham Minh Suu, 77, a frail
man with a wisp of white beard, a fedora and a blue blazer worn
over striped pajamas. ``The Vietnamese are great!''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end the Americans were defeated by the steadfastness of
Vietnamese policy,'' he said, a dutiful Communist who described
himself simply as a retired worker. ``Vietnam is very poor but we
beat the Americans. Kosovo can do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Chu Huy Tuan, who was 2 years old when the B-52 was shot down,
said that he had been watching television reports of the bombing of
Yugoslavia and that the Serbs could prevail if they just hold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vietnamese people want the Kosovo people to beat back the
American bombing just as we did,'' he said, balancing his baby
daughter on the handlebars of his bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke loudly so the young people sitting over cups of bright
yellow Vietnamese tea at an outdoor table nearby could hear him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vietnam has been free for 4,000 years,'' he said. ``Whoever
has come to fight us _ China, France, America _ they're all gone.''
</P>
<P>
   News in Vietnam is carefully controlled and the opinions of
people like Tuan are shaped by television news programs that
emphasize bombing rather than Serbian persecution of Kosovar
Albanians, and by newspaper commentaries that play up the surface
parallels with their own experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NATO air strikes have again divided the United States,
which now faces the possibility of repeating the mistakes it made
in its war against Vietnam,'' said the army newspaper, Quan Doi
Nhan Dan.
</P>
<P>
   It described the fighting as ``a United States-led military
adventure that can go nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Another newspaper, Nhan Dan, said, ``President Bill Clinton, who
protested against the Vietnam War, should be aware of how tragic
that war was for the United States and avoid repeating such a
terrible tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a common theme, newspapers warn of an aggressive United
States that wants to use its power to set the agenda for the world.
``The logic of such unfettered military might means that no one can
be sure where the world will be led,'' the army newspaper said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years after it ended, the ``war against the
Americans'' still defines national identity for many Vietnamese,
allowing them to view themselves as heroes even as they struggle
with continuing poverty and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is generally admired _ more warmly in the
south than in the north _ and Americans are welcomed. The hundreds
of thousands of Vietnamese who managed to flee to America are
envied in the south and viewed in the north with a mixture of envy
and resentment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   America, with its wealth and freedoms, represents a modern world
that Vietnam fears _ and aspires to.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, many Vietnamese also make a distinction between the
U.S. government and its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the American people who are bombing Kosovo, it's the
government,'' said Bu Thanh Son, 37. ``The same in Vietnam. Vietnam
and America are brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Son was a boy of 11 during the Christmas bombing, too young to
be frightened, he said. ``I liked to go out and look at the
shooting in the sky,'' he said. ``It was on the last night that
they shot down the B-52. I went and cut off pieces of it and sold
them for scrap.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, the shores of the pond have been reinforced
and a small plaque has been dedicated. In the afternoons, people
sip tea at a white plastic table by its banks. Children shout in a
nearby schoolyard. People with small nets fish for bait.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Nguyen Van Nam, 74, said the pond used to be full
of fish. ``When the B-52 fell there was a huge splash and there
were fish lying all over the ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nam, wearing a green pith helmet and brown pajamas, waved his
hand wearily when asked what he thought of the Christmas bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I think?'' he said. ``What should I think? People died
here.''

COMMENTARY: DO WE UNDERSTAND ANYTHING?  
(DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Do Americans understand that while we have been bombing the
Serbs, the following took place: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Libya was exonerated from responsibility in the destruction of
Pan Am 103. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Saddam Hussein's closedown of the U.N. search for Iraq's
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons went into its eighth
month. Richard Butler, the chief arms inspector, was barred
Wednesday by the Russians from even entering the U.N. Security
Council chamber where his inspection commission was the agenda,
marked for death.
</P>
<P>
   _ China's Prime Minister was visiting America getting a great
press _ plus a step nearer to a trade agreement that will fatten
China's economy and armed forces. On the day Zhu Rongji arrived in
Washington representing the Communist Politburo, President Clinton
criticized not China's expanding arrests of political and religious
dissidents, but American critics of China.
</P>
<P>
   So: do Americans understand that while we fight one
dictatorship, fumbling around trying to heighten the war and
somehow end it at the same time, three other dictatorships more
dangerous to American interests are walking away with America's
pants?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Libya deal was possible because the administration signed
off on it. This sweetheart gift to Col. Moammar Gadhafi ends the
effective sanctions imposed on Libya for harboring two Libyans
accused of murdering 270 people in the bombing of Pan AM 103 on
Dec. 21, 1988. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence agents are not allowed to ask the suspects
now held in the Netherlands if perchance Gadhafi knew what his boys
were up to or Syria and Iran were involved _ as Western
intelligence agencies had long believed. During the trial itself,
Libya's government is not to be undermined, hear? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Libya, a no-loser. Even if the men are found guilty, the
sanctions will remain ended. Italy, Russia, France and other
countries already have lined up fat oil and gas deals with Libya.
U.S. companies will follow. The deal is disgusting, an insult to
the dead and their families, and to all who fly in U.S. planes.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do Americans understand that the U.S. delegation to the U.N. did
not stand up and holler at the barring of Butler? Let's hope it
will when he tries again Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do they understand that the president denounced U.S. critics of
China on the very day that Jeff Gerth and James Risen of The Times
were writing that even more Chinese nuclear espionage took place
than the reporters had already disclosed? Another chapter in
Chinese espionage was written in 1995, reported to the national
security adviser, Samuel Berger, in April 1996, who told the
president in July 1997, who ordered tightened security _ in
February 1998.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do Americans understand that the administration disgraced itself
in the war on Serbia? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic, not America, is responsible for driving
cold, hungry, terrified Albanian Kosovars from their homes. But
Washington's disgrace is that Clinton and his top people did not
know and did not expect that Milosevic would use the bombing as an
opportunity to expel them by the hundreds of thousands. American
leadership still does not seem able to plan more than a couple of
days ahead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So we need no longer worry about America's credibility; we have
none. For a democracy, credibility comes not just from smart
weapons but smart leaders, from respect for the intelligence of the
public, domestic and foreign, from a measure of honesty. In a
democracy, pretense in war or peace is transparent, embarrassing
and finally self-destructive.
</P>
<P>
   We need not and should not support Kosovar secession. But we
helped Milosevic in his fight with the Kosovars by not foreseeing
his mass expulsion plans, and not having our own plans that would
treat the Serbian nation as something more than a bombing target. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When at war, support the troops.'' To me that means making
sure they have the strength they need, the affection, respect _ and
a doable mission.
</P>
<P>
   What it does not mean is keeping our mouths shut about
misconduct of a war by an American government _ or about its
failure to protect American interests in other crises that may
inconveniently present themselves. That's not supporting American
armed forces, but walking away from them.

AT LONG LAST, AARON WILL BASK AND FANS WILL LOVE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dual pursuit of Roger Maris' home run record last year
created so much good feeling among the fans and the hitters chasing
it that Henry Aaron watched with envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish for a moment that I could've enjoyed it as much as
Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire enjoyed it last year,'' Aaron said of
his own earlier pursuit of a home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago Thursday night, Aaron hit his 715th home
run, eclipsing Babe Ruth's career record. Major League Baseball and
the Atlanta Braves celebrated the anniversary Thursday night before
the Braves' game with Philadelphia Phillies, honoring Aaron in a
way that many fans and Bowie Kuhn, the commissioner a quarter of a
century ago, did not.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, baseball unveiled the Hank Aaron Award, to
be given annually to the player deemed to be the best hitter in
each league. It is an award Aaron could have won many times in a
remarkable 23-year career in which he never hit more than 47 home
runs in a season but amassed a record 755.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I got close, it was an important record,'' Aaron
recalled in a conference call with reporters. ``The closer I got to
it people started to play it down. I'm enjoying it very much so
now. Twenty-five years ago I was a very bitter person. I've aged
and taken my mother's advice: don't worry about things I don't have
control over.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, even Aaron's mother could not offer the
kind of advice that would have soothed him. Even she could not
overcome the racist hate mail that jarred the 40-year-old Aaron to
the depth of his soul. Facing National League pitchers was easy
compared to facing his mailbox every day.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron was asked if he has rid himself of the unwanted mail.
``The hate mail won't be thrown away yet,'' he said. ``We still
have hatred in this country and we need to be reminded.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig remembers. Now the commissioner, Selig was a longtime
friend of Aaron who saw first-hand what the slugger was battling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen hate mail in a lot of situations,'' Selig said
earlier this week. ``I have never seen anything like that, never.
It was so tragically unfair and just plain wrong. It's a tribute to
Henry Aaron that he's been able to survive that and be the person
he is today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, America was obviously not ready to have a
black man supplant the charismatic white man who was the country's
most legendary figure of the first half a century. And if the
career home run record had to be broken, let it be Mickey Mantle
who would do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had a choice of who they wanted to break Babe Ruth's
record, it would have been Mickey Mantle first,'' Aaron said.
``Mickey was like Marilyn Monroe. He didn't have to be the greatest
ball player. He had that charisma. The Yankees had won all those
pennants.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Downing was a rookie pitcher with the New York Yankees during
the season in which Mantle and Maris chased Ruth's season record.
Maris broke it. Maris, Downing recalled, ``got a lot of hate
mail.''
</P>
<P>
   His was not racist, though. The racial hatred, the ugly
epithets, the death threats made Aaron's mail even worse. The
crude, vile letters jolted Aaron and reduced him to tears. Downing
said the other day that he had not been aware of how bad it was
until he saw a documentary about Aaron a half-dozen years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Downing was pitching for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1974 and
started against the Braves in the fourth game of the season. In the
Braves' first game, in Cincinnati, Aaron hit No. 714. Facing the
left-handed Downing in the Braves' home opener, Aaron drove No. 715
over the left-center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fastball right down the middle,'' Downing said, describing the
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Was he plagued in any way by being the pitcher who gave up the
record-breaking home run?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it never bothered me that I threw the pitch,'' Downing
said by telephone from Los Angeles. ``What bothered me was the
public insinuation afterward that I grooved the pitch. Or that I
was less than a major league pitcher because he hit the home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn, the commissioner in 1974, did not see Downing throw that
fastball right down the middle. He did not see Aaron hit No. 715.
He had seen him tie Ruth's record in Cincinnati and decided that
was enough.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, published 13 years later, Kuhn continued to defend
his decision not to be in Atlanta for the historic home run. He
explained that he opted instead to keep ``a longstanding speaking
engagement'' in Cleveland before the Wahoo Club and wrote that if
he had to do it over, he would still choose Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever accused Kuhn of racism, but in snubbing Aaron, he
acted as insultingly and as thoughtlessly as some of the letter
writers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked now about Kuhn's absence, Aaron said: ``I haven't thought
about that one. I don't think about that. The commissioner doesn't
come up in my train of thought now.''
</P>
<P>
   But an associate of Aaron offered a different view. ``Hank is
hurt to this day,'' the associate said. ``It hurt him very deeply.
He talks about it to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron prefers to talk publicly about other people and other
events. His gala 65th birthday party in Atlanta two months ago, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States was at my birthday party,''
Aaron said, still awed by the thought. ``At my birthday party. He
came to my birthday party. I went to the White House and stayed in
the Queen's room. This has truly been a great year.''

REFUGEES WILL BE KEPT IN ALBANIA, NOT CUBA, SAYS ADMINISTRATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bowing to pressure from refugee groups and aid
organizations, the Clinton administration has suspended plans for
an airlift of Kosovo refugees from Macedonia to the U.S. naval base
at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Instead the United States will build
refugee barracks for them in Albania, according to administration
officials.
</P>
<P>
   While emphasizing that the United States will retain the option
of flying up to 20,000 refugees from Macedonia to the base in Cuba,
a top Clinton administration official said that ``we don't have a
first flight planned'' to the base.
</P>
<P>
   The airlift option grew out of the Macedonian government's
urgent request last week to NATO to assume responsibility for more
than 100,000 Albanian refugees, saying that Macedonia's delicate
ethnic balance would be destroyed by these newcomers. NATO's
response was to offer to airlift them out. Most NATO nations then
offered to accept certain numbers for temporary or permanent
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The Macedonian government took matters into its own hands on
Tuesday, swiftly deporting an estimated 45,000 refugees, about
9,500 of them to Albania, in an overnight operation conducted
without informing refugee workers. Many refugees reportedly were
removed against their will and were not told their destinations,
and hundreds of families were separated in the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian government had repeatedly volunteered to take in
refugees as long as Western countries agree to house them and
provide supplies for them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the chief opponents to the Guantanamo idea was the office
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which argued
against the base ``with its flavor of a detention camp'' but also
against the legal restrictions the United States would place on the
refugees once they arrived in camps, refusing to give them any
right of asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of moving the refugees out of asylum near their
homes is bad, moving out of the region is worse and Guantanomo is
the worst of all,'' said Karen Abu Zayd, the UNHCR representative
here.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. airlift of refugees could also cause a logistical
nightmare in the middle of the airwar campaign. But a Pentagon
official said, ``We're making preparations to receive the first
several hundred refugees at the base if we get to that stage.'' He
added, ``But if the refugees would prefer to go to Albania rather
than Guantanamo, I think we will fill up Albania first.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States joined nearly a dozen other countries in
offering to accept refugees when Macedonia asked for immediate
help, a gesture all the relief agencies applauded, even though they
opposed the selection of Guantanamo. But two days ago a group of
American refugee organizations wrote to President Clinton opposing
the Guantanamo base. They said ``the inhospitable, isolated,
prison-like environment is inappropriate and would exacerbate the
trauma and suffering they have already experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   While saying that the president understood these concerns, an
administration official who asked not to be named said that the
changing situation on the ground and the desire of the refugees to
remain close to their homes was the reason the Guantanamo airlift
had been put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be a voluntary decision by the refugees and if
they do not want to go that far we will accommodate them,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo have wanted to
stay as close to home as possible in the hope of returning, if only
to learn what happened to other family members. Many men did not
accompany their families, either because they wanted to stay and
fight or because they were held back by the Serbs. Many are
presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   But refugees are accepting some offers of asylum. Thursday,
German planes flew out 1,000 refugees who voluntarily agreed to
leave Macedonia for Germany. Others were flown to Norway and
Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   According to the UNHCR, Albania is now housing 303,000 refugees,
Macedonia has 117,000, and Montenegro 59,000.
</P>
<P>
   By volunteering to take in thousands of additional refugees,
Albania, one of the poorest nations in Europe, would benefit from a
big public works program that would provide roads and sanitation as
well as housing.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official estimated that the United States was
prepared to spend $1 million a day to house 20,000 refugees in
Guantanamo for at least six months, or $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That money would go a long way to rebuilding Albania and at
the same time give the refugees the homes they want,'' said the
official who favored the Albanian option over Guantanamo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased that they're not rushing forward with
Guantanamo and that the priority is now clearly preserving
protection for the refugees in the region and getting supplies into
the region,'' said Bill Frelick, senior policy analyst for the U.S.
Committee for Refugees who attended the meeting. ``The logistics
required, spending the time and resources to evacuate these people
half way across the globe at the height of the refugee crisis would
be an absolute mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Atwood, the administration's coordinator for the Kosovo
relief effort, said in a telephone conference call with reporters
Thursday that the administration was reconsidering Tuesday's
decision to use the Guantanamo base for temporary asylum because
living conditions in the camps in Albania and Macedonia are
beginning to improve and because the Serbs have temporarily closed
the border, preventing more Albanians from fleeing their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep people in the region,'' Atwood said. ``We want
to prepare the people to return to their homes. It will be a lot
easier to undertake that if they are in the region.''

 &HT;    New panel to probe claims of customs bias
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Customs Service created a special
commission Thursday to investigate allegations that black
passengers are being unfairly targeted for drug inspections because
of their color.
</P>
<P>
   ``If bias exists, whether perceived or real, it is paramount
that we find its cause and eliminate it,'' said Commissioner
Raymond Kelly. ``Bias is not a part of customs policy. We cannot
afford it to be part of our practice.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kelly is not the only chief of a federal law enforcement
agency concerned about officers singling out potential suspects
because of the color of their skin.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said her department is investigating
whether police officers are using racial profiling in traffic stops
and other questioning of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so very important that we address the feelings of
Americans who feel that police officers are stopping them because
of race,'' Reno said on Thursday. ``Let's address it, let's hit it
head-on.''
</P>
<P>
   If police officers deny that they are using racial profiling,
stand behind them, said Reno, adding, ``but stand behind them with
hard facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cities are already gathering those facts, said Reno, citing
San Diego as an example. In San Diego, police officers are
recording the race of everyone they stop in an effort to compile a
statistical picture of whether or not there is an ``inappropriate
reliance on a racial profile,'' Reno said. She called on other
police departments to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is investigating allegations of racial
profiling by the New Jersey State Police in traffic stops and by
police agencies in Eastpointe, Mich., and Orange County, Fla. The
department provides racial sensitivity training to local police
elsewhere, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of the four-person customs commission comes less
than two weeks after Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) requested that
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin conduct a federal investigation
into whether blacks were being unjustly singled out for inspections
at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis requested the investigation after customs inspectors told
reporters that the unwritten rule at Hartsfield is ``to go after
blacks.'' Lewis said he was moved to act after WAGA-TV news
reported that 90 percent of the individuals sent to hospitals to be
X-rayed for drugs were African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good first step,'' said Lewis, appearing at press
conference with Kelly to announce creation of the commission.
``Something is happening out there, and we have to address it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield is not the only airport where allegations of racial
bias have been raised.
</P>
<P>
   At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, 100 black women have
come forward alleging in a lawsuit that they were unfairly singled
out for inspections because of their race and gender.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complaints about discrimination, the number of
people actually searched at customs is relatively small when
compared with the total number of passengers passing through the
nation's airports.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, customs inspectors searched 50,892 of some 71.5
million passengers. Drugs were found in 2,116 of those searches,
which were conducted by frisking, patdowns, partial strips or
X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Constance Berry Newman, undersecretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, will chair the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Also named to the commission were Robin Renee Sanders, the
National Security Council's director for Africa, and Ana Marie
Salazar, deputy assistant secretary of defense for drug enforcement
policy and support.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sanders, who is black, and Salazar, who is Hispanic, said
they have had personal experiences with customs officials during
border crossings. A fourth person will be named at a later date.

 &HT;    Judge bars crackdown on Black College Reunion
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCOA BEACH, Fla. _ A federal judge late Thursday ruled that
police cannot block visitors at bridges to Daytona Beach's barrier
island for this weekend's Black College Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Patricia Fawsett in Orlando agreed with
lawyers from the NAACP, who filed a complaint saying the city was
treating black visitors to the three-day event differently from
tourists who come to other events, such as Bike Week and Speed
Week.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city did not offer ``a rational explanation for
why BCR should be singled out and subjected to greater restrictions
than other events,'' Fawsett ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend event of partying and cruising by African-American
college students is similar to Atlanta's Freaknik, which is
scheduled for April 14-16.
</P>
<P>
   Neither lawyers for the NAACP nor the city could be reached for
reaction late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling throws out a controversial plan that city officials
had worked on for months, hoping to quiet complaints from citizens
outraged by last year's Black College Reunion, which drew more than
100,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said the visitors were loud and frequently obscene and
completely gridlocked traffic on the island, making it impossible
for them to reach their homes or have access to ambulance, fire and
police emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   Under the police plan, officers this weekend were to be
stationed at the six bridges leading to the island. If traffic
became gridlocked, they would turn away all cars except those with
special passes that were issued to residents, workers and visitors
with reservations at beach hotels.
</P>
<P>
   People without passes were to be directed to parking lots where
they could catch special free buses to the beach for the events.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks found the plan and the passes offensive, saying they were
being singled out because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daytona Beach's law is the equivalent of Florida's closing its
borders to outside automobile traffic,'' their lawsuit argued.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear late Thursday what steps police would take to
try to control traffic at the event, which begins today and is
expected to draw more than 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Like Atlanta's Freaknik, Black College Reunion has been a
controversial long-running but unofficial event. Daytona Beach
officials tried embracing it last year by sanctioning a promoter
who put on concerts and other offerings in an attempt to break up
the traffic gridlock, but the effort failed. Officials also cooled
to the event after a shooting last year left an Orlando man dead
and four police officers wounded.

   WASHINGTON _ NATO's air campaign has effectively cut fuel and
ammunition supply lines to 40,000 Yugoslav army troops and police
fighting in Kosovo, allied officials said Thursday in providing the
first details of damage to support their claim that the 16-day
bombardment was taking a steep toll.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Pentagon officials noted that Yugoslav armored
forces had stopped maneuvering and were hunkering down, they
conceded that the strategy to starve the Yugoslav war machine might
be too late. The Yugoslav army, they said, may have already
achieved its goal of defeating Kosovo rebels and expelling hundreds
of thousands of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a sharply worded attack on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, said Thursday that Yugoslav forces
under his command are responsible for killing ``thousands'' of
Kosovar Albanians and creating ``hundreds of thousands of
refugees.'' Administration officials said the government estimates
of the number killed by Yugoslav forces, which ranged from a
minimum of 1,000 to more than 2,000, were based on intelligence
photographs and refugee reports.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's two main oil refineries had been knocked out of
operation, and the main rail lines and roads leading into the
besieged province had been destroyed or severely damaged, Pentagon
officials said. Fuel shortages were reported throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to see strong evidence of supply problems and
fuel problems plaguing these Yugoslav forces in a number of
different areas and among a number of different units,'' said Rear
Adm. Thomas Wilson, the director of intelligence for the military's
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO warplanes again flew more than 400 missions, attacking
22 targets across Yugoslavia, including air defenses, fuel depots,
bridges and tanks in the field, allied intelligence reported that
the Yugoslav army was hunkering down, and hiding in abandoned
buildings and forests, curtailing its campaign to drive ethnic
Albanians out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unilateral ceasefire declaration by Milosevic,
Yugoslav forces continued to engage remnants of the Kosovo
Liberation Army. Allied officials said there was evidence that
Yugoslav forces were conducting mop-up operations, particularly in
the northern part of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials said the air campaign would intensify. Defense
Department officials said Thursday that they expect Gen. Wesley
Clark, the NATO military commander, to request at least half a
dozen A-10s and a dozen F-16 ground attack planes, bolstering an
air armada of 600 aircraft already involved.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Defense Secretary William Cohen have said that
whatever requests Clark makes to conduct the air campaign will be
honored. Cohen said Thursday that he was considering a request for
additional F-15E strike fighters, as well as aerial refueling
craft. The fighter can attack with precision weapons from high
altitudes, making it less vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
   As American officials geared up for a protracted air campaign
that could last several more weeks, lawmakers traveling this week
with Cohen to Brussels, Belgium, and Italy, to meet with NATO
officials and American troops, indicated that the administration
must consider additional measures.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member bipartisan delegation of House and Senate members
intend to send the president a letter on Friday urging him and the
leaders of the other 18 NATO countries to begin at least the
planning for ground troops, said congressional officials.
</P>
<P>
   While political pressure may be building here for considering
ground forces, NATO officials remain adamant that no such option is
under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   As the air campaign entered its 16th day, allied officials here
and in Brussels denied claims by Yugoslav authorities that NATO
bombing had caused widespread damage in Pristina, the provincial
capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who toured the city as part of a visit arranged by
Yugoslav officials filed reports on Wednesday describing the
damage. But U.S. officers said Thursday that most targets around
Pristina were in lightly populated suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Only two targets in the city itself were hit, a telephone
exchange used by the military and a police headquarters building.
While the officers acknowledge that the bombing might have caused
some damage around the telephone building, they denied the Yugoslav
claims, and said Yugoslav forces were responsible for the
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collateral damage is being done by the Serbs,'' Wilson
told reporters at the Pentagon. ``Towns and villages have been
damaged primarily by fires set by the Yugoslav forces as they've
gone through, as well as by shooting them up with artillery and
tanks and those kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than two weeks of air and missile strikes, Pentagon
and NATO officials say they have inflicted significant damage to
Yugoslavia's armed forces, but Clark said in an interview that many
targets remain, and he vowed to continue striking them.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and NATO have left vague the exact
military objectives of the attack, saying the aim was ``to
degrade'' Yugoslavia's military and paramilitary police forces.
Senior Pentagon officials concede the standard was set so that the
attack could end at virtually any point and be considered to have
met that objective.
</P>
<P>
   Ending the strikes soon, however, could leave Milosevic with a
weakened but functioning military and considerable special police
forces, which he relies on to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
Clark, as well as the leaders of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wanted
to be able to continue to attack Yugoslav military targets for at
least a couple weeks more, if not longer, particularly since the
initial phases of the operation were hampered by foul weather.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday a senior Pentagon official said the general hoped to
escalate around-the-clock bombing, rather than limiting most of the
air raids to nighttime. The prospect of a significant diplomatic
initiative could force a halt to Clark's plans to escalate the
strikes.

N.J. GOVERNOR SAYS SHE WILL RUN FOR U.S. SENATE IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman said Thursday that she
plans to run for the U.S. Senate next year, raising the prospect of
a rematch with the man she ousted from the State House six years
ago, Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the state constitution forbids her to run for a
third term, Whitman said that a seat in the U.S. Senate would give
her the opportunity to continue promoting her moderate Republican
agenda, only on a different stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would give me a voice,'' Whitman said during a news
conference in Trenton. ``A place where I could keep talking about
the need for lower taxes, limited government and the fact that all
the answers don't necessarily come from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, she announced that she was forming a
fund-raising committee to begin collecting the $10 million to $12
million needed for a statewide campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Whitman's nationwide prominence as a moderate,
tax-cutting Republican, her announcement was greeted with
enthusiasm among Republicans in Washington, who feel that she
offers the party a strong chance to pick up a seat that has been
held by a Democrat, Frank Lautenberg, for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   National party leaders also said that having a well-known
candidate on the ticket next year would bolster support for the
Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she had not expected to decide whether to run for
the Senate until later in the year, but she sped up her
decision-making process after Lautenberg unexpectedly announced his
retirement in February.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she would remain in office throughout the campaign.
If she wins, state Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, a
Republican from Scotch Plains, would become acting governor for the
final year of her second term. DiFrancesco plans to run for
Governor in 2001, and the role of acting governor would likely
strengthen his bid.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lautenberg's decision to retire prompted several
Democrats to consider the race, most of the attention so far has
fallen on Florio, who was defeated by Whitman by a narrow margin in
the 1993 gubernatorial election. Florio has already announced his
plans to seek the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination and has been
raising money and trying to build support for his political
comeback. But he has yet to win the support of many party leaders,
who worry that the $2.8 billion tax increase he sponsored while
governor will hurt him in a race against Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Republicans have also considered running for
Lautenberg's seat, but most are expected to step aside for Whitman.
Even so, she is expected to face a primary challenge from Murray
Sabrin, who ran for governor as a member of the Libertarian Party
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that she made the decision after she became
convinced that she could complete her second-term agenda in three
years instead of four. She noted that the state Legislature has
already agreed to move forward with her property tax rebate plan,
her initiative to preserve one million acres of farmland and other
open space, roll back auto insurance rates and deregulate the
energy industry.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Whitman filed papers Thursday formally creating a
campaign committee, she said that she would not begin actively
campaigning or talking about broader issues until sometime next
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Florio, firing his first salvo at the newly announced
candidate, said he had already begun to outline his positions and
that he would expect the governor to begin presenting her views to
voters as well.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by reporters whether she was worried about a possible
rematch with a candidate as well known as Florio, Whitman laughed
and said, ``I certainly look forward to comparing our records about
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats who have expressed interest in the seat include
Rep. Frank Pallone; Goldman Sachs co-chairman Jon Corzine; former
state party chairman B. Thomas Byrne and Cherry Hill Mayor Susan
Bass Levin.
</P>
<P>
   After her election as governor in 1993, Whitman rose to national
prominence by delivering on her campaign pledge to cut income tax
rates by 30 percent. She was occasionally mentioned as a possible
vice presidential or presidential candidate, and in 1994 was
selected to deliver the Republicans'
</P>
<P>
   televised response to the State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   But her prospects for national office were diminished after the
1994 congressional elections, when conservatives seized control of
the Republican Party and Whitman's support for abortion rights put
her at odds with some party leaders. Those prospects seemed to dim
even further after she nearly lost a re-election bid in 1997. And
in recent months she has said emphatically that she had no interest
in running for national office.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two months, as she decided whether to run for
the Senate, Whitman received a pledge from the National Republican
Senatorial Committee to help her campaign, she said. Those promises
were important to Whitman, her campaign aides said, because during
her 1990 challenge to Sen. Bill Bradley, Whitman received similar
promises, but the help never materialized and she lost a
surprisingly close race.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is a costly and complicated arena for statewide
campaigns because candidates need to reach voters by advertising in
two expensive media markets, New York and Philadelphia. Most
political analysts predict that each major party candidate will
need up to $12 million to run a competitive campaign. As an
incumbent governor, Whitman is not expected to have much difficulty
raising funds.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman is likely to share the political spotlight in the region
next year with a fellow Republican, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who is considering a U.S. Senate bid in New York. The
mayor and the governor have recently clashed on a issues ranging
from garbage to sports franchises, but met for dinner this week at
the New York mayoral residence in an effort to smooth their
differences as they plot their next political moves.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ President Slobodan Milosevic's unexpected
decision to seal Kosovo's border to fleeing refugees took NATO by
surprise, and officials say they are now struggling to deal with
the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of ethnic Albanians turned back and trudging away
from the border area, NATO now has to take extra care to ensure
that its bombing raids avoid civilians. Officials are also
discussing the plight of homeless civilians inside Kosovo, while
conceding they have no ready plan to help them.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, the allies are not entirely sure where the
wandering refugees are, or how many they are, though Western
officials have said they may number from 15,000 to the tens of
thousands. Before they were turned back, they had been huddling on
the Albanian border for days without food, shelter and water, and
it was unclear how they would survive in a province ravaged by Serb
forces who were not likely to focus their efforts on feeding
displaced Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees were turned away by Serbian guards at the
Macedonian and Albanian borders on Wednesday. The Serbs told them
it was safe to return to their homes because Milosevic had declared
a cease-fire in Kosovo, Fabrizio Maltinti, an Italian commander
involved in the NATO effort to help the refugees, told reporters
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said that to make sure the refugees heeded the
orders, Serbs were sealing the border with mines. The Serbs had
used mines to try to prevent separatist Kosovo guerrillas from
infiltrating into the province; now they are blocking some of the
main exit routes.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs have even placed mines along the sides of roads to insure
that the refugees are channeled back toward the interior of Kosovo,
one Western diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the NATO reconnaissance planes and satellites over
Yugoslavia, military officials have been unable to give any
specific information about how many refugees had been turned back
or where they were headed at Thursday morning's closed-door
briefing for allied ambassadors. NATO's attention has been focused
till now on ferreting out Serbian armor, not following refugees,
though that was likely to change with the new developments.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's decision to shut the border came as a shock to NATO
_ as had the ferocity of his campaign to drive more than half a
million ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tactic of driving the refugees back is new,'' said Claire
Short, a senior British official in charge of international
assistance. ``We do not know whether they have been driven back to
their homes or elsewhere in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade seems to have several possible goals in closing its
borders to refugee flight.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Milosevic has proclaimed that peace is at hand, he
apparently wants to cite the returning refugees as evidence that
life is getting back to normal. Or, as the Belgrade radio put it on
Thursday, ``a process of return of displaced persons has been
initiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing the border would also put an end to the disturbing
images of fleeing refugees, images that have turned much of world
public opinion against the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
   These clumsy efforts at public relations, however, are unlikely
to have a major influence on NATO. The specter of desperate
refugees wandering without food and shelter in Kosovo has already
become another charge in the West's brief against the Milosevic
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Milosevic's ``peace'' come close to meeting the
alliance's demand that Serb forces which have been terrorizing the
ethnic Albanians be withdrawn from Kosovo, and that a NATO-led
international peacekeeping force be stationed there instead.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to seal the border also may be intended to serve
Belgrade's military goals. As NATO has picked up the pace of its
air attacks, Serbian tanks and vehicles have sought to ward off the
blows by hiding near civilian structures and population centers.
</P>
<P>
   Military planners had said last week that the routing of ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo would make their targeting easier by emptying
much of the province of much of its civilian population. Now, the
shifting crowds of refugees will complicate war planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no clear lines where the bad guys are and the
friendlies are,'' said Major Gen. Charles F. Wald, a senior aide to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they had no firm proof that the Yugoslav
military was using the refugees as ``human shields,'' though they
have been anecdotal reports that Serb units have deliberately been
operating near civilians.
</P>
<P>
   While the presence of thousands of additional Albanians on the
battlefield will present another problem for NATO's targeteers, it
is unlikely to present an insurmountable challenge to the allied
military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The main impediment to a quick allied victory at this point is
the absence of ground forces as well as self-imposed constraints
against political targets, such as Belgrade's television broadcast
capability.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has proclaimed it has made major gains by
destroying Serb fuel supplies, but this is only an indirect blow to
the fighting capability of the Serbs in Kosovo. The Serbs have
already accomplished their goal of reducing the ethnic Albanian
population and can conserve fuel by staying in their hiding places.
</P>
<P>
   The sealed-off borders, however, do heighten an already
monumental humanitarian problems. Even before the borders were
closed, NATO was struggling with masses of refugees in Macedonia
and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western European diplomat said on Thursday, for
example, that the allies were not aware of the Macedonian decision
to bus thousands of refugees to Albania until after they were on
their way out.
</P>
<P>
   As trying as things have been for the refugees outside Kosovo,
however, the situation for those who have not made it across the
border is even worse.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO diplomat said that only a few aid groups are able to work
inside Kosovo: an organization inspired by Mother Teresa and an
emergency team sent to Yugoslavia by the Russian government. Their
efforts are likely to be insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The pressing question today is what NATO can do to help. As
refugees rushed toward the border last week, the alliance ruled out
dropping food and medicine to them inside Kosovo. It said the
supplies could be used by Serb forces and that the refugees would
be taken care of after they crossed the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that NATO is helping to get on top of the humanitarian
crisis outside Kosovo, we do not want to see a second humanitarian
crisis inside Kosovo itself, with all of these people without
shelter, food or any kind of assistance,'' said NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea.

 &HT;    NATO INTENSIFIES ATTACKS AS TALKS ARE SET ON THREE CAPTIVE
AMERICANS
 &HT;    EDS: Optional trim at 750
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON U.S. and allied pilots pressed a withering,
around-the-clock air campaign directly on Yugoslav troops and
police early Friday, targeting forces on the ground, tanks on the
road and heavy artillery in the field.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he was hopeful that a Cypriot statesman
would be able to secure the release of three captured American
soldiers during talks in Belgrade scheduled for Friday. The
Pentagon insisted, however, that it would not barter away NATO air
strikes in exchange for the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Explosions rocked the suburbs of Belgrade early Friday, in the
17th straight day of NATO bombing. The state-run Tanjug news agency
reported separate strikes on a fuel depot in the town of Smederevo,
to the south, and explosions also in the southern industrial city
of Kragujevac.
</P>
<P>
   The first four U.S. tanks were flown into Albania to support 24
Apache attack helicopters and 18 battlefield missile launchers. The
Apaches, expected to begin arriving in Albania late next week, are
fast and low-flying gunships that would add an aggressive new
element to NATO's efforts to strike Yugoslav troops and tanks in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Escalating the image war for public opinion, NATO officials said
they would target state-run television broadcast facilities in
Belgrade unless those outlets agree to air uncensored Western media
reports.
</P>
<P>
   The threat came a day after Serb television reported that NATO
bombs not Serb troops and police had reduced much of the Kosovo
provincial capital of Pristina to an abandoned wasteland of smoke
and ash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb radio and TV is an instrument of propaganda and
repression. It has filled the airwaves with hate and with lies over
the years, and especially now,'' said NATO air commodore David
Wilby. ``It is therefore a legitimate target in this
</P>
<P>
   campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said NATO would take those stations off its target list if
Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, would
allow uncensored Western media reports six hours a day split
between afternoon and evening broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Serbian television was used as a proper tool of free
speech, as opposed to a propaganda machine, then it would be
considered, as other media broadcasts, very much acceptable,'' said
Wilby.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic wasn't expected to embrace the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Spyros Kyprianou, speaker of the Cypriot parliament, traveled to
Belgrade aboard a Greek airplane Thursday and was scheduled to meet
Friday with Milosevic to discuss the possible release of three
American soldiers captured last week near Macedonia's border with
the Serb province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be for anything that would honorable that would secure
their release, obviously,'' Clinton said at a White House press
conference with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon spokesman Capt. Michael Doubleday said NATO would
not halt its air strikes to secure the soldiers's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is immoral to use them as any kind of bargaining chips,''
Doubleday said, ``and we are certainly not going to negotiate in
any way for their release.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials showed extensive video and still
photography on Thursday, pointing to mounting success in targeting
Yugoslav troops, police and equipment in the south and west of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two weeks of air strikes focused on fuel depots,
ammo dumps, roads, bridges and command and control facilities,
troops inside Kosovo are showing signs of isolation and depletion,
said Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson, intelligence director for the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're feeling the impact among their deployed forces,'' said
Wilson, citing fuel shortages that appear to be slowing military
operations across Kosovo. He said direct strikes on troops and
tanks have forced some units to disperse and hide their vehicles in
abandoned buildings and beneath foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said repeated attacks on Yugoslavia's two refineries and
more than a dozen large oil storage facilities had destroyed
one-fifth of the country's petroleum stocks. Additional strikes
have targeted oil loading docks and distribution routes, forcing
widespread fuel shortages across the country and limiting the
army's ability to resupply tanks and trucks in the field.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Serbs forced thousands of fleeing refugees to turn
back and march into southwestern Kosovo, Wilby said it still isn't
known where those civilians have gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously very concerned about where those people will
be moved to,'' said Wilby. There were scattered reports that Serbs
have used ethnic Albanians as human shields to try to confound
allied attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have anecdotal rumors and reports of human shields, which
we have not been able to verify,'' said Wilson. ``It is a miserable
tactic for anybody to use in a wartime scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 24 hours from Wednesday night through Thursday, NATO
forces struck two dozen targets across Serbia. Seeking out Serb
forces in broad daylight, a pair of British Harrier jets destroyed
a compound of military vehicles in southwest Kosovo with
armor-piercing cluster bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon showed video footage of laser-guided bombs
destroying a Serb armored personnel carrier typically such vehicles
carry a dozen or so troops and crew as it moved along a road in
southwest Kosovo.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other Pentagon images showed:
</P>
<P>
   A Maverick missile destroying a bridge in Kosovo after being
fired by an A-10 Thunderbolt jet flying under heavy anti-aircraft
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Another A-10 attack on a convoy aborted under heavy
anti-aircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of the Raska bridge, a large highway bridge five
miles north of Kosovo, by F-15 warplanes dropping 2,000 pound
laser-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   An attack with similar bombs dropped by F-16s on an ammunition
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on activities over the past several days, Wilson also
said NATO forces had tracked down and bombed a group of combat
vehicles and forces at a rendezvous point at Istok, ten miles north
of Pec in western Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A similar attack south of Pec, near Decani, killed troops and
destroyed tanks, trucks, anti-aircraft guns and heavy artillery
that Serbs had used to shell nearby cities as part of a wider
campaign of terror targeting ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The allies also reported hitting a convoy of troops either Serb
army or special police near the city of Djakovica, scene of some of
the most intensive anti-Albanian repression.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Air Force Gen. Charles Wald, vice director of strategic
plans and policy for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said strikes
against fielded forces would continue to intensify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are flying day and night missions. And some of the day
packages are what we would consider large packages,'' said Wald,
referring to the grouping of several types of combat aircraft and
protective craft assigned to a specific mission. ``I would tell
Milosevic that ``If you don't understand we're committed by now,
you probably ought to start reading tea leaves.''

ANALYSIS: BEHIND MICROSOFT'S SHIFT ON WINDOWS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)  By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Microsoft's dramatic shift, shelving strategic
plans to blend its consumer and business Windows operating systems
into a single product, reflects profound changes in the consumer
personal computer marketplace that have surprised both the software
giant and its partner, Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight the PC market has moved from a business defined
by office products to one that is increasingly delineated by both
consumer prices and features.
</P>
<P>
   The shift became apparent on Wednesday at a Los Angeles hardware
developers' conference, when Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's president,
announced that the company planned at least one more release of its
aging Windows operating system for desktop computers. A version,
based on Windows 98 that is scheduled to ship this fall, will fix
software flaws and add some new consumer-oriented features.
</P>
<P>
   Then the company, based in Redmond, Wash., plans ``sometime in
2000'' to release a new consumer version of Windows that will offer
an as-yet-unannounced set of easy-to-use consumer features, such as
``instant on.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy shift, industry analysts said, may indicate that
Microsoft has found itself at a crossroads as significant as the
one it faced in late 1997 when it abruptly shifted direction and
embraced the growing Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By redefining the computer marketplace and acknowledging the
failure of its strategy to use a single operating system for
desktop machines, Microsoft is leaving itself vulnerable to
competition _ just as Intel is being successfully attacked at the
low end of the chip market by companies like the Advanced Micro
Devices Corp. and the Cyrix Corp.oration.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, consumer electronics companies like the Sony Corp. are
investing in software and operating systems and refining consumer
products like its Playstation line so they will increasingly serve
as Internet computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an explosive problem,'' said Mark Anderson, president
of Technology Alliance Partners, a research and consulting firm
based in Friday Harbor, Wash. ``The consumer market will be the
largest market in the world for operating systems,'' and Microsoft
does not have a product.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer's strategy shift included an acknowledgment that the
company's ``Simple PC'' initiative, intended to clean up the
increasingly complex design of the PC, had not gone far enough.
That effort, in connection with Intel has now been renamed ``Easy
PC,'' and Microsoft's president said that it would remain a
multiyear effort.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ballmer, by announcing Microsoft's intent to add a new
operating system between its Windows 98 and Windows CE product
lines, is in effect admitting that the company's CE strategy has
been a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   In its recent corporate reorganization, the Windows CE consumer
product line was divided in two, between set-top box and hand-held
and portable groups. The shift raised questions about the future of
Windows CE, which has so far had only lukewarm support among
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Anderson said, while Intel's failure to
respond quickly enough to the threat at the low end was a billion
dollar mistake, Microsoft may not pay such a price if it responds
promptly because there are not yet viable competitors in the
consumer space.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Linux operating system remains at least a year
away from being simple enough to install and having a meaningful
number of consumer applications. The Be operating system, developed
by Be Inc., of Menlo Park, Calif., has yet to take off.
</P>
<P>
   Although Apple Computer has gained some market share and been
revitalized since the return of its co-founder, Steven Jobs, it
still remains at a price disadvantage to PCs in consumer markets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the competitive situation at the low end of the PC market
is likely to become more volatile because the Windows 98 operating
system is increasingly the wrong product for consumers who are
oriented toward entertainment and away from Microsoft's Office
productivity suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Jeffrey Tarter,
the editor of Softletter, an industry newsletter based in
Watertown, Mass. ``The real problem is the more you look at the
innards of Windows the more complicated and more flaky it gets. I
don't see any way that they can fix the mess they created without
going back to the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   That appears to be exactly what Microsoft is doing in announcing
a new operating system that may appear in the year 2000 or 2001.
Ballmer said the new operating system would include advances in
digital media handling, home networking, Internet technologies and
improvements in the ease of installation and use. That product
outline has evoked a skeptical response from competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a risk of being called sexist, ageist and French,'' said
Jean Louis Gassee, chairman of Be, ``if you put multimedia, a
leather skirt and lipstick on a grandmother and take her to a night
club, she's still not going to get lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its consumer plans in a state of flux, Microsoft also
announced plans for its corporate Windows 2000 operating system,
raising new concerns that by fragmenting its product line the
company may inadvertently sew confusion among customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raised a red flag for me,'' said Louis J. Mazzucchelli
Jr., a financial analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison, a New York
investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the company now had as many as four or more
versions of its high-end Windows 2000 operating system (formerly
Windows NT) in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember when Apple had more than 17 different product
lines?'' he said. ``I have trouble understanding how Microsoft is
going to keep customers from becoming confused.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Windows Server Appliance, which Ballmer announced
on Wednesday, he said the company was working on Windows 2000,
Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000
Advanced Server and Windows 2000 Data Center.
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably, this could leave the software developer at a
disadvantage against Linux and other versions of the Unix operating
system, which have been growing rapidly among both Internet server
and software developer markets.

CONCERN MOUNTS OVER YUGOSLAVIA'S HANDLING OF REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concerns grew within the NATO alliance Thursday
that Yugoslavia was halting the exodus of Kosovo Albanian refugees
for a second day both to turn them into human shields and to
complicate NATO's intense bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials said the refugees were returning voluntarily
from the border with Macedonia, and US officials admitted they had
no hard evidence that the hunkered-down Serbian forces in Kosovo
were hiding behind civilians. Still, US officials described the
border closing possibly as part of an ``evil design'' by
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic to force refugees home and
into harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to try to ascertain what the evil design
is of this terrible business,'' said State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin. ``Clearly, by closing the border and trying to send
people back, he is not allowing the Kosovar Albanians out of
Kosovar.''
</P>
<P>
   As NATO bombed targets in the suburbs of Belgrade Thursday
night, Air Marshal Sir John Day said at a British military briefing
that NATO forces would ``take every precaution'' to avoid bombing
targets inside Kosovo where refugees might be. ``At the end of the
day, the responsibility is Milosevic's,'' Day said.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   --Kosovar refugees will not arrive at a US naval base in Cuba
until next week at the earliest, and US officials suggested few
Kosovars may ever volunteer to relocate there.
</P>
<P>
   --US and UN relief officials said they believed most of the more
than 40,000 Kosovar refugees who vanished overnight Wednesday from
a rough camp on the Kosovo-Macedonia border had been accounted for
in Macedonia, Albania, and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   --NATO announced the launch of ``Operation Allied Harbor,'' a
deployment of 8,000 multinational troops to Albania by the end of
next week to provide humanitarian relief to the 300,000 refugees in
11 camps.
</P>
<P>
   --President Clinton, asked by reporters if he believed NATO's
campaign against Yugoslavia would succeed without the use of ground
troops, said: ``I believe our present strategy will work if we can
keep the allies with it.'' New polls show increased US support for
troop deployment.
</P>
<P>
   --European Union foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, gave
strong support Thursday to NATO airstrikes and said Serb leaders
they blamed for atrocities in Kosovo should be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, expectations for a quick release of the three US
soldiers held by the Yugoslavs since March 31 fell Thursday when a
meeting between a Cypriot diplomat and Milosveic was delayed until
Friday. Spyros Kyprianou, acting president of Cyprus, arrived in
Belgrade Thursday after NATO arranged for the safe passage of his
aircraft into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Kyprianou said the Americans might be freed during the long
Orthodox Easter weekend that starts Friday, and he suggested NATO
could then ``reciprocate by responding to the numerous
international appeals for a cease-fire.'' But the hardline Serbian
vice premier, Vojislav Seselj, told reporters that would be
unnecessary since freeing the three was ``out of the question,''
and that the soldiers should be tried as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he hoped Kyprianou's mission would
succeed. ``We would like to see the servicemen released because
they never should have been detained in the first place,'' Clinton
said. ``And I would be for anything honorable that would secure
their release, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials insisted Thursday they would not negotiate with the
Serb-led government of Yugoslavia or halt the NATO bombing campaign
to free the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, NATO's air campaign against targets in Belgrade and
Kosovo continued in mostly good weather and with great intensity.
NATO officials in Brussels said its planes flew 400 sorties
Wednesday night, with US Navy fighters from the USS Roosevelt
aircraft carrier in the Adriatic Sea joining the campaign for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with films and detailed explanations of what they said
were NATO hits on Serb targets in Belgrade and Kosovo, spokesmen at
NATO headquarters in Brussels and at the Pentagon said the bombing
campaign was inflicting heavy damange on Serb military
installations and degrading their capacity to make war and
terrorize civilians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our operations are ongoing with even greater success against
fielded forces,'' said Air Commodore David Wilby of the British
Royal Air Force, a spokesman for NATO. ``Our operational tempo and
effectiveness continues to increase. I believe that our momentum is
building with encouraging pace.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance spokesmen denied Serb charges that its bombing in
the Kosovo capital of Pristina was the cause of widespread
destruction and 10 deaths. They accused the Serbs of destroying
civilian buildings and homes themselves to make it appear that NATO
had bombed the sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't rule out that some of the damage _ two nights ago, we
attacked the telephone exchange (in Pristina) _ was not done by air
attack,'' said Rear Admiral Thomas Wilson, director of intelligence
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``But the rest of the damage being
shown in Pristina was done by the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that NATO's policy is to ``do all it can to avoid
collateral damage,'' but officials were clearly concerned that the
return of the refugees from the closed border could put them in
danger of NATO airstrikes, even if they could not prove Serb intent
to make them human shields.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a continuing humanitarian concern about the fate
and well-being of the 10,000 ethnic Albanians who had been turned
back at the border on Wednesday. Some had been separated from
families who had made it into Macedonia; many were without food,
water, or warm clothing, refugee workers said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandako Ogata, the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees, arrived
in Albania Thursday to assess the ``enormous task'' and figure out
what had happened to the Kosovars who had been denied passage at
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what happened to them, and I'm very very
worried,'' Ogata said. ``I hope it was not stopped by force. But
right now, I really have no information.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Brian Atwood, the US coordinator of refugee relief, said
conditions are becoming critical in Kukes, an Albanian town where
many of the 140,000 Kosovar refugees are suffering from trauma and
increasing medical problems, including respiratory ailments and
diarrhea. The food needs there alone, he said, are 125 tons a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never seen a group of refugees so traumatized by what
they have been through,'' said Atwood, who is administrator of the
US Agency for International Development. ``What do you do for a
9-year-old child who watched three of his brothers be executed and
his house be lit on fire with his 2-year-old sister inside?''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said because the refugee flow is slowing, more camps are
being set up in Albania and Macedonia, and the ethnic Albanians
don't want to leave the region, using the US naval base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, may be unnecessary, at least in the short
term.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said he and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton would
travel to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware Friday to meet with the
crew members helping coordinate an airlift of relief supplies. Mrs.
Clinton is also going to be featured in an administration
advertising campaign to encourage Americans to donate to the
Kosovar relief, Atwood said.

TOUGHER RULES FOR FISHING INDUSTRY URGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A new Coast Guard report urges that a series of tough
rules _ from boat inspections to crew licensing _ be imposed on the
dangerous and largely unregulated world of commercial fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has gone down this road before. Agencies
from the National Transportation Safety Board to the National
Research Council have made many of the same recommendations in the
past 10 years, only to have an industry opposed to regulation
defeat them.
</P>
<P>
   What also hasn't changed is that commercial fishing is a
dangerous pursuit, according to the report, ``Dying to Fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen are 16 times more likely to die on the job than
firefighters or police officers, the report noted, and eight times
more likely to die on the job than truck drivers and others who
operate motor vehicles for a living.
</P>
<P>
   A fishing safety law passed by Congress in 1988 has cut deaths
by 20 percent, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, where much of Washington state's fleet works, deaths
have fallen from about 36 a year to 18, according to the Coast
Guard in Juneau. Thirteen lives and 32 vessels were lost last year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of vessels lost in Alaska has not changed much.
</P>
<P>
   The 1988 law, by requiring emergency equipment such as survival
suits and life rafts and the ability to use them, largely focused
on how to survive accidents, not how to prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard, for example, has a voluntary program to inspect
fishing boats. But fewer than half the nation's boats participate
in the program, and the inspections themselves focus on safety
equipment, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Mark Prescott, vice chairman of
the task force that released the report this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't tell a guy, `Hey, the hull looks like it's in poor
condition,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It would be like requiring flight crews to carry parachutes but
not requiring them to prove their competence to fly or that their
planes are airworthy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to use Prescott's own analogy, if people keep falling off a
cliff, ``you park an ambulance at the bottom instead of building a
fence at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force of Coast Guard officers and representatives of
other government agencies was formed in January after a series of
fishing boat accidents off the New Jersey coast. From late December
to mid-January, four boats sank in the mid-Atlantic, and 11 people
died.
</P>
<P>
   The sinkings sparked an interest in fishing vessel safety all
the way to Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater, Prescott
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also has received special emphasis from an assistant
commandant of the Coast Guard, Rear Adm. Robert North. He has
ordered an industry group that advises the Coast Guard on fishing
safety to meet next week in Washington, D.C., to consider the 50
recommendations the task force made.
</P>
<P>
   Some, including mandatory boat inspections, would require the
authorization of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard could adopt other recommendations simply by
adopting new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations would have the biggest effect on operators
of smaller fishing vessels. Skippers of large boats, for example,
already must have licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be overly optimistic if I thought fishermen would welcome
more regulation,'' Prescott said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he said the fishing industry might be receptive to
equitable regulations that are ``not creating a standard someone
already in the business can't meet.''
</P>
<P>
   The fishing industry probably isn't going to be receptive to a
long list of new regulations, said Jim Herbert, a fisherman and
technical college instructor from Seward, Alaska, who heads the
fishing industry group that advises the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's business as usual,'' Herbert said. ``But then the oil
industry never requested double-hulled tankers, and the auto
industry never requested seat belts.''
</P>
<P>
   The climate may have changed enough, he said, that the industry
may be willing to accept some of the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the task force's recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   -Require safety inspections of fishing boats and ensure that the
inspections are a prerequisite for fishing permits and vessel
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   -Make operators of fishing boats have a license, apply drug and
alcohol testing to crews, and require crew members to hold a
competency certificate.
</P>
<P>
   -Require larger boats to meet stability requirements, make sure
boats have emergency lighting and smoke detectors in interior
spaces and force crew members to wear personal flotation devices in
some locations on deck.

RAYTHEON SUES 21 OVER NET CHAT POSTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a controversial case that has attracted national attention,
Raytheon Co. has sued 21 anonymous authors for allegedly revealing
company secrets on an Internet chat board and causing ``harm to its
business reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a matter involving at least two of the chatters the
Lexington, Mass. defense contractor had already reported in public
filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission some of the
information that it now alleges was improperly revealed on the Web,
a Boston Globe review shows.
</P>
<P>
   The material concerns problems at a Raytheon project to make
electronic devices in South Korea. Raytheon recorded a $54 million
charge after taxes last year because of losses on the project,
according to a company filing dated Aug. 12. Two people _ using the
screen names ``Winstoncar'' and ``bobchand'' _ made references to
the Korean project on a Yahoo message board a month later. Raytheon
now alleges their posts constituted ``disclosure of inside
financial issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Raytheon's suit, filed in February, Winstoncar
has been dismissed, a person familiar with the matter now says.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Winstoncar nor bobchand could be reached to comment
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon won't discuss why it considers the Korean matter
proprietary given its earlier SEC filing. Postings by the other 19
anonymous writers named in the suit covered other matters, ranging
from details of union contract talks to general gripes about
Raytheon management.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that in light of Raytheon's filings, its chief
aim in pursuing the suit is to silence debate rather than to
protect company secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no grounds to say it's private, so they're just
going after people who repeat it,'' said James George, a private
investigator who has set up an Internet site devoted to the case.
</P>
<P>
   After its lawsuit caused a stir, Raytheon issued a policy
stating that employees can talk about public matters on the
Internet, but should keep quiet about proprietary information. Now,
``it makes you wonder what Raytheon means'' with its new policy,
said William Arabolos, chief executive of Akom Technologies Inc. of
Bethel, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Akom, a former supplier to Raytheon has sued the company over
the Korean project, and Arabolos says the details from the SEC
filing and the Yahoo chat relate to the same matter.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon filed suit in Middlesex (Mass.) Superior Court against
21 people it describes as ``John Does,'' who the company charges
posted improper information on the World Wide Web. Raytheon seeks
damages of more than $25,000 from the group, which it believes
includes current and former employees who signed agreements
pledging not to reveal proprietary information. Raytheon also wants
the group banned from further improper chat.
</P>
<P>
   Because the messages weren't posted under users' real names,
Raytheon obtained court motions against Yahoo to gain information
about what the California Internet portal service knew about their
identities. Based on that information, Raytheon in March obtained
similar motions against America Online, Microsoft Corp. and other
service providers in the hopes of tracing the identities of the
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't clear what the Internet service providers have told
Raytheon so far, and critics have seized on the case to argue
Internet users deserve more protection of their identity in civil
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Now the latest details about Raytheon's own previous disclosures
would seem to weaken its case against the John Does, said John
Reinstein, legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts. ``Certainly
it's not likely they'll get an injunction against discussion of
material that's already in the public domain,'' he said. ``Nor is
it clear there's any basis for damages.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention to the suit comes at a sensitive time for Raytheon,
whose new chief executive, Daniel Burnham, has pledged to
decentralize decision making at the company. Yet Raytheon's pending
suit is also one of the most aggressive to date by a company
seeking to crack down on talk about it on line.
</P>
<P>
   The company has declined to discuss actions taken against
employees, citing their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The issues stemming from the Korean contract seem to be among
the most sensitive in the lawsuit. In all, the company objected to
29 e-mails that allegedly violated its rules against disclosing
proprietary information.
</P>
<P>
   In a message on the Yahoo chat board dated Sept. 4 Winstoncar
typed: ``I heard there was a bit of a scandal in Advanced Device
Center in Andover. Someone wasn't watching the `store' . . .
closely regarding $100 million in Korean contracts. Knowing their
economy wasn't that great, they decided to look into the books,
shortly after that the comptroller was walked out the door (fired),
and the head of ADC, I won't mention names, was demoted.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days later, bobchand referred on the message board to
``the loss of 100 million on the Korea deal'' as part of a general
posting about the company's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Both Winstoncar and bobchand said in later postings on the chat
board that they didn't believe they were revealing inside
information.
</P>
<P>
   In a routine quarterly filing to the SEC dated Aug. 12, 1998,
Raytheon said it recorded a special charge of $54 million after
taxes. ``The special charge consisted of $27 million to writedown
to estimated realizable value certain assets the company has
decided to sell and $27 million as the current estimated asset
impairment for commercial electronics manufacturing operations
located in Korea,'' the document states.
</P>
<P>
   Arabolos said the work related to plans to manufacture office
networking products in Korea by a joint venture called RayCom.
Partners were Raytheon and a Seoul-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Akom was formed in 1996 to act as a purchasing arm of the joint
venture, according to Akom's suit against Raytheon and others,
filed in US District Court in Connecticut in February. Akom later
placed $22 million worth of orders on Raytheon's behalf, according
to the suit. However, Raytheon and the joint failed to pay for the
parts, Akom charges.

`FAMILY GUY' IS CLEVER, FUNNY - AND INSULTING 
</HEADLINE>
 GUY-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Husband and wife are in bed. Wife suggests hanky-panky. Clueless
husband misses the signals. It's as much a comedy cliche as the
single parent.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Family Guy,'' which targets everything we love and loathe
about TV, it is still a cliche. But when served with a twist of
sublime, cliches are so much easier to swallow. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   Lois Griffin says to her husband: ``You should spend some time
with our kids, Peter. And with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Griffin replies: ``Whoa. What could me and you do
together?''
</P>
<P>
   Lois laughs coquettishly, bats her eyelashes.
</P>
<P>
   Peter recoils: ``Lois, you've got a sick mind!''
</P>
<P>
   Lois continues: ``Peter, I'm talking about making love.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter, relieved, says: ``Oh, I thought you wanted us to murder
the children and harvest their organs for beer money!''
</P>
<P>
   In politically correct precincts, ``Family Guy'' will offend. In
places where subversive humor is embraced and cherished, it will be
hailed for what it is: a wry observation of behavior that is not
becoming, yet becoming more prevalent in a polarized society. The
funniest character is a 1-year-old baby named Stewie, whose goal is
world domination and the elimination of anyone who stands in his
way, parents included. Stewie has two older siblings, ages 13 and
16, and there's a family dog who puts on airs and drinks too much.
</P>
<P>
   It's all raucous nonsense, but the debate will rage as to
whether ``Family Guy'' contributes to, or merely reflects, the
demise of civility. As with most TV fare, it's doing a little of
both, and it's doing it with a sharp eye for detail.
</P>
<P>
   After a post-Super Bowl presentation in January and a
rebroadcast Tuesday night, ``Family Guy'' settles into its regular
slot at 8:30 p.m. Sunday with a riotously irreverent,
laugh-out-loud episode.
</P>
<P>
   Series creator Seth MacFarlane mined his New England origins to
create the Griffin family and the clammy enclave of Quahog, R.I.,
where life is amazingly derivative. Shoot, the baseline of ``Family
Guy'' is so similar to ``The Simpsons'' that it's amazing Fox put
it on at all.
</P>
<P>
   But not all imitations have to be pale ones. Grounded a bit more
in reality, ``Family Guy'' is clever,
</P>
<P>
   funny, insulting to just about every interest group imaginable _
and far from a carbon copy.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the principal character is a plain-speaking oaf of
white-bread America, quick with an impolitic comment or an
offensive barb. But Peter Griffin actually understands that he has
family obligations, where Homer Simpson understands nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Peter even tries to get the family to stop watching so much TV
by planning other activities. The family goes along for a while,
but soon returns to the blandishments of the tube, causing Peter to
say, ``But I thought we were having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Daughter Meg, supine in front of the television, replies: ``We
were, but now it might be nice to watch other people have fun. Or
get killed. You know, whatever's on.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Seth MacFarlane is hoping to connect with just that
sort of discriminating audience.
</P>
<P>
   Family Guy. Half-hour animated comedy series about a family of
five (plus dog) living in the suburbs. Voices by Seth MacFarlane,
Alex Borstein and Seth Green. Premieres in its regular time slot
Sunday on Fox. Parental guideline rating: TV-14.

AFTER U.S. REQUEST, BEIJING DELAYS TRIAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese officials have postponed the trial of a
democracy advocate, which was scheduled to start this week, after
the U.S. Embassy here urged them to drop or postpone the case.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Beijing courts said the trial of the advocate, Fang
Jue, on charges of fraud and illegal business activities would
begin on Tuesday. That was the day set for the start of Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji's official visit to the United States, which is
intended to patch up growing conflicts over human rights, trade,
missile defenses and charges of Chinese nuclear espionage.
</P>
<P>
   On learning of the trial date, the U.S. Embassy urged China to
release Fang and drop the charges, an embassy official said. ``If
they couldn't do that, we noted that the timing was very
inauspicious,'' said the official. If a trial does occur, the
embassy told the Chinese, it would like to observe the proceedings
firsthand, something that has never been permitted in a political
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Fang, 44, was formerly a government planner in the southern
province of Fujian but broke off to start his own trading company.
He had never been openly involved in dissident activities, but in
early 1998 he distributed to foreign journalists a manifesto
calling for democratic government, negotiations on autonomy for
Tibet and other changes. He said the document reflected
conversations among many younger government and Communist Party
officials, though he refused to name any.
</P>
<P>
   Exiled dissidents in New York championed his report, and he was
detained last July. Eight months later he was told of the charges
against him, relating to alleged acceptance of company payments
while he was still an official in 1995. He has denied the charges
and his sister says they were fabricated.

GARCIAPARRA DAY-TO-DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Nomar Garciaparra, who had been vague about
his elbow this spring, made no attempt to downplay how his left
hamstring felt Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts quite a bit,'' said Garciaparra, who strained the
muscle high in his left leg in the ninth inning of Wednesday
night's 6-0 win over the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who was on first base after a fielder's choice,
scored on Mike Stanley's two-run double, but on his way from third
to home felt the muscle grab. He remained on his back for a few
moments after sliding across the plate, then got up and gingerly
made his way back to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   He said that night he hoped it would feel better by the time he
came to the park Thursday afternoon, but that wasn't the case. He
was scratched from Thursday night's game here against the Royals,
is unlikely to play this weekend against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
on the artificial surface of Tropicana Field, and ackonwledged the
possibility he'll have to go on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no bruising or blood, which is good,'' he said.
``It's one of those things you have to take day by day to see
exactly how it feels. Hopefully, it won't be too long...I don't
know whether that (placing him on the DL) is going on, but until we
know how it is, we're going to have look at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams, who used Donnie Sadler in Garciaparra's
place, said that for now, he's considering Garciaparra's
availability on a day-to-day basis. But Williams usually prefers to
err on the side of caution, especially with an injury like a
hamstring, which can be easily aggravated.
</P>
<P>
   Just the fact Garciaparra allowed for the possibility he'd have
to go on the DL is a measure of how much it hurts him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give you any timetable,'' Garciaparra said. ``I
definitely know I did something with it, and we'll just go from
there. A hammy's something you've gotta really watch. It can feel
good some time, and you think it's OK, then it gets you
again...What I might not be able to do today I might be able to do
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra sounded like he'd just as soon not take any chances
on the artficial surface in St. Petersburg this weekend. ``You've
got to watch that, too,'' he said. ``It's a factor. It's different
playing on turf than other surfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra said he has not had problems with his hamstrings. In
1996, while playing for Pawtucket, Garciaparra tore a tendon behind
his left knee and was out for nearly three months. Technically,
that was a hamstring muscle as well, but in an entirely different
area from his current problem.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Garciaparra missed 14 games at shortstop after
straining the flexor muscle in his throwing elbow. Concerns that
the tendinitis he was experiencing could flare up again is one
reason the Red Sox kept Sadler on the big-league roster.
</P>
<P>
   And it was in Kansas City last May 9 that Garciaparra separated
his right shoulder diving for an eighth-inning groundball with the
Sox ahead by eight runs. His rookie season, 1997, he missed four
straight games with a sore ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' Garciaparra said of this spring's injury woes.
``Maybe it's just one year to get them all out of the way. I don't
get it.''

`OPEN' STATUS NOT SO BAD FOR JOCKEYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ He thought he was going to ride General Challenge in
the Santa Anita Derby. He was shunted onto High Wire Act. General
Challenge won Saturday's race. High Wire Act finished last.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Chris McCarron is still looking for a horse for the
May 1 Kentucky Derby, while Gary Stevens has one of the favorites
in General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But don't feel too sorry for McCarron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have eternal hope,'' the Hall of Famer said Thursday morning
at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   And he should. McCarron knows better than anybody that sometimes
a jockey is better off (begin ital)without(end ital) a commitment
at this stage of the game, with the last major Derby preps coming
up Saturday at Keeneland (the Blue Grass Stakes), Oaklawn Park (the
Arkansas Derby) and Aqueduct (the Wood Memorial).
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, McCarron was ``open,'' in the jockeys'
vernacular, after his Santa Anita Derby horse ran up the track. His
agent, Scotty McClellan, arranged for McCarron to ride Go for Gin,
abandoned by Jerry Bailey before the Kentucky Derby. McCarron won
his second Derby as Go for Gin led virtually from gate to wire on a
sloppy track.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, he was open for the Preakness after Dr
Devious bombed in the Derby, but McCarron showed up at Pimlico to
ride in another race. A track publicist told him Pine Bluff needed
a rider. McCarron ran to a phone and called Pine Bluff trainer Tom
Bohannon. McCarron won his second Preakness as Pine Bluff ran down
Alydeed and former Pine Bluff rider Craig Perret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I even paid you for that one,'' McCarron
kidded his agent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the past 10 horses to win Triple Crown races, only two had
been with the same rider since the start of the year. So good
things often come to those who wait, and especially to McCarron and
the handful of jockeys with his credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is one of them. He's the No.1 rider for two-time
Derby-winning trainer Bob Baffert. Last week, when Stevens became
available to ride General Challenge, Baffert impolitely broke an
oral commitment to McCarron.
</P>
<P>
   In the argument that ensued, Baffert shoved McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gets intense,'' said Tony Matos, Kent Desormeaux's agent,
of the jockeying for Derby mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Among Santa Anita jockeys, only Stevens (General Challenge) and
David Flores (Prime Timber) have Derby mounts secured. But others
need not panic, this being a year when the Derby is seen as wide
open, meaning that some promising horses will need riders.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux: The rider of '98 Derby-Preakness winner Real Quiet
has 7-2 third choice Certain in the Arkansas Derby but has made no
further commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Nakatani: Contractually bound to Desert Hero, third in the
Santa Anita Derby but a question mark for Churchill Downs, he rides
Saint's Honor in Arkansas and is believed to be the alternate when
Bailey gets off Nick Zito-trained Stephen Got Even and/or
Wondertross.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Solis: Second in the Derby with Captain Bodgit ('97) and
Victory Gallop ('98), he'll ride Answer Lively for the first time
in Arkansas, and the '98 2-year-old champion might be Solis' best
chance.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCarron, he'll be aboard Dubai-trained long shot Prado's
Landing in the Blue Grass while waiting for something better to
come along.
</P>
<P>
   It probably will.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend favorites: Wondertross (Bailey), Vicar (Shane Sellers),
Cat Thief (Mike Smith) and Menifee (Pat Day) in the Blue Grass;
Answer Lively (Solis) and Ecton Park (Stevens) in Arkansas; and
Adonis (Jorge Chavez) and Badge (Shaun Bridgmohan) in the Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Krone's retirement: Julie Krone, the first woman jockey to win
3,000 races or a Triple Crown event, cited ``a constellation of
reasons'' for announcing Thursday in New York that she'll retire
April 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on top, I'm 35 years old, I don't want to get hurt
anymore, and I've got nothing left to prove,'' said Krone, who rode
Colonial Affair to win the '93 Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, she hadn't been close to the top since severely
fracturing her right ankle in a '93 fall at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   But racing owes Krone a small debt: She was the subject of some
of the sport's most positive publicity in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   At Santa Anita: Baffert-trained Classic Cat carries a race-high
122 pounds, Budroyale 119, in Sunday's San Bernardino Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Full disclosure? Some bettors thought Baffert should have
revealed (begin ital)before(end ital) Saturday's Santa Anita Derby
that runner-up Prime Timber had to be treated for a foot bruise on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it from the trainer's point of view: If he discloses the
injury, driving bettors away, and the horse wins, a lot of fans are
angry. If he discloses the injury and the horse breaks down in the
race _ even if it's unrelated to the bruise _ it's an
animal-welfare scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A trainer should tell the truth if he's asked about an injury.
But he can't be expected to volunteer the information. &QL;

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
who have been waging a war of independence for the Serbian
province, told foreign diplomats Thursday that they have been hit
hard and that Yugoslav forces have pushed them into the hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pretty weak, they have been badly hit and have taken
casualties,'' said one Western diplomat here. ``They are running
out of ammunition and have lost vehicles and headquarters areas. It
will take time for them to re-equip, they are not going to be much
of a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he added, the Kosovar rebel leadership remains coherent,
and has retained command of its troops. It is even sporadically
engaging the Serbs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel commander, a member of the general staff who goes by the
name of Drini, insisted in an interview that ``The KLA is a good
force. In the last two weeks we have only had 16 casualties from
all units, so it means we are not destroyed or even hurt.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the Yugoslav government announced that peace was
being restored to Kosovo on Thursday, the rebels reported heavy
combat in several areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are reporting heavier fighting today than the last two
days,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``There was heavy shelling east of Mitrovica and in the Drenica
region.''
</P>
<P>
   The two areas he named, in northern and central Kosovo
respectively, have been heavily contested throughout the one-year
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav generals said they would finish off the rebel
force in four days, but they are still there,'' said another
Western military observer who was part of the mission in Kosovo run
by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They remain potentially an effective force,'' he added. ``They
do not threaten the Serbs in the way they did before, they cannot
threaten to break major arteries but they can threaten them in a
(particular) place.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels reported fighting on Thursday in Kachanik, in
southern Kosovo on the main road to Macedonia. The guerrillas
seized part of the town several days ago and appear to be holding
their own. Fighting has flared back and forth, and Serbian MiG
fighters and helicopters attacked Kosovar positions on Thursday,
the rebels reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have gained a lot of territory over recent weeks but
have not tried to hold it, the foreign observers said. They tend to
occupy villages, burn them and then pull out. Often, the villages
are then reoccupied by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav military strategy has been to break up the guerrillas
by surrounding them and pounding them with artillery fire. ``They
try to wear them out in the hope maybe they will give up,'' the
Western diplomat said. ``And then when they are weakened they will
send in the special operations units,'' referring to Yugoslav
commandos who finish off the battle.
</P>
<P>
   That could happen in the next few days. Yet there are signs that
NATO air strikes on Yugoslav armor and bases in Kosovo are
relieving the pressure on the rebel force. Drini, the Kosovar rebel
commander, said NATO planes hit a Serbian armored convoy driving
into northern Kosovo with reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   They also destroyed an armored artillery unit near the village
of Rogovo in southern Kosovo, he said. The previous day, NATO
bombing dealt heavy blows to artillery bases near the town of
Mitrovica in northern Kosovo and south of Klina in the west.
</P>
<P>
   All of the attacks have considerably eased the pressure on the
rebels and reduced the heavy shelling of their positions, the
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA has sounded more relaxed,'' the diplomat said. ``I
could hear in their voices. A couple of days ago I was talking to
someone near Klina, and I could hear the incoming shells exploding.
He held the phone out and said, `You can hear it.' Today he said
`It is quiet, we are sleeping at night.' ''
</P>
<P>
   NATO bombing in Kosovo appears to have taken out artillery bases
and hit a large number of tanks and artillery pieces in Decine, in
western Kosovo, Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian police and army now seem to be moving their forces
constantly, and transferring some forces northwards, allowing the
Kosovars more room, Drini said. He said the rebels were filtering
back into territory previously lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the rebels have ordered a general mobilization
and are actively recruiting fighters in Albania. Their force is
estimated at some 8,000 to 10,000 men and morale appears to be
good.
</P>
<P>
   Drini railed at reports likening the Kosovar rebels to the
Taliban, the militant Islamic fundamentalist movement in
Afghanistan, or to Communist guerrillas. ``We are just fighting for
a decent life, we just want peace. It is just a question of
survival. We have nothing to lose,'' he said.

WOODS STAYS COOL, DESPITE TRIPLE BOGEY ON EIGHTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Tiger Woods was smiling. He had committed the one
faux pas on a golf course that he had promised himself he would
never commit again. But he was relaxed. He had scored a triple
bogey on the so-easy-for-him eighth hole, a very birdieable par-5.
</P>
<P>
   Woods seemingly couldn't have been more pleased. He had been
forced to draw that snowman on his scorecard _ that big, fat ``8''
_ but he hadn't fallen apart. He hadn't become unglued. He hadn't
lost his patience. He had come back. He had settled down. He had
responded as only the best respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in good shape,'' Woods said of his even-par round of 72
that ordinarily might not be satisfactory. ``I'm even par, right
where you want to be. I'm very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   And well he should be.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was 1 under and in control of his tempo and game when he
badly hooked his tee shot at the eighth, his ball landing in the
woods that separate the eighth and second fairways. ``The blunder
came on the tee shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the pine cones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to try and hit a 6-iron between two trees,'' Woods said,
``but I had some pine cones right against my ball which I couldn't
move. I tried to play it through the trees but I just caught one
tree and the ball flew into the flowers (actually a bush) between
No. 8 and No. 2. I had to take an unplayable lie and I had to take
it back to the (previous) spot. But this time there were no pine
cones.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods finally got out of the woods, but then flew the green and
could not get up and down. He had his snowman, that triple bogey
Woods had said time and again this week the new-and-consistent
Tiger Woods would avoid at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, when I would be 2 over, I would try and be
aggressive right away,'' Woods said of the defining moment of his
round. ``Now I say to myself, `Be patient. I have a lot of holes
left. I have 64 holes left.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So Woods waited his turn and at Amen Corner he played his wedge
on the 155-yard 12th hole to 8 feet and made birdie. Then, on the
par-5 13th, a 3-wood and 6-iron put him on the green and he
two-putted from 30 feet for birdie. On 14, he carded his third
consecutive birdie, this one from 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   So even though he would give a stroke back on the 17th, when he
flew the green, Woods was happy. Two years ago, he overwhelmed
Augusta National, but that happens perhaps once in a lifetime
because Augusta is too canny and cunning. The patient must outwit
this course; the impatient are devoured.
</P>
<P>
   ``My patience definitely was rewarded,'' said Woods. ``You've
just got to hang in there and stay patient and understand that
you're going to get some mistakes and you're going to have some bad
bounces. Especially here. You're going to hit some good shots that
end up in bad places.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods had hit a bad shot into a bad place and hadn't fallen
to pieces. Seldom has a 72 been so pleasing. Smiles abounded. Woods
just may be on his way.

 &HT;    Long reach increases ends' odds
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Because outside pass rushers are so difficult to find,
NFL personnel directors reach for prospects every year, hoping they
mature into players who can knock down quarterbacks regularly.
</P>
<P>
   For this year's draft, however, their arms had to be extra long.
</P>
<P>
   The talent scouts had to reach all the way to the savannas of
Ghana and the well-manicured lacrosse field in Charlottesville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia end Patrick Kerney, who over the past month has become
the top prospect at the position, originally was recruited as a
lacrosse player. Ebenezer Ekuban of North Carolina, a player with
raw physical skills but little experience, was born in Ghana and
began his Tar Heels career as a tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Both started at end for only two seasons and are examples of the
way the league pursues prospects with ability to rush the passer
from the outside or anchor against the run. It is true this year,
because even the best players at defensive end and tackle come with
deficiencies. ``Probably more than at any other position, you're
betting on the (future), when it comes to defensive linemen,'' San
Diego Chargers general manager Bobby Beathard said. ``It's a
position where people are willing to roll the dice, because demand
is so great and the supply is so thin. Sometimes you hit the
jackpot, and sometimes you shoot snake-eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until Kerney stopped shooting at lacrosse goalies two years
ago did he develop into a solid player. His first two years at
Virginia, Kerney was a nondescript second-line player splitting his
time between the sports. But in 1997-98, he totaled 22 sacks and 31
tackles for losses.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Peach Bowl game, when he took advantage of injured
Georgia tackle Matt Stinchcomb, catapulted him into national
prominence.
</P>
<P>
   His pass-rush skills aside, Kerney still carries plenty of
question marks. At 6 feet 5 5/8, 266, he needs to gain weight, and
he must improve against the run and stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban, an engaging young man whose enthusiasm for the game is
obvious, needs to mature technically. In limited exposure at end,
he had a dozen sacks and 126 tackles. He looks as if he grew up on
a weight machine but still lacks football instincts.
</P>
<P>
   He switched from offense to defense after dropping a sure
touchdown pass against Syracuse in his sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 15 yards behind everyone, and it hit me right in the
hands,'' Ekuban said. ``A week later, the coaches asked if I might
consider going to defense. From the tone in their voices, I knew I
didn't really have a choice.''

 &HT;    Disaster in the woods
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ The tee shot on No. 8 hooked left, and Tiger
Woods jerked his head in disgust. Only he didn't really know how
bad his drive was until he got to his ball, which rested under a
tree and was nestled between two pine cones. Not good.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the line to the fairway was thin between trees. Really
not good. Daring shot-maker that he is, Woods used a 4-foot-wide
stance and tried to blast through the cones and trees. Instead, the
ball hit a tree and bounded about 10 feet behind him and into a
gathering of azaleas between the eighth and second holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unusual situation,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. He could not strike the ball from the flowers, so he
took a one-shot penalty, returned to the cite of the original
second shot and dropped. ``This time there were no pine cones,''
Woods noted.
</P>
<P>
   And so, lying three on the par 5, he blasted out across the
fairway. ``Probably one of the best shots I hit all day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods ended up three-putting and getting a triple-bogey 8,
leaving him at 2 over and sending him to a front-nine 38. ``At
worst, I should have made a double bogey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He could have lost it right there, been so frustrated over a
good round gone bad that he could not recover. But this wiser
version of Tiger Woods instead called on self-control.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, when I'm 2 over I would try to be aggressive
right away,'' Woods said. ``Now, I say to myself, `Be patient. I
have a lot of holes left.' I'm trying to be more patient now.''
</P>
<P>
   He benefitted from said patience. He parred the first two holes
on the back nine and birdied 12, 13 and 14 en route to a closing
34. He finished at even-par 72, still in the mix _ a major
accomplishment considering the disaster on No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooting even par in a major is always a good way to start,''
he said. ``You have to keep hanging in there and grind it out.
Unfortunately, I hit a couple of loose shots.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited an 2-iron mistake off the tee on No. 2 and a 3 iron
over the green.
</P>
<P>
   After getting to 1 under, Woods pulled a tee shot on 17 into the
left rough. It cost him a shot as he made his only bogey of the
back nine. When he parred the final hole, he accepted the round of
72. Had he scored the birdie expected on No. 8, Woods would be tied
for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   But he knew he had gutted out a day when he did not have his
best stuff and remained within striking distance of the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It was similar to his first round in '97, when he followed a
front-nine 40 with a closing-nine 30. He went on to win that year
with a record 18 under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just made a couple of mistakes,'' he said. ``I'm playing
really well and just trying to stay patient. I have 64 holes left.

 &HT;    This week, players' families are treated like family
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ While Stewart Cink tries to figure out the right
club to hit in the swirling winds on Augusta National's 12th hole,
and just how to slink a putt down one of the wickedly sloping
greens, the really tough decisions in his household this week
belong to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   She decides who gets the Masters badges and she wasn't happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got these eight golden passes,'' she said. ``I don't like
being the one who decides who gets to go. It's hard when friends
want to come, and even family. And we have to pay for the tickets
on top of that, which I don't understand because if it wasn't for
the players, the tournament wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the voice of stress behind this week's clubhouse badge.
Golf's first major places huge pressure on the 96 players here, and
it quickly seeps to their families. This week is like no other they
face all year.
</P>
<P>
   Pros' families usually stay in hotels; here, they rent houses.
Normally, they entertain a few friends and family; here, they are
besieged with well-wishers and long-lost acquaintances. Most weeks,
they leave their kids in the PGA Tour's nursery; here, they must
get used to new care-givers hired by the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   For the families, the Masters is a big green fishbowl. They know
exactly what's at stake, and the anxiety grows as they inch to the
course, like everyone else stuck in Washington Road traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do something good here, it follows you the rest of your
life,'' said Cink, who drove over from Smyrna with her two boys,
ages 5 and 2. ``Usually, I'll just catch Stewart on the back nine,
but here I want to watch every shot. I'll probably be more nervous
than usual, especially if he's doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kathy Perry, the tension started building months ago, when
husband Chris began seeking advice on the course from everyone from
fellow Ohioan Jack Nicklaus to former champ Fuzzy Zoeller. It
increased when she pulled her son out of kindergarten for a week;
she doesn't do that for just any event.
</P>
<P>
   Then Perry arrived on Magnolia Drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of awestruck when we drove in the entrance and saw
all this history,'' she said. ``Because this is so historical, I
don't even know what words to use. There's just a mystique or aura.
I don't know if I could lay my finger on it.''
</P>
<P>
   That atmosphere is exactly what the club's members try to create
for players' families. She and Chris attended a reception for
Masters rookies this week at the Eisenhower Cabin, where the
tournament's special treatment of its players was made even
clearer: If the familes needed anything, the Augusta National
members would take care of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that extra little touch,'' Kathy Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Debbye Watts, meanwhile, is still getting accustomed to the
absence of Jumbo Ozaki posters all over the place. Her husband,
Brian, has played in Japan for six years; this is his first season
in America, and it's a lot easier ordering food in Augusta than in
Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Jenna Elfman lookalike had to find her way around,
and didn't know where the ninth green was when she arrived with son
Jason, almost 2. He darted under a gallery rope and she scrambled
to pull him back as he let out a scream.
</P>
<P>
   That's not something Watts tolerates at any tournament, and she
planned to take him to the new day care. The new arrangement didn't
worry her, as it did other Tour wives. ``I can't imagine anything
at the Masters not being nice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing better for the families than coming here once is
getting the chance to return each year, and that's what Gary
Player's wife, Vivienne, has done for 41 years. This year she broke
that streak because her daughter just gave birth to the couple's
10th grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes right down to it, her son Wayne said, ``Nothing's
more important than family.'' Not even the Masters.

 Column: What's All the Fuss About Internet Sites That Give
Away  Stocks? 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Is there anything fundamentally wrong with fledgling Internet sites
that offer shares of their companies to people who sign up on their
Web sites?
</P>
<P>
   Not really. There doesn't appear to be any tangible downside for
consumers who hold the shares, except that they may never be worth
the paper on which they're printed.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the response to earlier Street Smarts columns on
Internet stock giveaways, some readers are asking: ``Why all the
fuss, if the shares are essentially for free?'' The trouble,
according to critics and federal regulators, is that the practice
smacks of excessive promotion.
</P>
<P>
   And in the once starched-shirt world of investing, promotion is
a dirty word. What's more, with the proliferation of Internet chat
rooms, where sources of information are quite anonymous, the
age-old practice of stock hyping seems to have migrated from the
telephone-filled ``boiler rooms'' of old to today's virtual chat
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Internet firms that offer stock to site
users are engaging in such activities.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that the SEC wants to make sure that the Net's
worldwide reach at warp speed doesn't breed new problems.
</P>
<P>
   Most Web site stock distributions are usually
``micro-offerings''_ small batches of shares with low valuations _
which most investment pros are leery of in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Such little-known stocks used to rely on word of mouth and tiny
brokerages for marketing. But now the Internet has filled that
void, meaning that micro-cap stock propaganda can reach more people
faster than ever before. And that presents a fertile environment
for fraud and deception.
</P>
<P>
   As mentioned in previous columns, the SEC is clamping down on
Web sites that have not told the SEC that they are issuing stock.
Seems sensible to me. All companies, whether they are widget-makers
or Web sites, need to abide by fundamental securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   And one fundamental tenet of a stock offering is telling the
truth. A glaring problem with the Exit23b Web site, which was
featured in an earlier column, was that one of its e-mails
promoting a stock giveaway made false claims. It stated that Yahoo
once gave away free stock, which is nothing but a bald-faced lie.
That's the kind of stuff that the SEC is trying to snuff out.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Exit23b, which apparently is based in Washington
state, has a Web site under construction that indicates the company
plans to be an electronic commerce operation selling home
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Also, speaking of stock giveaways, some readers have asked about
Ecompare, a comparative shopping Web site, which was offering free
shares. Judging by the message on its Web site, it seems likely
that Ecompare is in the process of trying to meet regulatory
requirements for issuing stock.
</P>
<P>
   `` E-Compare's free stock distribution has been voluntarily
suspended pending clarification of SEC _ Security Exchange
Commission (sic) _ rules on the matter,'' states a posting on its
site. Perhaps a good place to start in making amends with
regulators would be to get the name of the agency right.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WE'RE NO. 14: &LR;  If NationsBanc Montgomery Securities hopes to
crack the top five bulge-bracket (full-service) investment banks in
the not-so-distant future, which it says it wants to do, the bank
has a tough row to hoe.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco investment banking unit of BankAmerica of
Charlotte, N.C., apparently still needs to improve its status among
its peer group.
</P>
<P>
   Because if you look at the list of 13 underwriters selected by
Goldman Sachs to manage its initial public offering, Montgomery
Securities isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Published by TheStreet.com, the list consists of almost every
major investment house on Wall Street _ including Goldman, which is
acting as its own lead manager. Topping the list are Donaldson
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   As an underwriter, these investment banks will have allotments
of Goldman shares to sell to their best customers during the
initial offering, which is slated for the first week of May.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman plans to sell 69 million shares at about $50 per share,
which would raise about $3.45 billion in what likely will be the
largest IPO of the year. At that price per share, Goldman would be
valued at about $23.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Montgomery wasn't the only Bay Area investment bank
not invited to Goldman's coming-out party. All other regional
banks, such as BancBoston Robertson Stephens and Hambrecht and
Quist, were also left off the list.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TAKING CREDIT: &LR;  During Vice President Al Gore's recent
presidential fund-raising swing through Silicon Valley, he made the
usual boilerplate speech at the tony Woodside residence of Janina
Pawloski, founder of E-Loan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore rifled through his well-rehearsed list of talking points,
such as the Clinton-Gore administration's commitment to education
reform, its righteous decision to send troops to Kosovo, and its
recognition of California and technology as a cog in the nation's
fine-tuned economic engine. As expected, each line received its
fair share of polite applause from the sea of dot-com name tags.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until Gore pointed out that the Dow Jones
industrial average soared from 3,000 to 10,000 during the
Clinton-Gore reign that the options-laden crowd began to cheer in
earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market's performance definitely received the biggest
applause of the night,'' noted one fund-raiser attendee.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the administration's original agenda of gay rights,
health care and jobs for the poor.

GRIM AND GRUESOME TIMES FOR FALDO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ When it was finally done, this grim, gruesome and
horrible round, Nick Faldo emerged from the scorer's tent behind
the 18th green and spotted 15 or so of the media, all but one
English.
</P>
<P>
   No inquisitors this day.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes were averted, as mourners avert their eyes. Voices were
soft, as mourners soften their voices. The tone was sympathetic, as
mourners try so hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   A mere three years ago, Nick Faldo charged past Greg Norman on
the final round here at Augusta National and won his third Masters.
Nick Faldo was atop the golf world. Now, Nick Faldo's golf game is
dead as he has slid down that horrible golf abyss that Australian
Ian Baker-Finch and Britain's Sandy Lyle had slid down in the last
decade, landing at true bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Achh,'' Faldo began in disgust, after one of the mourners had
mumbled something soft to him, hopefully to get the words started.
``I had two bad drives (on) one and two ... then I hit three iron
shots off-line ... for 80.''
</P>
<P>
   That was it. The coroner's self-cause of this latest golf death.
Strange and sporadic explanation, two bad drives to start, three
bad irons somewhere in the middle and then that horrible final
number, ``80.''
</P>
<P>
   The mourners understood. Words didn't have to be spoken. Any
human with two eyes could see that Nick Faldo's golf game had
deconstructed, that Nick Faldo's golf game is in pieces -- little
pieces, at that -- and that this golfer is at rock bottom. Atop the
world three years ago, 167th in the world now ... and still
falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every iron shot was right at it or right over it,''
Faldo went on, his mind seaching for even a jot of confidence.
``You know .. I couldn't ... I just couldn't get up and down when I
needed to or when I had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bits and pieces of thought, just as his game is in those tiny
bits and pieces now. On the course, Faldo is the living, breathing
and, really, terrifying example of an athlete who lets his mind
think too much. There is no confidence. His mind races. There can
be no confidence. His mind races from one magic solution to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   There is none.
</P>
<P>
   On the 17th fairway, Faldo stared at his approach shot some 145
yards from the green for the longest of times. Finally he stepped
to the ball. Finally he swung that horrible piece of metal in his
hand. The ball flew the green. Right over the stick, true, but also
right over the green.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo didn't move toward the green. Instead, he remained in
place, deconstructing his golf swing once again, for maybe the
millionth time. Faldo would take his practice swing back a fifth of
the way ... and stop ... and study exactly where his hands and
shoulders were. Then he would take his next practice swing back a
bit further, perhaps halfway back, and stop ... and study. Then he
would take his swing back to the top ... and stop ... and study
this newest angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like ... it keeps hitting me,'' Faldo would say later, in
another of those pieces of thought, when the mourners had gathered
around. He had run his hands through his hair just as he had said
those words, maybe the third or fourth time he had run his hands
through his hair. He is at wit's end when it comes to golf.
Clearly.
</P>
<P>
   A girlfriend was waiting nearby, a new blonde girlfriend. The
story was that his last blonde girlfriend, Brenna Cepelik, had
taken a 9-iron to Faldo's Porsche last summer or a 5-iron to
another car as Faldo dismissed her.
</P>
<P>
   She had been a coed at the University of Arizona when they found
each other early in 1995, and the affair was so well-disguised that
it took the British tabloids 8 months before their telescopic
lenses were prying into classrooms in Arizona. When Faldo had won
the Masters in 1996, he had hugged Brenna. Publicly. His wife was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   David Leadbetter, Faldo's golf guru, also was gone as of last
summer, about the same time as Brenna. Leadbetter and Faldo had
spent endless moments and months and years together, Leadbetter
deconstructing every piece of Faldo's swing, much like a golfing
Walt Hriniak, and for years it had been good. But, in the last two
years, it had been horrible. So the one guru was replaced by a new
guru.
</P>
<P>
   No difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were only three shots that happened to miss the green
... you know, off-target,'' Faldo went on, yearning to find some
good in the bad. Faldo then was asked to go through a few shots,
and he tried, and when one of the mourners tried one last bit of
empathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a good finish coming in? (birdie-par-par).''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``How close were you on 16?'' Faldo had tapped in his only
birdie on the 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What club did you use on 16?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven-iron.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Faldo has missed the cut at Doral, missed the
cut at the Honda Classic, been disqualified at the TPC (when he
failed to identify his ball that became lodged in a tree before
dropping a new ball), tied for 33rd at one event and then tied for
55th last week in the BellSouth Classic in Atlanta. In his
lifetime, Faldo has earned $4,553,613 on the golf courses of the
world; this year the total is $30,650.
</P>
<P>
   Five hours earlier, another once-broken man, broken by life and
alcohol and not golf, had stood in the same spot as Nick Faldo had
stood. John Daly had been ready to implode when he hit his approach
shot into the creek in front of 13, but he had stepped into the
water and splashed the ball onto the green and rescued a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that if you shot a 72 here, you were
discouraged,'' said a now-sober Daly. ``The year that Faldo won, I
was 4-under going down 18 (on the first day) and I doubled to start
the (tournament) 2-under. But the fans are great here. They are
behind me, most of them. It's really special.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a light in John Daly's eyes as he spoke his hopeful
final public words of his day. There was no light in Nick Faldo's
eyes as he said his last words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to take a look at the takeaway,'' Faldo began
another sporadic string of throughts. ``A few little bits ... you
know ... it's the same old story ... close but not close enough ...
come back tomorrow, I guess. Al right?''
</P>
<P>
   The golfing corpse turned on his heel. The mourners filed away.
Sadly.

 Living-Wage Laws Spread Across U.S.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The road to a higher U.S. minimum wage could lead through San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And through San Jose, Hayward, Los Angeles, Detroit, Baltimore
and even Duluth, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco may soon be the latest of about two dozen U.S.
cities to pass ``Living Wage'' laws, which typically require firms
doing business with local government to pay higher-than-minimum
wages.
</P>
<P>
   These laws _ including San Francisco's proposal _ tend to be
limited in scope and apply only to a relatively small number of
workers.
</P>
<P>
   But they're part of a large, growing campaign that could end up
sparking a national debate about economic inequality and raising
the U.S. minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   It's a campaign in which _ for a change _ organized labor and
its liberal allies are outsmarting and outmaneuvering their
business opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a model case of changing social policy through an issue
with widespread appeal: After all, who would say they're for a wage
that you  &LR; can't  &LR; live on?'' said Harley Shaiken, a UC Berkeley
professor who studies the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor has been very focused and very effective in these
campaigns, while much of business hasn't been real focused,''
Shaiken added. ``This campaign has been a marked success for labor,
while business has just been reacting.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco city officials are analyzing a living-wage
proposal that would require firms with city contracts to pay hourly
wages of $14.50, or $13 if the company provides health benefits.
The Board of Supervisors could vote on the proposal or a modified
version of it as early as May or June.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the law is a matter of simple fairness. They note
that it takes far more than the state minimum wage of $5.75 to
survive in a high-cost region like the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who works full time in a city-supported job should
receive enough money to support their family and make it through
the month without turning to charity,'' said Ken Jacobs, a
spokesman for San Francisco's Coalition for a Living Wage.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents _ including many small firms with city contracts _ say
hiking wages as high as $14 could drive them out of business or
force them to lay people off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If wages are raised to $14, a small number of people will get
that $14, but it will also expand the welfare rolls since companies
won't pay that much money for unskilled people,'' said John Doyle,
spokesman for the libertarian Employment Policies Institute in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the living-wage movement has mushroomed during the
past year. Within the Bay Area, the cities of Oakland, San Jose and
Hayward all passed laws within the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   But the movement first started in Baltimore in 1994. Religious
groups there noticed that more and more of the people showing up at
their soup kitchens were actually working full time, at wages too
low to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The religious leaders formed an alliance with labor unions and
community activists that became a model for other cities where
living wage laws have passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks of this segment as grouped together, but
really, they hadn't worked together before the living-wage
movement,'' said Jen Kern, director of the living-wage resource
center at ACORN, a nationwide community group that is very involved
in promoting living-wage laws.
</P>
<P>
   What led labor and anti-poverty activists to embark on a series
of local wage campaigns?
</P>
<P>
   One big reason is that unions and their allies had been stymied
at trying to win significant hikes in the federal minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite increases in 1996 and 1997, today's U.S. minimum wage of
$5.15 has 20 percent less buying power than it did two decades ago.
(If the 1979 minimum wage of $2.90 had kept up with inflation, it
would today amount to $6.92.)
</P>
<P>
   Living-wage advocates figured they might have more success
working locally than contending with the Republican majority in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, opposition to living-wage laws has been relatively
weak on the local level.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because local business communities are divided on
the issue: Companies with city contracts see living-wage laws as a
serious pocketbook issue but those without city contracts haven't
seen much reason to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most businesspeople in San Francisco, San Jose or Boston can
say, `I have no dealings with the city. It's not my problem,'''
said Doyle. ``There really has been no concerted (business) effort
to oppose it, although people are now starting to wake up to the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle's organization _ which is funded largely by employers _
fears that the spread of local living-wage laws will provide
ammunition for a campaign to raise state and federal minimum wage
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take Wisconsin, where the city of Madison recently passed a
living-wage law for various groups of workers,'' Doyle said. ``Now
the Wisconsin state Senate president has written an op-ed piece
saying that a minimum wage of $7.25 should apply to all workers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The phrase is seeping into the political vernacular and
changing the dynamics of political discussion,'' Doyle added.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of living-wage laws acknowledge their goals stretch
far beyond the local ordinances they're busy promoting.
</P>
<P>
   They hope that, as the 2000 election season approaches, they can
pressure Congress into passing another, larger minimum wage
increase.
</P>
<P>
   And they hope to put issues of economic inequality at the center
of the country's political debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``These living-wage ordinances tend to be very narrow and affect
just a tiny pocket of poor working families,'' said Robert Pollin,
a University of Massachusetts economist and author of the 1998 book
``The Living Wage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to start somewhere,'' Pollin continued. ``And the
movement has given voice to people's sense that if someone is going
to go to work, they should at least earn a living wage. Just the
term `living wage' is part of the policy culture now, in a way it
wasn't a year or two ago. ... The debate in Congress is now being
driven by these local living-wage ordinances.''

 When Physical Stature Makes It Hard to Find a Job
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I'm a 26-year-old man who has had some unfortunate
problems in dealing with employers due to my stature. I have what
doctors refer to as infant-adult condition. At 3 feet and 55
pounds, I have the bone mass and muscle tissue of a small child.
I'm having trouble finding work with a real estate brokerage in my
town. One broker said she could not hire me because I would be
viewed by potential buyers as ``a small infant'' (her words) and
would not be able to gain the respect necessary to represent the
company. How can I find a brokerage that will see me as more than
just a little person?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  That broker who said you won't be able to gain
clients' respect is simply ignorant. If you do good work, clients
will quickly focus on the homes or offices you're showing them
rather than your height. In fact, you may even be able to turn your
unusual appearance into a marketing advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Van Etten, a Florida legal writer and lawyer who is of
very short stature, initially was advised by law firms to seek
behind-the-scenes work in a government office because clients might
not have confidence in her abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't have been more wrong,'' said Van Etten, who
persevered and became a successful trial lawyer. ``New clients
would come into the office who couldn't remember my name, but who
remembered seeing me in court. They'd say, `Is this the office
where the little lady works?'''
</P>
<P>
   That broker's comments to you pretty clearly violated the
Americans With Disabilities Act. So one of your options is to find
an experienced civil rights lawyer and file a discrimination
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   But frankly, if your main goal is launching a real estate
career, I'd avoid getting into a legal battle right now. Instead,
focus on your job search.
</P>
<P>
   Start by networking with people who you know are supportive of
disability rights. Your town might have a chapter of Little People
of America: Check their Web site at  &LR; www.lpaonline.org. &LR;  Or it may
have a Center for Independent Living or other disability-rights
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Ask members of those organizations for names of real estate
brokers they've used. Their first impression of you will be as a
``friend of a client'' rather than as some oddity.
</P>
<P>
   Also, do some conventional networking through your local chamber
of commerce or Board of Realtors. Show the people you meet that you
are professional, reliable and sharp _ a great potential employee,
regardless of your height.
</P>
<P>
   If a prospective employer still has doubts, you can offer to
prove yourself. ``I would think it's pretty low-risk for the
brokerage since they pay on a commission basis,'' said Van Etten,
who chairs the access committee of Little People of America. ``He
could say something like, `Let me work out of your firm's office
for three months. If I don't sell anything, then I'll move on. ...'
He has to show he has the personality for sales _ that he's
positive and not easily rebuffed.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding Startup Jobs
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you direct me to some good sources for jobs with startups
or companies that have recently gone public? Are there recruiters
who specialize in startups? I work in the area of corporate
facilities/ real estate. The work I perform probably wouldn't be
needed by very recent startups, but might be helpful to those that
are starting to expand.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: There definitely are recruiters who focus on startups.
But there's no easy way to find all of them: Most directories tend
to list recruiters by their geographic area or industry, not by the
size of their client firms.
</P>
<P>
   You might thumb through a resource like the Directory of
Executive Recruiters (Kennedy Publications) and contact recruiters
for industries like biotech or software, which tend to have a large
number of emerging companies.
</P>
<P>
   Roger King runs a Sausalito recruiting firm called TechSearch
that does a lot of work for startups. He suggests some other
job-search tactics: Check newspapers like The Chronicle that run a
regular listing of local firms that have gone public. And seek out
organizations or events that draw people from the startup world.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Silicon Valley Association of Software
Entrepreneurs is chock-full of startup executives. And the Marin
Technology Venture Forum, to be held May 6, will draw both startup
entrepreneurs and venture funders. (See  &LR; www.marinventure.com &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   Last but certainly not least, there's the Internet. Betsy
Collard of the Career Action Center in Cupertino suggests that you
check out a site called  &LR; www.venturerex.com,  &LR; which lists more than
7,000 jobs at 800 startups across the country. Upside magazine also
offers startup job listings at  &LR; www.upside.com.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Want more ideas for researching jobs at startups? Check with the
Career Action Center at (408) 253-3200.
</P>
<P>
   Murky Bonus System
</P>
<P>
   Q: Part of our pay is based on a bonus system. The bonus is
calculated at the end of each month based on performance during
that month, but the money isn't distributed until the end of the
quarter. Recently, the company adopted a new policy saying that in
order to receive a bonus, employees must be working for the company
at the time the money is distributed. This means deserving people
lose their bonuses if they quit before the end of the quarter. Is
this legal?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: It sounds not only legal, but pretty common.
</P>
<P>
   Labor law treats bonuses differently from regular wages. Your
company can't refuse to pay wages for time you've worked if you
happen to quit before the end of a pay period. But it  &LR; can &LR;  make
bonuses conditional on folks remaining employed through a certain
date _ in your case, the end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor code is focused principally on wages and doesn't
give the same protection to bonuses,'' said Alan Exelrod, a San
Francisco attorney who represents employees with Rudy, Exelrod,
Zieff &AMP; True.
</P>
<P>
   Consider yourself lucky in one respect: At least your bonuses
are paid out each quarter. Many companies don't hand out bonuses
until the end of the year. Their employees may work for nine or 10
months, meet all their performance goals and yet be denied a bonus
because they quit before year's end.
</P>
<P>

Send your work and career questions to Ilana DeBare, Workways, San
Francisco Chronicle, 901 Mission St., San Francisco 94103. Or send
e-mail to workways(at sign)sfgate.com. &LR;   &LR; Or call (415) 764-2815. We

we can. &LR;

AIDS AGENCY LAYS OFF 19 WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a sign of the nation's battle fatigue in the fight
against AIDS, the largest AIDS agency in Massachusetts laid off 19
workers Thursday, nearly one-fifth its staff, in an effort to make
up a nearly $1 million shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   The first major layoff in the 16-year history of the AIDS Action
Committee of Massachusetts comes largely in response to a steep
dropoff in money from the annual AIDS Walk, its primary
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS Action's fund-raising crisis reflects a nationwide trend
affecting organizations from New York to Seattle, as the public has
come to think the epidemic is less urgent because of new drugs and
the drop in deaths, say AIDS advocates.
</P>
<P>
   However, the urgency is even greater as more people with AIDS
live longer and require more services, and as the rate of new
infections continues unabated, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very bittersweet time here,'' said Larry Kessler,
executive director of the Boston-based agency, in an interview.
``Here we are at this point now, we've got some better drugs and
some really good news. At the same time, we know it doesn't equal
cure. We're worried about prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the agency said the staff downsizing would be
accompanied by a shift in focus toward more intensive HIV
prevention and health-promotion programs, to more effectively stop
the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of AIDS Action clients who die each year has
dropped from more than 300 in the mid-1990s to fewer than 100 last
year, the number of registered clients receiving services has
jumped from about 1,300 to more than 2,000 in the same time frame,
according to the organization's figures.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, 242 people died from AIDS in 1997, down from 609 in
1996, according to the latest mortality figures. About 25,000 to
30,000 Massachusetts residents are estimated to be infected with
HIV, said Jean Maguire, director of the state's AIDS bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, while the number of people who died from AIDS
dropped 47 percent in 1997, about 40,000 Americans a year continue
to become infected with the virus that causes the incurable
disease, according to US figures.
</P>
<P>
   That estimated infection rate has ``been unchanged for the past
few years,'' with minorities, women, and young people making up a
growing share of those now being affected, said Daniel Zingale,
executive director of a Washington-based national network of AIDS
agencies. Based on the current demographics of infection, Zingale
said, ``Every hour, two Americans under the age of 25 are becoming
newly infected with HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   All day Thursday at the AIDS Action offices on Clarendon Street,
department heads met with each of more than 100 staffers, letting
them know whether they were being laid off, staying or having their
duties changed, Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everybody has been crying at every level, from the top
down. It's very sad,'' Kessler said. ``It gets triggered by a
look.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19 being laid off effective April 22 have been with the
agency from one year to 10 years, and did such jobs as secretary,
bookkeeper, and case manager. They will each get six weeks' salary
as severance, three months' health coverage, plus any accumulated
vacation time, Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, two of the more than half-dozen who had been
told they were being laid off by then said they would come back as
volunteers, Kessler said. ``I cannot describe for you why they're
such special people. They're real givers.''
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS Walk, which began 13 years ago, raised more than $3
million at its peak, in 1993, but its gross revenues have
consistently dropped since then _ most sharply after 1996, the year
that the drugs known as protease inhibitors made headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, AIDS Action had hoped to raise $2.6 million from the
walk, but grossed only slightly more than $2 million. This year,
with more pessimistic expectations, the agency plans on only $2
million from the June 6 walk, but would love to raise $2.4 million
or $2.5 million, Kessler said. The AIDS Walk has been the single
biggest private source of funding for the $10 million a year
agency.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, AIDS Action and many other AIDS agencies have
seen other private donor sources shrinking, with corporate mergers
and competition from other good causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of `donor fatigue' out there,'' said Anne Marie
Silvia, executive director of the Boston AIDS Consortium, a private
non-profit organization that focuses on AIDS planning, policy and
advocacy in the greater Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   But state and city public health officials and other AIDS
advocates applauded AIDS Action's attempts to do more with less by
creating new programs to intensify its efforts to prevent HIV and
keep people who are already infected as healthy as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The new AIDS Action programs are a neighborhood mobilization
project to prevent HIV; case management of infected clients to
reduce transmission of the virus; and promotion of health among
HIV-infected people.
</P>
<P>
   With the ``breathing room'' that the new drugs now provide, and
with the new programs focused on prevention, ``We're turning our
guns on those areas that are fueling the epidemic,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are closing in on 20 years, and it's still here in
more ways than one. The epidemic says it's not going away.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ask Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the early
favorite for the Republican presidential nomination, about the
prickliest issues of the day, and his carefully wrapped responses
are those of the ultimate Rorschach politician: voters can see what
they want to see.
</P>
<P>
   In comments that should please gay rights advocates, Bush argued
that no one should be disqualified from an ambassadorship or other
presidential appointment because he or she is a homosexual. But he
also appealed to opponents of gay rights, saying that homosexuals
should not be foster parents, and that there should not be a
specific reference to them in hate crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He also takes a play-to-both-sides position on abortion. Unlike
some of his rivals, Bush refused to say whether he would insist on
a running mate who opposed abortion. ``It's too early to
determine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he described himself as ``pro life,'' Bush appealed to
voters who are less adamantly opposed to abortion by saying the
country was not ready to embrace a constitutional amendment banning
all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Bush preferred not to wade into the most nettlesome
issue of the day, the crisis in Yugoslavia. He refused to say
whether President Clinton's policies had been sound. Again and
again, he stuck to the same line, ``He'd better have a clear exit
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   But stung by criticism, including an editorial in the reliably
conservative Wall Street Journal that attacked his statements as
``so vague and tepid as to be almost Clintonian,'' Bush has
expanded on his views a bit. At a news conference in Austin on
Thursday, he suggested he could be open to ground troops, saying,
``I worry about whether or not the bombing campaign is being done
with ferocity.'' He said it ``should be a military decision as to
whether or not troops are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   In a striking contrast to his opponents who are scurrying across
the country trying to gain traction by articulating their stands,
Bush is staying put in the Texas Capitol, sitting on his
overwhelming lead in the polls, and saying as little as possible.
</P>
<P>
   When he does address issues, as he did in an interview here last
week, Bush skates between the left and the right, carefully
calibrating his answers to avoid offending anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reticence may make political sense: given his dominance
in the race, the governor would risk alienating supporters if he
began taking hard positions. With several opponents ready to pounce
on Bush, whom they view as their biggest obstacle to the
nomination, the last thing Bush wants is to give them more
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The danger in Bush's strategy is that his detractors have begun
to portray him as not prepared to run for national office. On
abortion, for instance, he has been attacked for his comments both
by liberal groups on the left and by conservative candidates on the
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strategy of rational ambiguity,'' said David C. King, a
professor of public policy at Harvard University. ``You try and
hide your true positions to increase the number of people who will
identify with you. He's doing it early in the campaign to increase
the amount of money he gets.''
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign progresses, King said, Bush will need to appeal
to conservative primary voters by ``moving slightly to the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting with his feet perched on his desk at the Capitol here,
Bush said he was resigned to the assaults. ``I guess it's what
happens when you're the front runner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bristling at the notion that he is an empty vessel, the governor
said: ``I state what I believe. I've got a record. I've actually
served in office. And I've signed or vetoed bills. I did a lot of
speeches. And some people will like it and some people won't.''
</P>
<P>
   There were issues he had to figure out for himself, Bush said,
insisting that he was not hiding but waiting until June, after the
Texas Legislature adjourns, to begin campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly not underestimating the task,'' he said. ``It's
going to be a lot of work, not only physically, but I haven't the
federal issues like a lot of the other candidates have. I'm coming
from the outside. So I've got a lot of work to do.''

</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments on homosexuals offer a prime example of how he
is trying to be acceptable to the broad Republican electorate. The
drive to block Clinton's nomination of James C. Hormel, a
philanthropist, as ambassador to Luxembourg, has been a cause
celebre among conservatives, many of whom cited Hormel's
homosexuality. Bush would not comment on Hormel specifically,
saying, ``I don't know the background.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether an ambassador should be disqualified on
the basis of sexual orientation, Bush said, ``As a general
statement, if someone can do a job, and a job that he's qualified
for, that person, that person ought to be allowed to do his job.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he would not exclude homosexuals from other
posts, ``as long as they can do a good job, as long as their
political agenda was the same as mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many homosexuals may be put off by Bush's positions on
hate crime legislation and gay foster parents. ``I look at each
person based upon their heart and soul,'' he said. ``I think it's
much different than gay adoption. I strongly believe that what's
best for children is a married man or a married woman as their
parents. That has nothing to do with whether or not I don't respect
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Francis, a gay Republican consultant who is an old
friend of the governor, said Bush's comments on appointments should
make him acceptable to homosexuals because they present ``a
balanced picture'' and show that ``there's not an intolerant bone
in the man's body.''
</P>
<P>
   Another example of Bush's skirting ideological perils is his
refusal to say whether he would insist on an abortion foe as a
running mate. By withholding a position, he can stave off
defections from abortion opponents while still leaving the
impression among abortion rights advocates that he might pick one
of their own as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing groups on both sides of the abortion issue who have
faulted his position, Bush said: ``Abortion's a very emotional
issue. People have got strong feelings about it. So I'm not
surprised people are attacking me on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond to conservatives like Gary Bauer, a rival for
the nomination who questions Bush's commitment to oppose abortion,
he said, ``Those of us who run for office are used to political
hyperbole.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said there was ``something wrong if people with
diametrically opposing viewpoints on an issue meet with a
presidential candidate'' and both groups come out ``believing that
the candidate is on their side.''
</P>
<P>
   On a variety of other issues, Bush ambles down the middle of the
road. He opposes racial quotas, for example, but supports other
efforts to open doors for minorities. He calls his approach
``affirmative access.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bush has advocated voluntary school prayer before high
school football games. Yet he is careful to say that the choice
should be left to the students. ``Why do I think prayer is
important?'' he asked. ``I believe there's an almighty loving God,
and I think if students so choose to do so, it's an important
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he recently had ``a very frank discussion'' with Pat
Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition, as part of his
concerted effort to woo all factions of his party. Bush said he
talked about ``my heart, what my beliefs are.''
</P>
<P>
   How important would he consider Robertson's endorsement? ``I
want everybody to support me,'' Bush said.

A SURVIVOR OF AUSCHWITZ REFLECTS ON THE KOSOVO CRISIS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Aca Singer, who lost 65 members of his
family in the Holocaust, says he didn't survive Auschwitz to die
from an American bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Americans bombed the death camps at the end of World
War II, I was very happy,'' he said, sitting in the library of the
Federation of Jewish Communities of Yugoslavia, which he heads.
``Then I thought, `Kill me if necessary, but kill the Nazis.' And a
lot of Jews died at the end from U.S. bombers, and we were not
unhappy to see the bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, he said, as NATO bombs and missiles smash civilian
and official buildings in downtown Belgrade, ``we do not have this
feeling _ quite the reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans say President Slobodan Milosevic ``is using
disproportionate force to repress the Kosovo Liberation Army, and
that is true,'' he said. ``But now the Americans are being
disproportionate in their actions, in this criminal use of force,
which is indiscriminate. And this kind of abuse of power will come
back to the United States like a boomerang. They are killing
political pluralism here, and thus doing a great favor to this
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer, now 76, with a full head of white hair, says he had to
move from his comfortable apartment on Sarajevo Street, just behind
the bombed-out Interior Ministry, because he knew it would be a
NATO target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty angry because I've been moved to a little room and
sleep in a cot with my wife,'' he said genially. ``But if I didn't
get killed in Auschwitz, I don't want to provide this pleasure to
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer, a retired banker and amateur historian, is one of the
leaders of Yugoslavia's 3,500 Jews, some 2,000 of whom live in
Belgrade. Even these figures include those whose mothers are not
Jewish, so long as they regard themselves as Jews, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first known reference to Jews living in Belgrade dates to
1337, he said. In 1941, 82,240 Jews lived in the Kingdom of
Yugoslavia, Singer has written, but only 15,000 survived World War
II. Many of those emigrated to Israel or assimilated in Communist
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under the pressure of the bombs, he says, Jews are again
leaving Yugoslavia for shelter abroad. With help from Hungarians
and Americans, 250 Jews, mostly women with children, have already
gone to Hungary on buses, and another 80 are preparing to go. Most
are from Belgrade, Nis and Novi Sad; some, Singer says with sad
understanding, will go to relatives in Israel and elsewhere and
never return.
</P>
<P>
   He is reluctant to draw attention to this small flow of Jewish
refugees because it might seem somehow disloyal, and he stresses
that no Jewish male between 18 and 60 and subject to mobilization
will violate the wartime ban on travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Serb has a relative in the countryside where his family
can stay,'' Singer said. ``But the Jews here are a city people. We
have no such places to send our children. Our families are in
Israel or elsewhere in the Diaspora.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the sharp increase in Serbian nationalism and
anti-Americanism because of the bombing, Singer admits that given
his past, he is trying to look hard into the future, as a custodian
for the tiny Jewish community. ``I really do not sense
anti-Semitism in the general population here, as in other
countries,'' he said. Since the war started, there have been a few
slogans scrawled on a synagogue wall, but nothing more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says, he has been accused by some (though not by the
government) of being insufficiently pro-Serb in public statements.
And like many here, he is concerned about the rise of the Radical
Party leader, the ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj, who is a
Serbian deputy prime minister. Seselj has made no anti-Semitic
remarks, Singer said, but considers the French populist Jean-Marie
Le Pen and the operatic Russian Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky as his
friends. Both have made anti-Semitic remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot know what will happen, and precisely because of your
American Jewish politicians who are speaking for the American
government,'' he said. It may seem ridiculous, he admits, but
having strong anti-Serb language coming from Defense Secretary
William Cohen; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; her
spokesman, James P. Rubin, and the national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, has had an impact here. Cohen and Ms. Albright, although
they have Jewish relatives, are not Jewish; but ``here they see the
Jewish name, and they think everything is somehow connected,''
Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   But what most infuriates the gentle Singer, he freely admits, is
the use of the word ``genocide'' by all parties _ the Serbs, the
ethnic Albanians and, he says, the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tendency to manipulate with the Jews,'' he said, to
use the unique experience of the Holocaust as propaganda or
justification for policy misjudgments. What was done in Bosnia,
Croatia or Kosovo, however horrible, he says, is not genocide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't at all agree that this is genocide,'' he said. ``There
was no effort to exterminate an entire race _ men, women and
children _ merely because of their religious or ethnic identity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the Serbs and the Albanians pressure us for sympathy and
comparison,'' he said wryly. ``Both sides, it seems, want to be
Jews. I put myself on neither side.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, by
comparing Serbian attacks in Kosovo to the mass murder of the
Nazis, ``are also manipulating with the Jews,'' he said with
disgust.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, then said softly: ``Sixty-five members of my family
were killed in Auschwitz, and I know all their names, first name
and surname. The youngest was a baby and the oldest, my
grandfather's brother, was 92. Sixty-five people killed because
they were Jewish only. That is genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   He rubbed back his soft white hair and changed glasses again,
looking out the window to say: ``I survived by accident, and no one
should ask why. I would have been number 66. That is genocide. I
give myself the right to think this way.''

JUDGE SAYS RECORD LIBEL CASE SHOULD BE RETRIED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., N.Y., Texas)   (rk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The case that resulted in the largest libel verdict in history
was tainted by the deception of the plaintiffs, a U.S. District
Court judge said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the case, which pitted a Texas brokerage firm
against The Wall Street Journal's parent company, should be
retried.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is the latest twist in a case that won widespread
attention in 1997 when a Texas jury awarded the plaintiffs, MMAR
Group Inc., a record $222.7 million, an amount that exceeded the
total annual earnings of Dow Jones &AMP; Co., The Journal's parent
company, and shocked media companies in its severity.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Ewing Werlein Jr. of the Southern District of Texas,
had already reduced the original award to $22.7 million,
eliminating $200 million in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was on appeal when a former employee of the company
approached Dow Jones lawyers 14 months ago to say that MMAR's top
officials had hidden and destroyed evidence that might have
buttressed the allegations made in the 1993 Journal article that
prompted the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Laura Jereski, the article said that MMAR had gained
its power and reputation by selling mortgage-backed securities, but
described the company's dealings with clients as reckless. A
central point in the article was that MMAR mishandled the
investment portfolio of the Louisiana state pension plan, costing
that client $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   MMAR officials had contended in court that the article, and
resulting lawsuits and investigations, destroyed its business.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the verdict, the former MMAR employee, William
Fincher, contacted one of Dow Jones' lawyers through an
intermediary, who told the lawyer that MMAR executives had hidden
or destroyed internal tape recordings before the trial. Some of
these, Fincher asserted, supported the article's descriptions of
irregular handling of the Louisiana pension account. Dow Jones
attorneys had sought all such evidence during the pre-trial phase
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   According to legal papers Dow Jones lawyers filed with Werlein
seeking to overturn the libel verdict, Fincher had been put in
charge of reviewing hundreds of hours of internal tape recordings
about the time MMAR filed its libel suit in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dow Jones' motion to have the original verdict set
aside, Fincher ``disclosed that MMAR had withheld crucial evidence,
including audiotapes and transcripts, and engaged in a scheme to
erase damaging portions of conversations recorded on the `master
reels' of its telephone taping system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fincher, the legal pleadings said, had made copies of
crucial tapes. Last summer, while he was providing further evidence
to Dow Jones attorneys, Fincher died in the crash of a small plane
while on a Central American vacation.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments on the case Thursday, Werlein wrote that ``The
tapes contain significant evidence to suggest that MMAR had engaged
in mismarking'' the documents that listed the value of pension
fund's mortgage-backed securities. ``This evidence,'' the judge
continued, ``went to the heart of one of the most damaging
statements in the article.''
</P>
<P>
   The material, Werlein wrote, ``would have provided potentially
fruitful, if not dramatic, new avenues of cross-examination during
the trial, and would have provided substantial evidence from which
to argue to the jury that the mismarking statement was true.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the newly revealed taped conversations, which occurred
a few months before The Journal's article appeared, MMAR's chief
financial officer is discussing the Louisiana state pension
portfolio with the head of the company's trading desk. ``But, I
mean, what did we do? Except for mispricing?'' the officer asks.
</P>
<P>
   The top trader responded, ``That's what we _ well, that, which
is pretty major. And we sold them all this (expletive). It was
probably _ could be considered unsuitable by certain people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reached early Thursday evening, MMAR's attorney, Kenneth M.
Morris, said, ``If we need to retry the case, we will.'' He added
that he had not received a copy of the judge's ruling, but ``a new
trial procedure would be a disappointment but certainly not a
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think those tapes can be fully and fairly
explained. I do not think those tapes show that MMAR mismarked''
any listings ``to hide any losses because there were no losses to
hide'' in the pension plan's portfolio. ``I'm confident that the
jury will find that that statement remains false and defamatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the case is on appeal to the circuit court, Werlein cannot
not immediately order a retrial until the higher court sends him
back the case.
</P>
<P>
   Paul E. Steiger, the Journal's managing editor, said Thursday,
``We are very pleased with the court's decision, and are quite
optimistic as this case returns to the district court. We've long
maintained that we did not cause MMAR's collapse, but merely
chronicled it.''

 &HT;    Senate supports consumer tax cuts
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Though they rejected similar proposals two years
ago, Senate Republicans on Thursday helped pass more than $300
million in consumer sales tax cuts, a key part of Gov. George W.
Bush's legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats in 1997 urged Bush and fellow lawmakers to
exempt over-the-counter medicines and children's school clothing
from the sales tax. At the time, Senate Republicans, backing Bush's
1997 call for property tax cuts, voted against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a likely candidate for the Republican presidential
nomination, again has called on lawmakers to cut property taxes. He
also wants consumer sales tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the see the governor and some of our other colleagues
have jumped on the bandwagon,'' said Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos.
Barrientos (D-Austin) peppered the Senate with comments about
Republicans fighting the issue two years ago before the Senate
approved the bill by an unrecorded voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``How come we didn't pass these very same tax cuts last
session?'' he asked Sen. Rodney Ellis (D-Houston), sponsor of the
bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   No Republicans voted for the amendments last session, though not
all Democrats supported them either.
</P>
<P>
   As approved by the Senate, Texans would not pay the state's 6.25
percent sales tax or the local option sales taxes of up to 2
percent on over-the-counter medicine specifically formulated for
children. They also would not pay sales taxes on diapers. Those
exemptions, which would begin Sept. 1, 1999, would cost the state
$101 million during the next two budget years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the permanent exemption on diapers and children's
medicines, Senate Bill 441 would establish a 14-day sales tax
holiday during which no sales taxes would be collected on most
clothing and shoes that cost less than $200. That would cost the
state about $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals would cost cities, counties and other taxing
authorities, like transit authorities, another $54.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Because recent state income has been higher than expected,
lawmakers and Bush are talking tax cuts for the next two budget
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real tax cut for families that they can
understand,'' said Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have criticized a $1 billion property tax cut passed
in 1997 and Bush's proposed $2 billion property tax cut this year.
They say property tax cuts do nothing for people who don't own
homes or businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A House committee late Wednesday approved its version of
consumer tax cuts. That plan, including House Bills 209, 2280, 2371
and 2372, would eliminate the sales tax on diapers, most school
supplies, children's over-the-counter medicines. The House
committee plan also would create a nine-day moratorium on sales
taxes on children's school clothing that costs $75 or less.
</P>
<P>
   The committee now will have to decide whether to take up the
Senate version of the proposal, make changes to its version on the
House floor or debate the issue with senators in a conference
committee.

   WASHINGTON, _ Madeleine Albright's limousine left her Georgetown
house just after 7 Thursday morning to take her to a State
Department building where her colleagues are torn between their
admiration for her principled stand against a dictator and their
remorse over the human repercussions of the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   As the devastation from the war has mounted, Albright has found
herself ever more defensive, watching as diplomacy is overrun by
military issues.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, described by aides as the champion of the idea that if
diplomacy failed, force was necessary against Slobodan Milosevic,
is now viewed by her colleagues as the most likely loser in
Washington's current round of assessing blame for a war whose
progress is not what was expected.

   ``There is a certain degree of of finger-pointing going on,''
one of her closest advisers, the State Department spokesman, James
R. Rubin said at a daily briefing this week. ``I don't think it is
particularly appropriate in a time of crisis, but that is the
nature of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign service officers are dismayed because, as one
explained in loyal defense of his boss, Albright's views seemed
correct when she expressed them in the president's councils, but
the consequences of their execution were unforeseen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced this is a good thing,'' said a State Department
official who said he was emotionally wrenched by the condition of
the refugees and the atrocities inside Kosovo. ``I think destroying
Milosevic is a worthy objective. But whether we can accomplish this
is up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Albright often argued that a lesson of World War II was
to counter force with force and that Milosevic only understood
force, she has been seen as the chief hawk on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the critics of the administration's Kosovo policy,
Ivo Daalder, a member of the National Security Council in the first
Clinton administration and now an analyst at the Brookings
Institution, said that the rising clamor in Washington about
``Madeleine's war'' was off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, Richard Holbrooke always thought he could negotiate
with the threat of force,'' Daalder said, referring to the
administration's Balkans envoy. ``And then Clinton, Shelton, Clark
and Solana based their arguments on that too,'' he said, referring
to Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Wesley K. Clark, the commander of NATO and Javier Solana,
the secretary general of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that they misread Milosevic,'' Daalder said.
``They said the only thing he understands is force. They were
wrong. The only thing he understands is maintaining power.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the dismay at the State Department on the misreading
of Milosevic, is the fact that since the bombing started,
Albright's role within the administration has diminished.
</P>
<P>
   In any war, the military machine takes over, officials said. Any
secretary of state, they said, would find herself with less
influence at the White House than, for example, the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not an analysis that is likely to be shared by some
of her predecessors, like Henry A. Kissinger and James A. Baker
III, both of whom exerted powerful influence on the wartime
policies of the presidents they served. But Albright's star has
dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Her brief is to call many of the NATO foreign ministers on the
phone every day, urging them to hang tough and not to waver, aides
say. She has concentrated on keeping Italy on board, where the
bases are critical for the air operation but the public mood could
waver.
</P>
<P>
   She has been relatively sidelined within the inner circle on the
big decisions on the crisis at the White House, State Department
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring this was the White House decision this week to move
chief responsibility for the ethnic Albanian refugees from
Albright's purview at the State Department to a new council set up
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House morning meetings with President Clinton, his
national security adviser, Samuel Berger, Vice President Al Gore,
the head of Central Intelligence, George Tenet and the Pentagon
chiefs, Albright's task is to announce the latest on what she has
gleaned from the NATO capitals.
</P>
<P>
   She also reports on the attitude of the Russian foreign
minister, Igor Ivanov, who so far has been uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Ivanov usually end their conversation with the line
that the Washington-Moscow relationship is ``bigger'' than the
Kosovo crisis, one of Albright's aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But after hanging up, a Russian foreign ministry official noted,
Ivanov often steps before the television cameras in Moscow and
denounces NATO's actions in Kosovo in the strongest terms.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's closest counsellors on the conflict gather at 8 a.m.
on the seventh floor of the State Department. Around the table are
usually the deputy secretary of state, Strobe Talbot,
undersecretary of state, Thomas Pickering, her new special envoy to
the Balkans, Ambassador James F. Dobbins, and Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Most mornings, Albright has then headed to the White House for
the meeting with Clinton and his foreign policy team.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary has talked almost daily in speeches and on
television of how the brutality of Milosevic has solidified the
NATO alliance, how determination to forge ahead is necessary and
most frequently, how the United States position is morally correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather be here answering these questions than
answering your questions of why we stood by and watched these kinds
of massacres take place,'' she said on a television talk show after
being pushed on the question of why Milosevic had not been declared
a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   In her public explanations of the Kosovo policy, Albright has
said that the accord devised at Rambouillet in France, where she
spent days persuading the ethnic Albanians to agree, remained the
basis of a future political settlement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But that agreement appears to be fading as the centerpiece for a
resolution of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, publicly
questioned whether parts of the agreement were still viable.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Rambouillet agreement, Kosovo was to be granted
autonomy within Serbia. In the last few days, the administration
has referred to ``self government,'' for Kosovo, a phrase which to
many translates as independence.
</P>
<P>
   And the administration, including Albright, have changed some of
the key language, referring to an ``international security force''
instead of a NATO-led force, which may be more to Milosevic's
liking, officials said.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR GRUNFELD, FUTURE RIDES ON KNICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the bleeding doesn't soon stop, Ernie Grunfeld
surely knows where this is going because he has already been there,
eight years ago, in one of those fancy sky boxes atop Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   He was alongside Al Bianchi one winter night in 1991 when
Bernard King returned like a vengeful ghost to haunt the faltering
Knicks with 49 points, and a crowd of 14,227 erupted with inspired
chants of ``Al Must Go.'' If it was painful for Grunfeld to sit
there while his boss, the general manager, was derided, it was
worse for Bianchi, who finally turned to him and said: ``They booed
Holzman, DeBusschere and Reed. I guess I'm in good company.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi was fired soon after, just like Red Holzman, Dave
DeBusschere and Willis Reed. Grunfeld slid into the general
manager's seat, and up another notch to team president after Pat
Riley slithered south to Miami, and Dave Checketts climbed from the
Knicks' presidency up the corporate ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld, out of Forest Hills High School, has outlasted
Bianchi, the man who hired him, for almost a decade. He has had a
good front-office run, but history and common sense tell us it will
end if the Knicks don't reverse field and at least last into the
second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld will be out, and his recent pronouncement of job
security for the coach, Jeff Van Gundy, will be moot. Even
Checketts, caretaker of the entire Garden, may have to explain _ 60
percent to Charles Dolan and the other 40 to Rupert Murdoch, if I
understand the latest shuffling of ownership _ why the hundreds of
millions in basketball and hockey salaries have produced such
insipid results.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts, Grunfeld and Van Gundy, whom you never mind bumping
into in the Garden corridor, obviously have their public-access
allies, who, unfortunately, have sounded more like spokespeople
these last turbulent weeks. All warring camps should by now at
least be in agreement that, barring a miracle of biblical
proportion, there will be no championship in the Patrick Ewing era.
Whoever is in charge next season had better come up with one heck
of an exit strategy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if this management team didn't have the time and
resources to win the franchise's first title in over a quarter of a
century. Eight years in the front office is an eternity these days,
and after several spending sprees, Grunfeld has somehow assembled a
team that doesn't pass or rebound well enough to create high
percentage shots, a team with no custodial presence that was
foolishly built around a 36-year-old center with a worn, cranky
body.
</P>
<P>
   On this latter subject, Ewing's public defenders should stop
whining about how maligned he is. The argument that Ewing is no
longer a title-caliber leading man _ if he ever was _ is an
indictment of the front office, not him. For the money Checketts
and Grunfeld spent, as well as the prices they charge, they had to
do better than they have.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent moves by Grunfeld have been the confused or
desperate maneuverings of a man trying to make up for mistakes. The
Knicks didn't want to pay an aging Charles Oakley free-agent money,
so they surrendered their interior soul, turned around and handed a
$28 million, four-year deal to Chris Dudley, 34. They compounded
the Chris Childs mistake by overpaying Charlie Ward. They knew
Latrell Sprewell could score and paid little mind to how he would
fit.
</P>
<P>
   So much costly redecorating, in the interests of ``winning one
with Ewing.'' This is the weight on the shoulders of every player
who has walked through the locker room door. Not to mention the
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Before anyone screams bloody murder in Van Gundy's defense,
please note that 23 coaching changes have been made since he
relieved Don Nelson late in the 1995-96 season. Van Gundy is
knowledgeable and prepared, but labels come cheap these days. I
suppose if Allen Iverson, who hasn't been in a playoff game, can be
called a great player, then Van Gundy, as his worried supporters
have been lining up to say, is a great coach.
</P>
<P>
   If he goes, frankly, he'll live, and probably with a lucrative
deal someplace else. Any sympathy I have for fired coaches is
reserved for guys like Butch Beard and Eddie Jordan, the
African-American aspirants who wait years to coach a bad team for a
short time, on the way back to being an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   For Knicks fans, the reality is that they're better off if this
team bottoms out right here and now. The illusion of contention
will finally be shattered. The paying customers can start chanting
that someone, or everyone, must go. The corporate head hunters will
fill in the blanks.

EARLY LEADERS IN MASTERS POST 69S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ As darkness settled in over Augusta National Golf
Club _ with players still on the course in Thursday's opening round
of the 63d Masters and just a few spectators following a weather
delay _ the duel between David Duval and Tiger Woods had failed to
take shape. They both played ordinary rounds, Woods taking an 8 on
the par-5 eighth and Duval stumbling to three straight bogeys on
the incoming nine.
</P>
<P>
   When play was suspended at 7:50 p.m. and scheduled to resume at
9 a.m. Friday with 12 players still to complete their opening
rounds, the leaders at 3-under-par 69 in the Ante Bellum South
clubhouse were 1997 PGA champion Davis Love, Masters rookie Brandel
Chamblee, and Scott McCarron, who quit the game after leaving UCLA
to work in his father's clothing business. This wasn't exactly
Duval/Woods but as Love was quick to point out, ``There's a long,
long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The first suspension of play came at 5:10 p.m. and Duval had
just bogeyed the par-3 12th. The siren sounded after he pulled his
tee shot on the par-5 13th into Rae's Creek and was looking at
saving par putt of 8 feet. It wasn't until 6:40 that Dvual returned
to his putt. He missed, then left his second shot on the 14th short
of the green, hit a woeful chip, and missed the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Woods had pulled his tee shot on the eighth, caught a
bush on his second shot, and had to take an unplayable lie. The
bush couldn't be moved as had the rock in his line at Phoenix, so
he took a drop and wound up with an 8 from behind the green. Woods
birdied three straight holes starting at the 12th and finished at
level-par 72. Duval birdied the 17th to get to 1 under and will
finish the 18th this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee, who qualified for his first Masters when he won the
Greater Vancouver Open last August, said this normally was a week
spent at home. ``I did my taxes like everybody else,'' he said,
``and I'd have a Masters party and invite everybody over to watch
it on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   He adapted pretty well in his first Masters round. ``I really
don't know how the course is going to play the next two or three
days,'' Chamblee said. ``Every day is going to be a new day for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee's round was set up by a birdie on the 11th, when he hit
an 8-iron to 15 feet, and the 13th, where he pulled out what he
called a Zoom club, somewhere between a 2-iron and 4-wood, and
lofted a shot 216 yards that settled within 5 feet of the pin for
eagle. When he finished by hitting an 8-iron to within 5 feet for a
birdie, he was tied for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Love, who has been disappointed he hasn't won more since
dramatically producing his lone major victory at the PGA
Championship at Winged Foot two years ago, stormed home with four
birdies on the incoming nine after making the turn in 37. The round
picked up steam after Love birdied the 10th and ran in a 30-foot
birdie putt on the remodeled 11th. The round was topped by birdies
on the 16th and 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course was playing pretty difficult,'' he said. ``I got
away with not getting anything going on the front, and then got
something going on the back. It's nice to get started. I'm always
eager to get started in the majors, but I was expecially anxious
for this one. I'm looking forward to getting a little bit better
every day, a little more relaxed. I did a good job today of just
staying patient.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron, who finished tied for 10th in his first Masters in
1996, missed the cut in the BellSouth won by Duval last weekend and
arrived here last Friday night. ``I think I had a little
Masters-itis going,'' he said, ``so I've had a few looks at it. The
(heightened) rough is probably the biggest obstacle for me. I
missed the fairways a few times by a foot or two and had some
difficult shots.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron had five birdies, but his low Masters round was made by
birdies on the 12th (9-iron, 2 feet), 15th (3-iron, two putts), and
18th (sand wedge, 2 feet).
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, when I get here and feel comfortable I drive
the ball farther and feel more powerful,'' McCarron said. ``It's
kid of a mystical place for me. I've really enjoyed it from the
first time I stepped up and played.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, who opened with a 74 last year but birdied three
of the final four holes to earn his first major championship,
birdied the 18th by holing an 8-foot putt to wind up one shot back
in a group of seven, which also included Colin Montgomerie, Jose
Maria Olazabal, Justin Leonard, Lee Janzen, Jeff Sluman, and Andrew
Magee. Only Montgomerie and Magee have yet to win a major.

 &HT;    Love `the quietest No. 3 in history'
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA , Ga. _ The breakthrough for Davis Love III was supposed
to have come at the PGA in 1997 when he won his first major. Now,
the theory went, the pressure was off and the majors would start
rolling in like clouds in front of a low pressure system.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Just like after Tiger Woods won the Masters by 12 shots in 1997,
there was no follow through.
</P>
<P>
   Golf is funny that way. It will lure you into thinking you've
figured it out, then it will knock on your front door late at night
and leave a burning sack of putters on your porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here last year thinking I had a good chance,'' Love
said. ``To not really contend in any of the majors was
disappointing. All I did was hang around in a couple of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanging around can be profitable in this game.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus made a pretty fair career out of it. He hung
around, made a birdie here or there, saved a par from someone's
porch, had the nerves of a cliff-diver, watched the men around him
turn to jelly and won 70 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   But if you don't do any or all of those tricks that Nicklaus
perfected, you end up seventh or eighth and people are asking you
questions like this one from a USA Today writer on Thursday:
``Someone asked me last night, `Why doesn't Davis Love win more?'
and I'm like, `I don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   This was after Love had goosed a 3-under-par 69 at Augusta
National Golf Club to tie for the first-day lead at the
storm-interrupted Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Love's quick-draw answer: ``He doesn't shoot low enough
scores.''
</P>
<P>
   And then this more reflective response: ``I've been wondering
that a lot this year. I do feel I should win more, but I bet
there's 100 guys playing this week who feel they should win more,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not 100, but plenty. This is a Tour of should-haves,
would-haves and might-haves. And every major _ except the one Tiger
swallowed whole _ ends with a half-dozen guys muttering that it was
theirs for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   Love was one of them in 1995, the year Ben Crenshaw won with his
late teacher, Harvey Penick, whispering to him from the grave.
Penick died the Sunday before the Masters, Crenshaw was a
pall-bearer at the funeral on Wednesday, and then came the classic
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Love nailed a 6-under-par 66 on Sunday and led by a shot. But
Crenshaw, playing with memories of Penick ripping him apart,
birdied 16 to tie, birdied 17 to lead and then two-putted for a par
on 18 to win, after which he doubled over and let out a week's
worth of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Love finished at 13-under 275, which would have won 16 of the
previous 18 Masters (and tied the other two), yet he left Augusta
that night as empty as an Arizona ghost town.
</P>
<P>
   Love flew home to Sea Island, Ga., then phoned Crenshaw, who was
eating his Champion's dinner in the clubhouse here. Best of
friends, the two congratulated each other on a battle well fought.
``Then I told Ben, `The only way I could feel good about finishing
second was that you won,''' Love said, ``and that's how I still
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   He shot 32 on the backside Thursday after wrestling a 37 out of
the front, then addressed his status as No. 3 in the world golf
rankings. ``I'm the quietest No. 3 in history,'' he said. ``I came
in here and talked to one or two people, hit some balls, and that
was it. It's nice not to be in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand is a fickle beast. You're only in demand if you've left a
footprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to be in demand next Monday,'' Davis Love
decided.

SEAGRAM'S ONLINE PLANS BOOST STOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- Internet mania has hit Seagram Co.,
parent of Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram's decision to launch an online music business goosed the
stock by 13 percent in the past two sessions for a pair of all-time
highs. It gained $4.0625 Wednesday and an additional $3 on Thursday
to close at $62 a share after hitting $65 during the session.
</P>
<P>
   The price rise represents a validation of Edgar Bronfman's
strategy to transform Seagram from a beverage concern to an
entertainment conglomerate. Seagram shares had been depressed last
fall, dropping under $30 at one point, over concerns about its film
business. But the shares recovered on optimism about the
acquisition of Polygram NV and remained at the $47 level in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   The stock began rising last week on rumors of a major Web
alliance. Seagram and German media giant Bertelsmann confirmed
Wednesday they will pool resources for online sale in the most
extensive such move by major music companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction is an overreaction except that anything related
to the Internet is getting a great response these days,'' said
Barry Hyman, an analyst with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ``This is a
good partnership because music is heading in this direction. We
bought the stock at $32 when it was one of the cheapest
entertainment companies in the universe so right now I would
consider it fairly valued but I will think it will continue
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bannister of Edward Jones, who recently upgraded Seagram
from hold to buy, said the price surge reflects not just Wall
Street's lust for Internet stocks but also its satisfaction with
how the company is positioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seagram is being viewed much more now as an entertainment
company,'' she said. ``The stock was significantly undervalued, so
the discount is not there anymore, but there's a lot of potential
for them to benefit eventually from downloading music from the
Internet.''

SAM SHAW, FILM PRODUCER AND PHOTOGRAPHER, DIES AT 87  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., La, W. Va.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sam Shaw, a film producer and photojournalist famous for his
photographs of Marilyn Monroe standing over a subway grate with her
skirt billowing, died on Monday at a hospital in Westwood, N.J. He
was 87 and lived in Tappan, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Born and reared on New York City's Lower East Side, Shaw's
artistic talents were evident even as a young boy when, without
money to buy supplies, he would gather up tar from the streets and
make sculptures of animals. By the time he finished high school, he
had turned to painting and was offered either a scholarship to
study at the Pratt Institute or a studio in which to work. He chose
the latter, which he sometimes shared with the artist Romare
Bearden.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint as the art director for the Brooklyn Eagle,
Shaw began his career as a photojournalist with Colliers magazine
in the 1940s. Alongside the journalist Harry Henderson, he traveled
through the United States to create memorable photographs of West
Virginian miners, Southern sharecroppers and New Orleans jazz
musicians at work in their environs. His name became synonymous
with the covers of Life and Look in the 1950s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, he moved into film. In 1951, he created the
photograph of Marlon Brando in a ripped T-shirt that came to
symbolize ``A Streetcar Named Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   It was while shooting Brando on the set of ``Viva Zapata!'' in
1952 that he met Monroe. A struggling contract player, she had been
assigned to drive Shaw to film locations, and their friendship
quickly ignited.

   Her star had risen by 1955, when Shaw was hired to shoot a
poster for Billy Wilder's ``Seven Year Itch.'' Before a crowd of
thousands, Monroe re-enacted the scene from Wilder's script in
which she left the Trans Lux theater on Lexington Avenue and
crossed a subway grate, as a rush of air from an oncoming train
caused the skirt of her white dress to fly up. ``You've got to give
Marilyn credit, too,'' Shaw said in an interview years later of
that moment. ``She was very inventive. She loved the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Shaw had filed a $100 million suit against his
son, Larry Shaw of Piermont, in which he claimed that his son, then
acting as his agent, made deals to illegally reproduce images of
Monroe and pocketed the proceeds. His son denied the accusations,
saying he had permission.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961 Shaw tried his hand at producing with ``Paris Blues,''
starring Paul Newman, Joan Woodward, Sidney Poitier and Louis
Armstrong. He went on to produce films for John Cassavetes,
including ``Husbands,'' ``A Woman Under the Influence,'' ``The
Killing of a Chinese Bookie,'' ``Opening Night,'' ``Gloria'' and
``Love Streams.''
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his daughters, Meta Shaw Stevens of New
York City and Edith Shaw Marcus of Tappan, N.Y.; seven
grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.

 &HT;    Confidence not lacking in Perez, 20
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Today is the big day for Odalis Perez, who makes his
first major-league start when the Braves open a three-game series
with the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   And no, the left-hander who beat out Bruce Chen for the No. 5
starter's job is not especially nervous. But Perez, 20, is glad
today is finally here.
</P>
<P>
   To pass the time Perez said he has been ``just relaxing,
watching TV, watching the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his confidence comes from his personality, some from his
successful spring. In his two spring starts, Perez dominated the
two best lineups in the American League. In a split-squad game
against the New York Yankees, Perez struck out seven in four
innings and gave up two runs. Against the Indians, Perez pitched
five scoreless innings, allowing one hit and striking out six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go there and do well, like I was doing in spring
training,'' Perez said. ``I will try to do my job and be focused,
approach the hitters one at a time. I'll just throw all my pitches
and let them work.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he hasn't been studying the Arizona lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a good team,'' Perez said. ``It doesn't matter the kind
of lineup they're going to have there.''
</P>
<P>
   One advantage Perez does count on is the Diamondbacks'
unfamiliarity with him. Perez, who was used exclusively as a
reliever last season, faced the Diamondbacks only once. He saw two
batters and got them both out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have a big surprise,'' Perez said. ``They
don't know who I am. There might be two or three guys who remember
who I am. Most of the guys don't even know me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker ready
</P>
<P>
   The day after striking out the side in the ninth inning to cap
off a 4-0 Braves shutout, John Rocker said he wasn't counting on
having the closer's job, but was ready for it either way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they'll give (Mark Wohlers) as many chances as they
think he deserves to reclaim his closer's job,'' Rocker said. ``If
he gets back to where he was two years ago, I'm sure they'd be
thrilled to death to have that. ... Better (for me) to be prepared
and have it not happen, than not prepared and have it happen and
say `What do I do now?'''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan on the move
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of reasons why Brian Jordan has been eagerly
attempting stolen bases in his first several games as a Brave: One
is he wanted to get his first stolen base behind him. And secondly,
he's not trying to protect Mark McGwire anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got freedom,'' said Jordan, who was 17-for-22 last year
in stolen bases. Jordan, who is 0-for-2 in steals, said one of
those attempts came after he misread a sign, where he thought he
was supposed to go instead of just having the option to go. Also,
Jordan is nursing a sore hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel fast at all,'' Jordan said. ``I don't have that
explosion. ... I'm not going to give up trying. ... You've got to
be aggressive.

LAWYER LIKENS MELISSA VIRUS TO GRAFFITI
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEHOLD, N.J. _ The 30-year-old computer programmer accused of
creating the fastest-spreading computer virus in history made his
first appearance in court Thursday, and afterward his lawyer
suggested that whoever wrote the virus should be considered a sort
of graffiti artist rather than ``an international cyberterrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   The programmer, David L. Smith, was arrested a week ago after a
global search and charged with writing and sending out the Melissa
virus, which has infected more than 100,000 computers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Edward F. Borden Jr., said Thursday that Smith would
most likely plead not guilty if indicted by a state grand jury. The
programmer, who lives in Aberdeen, N.J., will not have to enter a
plea on the five counts he faces until his arraignment, which has
not yet been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's hearing in state Superior Court in Monmouth
County, Judge John Ricciardi advised Smith of his rights and
explained the legal process that will ensue in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a tall, broad-shouldered man, wearing a plain black suit,
nodded repeatedly as the judge spoke to him, but remained silent
except for an occasional ``Yes, sir'' or ``No, Sir.'' After the
brief hearing, he walked without a hint of emotion through the pack
of reporters waiting for him outside the courthouse and was driven
away by Borden.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to speak with reporters, Borden described Smith as a
bright young man who had been wrongfully vilified by the state.
``David was making his way in the world just fine until a few days
ago,'' he said. ``He's very upset and has been affected by this
very profoundly.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that Smith, who worked until a few days ago
as a consultant for CGS, a computer company based in Iselin, N.J.,
wrote the virus and named it after a topless dancer he had
apparently met in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged with three counts relating to the interruption of
public communication, as well as theft of computer services and
wrongful access to computer systems. The charges carry a maximum
penalty of 40 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 26, when it was first uploaded to the Internet news
group alt.sex from a stolen America Online account, the Melissa
virus has spread like a cancerous chain letter by penetrating a
computer user's e-mail system and sending itself to as many as 50
correspondents in the user's e-mail address book.
</P>
<P>
   By replicating and transmitting itself so quickly, the virus
backed up and at times incapacitated computer networks at about 300
corporations, experts have said.
</P>
<P>
   While Borden said he could not dismiss the virus as a ``harmless
prank,'' he said it did not delete any files or severely damage any
computers. He also refused to say whether Smith had anything to do
with creating the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question,'' he said of whoever wrote the Melissa
virus, ``is whether we're dealing with someone more akin to a
graffiti artist or to an international cyberterrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Loriquet, a spokesman for the New Jersey attorney general's
office, which is prosecuting the case, said a grand jury would soon
convene in Trenton, but would not say exactly when.
</P>
<P>
   Smith remains free on $100,000 bail and is staying with his
family, Borden said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's air campaign has effectively cut fuel and
ammunition supply lines to 40,000 Yugoslav army troops and police
fighting in Kosovo, allied officials said Thursday in providing the
first details of damage to support their claim that the 16-day
bombardment was taking a steep toll.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Pentagon officials noted that Yugoslav armored
forces had stopped maneuvering and were hunkering down, they
conceded that the strategy to starve the Yugoslav war machine might
be too late. The Yugoslav army, they said, may have already
achieved its goal of defeating Kosovo rebels and expelling hundreds
of thousands of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   And after four days of clear weather _ ideal for bombing _ rain
and fog rolled in again Thursday night, forcing several
fighter-bomber missions to turn back to base. Pentagon officials
said the forecast called for bad weather for much of this week.
</P>
<P>
   NATO missions were also complicated by the unexpected return to
Kosovo of huge numbers of ethnic Albanians who were turned back at
the Macedonian and Albanian borders when Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic abruptly closed the borders. Though the
whereabouts of these refugees were not immediately known, NATO
officials acknowledged that they could put new limitations on
targeting.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Thursday that Yugoslav forces were
responsible for killing ``thousands'' of Kosovar Albanians and
creating ``hundreds of thousands of refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said, ``In 1998
alone, the death toll was 2,000.'' Moreover, he said, ``there are
growing numbers of credible reports of innocent people being killed
in the last two or three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said information on the killings was initially obtained
from monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe and was later supplemented by accounts from refugees and by
``all available means'' of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   As administration officials sharpened their rhetorical attack on
Milosevic, senior military officers said Thursday that Yugoslavia's
two main oil refineries had been knocked out of operation, and that
the main rail lines and roads leading into the besieged province
had been destroyed or severely damaged. Fuel shortages were
reported throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to see strong evidence of supply problems and
fuel problems plaguing these Yugoslav forces in a number of
different areas and among a number of different units,'' said Rear
Adm. Thomas Wilson, the director of intelligence for the military's
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO warplanes again flew more than 400 missions, attacking
22 targets across Yugoslavia, including air defenses, fuel depots,
bridges and tanks in the field, allied intelligence reported that
the Yugoslav army was hunkering down, and hiding in abandoned
buildings and forests, curtailing its campaign to drive ethnic
Albanians out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unilateral ceasefire declaration by Milosevic,
Yugoslav forces continued to engage remnants of the Kosovo
Liberation Army. Allied officials said there was evidence that
Yugoslav forces were conducting mop-up operations, particularly in
the northern part of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials said the air campaign would intensify. Defense
Department officials said Thursday that they expected Gen. Wesley
Clark, the NATO military commander, to request at least half a
dozen A-10s and a dozen F-16 ground attack planes, bolstering an
air armada of 600 aircraft already involved.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Defense Secretary William Cohen have said that
whatever requests Clark makes to conduct the air campaign will be
honored. Cohen said Thursday that he was considering a request for
additional F-15E strike fighters, as well as aerial refueling
craft. The fighter can attack with precision weapons from high
altitudes, making it less vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
   As American officials geared up for a protracted air campaign
that could last several more weeks, lawmakers traveling this week
with Cohen to Brussels, Belgium, and Italy, to meet with NATO
officials and American troops, indicated that the administration
must consider additional measures.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member bipartisan delegation of House and Senate members
intend to send the president a letter on Friday urging him and the
leaders of the other 18 NATO countries to begin at least the
planning for ground troops, said congressional officials.
</P>
<P>
   While political pressure may be building here for considering
ground forces, NATO officials remain adamant that no such option is
under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   As the air campaign entered its 16th day, allied officials here
and in Brussels denied claims by Yugoslav authorities that NATO
bombing had caused widespread damage within Pristina, the
provincial capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who toured the city as part of a visit arranged by
Yugoslav officials filed reports on Wednesday describing the
damage. But U.S. officers said Thursday that most targets around
Pristina were in lightly populated suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Only two targets in the city itself were hit, a telephone
exchange used by the military and a police headquarters building.
While the officers acknowledge that the bombing might have caused
some damage around the telephone building, they denied the Yugoslav
claims, and said Yugoslav forces were responsible for the
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collateral damage is being done by the Serbs,'' Wilson
told reporters at the Pentagon. ``Towns and villages have been
damaged primarily by fires set by the Yugoslav forces as they've
gone through, as well as by shooting them up with artillery and
tanks and those kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than two weeks of air and missile strikes, Pentagon
and NATO officials say they have inflicted significant damage to
Yugoslavia's armed forces, but Clark said in an interview that many
targets remain, and he vowed to continue striking them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and NATO have left vague the exact
military objectives of the attack, saying the aim was ``to
degrade'' Yugoslavia's military and paramilitary police forces.
Senior Pentagon officials concede the standard was set so that the
attack could end at virtually any point and be considered to have
met that objective.
</P>
<P>
   Ending the strikes soon, however, could leave Milosevic with a
weakened but functioning military and considerable special police
forces, which he relies on to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
Clark, as well as the leaders of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wanted
to be able to continue to attack Yugoslav military targets for at
least a couple weeks more, if not longer, particularly since the
initial phases of the operation were hampered by foul weather.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday a senior Pentagon official said the general hoped to
escalate around-the-clock bombing, rather than limiting most of the
air raids to nighttime. The prospect of a significant diplomatic
initiative could force a halt to Clark's plans to escalate the
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   At Aviano Air Base in Italy, the nexus of NATO's air war against
Yugoslavia, Cohen's remarks to troops Thursday clearly underscored
a hardening of the Pentagon's view, leaving little prospect for a
deal with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic, as you all have seen, has carried all of us
into the heart of darkness,'' Cohen told an assembly of pilots and
airmen. ``It is a place where the law of rule drives its heel and
boot over the rule of law and where justice amounts to nothing more
than a bullet in the back of the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, military briefers described in the greatest
detail to date specific targets attacked and estimates on the air
war's effectiveness against certain kinds of targets.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes, for instance, successfully bombed a refinery at
Pancevo that produces nearly two-thirds of Yugoslavia's oil. But
Wilson acknowledged earlier in the week that the Yugoslav troops in
Kosovo had at least a couple of weeks' fuel with them when the air
war started, and while many forces showed signs of running low,
tanks and armored vehicles were not yet stopping in their tracks.

EDITORIAL: THE WHITE HOUSE AND CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April 9:
</P>
<P>
   Differences between Washington and Beijing over human rights,
Kosovo and Chinese admission to the World Trade Organization were
already casting a shadow over this week's visit to America by
Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. Then came a new report Thursday
that China may have stolen neutron bomb secrets from the United
States during President Clinton's first term. Earlier accounts said
China had stolen design information about other U.S. nuclear
warheads a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not merely the potential damage to U.S. security.
As troubling is evidence _ described by Jeff Gerth and James Risen
in The New York Times on Thursday _ that top White House officials,
especially Samuel Berger, now the national security adviser,
reacted lethargically when the first alarms were sounded about the
suspected spying.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton this week has offered a strong defense of his policy of
engaging China. But he acknowledged that China's goals sometimes
conflict with those of the United States and promised that his
administration would vigorously uphold U.S. interests. Thursday
Clinton effectively used his joint press conference with Zhu to
offer frank criticisms of China's worsening human rights record. He
wisely refrained from agreeing to Chinese membership in the trade
group while market access issues remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the White House's initial handling of the nuclear
espionage cases in 1996 seemed to reflect a tolerant attitude
toward Chinese misconduct. It remains unclear whether the response
was motivated by a desire to avoid friction with China at a time
when the White House was trying to mend tattered relations, or
whether Berger and his colleagues failed to recognize the
significance of the espionage information when it was first
presented to them.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department investigators first told Berger in April 1996
of suspicions that China had stolen designs for America's most
advanced nuclear weapon in the 1980's from the Los Alamos National
Laboratory. They also mentioned intelligence reports that China may
have more recently stolen neutron bomb designs. Berger asserts that
this 1996 briefing was cast only in general terms and that he did
not learn the true extent of the problems until mid-1997. Others
who attended the meeting dispute this.
</P>
<P>
   If they are right, Berger should have briefed Clinton and
ordered immediate security improvements at the nuclear weapons labs
in 1996. Yet Clinton was not alerted to the seriousness of the
problem until July 1997, and lab security has been tightened only
in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has asked the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board to investigate the Chinese nuclear espionage issue, including
the response of administration officials. That inquiry, as well as
parallel congressional investigations, must closely study and
report on the performance of Berger and other national security
officials.

 &HT;    Big-hitting McCarron likes lengthier course
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Everyone has claimed the changes made to Augusta
National favor the long hitters. They certainly favored co-leader
Scott McCarron, considered one of the PGA Tour's longest drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the course does set up real well for me,'' said
McCarron, a 33-year-old Californian, after his five-birdie,
three-bogey round. ``For some reason, I get here and start relaxing
and feel comfortable. I drive the ball farther and feel more
powerful. It's kind of a mystical place for me.''
</P>
<P>
   His 69 marks the first time he's broken 70 in three Masters, but
that is a bit misleading. He finished 10th in 1996 with rounds of
70-70-72-74. Crowd washed away
</P>
<P>
   The storm that blew through Augusta National late Thursday
afternoon turned the first round of the Masters into two
tournaments. The first was as hot as summer and jammed with crowds.
After the rain, a cool breeze and strange hush fell over the course
as the few-hundred lingering fans watched lightning dance in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting a sand shot on 18 close enough for a tap-in par
and 83, Arnold Palmer said he thought the small necklace of
spectators around the last green was the fewest he'd seen in 45
Masters. A few minutes later, everyone could easily see Mark
O'Meara hole a 3-footer for birdie, which would have been
impossible if he had finished a few hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Franco stumbles after fast start
</P>
<P>
   It would have been a fairy tale if Carlos Franco could have
stayed on the leaderboard. A 33-year-old Masters rookie who grew up
in Paraguay, a country with only three golf courses, he got to 4
under after 11 holes.
</P>
<P>
   But disaster struck on the par-5 15th when Franco struck a hard
5-iron from 202 yards that bounced off the green as if from a
tabletop. The ball came to rest on the bank of the pond behind the
green _ a lucky break. But Franco skulled his next shot into the
front pond and he made a double bogey en route to a 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``One moment I was first,'' he said through an interpreter after
his round. ``The next moment I had an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Rough start
</P>
<P>
   When honorary starter Byron Nelson was introduced as the winner
of 11 consecutive PGA tournaments Thursday morning, one fan
wondered, ``Isn't David Duval working on that record?'' Sort of.
He's won 11 _ out of his past 34. Nelson, 87, topped his drive
left. But he wasn't the first to find the new Augusta rough. That
distinction belonged to Gene Sarazen. The 97-year-old ``Squire''
took a smooth whack at a ball that never reached the fairway, but
who cared?
</P>
<P>
   Felled by heat
</P>
<P>
   The medical trucks were busy Thursday because of the heat. About
the time the temperature crested at 90 degrees, one woman who had
been sitting without shade watching drives on No. 11 keeled over in
her chair, and medical personnel carried her away on a stretcher.
With summer-like conditions predicted through the weekend, those
headed to the course should pack a few essentials along with that
badge: a brimmed hat, light-colored clothing, sunscreen and
rubber-soled shoes. Golf spikes will just make it hotter.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles flying high
</P>
<P>
   Jumbo Ozaki's eagle at the par-4 10th was the fifth on that hole
since the tournament began in 1934. Tom Lehman's eagle on the 13th
hole is his fourth at Augusta, second on that hole. Nick Price's
eagle on No. 2 is his third at the Masters. Other eagles: Lee
Janzen holed out a wedge at No. 2, and Jose Maria Olazabal
recovered from a bad drive at No. 13 with a 4-iron to 25 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Par-3 jinx lives
</P>
<P>
   Joe Durant's 5-under 22 to win Wednesday's Par-3 tournament came
back to haunt him Thursday. He made four double-bogeys in his last
four holes on the way to an 87, keeping intact an infamous record:
Nobody has ever won the Par-3 and the Masters in the same year. ``I
guess there must be something to that Par-3 jinx,'' said Durant,
making his first Masters appearance after a win in last year's
Motorola Western Open. Semi-Colin?
</P>
<P>
   After an opening 70, it was noted to Scotland's Colin
Montgomerie that his name and scores were not on the big scoreboard
near the 18th hole. ``Of course, my name's not up there,''
Montgomerie said. ``I'm the wrong nationality.''

CHINA'S PRIME MINISTER DENIES SECRETS WERE STOLEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: See also CHINA-U.S., CHINA-U.S. SCENE)  
(DW) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Spicing his denials with humor and compliments to
his American hosts, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji asserted Thursday
that China had never stolen nuclear secrets from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to make a very solemn statement here that I have
no knowledge whatsoever of any charge, of any allegation, of
espionage or the theft of nuclear technologies,'' Zhu declared.
``And I don't believe such story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the policy of China to steal so-called military
secrets from the United States,'' Zhu continued through an
interpreter, even though he speaks excellent English. ``And I don't
think there can be such problem, given the tight security measures
in the United States and advanced technology.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the sound system malfunctioned momentarily. ``It
seems that the technology with regard to this microphone is not
that advanced,'' the premier remarked to accompanying laughter.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton standing nearby and flags of both
countries on display behind the leaders, Zhu said, ``As a senior
engineer, I've been in charge of the industry in China for more
than 40 years, and I have never known any of our most advanced
technology came from the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing remarks he made last month amid suspicions that China
had been able to obtain American nuclear-weapons secrets from U.S.
laboratories during the course of joint scientific programs, Zhu
said, ``I hope you don't underestimate your own ability to keep
secrets, and don't underestimate the capability of the Chinese
people to develop their own technology.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, American intelligence experts have been
investigating the possible acquisition by China in the 1980s of the
designs of the United States' most modern nuclear warhead. While
acknowledging the seriousness of the allegations, administration
officials have taken comfort in noting that the thefts, if any,
were not committed on their watch.
</P>
<P>
   But The New York Times reported Thursday that some American
intelligence officials now believe that a second theft of data
occurred. They suspect that Chinese agents stole secrets related to
the neutron bomb, which kills with enhanced radiation, from the
United States in 1995, during the Clinton presidency. Several
agencies are investigating the possible thefts, although
administration officials say they have found no evidence that China
has produced an improved neutron bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Thursday that he would continue to decline to
comment on specific intelligence reports. But he said he had raised
the espionage issues with Zhu on Wednesday night, when the prime
minister arrived in Washington on an official visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, China is a big country with a big government, and I
can only say that America is a big country with a big government,
and occasionally things happen in this government that I don't know
about,'' the president said. ``I think it's important that we
continue the investigation and do our best to find out what
happened, and I asked for his cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Zhu said he had been asked at a welcoming luncheon
in Los Angeles how his country would celebrate the 50th anniversary
of Communist rule this fall. With a grand military review, the
prime minister replied, and perhaps the missiles will bear signs
``that they are made in China, not from the United States.''

AUGUSTA CUTS WOODS DOWN TO SIZE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Tiger Woods scored another first Thursday at
Augusta National Golf Club. A landmark moment, it was not. It was
more like a land mine.
</P>
<P>
   In 14 previous trips around the course, Woods never had posted a
score worse than a double bogey. That all changed when the
23-year-old stepped to the par-5 eighth tee and pulled his drive
into the pine trees standing sentry on the left side of the
fairway.
</P>
<P>
   The ball came to rest between two pine cones, making his second
shot tricky. Woods tried to punch the ball out into the fairway
with a 6-iron, but it hit a tree and ricocheted into a clump of
azaleas some 15 yards behind where he stood, speechless.
</P>
<P>
   Upon retrieving his voice, Woods muttered, ``This is how you
lose (expletive) golf tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, in 1997 Woods shot a 4-over-par 40 on the front nine
and went on to win the Masters, the first of golf's four majors, by
a record 12 strokes. He managed to better that horrible halfway
number by two on this day, but it was a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a one-stroke penalty for an unplayable lie, Woods'
fourth shot on eight found the fairway. He flew the green with his
fifth shot, then chipped to 15 feet and two putted for a
triple-bogey 8.
</P>
<P>
   So much for taking advantage of his prodigious length on the
hole, which Woods had played in 6 under par in four other Masters
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting mad, Woods went 2 under on the remaining 10
holes to salvage an even-par round of 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to hang in there and be patient,'' Woods said. ``In
the past when I was 2 over par I'd try and be aggressive right
away. (Today) I told myself to be patient, that I had 64 holes
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, wielding his putter like a wand, Woods made those
three extra strokes he was carrying courtesy of No. 8 disappear
with consecutive birdies at the par-3 12th, the par-5 13th and the
par-4 14th. A bogey 5 at 17 was his only hiccup on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   On pins and needles: If the players felt like they were trying
to land their approach shots on the head of a pin, there was a good
reason. The first-day pin placements were so tough, Agoura Hills
resident Steve Pate felt fortunate to escape the sixth green with a
bogey 4 after hitting what he considered a really solid tee shot.
</P>
<P>
   The pin was in the back right quadrant of the green, tucked some
10 feet behind a mound that created a waterfall effect for balls
hit with any hint of a backspin.
</P>
<P>
   Pate's tee shot landed about five feet in front of the hole and
rolled all the way down to the right front part of the green.
Pate's first putt also rolled back down to within an inch of where
he had struck it. His third stroke stayed above the hole and he
made the comeback putt for his only bogey in a round of 1-under-par
71.
</P>
<P>
   Pate was in the second threesome sent out on the course. His
early tee time was a decided advantage insofar as he was able to
finish before the sun had thoroughly baked the greens until they
were as hard as crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Great Scott: The fourth time was a charm for former UCLA golfer
Scott McCarron. In his 13th competitive round at Augusta National,
McCarron broke 70 for the first time. His 3-under-par 69 was good
for a share of the lead with Brandel Chamblee and Davis Love III.
</P>
<P>
   His play made a prophet out of former champion Fred Couples, who
had said earlier in the week that he believed McCarron had the game
to do well here.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Freddie to say that is an honor,'' said McCarron, who made
seven straight cuts to start the 1999 season before missing the two
leading up to this week. ``I'm really relaxed here and am enjoying
the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing sick: Amateur Matt Kuchar, who wowed the crowds with his
play and his personality in his 1998 Masters debut, opened with a
77. That's five shots higher than his first-round score of a year
ago but not bad for someone who had to rise from his hospital bed
to make it here.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar, 20, who has been battling influenza, spent Tuesday at a
local hospital being treated for dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I had a lot more fun and I was playing a lot
better,'' Kuchar said. ``I was in more of a fairytale world. This
year, being sick kind of took the fairytale out of it.''

SPORTS COLUMN: PAR AT THE MASTERS FOR THE PARAGUAY PRO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA , Ga. _ With birdies on the third and fourth holes,
Carlos Franco's name went up early on the Masters leader boards,
but it was a new name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is Franco?'' voices in the gallery were asking.
</P>
<P>
   Not many knew that Franco, with a bandit's mustache and a sturdy
swing, is No. 46 in the World Golf Ranking and No. 54 on the PGA
Tour money list with $221,320, mostly because of a tie for third in
last month's Honda Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Not many knew that the 33-year-old Franco halved Phil Mickelson
for the International team that routed the American pros in the
Presidents Cup matches in Australia last year, or that he had
defeated Sam Torrance in the 1993 Dunhill Cup at St. Andrews when
little Paraguay shocked Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the golfers in Masters history, the 5-foot-9-inch,
165-pound Franco of Asuncion, Paraguay, was perhaps the most
unlikely to tee off at Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   One of six sons of the greenskeeper at one of only three golf
courses in Paraguay, he grew up in his family's one-room shack with
a dirt floor and no plumbing. But he and his brothers could play
the Asuncion Golf Club course at off hours. They now are six of
only 28 golf pros in all of Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   As a barefoot youngster, Carlos was shooting par when he won a
pair of golf shoes at age 14 in a caddie tournament; he earned $3 a
loop. He fished golf balls from the ponds. He used rusted irons
until a friend gave him a set of Hogan clubs when he was 18. By
then he was watching the Masters on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Jack Nicklaus win in 1986,'' he said. ``He was an
extraordinary golfer, very aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   In a touching moment here Tuesday, Franco, practicing alone, was
on the tee of the 155-yard 12th hole when Nicklaus, riding in a
golf cart to ease his recuperation from hip surgery, stopped and
asked for Franco's 6-iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, give me the 5,'' Nicklaus said.
</P>
<P>
   With that familiar swing, the six-time Masters winner lofted a
ball onto the green. Franco applauded, then took his 8-iron and
lofted his ball onto the green.
</P>
<P>
   When Franco walked to the 12th tee Thursday after a birdie 3 at
the 11th hole to go to 4 under par, he was suddenly leading the
Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew,'' he was saying now through an interpreter. ``I was
very happy. Not nervous. I was proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco had been advised by Seve Ballesteros, the two-time
Masters winner from Spain, to aim for the middle of Augusta
National's slick greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried,'' Franco said, ``but it's not that easy.''
</P>
<P>
   After a bogey 4 at the treacherous 12th hole, he was still tied
for the lead. After a good drive at the 500-yard 15th, he had a
chance for a two-putt birdie if he hit his 5-iron on the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure if it was 4-iron or 5-iron,'' he said. ``I hit
5-iron. Hit it perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't enough club. His ball splashed into the pond in
front of the green. ``One moment, excellent,'' he said later with a
shrug. ``Next moment, accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco took a double-bogey 7 there, then bogied the short 16th
hole and finished his round at even-par 72, three strokes away from
the leaders, but the only Masters golfer to shoot the first three
letters of his country's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence,'' he said. ``I think I can
surprise here.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco has won 29 tournaments worldwide, mostly in South America
and five on the Japan tour where he earned more than $2.7 million
in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   He owns a spacious home in Asuncion for his wife, Celsa, and
their two sons, Carlos and Ramon. He also supports many family
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the PGA Tour here is much more competitive than Japan,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Franco earned his PGA Tour card by one stroke at last year's
Q-School, using his driver to putt on the five closing holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I putt with driver,'' he has said with a laugh, ``to
get people to know me.''
</P>
<P>
   In introducing himself to the Masters galleries Thursday, Franco
putted with his putter, but no introduction was necessary in
Paraguay where he was seen on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor people in Paraguay,'' he said, ``they need to see
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco referred to the recent outrage in Paraguay over the
assassination of its vice president, Luis Maria Argana, which
forced President Raul Cubas Grau to resign and flee into exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope what I do here will give the poor people in Paraguay
something to give them hope,'' Carlos Franco said. ``The poor
people need that.''

N.J. GOVERNOR SAYS SHE WILL RUN FOR U.S. SENATE IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs to add 2nd take)   (bl)  
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman said Thursday that she
plans to run for the U.S. Senate next year, raising the prospect of
a rematch with the man she ousted from the State House six years
ago, Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the state constitution forbids her to run for a
third term, Whitman said that a seat in the U.S. Senate would give
her the opportunity to continue promoting her moderate Republican
agenda, only on a different stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would give me a voice,'' Whitman said during a news
conference in Trenton. ``A place where I could keep talking about
the need for lower taxes, limited government and the fact that all
the answers don't necessarily come from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, she announced that she was forming a
fund-raising committee to begin collecting the $10 million to $12
million needed for a statewide campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Whitman's nationwide prominence as a moderate,
tax-cutting Republican, her announcement was greeted with
enthusiasm among Republicans in Washington, who feel that she
offers the party a strong chance to pick up a seat that has been
held by a Democrat, Frank Lautenberg, for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   National party leaders also said that having a well-known
candidate on the ticket next year would bolster support for the
Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she had not expected to decide whether to run for
the Senate until later in the year, but she sped up her
decision-making process after Lautenberg unexpectedly announced his
retirement in February.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she would remain in office throughout the campaign.
If she wins, state Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, a
Republican from Scotch Plains, would become acting governor for the
final year of her second term. DiFrancesco plans to run for
governor in 2001, and the role of acting governor would likely
strengthen his bid.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lautenberg's decision to retire prompted several
Democrats to consider the race, most of the attention so far has
fallen on Florio, who was defeated by Whitman by a narrow margin in
the 1993 gubernatorial election. Florio has already announced his
plans to seek the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination and has been
raising money and trying to build support for his political
comeback. But he has yet to win the support of many party leaders,
who worry that the $2.8 billion tax increase he sponsored while
governor will hurt him in a race against Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Republicans have also considered running for
Lautenberg's seat, but most are expected to step aside for Whitman.
Even so, she is expected to face a primary challenge from Murray
Sabrin, who ran for governor as a member of the Libertarian Party
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that she made the decision after she became
convinced that she could complete her second-term agenda in three
years instead of four. She noted that the state Legislature has
already agreed to move forward with her property tax rebate plan,
her initiative to preserve one million acres of farmland and other
open space, roll back auto insurance rates and deregulate the
energy industry.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Whitman filed papers Thursday formally creating a
campaign committee, she said that she would not begin actively
campaigning or talking about broader issues until sometime next
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Florio, firing his first salvo at the newly announced
candidate, said he had already begun to outline his positions and
that he would expect the governor to begin presenting her views to
voters as well.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by reporters whether she was worried about a possible
rematch with a candidate as well known as Florio, Whitman laughed
and said, ``I certainly look forward to comparing our records about
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats who have expressed interest in the seat include
Rep. Frank Pallone; Goldman Sachs co-chairman Jon Corzine; former
state party chairman B. Thomas Byrne and Cherry Hill Mayor Susan
Bass Levin.
</P>
<P>
   After her election as governor in 1993, Whitman rose to national
prominence by delivering on her campaign pledge to cut income tax
rates by 30 percent. She was occasionally mentioned as a possible
vice presidential or presidential candidate, and in 1994 was
selected to deliver the Republicans'
</P>
<P>
   televised response to the State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   But her prospects for national office were diminished after the
1994 congressional elections, when conservatives seized control of
the Republican Party and Whitman's support for abortion rights put
her at odds with some party leaders. Those prospects seemed to dim
even further after she nearly lost a re-election bid in 1997. And
in recent months she has said emphatically that she had no interest
in running for national office.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two months, as she decided whether to run for
the Senate, Whitman received a pledge from the National Republican
Senatorial Committee to help her campaign, she said. Those promises
were important to Whitman, her campaign aides said, because during
her 1990 challenge to Sen. Bill Bradley, Whitman received similar
promises, but the help never materialized and she lost a
surprisingly close race.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is a costly and complicated arena for statewide
campaigns because candidates need to reach voters by advertising in
two expensive media markets, New York and Philadelphia. Most
political analysts predict that each major party candidate will
need up to $12 million to run a competitive campaign. As an
incumbent governor, Whitman is not expected to have much difficulty
raising funds.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman is likely to share the political spotlight in the region
next year with a fellow Republican, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who is considering a U.S. Senate bid in New York. The
mayor and the governor have recently clashed on a issues ranging
from garbage to sports franchises, but met for dinner this week at
the New York mayoral residence in an effort to smooth their
differences as they plot their next political moves.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Whitman's run for Senate seems a natural progression for a woman
whose family was so steeped in Republican politics that she
attended her first national political convention at age 9. Each of
her grandfathers served as chairman of the New Jersey Republican
finance committee. Her parents, Webster Todd and Eleanor Schley,
were one of the New Jersey's most wealthy and politically connected
couples and became patrons for centrist Republicans like Thomas
Dewey, Nelson Rockefeller and Wendell Wilkie.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman was active in Republican politics while attending
Wheaton College, where she received a degree in government. She
married John Whitman, the grandson of former New York Gov. Charles
Whitman, and worked briefly for the federal Office of Economic
Opportunity and the Republican National Committee. Whitman then
left the workplace to raise her two children, Kate and Taylor, and
did not re-enter public life until they were old enough to attend
school.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman first ran for office in 1982, when she was elected
freeholder in Somerset County, the affluent countryside where she
still lives on the family's 205-acre estate, known as Pontefract.
In 1988, she was appointed president of the Board of Public
Utilities by Gov. Tom Kean, and used it as a base to build her own
statewide support. After forming Republicans for Choice, a group
that supports abortion rights, Whitman made her first attempt at
statewide office in 1990 by unsuccessfully challenging Bradley for
his U.S. Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Whitman barely averted political disaster when she won
a slim victory over a little-known challenger, Woodbridge Mayor Jim
McGreevey. McGreevey surprised many political analysts by running a
focused campaign that blamed Whitman for the state's high auto
insurance rates, and came within 25,200 votes of an upset.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years, Whitman has restored some of her
national standing by making frequent fund-raising appearances for
moderate Republicans across the country. But she is still
considered more popular nationally than within New Jersey, and in
fact has never received more than 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In her announcement Thursday, Whitman gave a preview of her
campaign themes, touting her record of tax cuts and taking credit
for the state's robust economy and low unemployment rate. She also
sounded a populist note, saying that the federal officials need to
hear the pragmatic perspective of someone who has experience
running a government outside the Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that I can make a real contribution as a former
governor to help determine that federal policy,'' she said. ``To go
there with an understanding of just what it takes to deliver. What
it takes to balance a budget in a state and deliver services to all
the people who require it. What those federal regulations _ a
slight change in a `but' or an `and' _ can mean in terms of
literally tens of thousands of dollars to needy people in our
states.''
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic leaders said they consider Governor Whitman a
formidable opponent, but welcome the chance to challenge her
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the name recognition and financial resources, but I do
believe she's vulnerable,'' said Thomas Giblin, chairman of the
state Democratic Party. ``Her record on property taxes, HMOs,
profiling by the state troopers, car insurance. When she decides to
marry up to the Republican platform, which is run by
arch-conservatives, she's going to be taking money from folks whose
philosophy is opposed to what her personal beliefs are. That ought
to be interesting.''

CONCERN GROWS THAT SERBS WILL USE ETHNIC ALBANIANS AS HUMAN SHIELDS &HT;

</HEADLINE>

 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Allied officials expressed concern Thursday that
Yugoslav forces will use ethnic Albanians trapped in Kosovo as
human shields to deter NATO's stepped-up bombing campaign against
Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the regime of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic may have closed border crossings out
of Kosovo because he planned ``to use people as human shields in
case the alliance's military action is concentrated more on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb government urged refugees to return home Thursday,
saying peace had ``prevailed'' in Kosovo and the fight against
separatists was over.
</P>
<P>
   The developments made it harder for NATO strategists to pick
bombing targets as unsettled weather returned to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at the circumstances at the time, and we'll make
sure that before we carry out our attacks that we can carry out
those attacks without collateral damage ... particularly innocent
civilian lives,'' NATO air chief David Wilby said at alliance
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials acknowledged reports that Serb forces were
planting land mines along the Yugoslav border with Albania and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's repeated contentions that ground forces were not
under consideration was brought into question by the assertion of
Canada's defense minister, Art Eggleton, who said Western military
officials were ``looking at other options as to where ground troops
might be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Eggleton acknowledged the original NATO plan was to use ground
troops only after a peace deal was struck with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if that's not going to be possible, and I think as we see
with each day the Milosevic government is not indicating they're
favorable to doing that, then certainly NATO has to look at other
options,'' Eggleton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration insisted that a turn to ground troops
was not in the plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe our present strategy will work if we can keep the
allies with it,'' Clinton said during a news conference with
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen expressed a similar view on
a quick trip to Europe, telling pilots at the Aviano air base in
Italy: ``We will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now starting to see this air campaign really take root
and start to go after those who are on the ground inflicting the
kind of suffering we've seen upon the Kosovar Albanians,'' Cohen
said in an NBC interview. ``So it will go on as long as
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who met Wednesday with representatives of the 19 NATO
nations, said: ``They are solid and determined to carry this
mission out to its completion. ... This resolve has only been
strengthened by the exposure of Mr. Milosevic's barbarity.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO air assault drew strong support from European Union
foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the face of extreme and criminally irresponsible policies
... the use of the severest measures, including military action,
has been both necessary and warranted,'' the ministers said in a
statement adopted during a meeting in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   The latest turn in the Serb oppression of Kosovar Albanians came
Wednesday when, after weeks of driving displaced families toward
the border, Milosevic's military started to seal off crossing
points.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson told a Pentagon briefing about
``anecdotal rumors and reports of human shields which we have not
been able to verify. It's a miserable tactic for anybody to use in
a wartime scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a planning director for the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said that more than a half-million ethnic Albanians
remain in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, as we do our planning, mission planning, that is always
put into the calculus of everything we do,'' Wald said.
</P>
<P>
   Laying out the bombing campaign is made more difficult because
allied strategists are uncertain where the Kosovar Albanians headed
for the border have gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what has happened to these people who seem to
have been forced back inside Kosovo,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea
said. ``We do not want to see a second humanitarian crisis inside
Kosovo itself with all of these displaced people without shelter,
food or any kind of assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, spokesman Jamie Rubin said Serb forces
``appear to be denying them the opportunity to cross the border and
receive humanitarian assistance and (are) trying to force them back
into a wasteland with virtually no food, water or shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said NATO forces flew almost 400 combat missions over
Yugoslavia on Wednesday, with all allied planes returning to base.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wilson cited ``strong evidence'' of Serb supply problems and
fuel disruption.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo said his nation has
granted NATO authority to operate from its territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave to NATO ... all the rights to use our harbors, our
airspace and to control everything in Albania,'' Milo said in a
EuroNews interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration announced a new shipment of 51 metric
tons of food rations for Kosovo refugees in Macedonia and Albania.
The shipment, organized by the U.S. Agency for International
Development, will contain enough high-protein biscuits for 647,000
meals.

FOR THREE TIED FOR THE LEAD IN THE MASTERS, EVERYTHING'S COMING UP
AZALEAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ The first round of the Masters was everything
that Brandel Chamblee imagined, everything that Scott McCarron
hoped for, everything that an experienced major winner like Davis
Love III expected.
</P>
<P>
   For those three players, who were the clubhouse leaders at
three-under-par 69 when play was suspended because of darkness,
Thursday was a pleasant stroll through the azaleas, a comforting
way to start the year's first major.
</P>
<P>
   But they were fortunate. For many others, playing Augusta
National Golf Club was even more of a mind game than usual. The pin
placements were difficult, more like Sunday than Thursday. There
was a 90-minute rain delay that broke the momentum of 33 players
who were still on the course. There was just enough of a breeze to
alter some shots. There was the unknown of playing a different
Augusta, a course that has been lengthened on three holes and
toughened with 1]-inch-high rough to test the skill, patience and
strategy of the world's greatest players.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that mission accomplished. Only 17 of the 84 players
who completed the first round broke par, and many took nose dives
on the back nine. David Duval, cruising at three under par through
nine holes, made bogeys at No. 12, No. 13 and No. 14. When the
normally unflappable Duval becomes undone, you know this is not a
picnic. While Duval (one under par through 17 holes) and Tiger
Woods (par 72) remained in contention on a tightly bunched leader
board, by the time this Masters ends, many players may feel more
suited for a straight jacket than a green jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting 69s and avoiding costly mistakes that sabotaged many
rounds, Love, Chamblee and McCarron were atop the leader board when
play was stopped because of darkness. First-round play will resume
at 8:15 Friday morning. Twelve players were unable to finish the
first round, including Nick Price, who was three under par through
17 holes. Meanwhile, seven players were at 70, just one stroke off
the lead - defending champion Mark O'Meara, Justin Leonard, Jose
Maria Olazabal, Jeff Sluman, Lee Janzen Andrew Magee and Colin
Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   While Love and Price are tested veterans, sitting atop the
leader board at the Masters was new territory for Chamblee and
McCarron. Chamblee is playing in his first Masters, but he handled
his first round like a relaxed tourist, soaking up the atmosphere
and hitting superb shots along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard horror stories about how much the course changed from
practice rounds to tournament rounds, so I didn't know what to
expect,'' said Chamblee, a 36-year-old tour veteran who won his
first event at last year's Greater Vancouver Open. ``I didn't know
how I was going to handle the first day.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee handled it just fine. He laughed about his first visit
to the course on Saturday, when he drove down Magnolia Lane for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up on Washington Street and almost went past the
entrance,'' Chamblee said. ``I had my PGA money clip and started to
show the guy. He said, `I don't need to see that.' He didn't ask
for ID. I thought, `Man, I'm going to ask my buddies to give that a
shot.'''
</P>
<P>
   Love and Price do not need identification at Augusta, but
neither player has ever won the Masters. Love has come close,
finishing second to Ben Crenshaw in 1995. But after winning the
Professional Golfers Association Championship in 1997, Love
faltered in majors last year, including a tie for 33d at last
year's Masters. Love came into this season determined to be a
factor in majors again. Thursday was a good start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was especially anxious for this one,'' said Love, who shot a
37 on the front nine, then recovered to shoot 32 on the back, with
birdies at No. 10, No. 11, No. 16 and No. 17. ``I haven't been
playing as well as I would like, but there's a lot of reasons. We
could talk about it for a long, long time. But I do feel like I
should win more. But I bet there's 100 guys who feel they should
win more, too.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron, whose last victory was at the 1997 BellSouth Classic,
is only in the field because he finished 16th at Augusta last year,
and the top 24 finishers earn spots for the following year. But
something about the Masters brings out the best in McCarron, whose
worst finish in three starts is a tie for 30th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a mystical place for me,'' said McCarron, a
33-year-old native of California, who took advantage of his length
off the tee to make five birdies, offset by two bogeys. ``For some
reason, I get here and drive the ball farther and feel more
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   But some players seemed powerless to avoid making costly
mistakes, including Woods, who made a triple-bogey 8 at the par-5
No. 8. The rough made it harder to spin some shots into the green,
but the famous ultra-fast greens at Augusta were the major problem,
coupled with difficult pin placements that made it dangerous for
players to attack.
</P>
<P>
   The back nine was particularly treacherous. Phil Mickelson, who
was two under par through 12 holes, hit into the pond at No. 15,
which led to a double-bogey, followed by bogeys at No. 17 and No.
18 that left him with a bitter 74. Even Duval, the world's
top-ranked player and pre-tournament favorite with four victories
this year, was not immune. After a bogey at No. 12, he pulled his
tee shot at No. 13 into the creek, then after the rain delay, he
missed a putt for par at No. 13, followed by another bogey at No.
14. A great approach shot at No. 17 led to an easy birdie putt that
seemed to get Duval back on track, and he will finish No. 18 on
Friday, followed by a second round that promises to be interesting,
with so many top players near the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of good players out there apart from
Duval and Woods, and they know that as well,'' said Montgomerie, an
excellent player still in search of his first major. ``It will be
interesting to see who's up there at the end. Very interesting.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ A businessman has given up a two-year effort to offer
the first commercial spaceflights aboard a passenger rocket
designed to be launched from Gulf waters off Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   The bid included creation of a Civilian Astronauts Corps whose
members would pay $100 each and could then purchase rides on the
proposed six-passenger rocket for $5,500. Plans for the first
flight of what came to be billed the Mayflower expedition slipped
from July 4, to October to early next year as efforts to raise
funds to build the rocket through advanced ticket sales and
advertising flagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've decided to close things up. It just wasn't working,''
Harry Dace, director of the Civilian Astronauts Corps, said
Thursday. ``We just simply were not getting enough participants and
enough responses from potential advertisers to keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, he began returning the nearly $200,000 collected
from 62 potential passengers and placed in an escrow account, Dace
said. Some had paid all and some only part of their $5,500. He's
also returning $12,000 in membership dues collected from 120 people
who joined the civilian astronauts but had not pre-purchased a
seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is getting every penny back,'' Dace said.
</P>
<P>
   Dace recruited Jim Akkerman, a retired NASA propulsion and space
systems engineer, to design a passenger rocket through a company
called Advent Launch Services. When they unveiled their plan in
early 1997, they envisioned development costs of $8 million to $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   Dace planned to raise the funds for a seven-story, reusable
rocket fueled by natural gas and liquid oxygen through the sale of
2,000 memberships in their astronaut corps with passenger
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the idea was so good that people would love it and
come running to jump on board,'' Dace lamented. ``How wrong we
were.''
</P>
<P>
   The project received prominent news coverage in Houston, and
ultimately was featured in national and overseas stories. Though
meager, the passenger pool included adventurous souls from a dozen
countries, including Sri Lanka, New Zealand and South Africa.

<P>
   The two men believed they could raise the funding they needed in
18 months, then spend another year producing and testing their
rocket. But no hardware was ever fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan was to duplicate for civilians what the late Alan
Shepard, America's first space traveler, did in 1961. Shepard's
Mercury capsule soared to an altitude of 115 miles atop a Redstone
rocket before separating and parachuting to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Dace hoped the plan would capture the $10 million X Prize, an
international competition intended to foster space travel and
tourism. The prize will go to the first private citizens who manage
to launch three passengers to an altitude of at least 62 miles and
repeat the feat within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been as excited about a program as I was about
this. I've been running on adrenaline for two years,'' Dace said.
``I've done everything possible to make this work, but it's not in
the cards.''

   TBILISI, Georgia _ In one of the most sweeping attacks on
corruption in the former Soviet Union, most of Georgia's judges are
to be forcibly retired next month and replaced by new ones chosen
by competitive examination.
</P>
<P>
   Like many former Soviet republics, Georgia is plagued by
corruption, which has crippled attempts at political change and led
to widespread complaints that things were better under Communism.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers who support President Eduard Shevardnadze fear that
this resentment could lead to gains for pro-Communist parties in
parliamentary elections set for November.
</P>
<P>
   So they have taken a series of radical measures. In December
they hired an American company to distribute electric power here in
the capital, taking over from a state agency widely viewed as
corrupt. They plan to turn the tasks of the customs service,
traditionally a rich source of bribes and kickbacks, over to a
foreign company. All senior officials have been required to file
declarations of their net worth.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these steps is as potentially important as the move
on the judiciary. Most of the country's nearly 350 judges were
named in the Communist era. Few have a grasp of new legal codes
modeled after those in the United States and Europe; all are widely
seen as part of a system ruled by favoritism and payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a new commercial code, new civil procedure laws, new
criminal laws, new tax laws and a whole new structure for our legal
system,'' said the minister of justice, Lado Chanturio, a former
law professor whom Shevardnadze appointed last year to direct the
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't put this system into effect with judges who are in
many cases ignorant and corrupt. Our new judges will be educated
and qualified, which is something very new and unusual in this part
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the government invited lawyers who aspired to judicial
careers to take an examination composed of essay and
multiple-choice questions. It was drawn up with the help of the
American Bar Association, printed in California and shipped to
Tbilisi in a German diplomatic pouch to assure security.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 lawyers took the exam, and 270, many in their
early 30s, passed. Most sitting judges either refused or failed the
exam.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the 270 new judges, along with several dozen
incumbents who passed, took their oaths of office and a second oath
pledging never to take a bribe. And Mikhail Saakashvili, the former
New York lawyer turned majority leader of the Georgian Parliament,
who helped design the new system, said that the judges' salaries,
which start at about $350 a month, will soon be tripled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to create an island of totally uncorrupted
people who can serve as an example to all of society,'' Saakashvili
said. ``Even before the new system goes into effect, we can see
that it's working, because lots of people are not going to court
and waiting for the new judges to take office.''
</P>
<P>
   The new judges are to begin work on May 15, but some outgoing
judges say they will refuse to vacate their offices. Several
citizens' groups, however, have threatened to physically remove
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutors will be our next target,'' Saakashvili said.
``They're already organizing resistance.''

KY-AIRPORT-RELOCATE-2, 4-08 -- Mayor Fred Williams of Minor Lane
Heights on the 287-acre site where residents will move into new

   (NYT32) MINOR LANE HEIGHTS, Ky. -- April 8, 1999 --
KY-AIRPORT-RELOCATE-1, 4-08 -- Rather than break up lifelong
friendships, residents of Minor Lane Heights told the Louisville
airport authorities that they would agree to be moved out of the
path of jet noise only if they could stay together. ``We've never
encountered this big a deal, a community making a decision to move
this way,'' says Stan Lou, an FAA official. (Mark Lyons/New York

Some of the Hispanic uninsured in Denver seek out community health
centers like the Tepeyac Clinic, where Sylvia Garcia brings her
daughter, Darling, for a recent physical. The lack of professional
health care here sustains a thriving, informal system of
alternative care built on religion, tradition and home remedies.
Often it works. But just as often, it delays and impedes crucial
care. (Kevin Moloney/New York Times Photo)

Some of the Hispanic uninsured in Denver turn to folk remedies like
those sold at this specialty store. While Hispanics - 64 percent of
whom are of Mexican origin - appear to be gaining in economic and
political strength, their lack of insurance coverage and ready
access to professional care is costly in both the demands they
eventually make on emergency rooms and in public health. (Kevin

Don't be fooled by that air of insouciance: Beavers, like this one
in the Tidal Basin on Thursday, are harming Washington's cherry
trees. Park Service officials, who originally suspected they were
dealing with one beaver, are now fairly sure there are two. ``We
got a reliable sighting this morning, two of them in the Tidal
Basin,'' says Earle Kittleman, a spokesman for the Park Service.

KY-AIRPORT-RELOCATE-1, 4-08 -- Rather than break up lifelong

Some of the Hispanic uninsured in Denver seek out community health
centers like the Tepeyac Clinic, where Sylvia Garcia brings her
daughter, Darling, for a recent physical. The lack of professional
health care here sustains a thriving, informal system of
alternative care built on religion, tradition and home remedies.
Often it works. But just as often, it delays and impedes crucial
care. (Kevin Moloney/New York Times Photo)

Some of the Hispanic uninsured in Denver turn to folk remedies like
those sold at this specialty store. While Hispanics - 64 percent of
whom are of Mexican origin - appear to be gaining in economic and
political strength, their lack of insurance coverage and ready
access to professional care is costly in both the demands they
eventually make on emergency rooms and in public health. (Kevin

Don't be fooled by that air of insouciance: Beavers, like this one
in the Tidal Basin on Thursday, are harming Washington's cherry
trees. Park Service officials, who originally suspected they were
dealing with one beaver, are now fairly sure there are two. ``We
got a reliable sighting this morning, two of them in the Tidal
Basin,'' says Earle Kittleman, a spokesman for the Park Service.

Pigott-Smith as Larry Slade in the new revival of ``The Iceman
Cometh,'' which opened Thursday night at the Brooks Atkinson

9 MEN PLEAD GUILTY TO KILLING HUNDREDS OF BIRDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine men from sport-fishing communities along the eastern shore
of Lake Ontario pleaded guilty Thursday to charges stemming from
killing more than 1,000 federally protected birds last summer,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings, which killed hundreds of double-crested
cormorants _ both adults and nestlings _ and left dozens of
nestlings to starve to death, are considered by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service to be one of the largest mass killings ever of a
species protected by federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   A 10th man pleaded guilty to being an accessory to the crime by
hiding shotguns used to kill the birds. The plea agreements,
negotiated over the last few weeks, were entered in U.S. District
Court in Syracuse, said Thomas J. Maroney, the U.S. attorney for
the Northern District of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The five men who pleaded guilty to the most serious charges
agreed to serve six months of home confinement, monitored with
electronic ankle bracelets. They each agreed to pay a $2,500 fine
and to contribute $5,000 to the National Fish and Wildlife
Foundation, a private group, which will use the money to restore
wetlands around Lake Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   But several of the men, who are professional fishing guides,
have said all along that they believed they were justified in
shooting the fish-eating birds to save their livelihood. They feel
vindicated, they say, by the state's recent decision to cull the
cormorant flock to protect sport fish.
</P>
<P>
   James R. McGraw, a defense lawyer in the case, said the state
plans proved that the killing of the birds was appropriate. Several
of the defendants were reached by telephone, but declined to be
interviewed until their final sentences are handed down in August.
</P>
<P>
   The cormorants are not endangered, but are protected by the
81-year-old Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits hundreds of
species that migrate across international borders from being killed
or harassed.
</P>
<P>
   Their numbers have risen sharply in recent decades, and the
birds, which can each gulp several pounds of fish a day, are
considered pests by anglers in the Great Lakes and catfish farmers
in their winter range along the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Before the shootings last year, several of the defendants in the
case had threatened to cull a fast-growing colony of the birds on
Little Galloo Island, which is about five miles from Henderson, a
lakeside town where dozens of charter boats dock and eight of the
10 defendants live.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the community blamed the cormorants for a recent
sharp decline in stocks of smallmouth bass, a popular game fish.
The economy of Henderson, which is largely built on bass fishing by
tourists, has seen a simultaneous downturn, as anglers have headed
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A study released in December by New York environmental
scientists confirmed a link between the growth in the cormorant
colony and falling fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors and federal and state wildlife officials said
Thursday that there was no excuse for the outburst of violence
against the birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vigilantism, and especially this kind of cruel killing by
individuals, has no place in resolving a complex population
issue,'' said Craig A. Benedict, an assistant U.S. attorney who
helped prosecute the case.
</P>
<P>
   The pleas filed in court described the systematic nature of the
shootings: On July 27, the five men facing the most serious
punishments, David McCrea, Ronald Ditch, Mitchell Franz, Louis Cook
and John Kabot, took McCrea's boat to the island, where they split
into groups and began shooting birds from the boat and the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Ditch and McCrea are guides whose families have made a living
from sport fishing for several generations. Cook owns a marina.
</P>
<P>
   After the July 27 shooting, according to the plea agreements,
the men handed their shotguns to Rex Allen, who was in another boat
and who did not shoot any birds. Several of the guns were later
hidden by another man, Angelo Aversa.
</P>
<P>
   The mass shooting was discovered when state biologists visited
the island two days later as part of a continuing study of the
birds' diet. They found dozens of fledglings starving to death,
sitting among piles of carcasses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the same plea agreement, Aversa and Ditch's three sons _
Andrew, David and Thomas _ admitted to shooting cormorants in
separate incidents last year along with the other five men. They
have agreed to serve three months of home confinement and pay
smaller fines. Allen, who never shot at the birds, will pay a fine
and be placed on probation.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw, a lawyer for Ditch and his sons, said they stood by
their actions, but were willing to accept punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they got involved, they knew there was going to be a
consequence,'' McGraw said. ``They weighed the good and the bad and
decided it was appropriate to do. When the bureaucracy sits back
and lets a community die and an industry die, I don't think that's
vigilantism.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation is
planning to go ahead with its own culling of the Little Galloo
Island colony, under a permit that is expected to be issued by
federal wildlife officials in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   State biologists plan to trap and kill 300 adult birds and dip
the cormorants' eggs in mineral oil and return them to nests. This
practice suffocates the embryos, but the parent birds continue to
roost and thus are not prompted to breed a second time. The goal is
to reduce the colony from 6,000 nesting pairs to about 1,500 in
five years, according to the state proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The men are to be sentenced Aug. 11 by Magistrate Judge Gary L.
Sharpe, and will not be confined to their homes until September.
They are not prohibited from fishing on the lake this summer, said
Benedict, the assistant U.S. attorney.

IRAQ REJECTS PANELS' EFFORTS TO END IMPASSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq has angrily rejected the recommendations
of three special panels that have tried to find a solution to the
diplomatic impasse over Iraq on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said Iraq's blistering response made it clear
that Baghdad would not accept any further arms inspections unless
economic sanctions imposed after its defeat in the 1991 Persian
Gulf War were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The net result of the recommendations is disappointing''
because they ``fall short of the goal, which should have been
putting an end to the prolonged regime of sanctions,'' Iraq wrote
in response to three reports issued last week by Celso Amorim,
Brazil's representative to the United Nations, who was the chairman
of all three panels.
</P>
<P>
   The panels' conclusions not only provide ``the enemies of Iraq
with the pretext for future aggression,'' Baghdad said; they would
infringe Iraq's territorial sovereignty and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a position,'' the statement declared, ``will never be
accepted by the government of Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   The three inquiries were set up in January to seek compromises
that would permit arms inspections to resume, improve the health
and welfare of Iraqis and resolve the fate of more than 600 people
who disappeared after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said Iraq's defiant rejection of the findings
puts Russia, China and France, the permanent members who have
argued most forcefully for an end to the sanctions, in a
politically difficult position. ``Iraq's most vocal advocates now
have a big problem,'' said a senior American official. ``Iraq
clearly doesn't want to cooperate, and we intend to make that
noncompliance and noncooperation the major issue.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Western diplomats said, Richard Butler, the
executive chairman of the special commission charged with disarming
Iraq, decided once again not to provoke a fight within the Council
by trying to attend Security Council deliberations on Friday on the
future of his agency.
</P>
<P>
   Sergey Lavrov, Russia's representative, vowed Thursday to bar
Butler from the Council's discussions on Friday, as he did on
Wednesday. Butler agreed on Wednesday to send in his place his
American deputy, Charles Duelfer, after Lavrov warned that unless
Butler were barred, he would not enter the room.
</P>
<P>
   According to associates and friends, Butler decided that
provoking a fight over his presence would only distract the Council
from the real issue: Iraq's unwillingness to disarm and to comply
with the Council's resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have argued that Council
resolutions require Iraq to disarm itself of unconventional weapons
and meet its other commitments before sanctions are lifted. Russia
and China have argued, by contrast, that sanctions are no longer
warranted because most questions surrounding Iraq's past weapons
programs have been answered.
</P>
<P>
   Amorim tried to strike a balance, arguing that a reinforced
long-term monitoring system could both answer questions about
Iraq's past programs and monitor future ones. While recommending
that steps be taken to get more food and medicine to Iraq, he did
not urge that sanctions be lifted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Iraq also repeated reports that the United States has used
inspection missions and the monitors' field office in Bahrain to
spy on President Saddam Hussein and select targets for American air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly unnerved by such allegations, Bahrain, another Security
Council member, has asked Secretary-General Kofi Annan for public
assurances that the monitors are not using their base there to spy
or for any purposes other than disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be assured publicly, as we have been in private,
that things have been done according to the United Nation's
resolutions,'' said Jassim Buallay, Bahrain's representative. ``We
don't want our facilities to be used for anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   In another development Thursday, American officials and
diplomats confirmed that the United States had asked Annan to help
set up meetings with Libya to clarify what Tripoli must do to
persuade the Council to lift sanctions imposed in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Libya surrendered two men charged with downing Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, enabling Washington to abandon
its longstanding prohibition on direct contacts with Tripoli,
officials said.

SCULLY ADEPT AT ADAPTING

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During the past 50 years, those promoters and
networks who run baseball have tried to improve the game. It's been
an all-out assault on the senses.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasts use more mini cameras, louder whirling graphics,
microphones crammed into anything that's not moving, and ad nauseam
replays. The stadiums have become carnival grounds where a game
happens to be taking place.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not even get started on Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   But then there's Vin Scully, like a candle, somehow bringing a
sense of calm to everything.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think it'd be the other way around: Baseball should move
toward preserving its past rather than tweaking its future.

<P>
   Not really, says Scully, who begins his second half-century not
with just the same sport but with the (begin ital)same team(end
ital). As much as he is a link to the past, he wants to have a
future in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've noticed is something that looks like an out-and-out
appeal _ a drive if you will _ to get young fans,'' the Dodgers'
Hall of Fame play-by-play man said. ``And today's youngsters, I
guess studies have shown they have the attention span of 30 seconds
with the combination of push-button radio and remote control. And
they love noise _ the louder the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in ballparks all over the country, they play the most
raucous rock and roll _ even when the park is empty. Naturally,
when you're in the marketing business or controlling a network, you
know you've got the older people, but you also want the young ones.
So you make it loud _ crash, boom, bam....''
</P>
<P>
   Scully paused as only Scully can do _ to make the story better
and to stop himself from sounding like some crotchety baseball fan
pining for the good old days. He broke into a huge smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if that's what kids want and it brings young fans in, go to
it. And I just go with the flow. Maybe I don't like all the pizzaz.
But I understand, or at least I think I do. I would feel much worse
if they changed the game. But the packaging, the wrapping... that's
another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the secret for me has been to accept the change.
Yesterday is gone. Just like all those years at Vero Beach (the
Dodgers' spring-training site in Florida). That's where I connect
to this team so much more than in any other way. But it's
yesterday. They can always move the pictures to a new place. You
have to keep adjusting to change.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, sharing a press-box microphone with Red Barber
and Connie Desmond, there was this 22-year-old still living with
his mom, step-dad and sister in a fifth-floor walk-up apartment in
the Bronx. He was a year out of Fordham University (also in that
borough).
</P>
<P>
   Scully had been hired just months earlier by Branch Rickey to
replace Ernie Harwell, who moved across town to call games for the
New York Giants. Barber recommended Scully based on a
Maryland-Boston College football game Vin did for CBS Radio while
freezing on the roof of Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   On April 18, 1950, the Brooklyn Dodgers opened the season with a
9-1 loss at Ebbets Field to the Philadelphia Phillies. Robin
Roberts pitched a complete game against Don Newcombe, who came out
after the second inning. Jackie Robinson batted cleanup and played
second base.
</P>
<P>
   Scully admits he remembers nothing from the game he broadcast
over WHM in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thoroughly intimidated and scared to death,'' is the
best his mind can do for him. ``My attitude then was I'd go to
ballpark like a bad hitter who was going up to the plate saying, `I
don't want to strike out,' rather than `Get a base hit.' I was
thinking, `God, please don't let me make a mistake.'''
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, Scully was as much a TV broadcaster as a
radio man. In 1950, the Dodgers did all 77 home games for
WPIX-Channel 11. A few seasons later, they added 25 road games.
</P>
<P>
   And after Game 6 of the 1954 World Series, Scully found himself
really on his own _ Barber, upset over how little money he received
for doing the Series, went to work for the New York Yankees with
Mel Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the move to Los Angeles in '58 and the boom of
transistor radios from fans who brought them to games at the
Coliseum to help them follow what was going on way down on the
field. It became Scully's medium.
</P>
<P>
   He not only introduced an entire city to big-league baseball,
but he had a captive audience _ so much so that when the team moved
over to Dodger Stadium, owner Walter O'Malley didn't put (begin
ital)any(end ital) home games on TV for years.
</P>
<P>
   Scully has come a long way to his 50th season _ a family-owned
team now a Fox-owned team that will be on TV home and away more
than 130 times in 1999. Scully will do as many of those games as he
can handle, and you'll hear less and less of him on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   That's progress?
</P>
<P>
   It's an adjustment that others of his era have had to make,
moving from radio, which was the dominant medium, to another,
television, to the cusp of another, the Internet, to broadcast the
sport. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone, Scully, 72, marvels at how octogenarian Chick
Hearn has made it through it all to be doing games for the Lakers
in his 38th year with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously loves it and it obviously makes him happy,''
Scully said of Hearn, trying to figure out his secret for
longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt a man's job almost _ almost _ is the man.
There's so-and-so the doctor, or the lawyer... it's so much a part
of you. I think when you give it up, you lose something maybe not
in the public eye, but your own self worth is challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I don't like the idea of playing golf every day. I
found that out during the strike of '94. That's when I knew I
couldn't just walk away from this.''
</P>
<P>
   With no guarantee of calling Dodgers games for another 50 years,
what will Scully be doing five or 10 years from now? His current
contract keeps him here three more years, through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, it's a question.... I mean, as long as I enjoy it
and I'm healthy enough to do the job, the enthusiam is honest, the
crowd roar brings the goose bumps, I'll probably keep doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to turn the engine off after all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Scully paused again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that old story: If you want to make God smile, tell him
(begin ital)your(end ital) plans.'' &QL;

   WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
_The History Channel _ that's up the cable menu between ESPN and
MTV, grouped with the other channels that make you think _ has
sneaked in a block of sports stuff tonight worthy of more than just
a yawn and a click over to the Lakers game. Start with ``Golf:
Links in Time'' (6 p.m.), a two-hour documentary on the sport.
Next, the episode of ``Modern Marvels'' (8 p.m.) is a look at how
sports technology has advanced. Then on ``In Search of History'' (9
p.m.), it's a review of the first Olympic Games. The three-show
cycle repeats at 10 p.m. &QL; 
_ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball telecast, which this week features
the first of two straight appearances by the Disney Angels, will
break out a new version of ``Bat Track.'' It's the graphic inspired
by Joe Morgan that shows viewers how the immediate bat speed and
its relationship to pitch speed results in putting the ball in
play. By the way, ESPN plans for later this season include a
strike-zone graphic that'll attempt to provide with even more
precision how a pitch is a ball or strike based on the rule book.
The umps will love that one. &QL; 
_An episode of ``The Simpsons'' re-airs tonight (Channel 11, 6:30
p.m.) that's got to be sports time-capsule material _ remember the
one when Mr. Burns uses big-league ringers on the company softball
team, and Darryl Strawberry, Wade Boggs and Mike Scioscia lend
their voices? And Strawberry cries when the fans taunt him? And...
aw, just watch it. Again. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
_Those new Dodgers home-game starting times _ 7:10 p.m. instead of
7:05 p.m. and 1:10 p.m. instead of 1:05 p.m. _ have (begin
ital)absolutely(end ital) nothing to do with cramming a few more
commercials in on the front side of the TV telecast. &QL; 
_And as for why the Dodgers are playing an odd-start 4:35 p.m.
Saturday _ Fox Sports West 2 already had the Clippers-Portland game
locked into the 7:30 p.m. hole, so in order to televise the game,
the early start was necessary. Yup, the (begin ital)Dodgers(end
ital) are bumped for the (begin ital)Clippers(end ital). &QL; 
_How does a Dodgers (begin ital)exhibition(end ital) game draw a
better rating than the season opener? &QL; 
_There are approximately 547 TV sportscasters who you could at one
time or another believe were capable of fabricating a
story/twisting the truth/pumping up an otherwise dull yarn to draw
attention to their network. Fox Sports News anchor Keith Olbermann
isn't one of them. &QL; 
_Sean McDonough on the 16th hole. &QL; 
_It's unfortunate KTLA Channel 5's Stu Nahan (yeah, we thought he
was retired, too) feels he needs to spend good quality
advertising-supported airtime to tell newspaper editors who to hire
to cover their beats. On the other hand, most of the city never saw
``A Moment With Stu'' last Sunday in the first place, or will watch
this Sunday when he says he's going to apologize. By the way, nice
jacket, Stu. &QL;

ODDSMAKER HAS A FIELD DAY FOR THE BLUE GRASS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Fla., La., Dubai)   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ The 75th running of the Blue Grass Stakes, the
Eastern finals for the Kentucky Derby, drew one of its most closely
matched fields Thursday when eight colts were entered led by
Wondertross, Vicar and Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   They were so close that five of the eight horses were rated at
odds between 5-2 and 9-2 in the early line set by Mike Battaglia,
the oddsmaker at Keeneland Race Course. They will run a mile and
one-eighth for a purse of $750,000 and a chance to advance to the
Kentucky Derby three weeks later against the best in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Grass will be the centerpiece of a racing tripleheader
on Saturday, with 26 horses competing in three stakes at three
tracks: eight in Kentucky in the Blue Grass, 11 in the Wood
Memorial at Aqueduct in New York and seven in the Arkansas Derby at
Oaklawn Park. The best of the bunch will move on to Churchill Downs
to contest the Kentucky Derby on May 1 against other prime
3-year-olds, led by General Challenge and Prime Timber, who ran
first and second in the Santa Anita Derby last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be favored, but it doesn't put you in the
winner's circle,'' said Jerry Bailey, the leading jockey in the
country and the rider of Wondertross. ``He made a tremendous effort
in the Florida Derby, made up 15 lengths and lost by a nose. But
that's Nick Zito's style. He keeps improving them up to the
Kentucky Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Zito, the winner of the Kentucky Derby in 1991 with Strike the
Gold and in 1994 with Go for Gin, observed that ``horses seem to
thrive in Kentucky in the springtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Wondertross, he said: ``His coat is shiny. He seems happy.
He's a great horse. But Vicar beat him in the Florida Derby by a
nose, and Vicar can go forward, too. My hope is that Wondertross
stays the same as he is now, and he'll be at his peak for the
Kentucky Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``horses don't know the odds.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds were so close on the morning line that fractions made
the difference. Wondertross, a son of Chief's Crown and owned by
William J. Condren and George Steinbrenner, was made the favorite
at 5-2. But on his mathematical heels at 3-1 was Vicar, who nosed
him out in the Florida Derby. Cat Thief, third in the Florida
Derby, and Menifee were at 4-1, with Lemon Drop Kid at 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberlite Pipe, who took the Louisiana Derby last month, and
Pineaff, who outran Menifee in the Tampa Bay Derby two weeks ago,
were both quoted at 15-1. At 30-1 is Prado's Landing, the first
arrival from the stable of horses owned by Sheik Mohammed
al-Maktoum of Dubai on the Persian Gulf. If Prado's Landing were to
run a strong race, he would lend instant credibility to his Dubai
stablemates, Worldly Manner and Aljabr, who are booked into the
Kentucky Derby without a prep race.
</P>
<P>
   In the draw for the Blue Grass, not much importance was being
placed on geography. Pineaff drew the rail with Vicar to his
immediate right. In the middle came Kimberlite Pipe in the No. 3
slot, then Prado's Landing and Lemon Drop Kid. On the outside, Cat
Thief will start in the No. 6 hole in the gate with Wondertross in
No. 7 and Menifee in the last stall.
</P>
<P>
   As for East-West rivalry, D. Wayne Lukas has cast a vote for Cat
Thief, a son of Storm Cat, who has been running second or third in
the major Florida stakes recently and has done everything except
win.

 &HT;    Researcher: As growth rises along Florida cost, so will costs of
hurricane damage
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Andrew was in living color.
</P>
<P>
   The great storms from earlier this century are found only in
fading snapshots, fading clippings, the fading memories of elderly
survivors from a more sparsely developed Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But if those storms were to strike today, they would hammer a
Florida of 15 million people, gleaming megalopolises and coastlines
packed shoulder-to-shoulder with luxury high-rises.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting for how Florida has changed, those storms would do
damage on the order of Hurricane Andrew, an unnerving prospect for
the future, hurricane researcher Christopher W. Landsea told the
National Hurricane Conference on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers studied the economic impact of the century's most
ferocious storms as if they had hit the United States today.
Adjusting for inflation, growth and increased property values, they
found that seven of the 11 costliest storms and 13 of the top 30
were storms that hit Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list: the great 1926 storm, which would cause an
estimated $80 billion in damage today. It was almost as strong as
Andrew and as big as Hugo. And unlike Andrew, which made landfall
in Homestead, the 1926 hurricane hit downtown Miami head-on.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew was second. It cost $26 billion when it hit in 1992. Just
seven years later, its impact would be $36 billion, the study
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The 1928 hurricane, which drowned up to 3,000 in the Glades, was
ranked seventh, at $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Colorado State University hurricane soothsayer
William Gray on Wednesday updated his annual forecast by saying
he'll stick to his December prediction of 14 named storms _
tropical storms or hurricanes _ with nine of those becoming
hurricanes, and four becoming major hurricanes, with winds of more
than 111 mph. Gray never says where or whether storms will strike
land, although he has said the odds of a hurricane hitting the U.S.
East Coast, including all of Florida, is three times above normal
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing awareness and preparation, better building codes and
the advent of mass communications have dropped hurricane deaths
from thousands per year at the turn of the century to 100 a year
now, but property damages have risen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, people continue to migrate to America's coastline,
especially Florida's, Landsea told weather researchers and
emergency managers.
</P>
<P>
   Applying his formula to history, Landsea contended the United
States has a one-in-six chance of suffering a storm with more than
$10 billion in damages, and every year, ``the stakes rise due to
inexorable coastal population growth and development.''
</P>
<P>
   Already about 110 million people _ nearly half of all Americans
_ live in a 5-mile-wide coastal strip that accounts for only 10
percent of the nation's mass. It's expected to rise to
three-fourths of Americans during the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   More people live in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, according
to the 1990 census, than lived in all 109 coastal counties from
Texas to Virginia in 1930, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Major hurricanes make up only one-fifth of all tropical storms
but account for 85 percent of the damage. And while peninsular
Florida experienced seven major hurricanes from 1944 to 1950 and
only three since, it is the increasingly-valuable property in their
path that will mean more costly storms in the future, Landsea said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are causing hurricane disasters,'' he said. ``It is only a
matter of time before the nation experiences a $50 billion or
greater storm, with multibillion-dollar losses becoming more
frequent.''
</P>
<P>
   Landsea, a hurricane researcher at the South Florida-based
Hurricane Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, parent of the National Weather Service and the
National Hurricane Center, conducted his research with Roger A.
Pielke Jr. of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in
Boulder, Colo.

REBELS IN MEXICO RETAKE A TOWN HALL SEIZED BY POLICE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The Zapatista rebels, in a bold challenge to the
government, sent more than 1,000 unarmed followers Thursday to
retake the town hall in an Indian village in Chiapas state only one
day after they were ousted from the building by the state police.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, three columns of rebels, their faces covered with their
hallmark black ski masks, marched into the cobblestone square in
San Andres Larrainzar, in the Indian highlands of Chiapas and
confronted 150 state police officers in riot gear who were guarding
the town hall.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the Zapatistas were empty-handed, not even
carrying sticks or stones. But they battered several police cars
with their fists and shoved the policemen to move them away from
the building. No injuries or arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
   A state government communique said that the police had withdrawn
to the edge of the village ``to avoid a confrontation with furious
demonstrators who pounded on their vehicles and shouted slogans at
them in an obvious attempt to provoke violence.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they were seeking arrest warrants for the
Zapatistas who damaged the police cars.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 months of tense standoff in Chiapas, the Zapatistas
moved to reassert their claim to the village, which is a central
political symbol because it was the site, in 1995 and 1996, of
peace talks between the rebels and the government that produced the
first and only peace agreement for Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later the Zapatistas pulled out of the talks after
the government sought to renegotiate some terms.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the government staged military operations to break up
several Zapatista-run townships. The last one, in June, ended in a
shooting battle with Zapatistas in which at least eight people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition forces occupied the mayor's offices in San Andres
Larrainzar in December 1995 after Zapatista supporters won an
election conducted according to Maya Indian custom that was not
recognized by state elections officials. Since then the Zapatistas
have boycotted all other elections, so candidates from the
governing party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI,
have won the mayor's post by overwhelming but not representative
majorities.
</P>
<P>
   A Zapatista mayor was nominally presiding in the town hall over
what the rebels called an ``autonomous township.'' But since the
government cut off all public funds to the rebel mayor, the
Zapatista administration had been virtually paralyzed for months.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in an operation without violence or arrests, 300
state police officers recaptured the town hall, expelling the only
two Zapatistas who were there, both security guards.
</P>
<P>
   The police installed an Indian mayor elected by the PRI faction,
Marcos Diaz Nunez. Thursday Diaz withdrew along with the police and
entered a police complaint against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The state government asserted that most of the Zapatista
protesters were from other townships, not San Andres Larrainzar.
But a rebel leader who gave his name only as Benjamin said most of
the demonstrators came from a nearby village that is a Zapatista
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before the Zapatista crowd, Benjamin accused the
Chiapas governor, Roberto Albores Guillen, of ``cowardice and bad
faith'' and of trying to provoke bloodshed between Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rebels withdrew by midafternoon, leaving a
contingent of several hundred to guard the mayor's office.

 AT&AMP;T Grasp on AtHome Slips a Bit
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
AT&AMP;T Corp. will lose a bit of control over Redwood City's AtHome
Corp. because it failed to sign up enough customers for AtHome's
high-speed Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome, which provides fast Internet connections over cable TV
lines, said yesterday that AT&AMP;T will no longer be able to control
decisions made by AtHome's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T acquired a 71 percent voting stake in AtHome when it bought
TCI, the cable company that originally had the deal with AtHome.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has three seats on AtHome's board of directors. Until now,
the 11-member board needed only three votes to take any action.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the board will require a majority of votes before
taking any action, which dilutes AT&AMP;T's power.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, &UR;  &LR; Cox Communications, Comcast Corp. and Cablevision Systems
Corp. _ four of the largest U.S. cable TV companies _ have a stake
in AtHome and agreements to sell AtHome's Internet service to their
cable customers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of those agreements, AtHome included a clause saying
that if AT&AMP;T's TCI subsidiary did not sign up a certain number of
customers by June 4, 1999, the other cable partners could drop
AtHome as their exclusive Internet access provider.
</P>
<P>
   Since AT&AMP;T does not expect to sign up enough subscribers _ the
number was not disclosed _ Cox, Comcast and Cablevision could drop
AtHome altogether and sell another company's Internet access
product to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox and Comcast agreed not to end their exclusivity
agreements with AtHome &UR;  &LR; in exchange for AT&AMP;T giving up some of its
hold over the AtHome board.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission yesterday, AT&AMP;T said AtHome's board could not take any
action without the approval of Comcast or Cox. AT&AMP;T also agreed to
increase its target subscriber levels to an undisclosed number.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome has 331,000 subscribers across the country, said AtHome
spokesman Matt Wolfram said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Rimer, who follows AtHome for Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, said
TCI's failure to attract the agreed-upon number of customers was
not a surprise. ``One of the reasons that TCI sold itself to AT&AMP;T
was because it could leverage the deep pockets of AT&AMP;T to grow at a
much more accelerated level than it could as an independent
company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects the subscriber levels to grow now that AT&AMP;T
has assumed control of the cable company.

   NEW YORK _ There once was a time that children followed the
circus dancing when it came to town. But these days the children
are more likely to be given coloring books by the animal rights
advocates that feature a circus elephant weeping, and the trainer
might be singled out on a Web site for abuse. This drives Gunther
Gebel-Williams, the legendary animal trainer, nominally retired,
nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the allegation that a baby elephant died
over a year ago at Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP; Bailey because it
was forced to perform when it was sick. The circus ultimately
settled with the government, but Gebel-Williams, now 64, a part
owner, says they were simply trying to do right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not let a 2-year-old elephant stay in back, away from
the other elephants, when he doesn't feel good,'' says the
German-born trainer, in heavily accented English. ``A 2-year-old
elephant is a child. The performing, it was just pushing around a
ball. Still to this day I don't know why the elephant died.''
</P>
<P>
   When he starred in the center ring of the Ringling show,
strutting with his unnatural white blond hair, his beloved leopard
Kenny (now an honored throw rug in his Florida home) in a signature
sling around his shoulders, Gebel-Williams had something that was
not touted in the posters, though the ladies didn't need a program
to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women were so good to me,'' Gebel-Williams says. ``It was
always so easy! It was a tough life for Sigrid'' _ his wife _ ``but
family was always No. 1. I never promised any of them anything.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife cannot be happy about this. ``She's not happy, but
there is only one Gunther,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He remains a physical guy. He has an arm around your shoulder
and is patting your knee moments after he meets you, which can turn
a girl's head until you realize it's the same way he pats the
elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Gebel-Williams retired from performing nine years ago. But he
still trains the animals and performs occasionally. He trains the
animals the way he always has: positive reinforcement, meat on a
stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think I hurt the animal with this?'' he says, backstage at
the Garden where the elephants are chained at the foot, knocking an
elephant's side with an elephant hook, and you realize, with some
concern, that not all the elephants are shackled.
</P>
<P>
   One, with pink speckled ears and a dusty hide, is walking
unfettered, responding to Gebel-Williams' hand signals and voice.
As Gebel-Williams stands against the elephant's front leg, she
bends her head down and wraps her trunk around him, and envelops
him in a full body hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``My lover,'' Gebel-Williams says.
</P>
<P>
   The lore of the circus is that one runs away to join it. Gunther
Gebel, raised in wartime Germany, is of the other tradition, which
was the domain of the malformed or unwanted _ he was dumped.
</P>
<P>
   His father was a carpenter who drank and beat his mother. His
mother, a seamstress, beat Gunther. When he was 13, Gunther's
mother contracted with the Circus Williams to hire him as an usher,
informing her son after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried so much,'' Gebel-Williams says. ``I never get it. My
son is 28. I look at him, I think how? I think the war did
something. I raised my family close.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child Gebel-Williams bonded with the animals. Eventually,
he took the circus' name, a marriage of sorts. He also married
Sigrid, a former model. She, their son and daughter all went into
circus work. Mark Oliver Gebel now performs his father's act.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to showtime. Mark Oliver Gebel is in the center ring with 12
Bengal tigers, inside a mesh cage, carrying two whips and a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Gebel-Williams places a small black satchel containing raw meat
outside the cage. As his son works, he rewards and distracts the
animals, reaching through the bars to pat a tiger or skewering a
piece of meat on a stick and slipping it to the animal. A few
minutes into the act he runs to the sidelines, grabs the reporter's
hand, and takes her to the side of the ring to show how his son
uses the whip only to signal.
</P>
<P>
   Now a 500-pound Bengal tiger is on its hind legs, walking
forward toward Gebel, towering over him.
</P>
<P>
   Is Gebel-Williams scared watching his son like this?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not scared,'' he says, ``but I worry. If he did something
else, if he flew planes, I couldn't be there every day, but here I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Now only one tiger is the cage. Gebel moves it onto a wide
swing, then steps behind it, the only control the leash in his
hand. Suddenly, the cage collapses, leaving the reporter, beside
Gebel-Williams, 6 feet from the tiger. The presence of a stranger
is a first and a surprise to everyone but Gebel-Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Gebel-Williams laughs, and offers the reporter a piece of raw
meat on a stick.

NEVILL FINDS NEW GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Art Nevill was tired of racing on shorter tracks at slower
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he tested a Speed Challenge Truck, built by a San
Bernardino company, at Willow Springs Raceway in Rosamond, liked
the vehicle so much that he bought one on the spot and used it to
win the series' second season championship.
</P>
<P>
   `` I wanted to go race superspeedways,'' the Acton resident
said. ``I didn't want to race just (the) Legends (class) anymore. I
wanted to go to Phoenix and to bigger road courses.''
</P>
<P>
   The 26-race series will make its 1999 debut at Irwindale
Speedway tonight, where the trucks will race the track's half-mile
oval 16 times this season. The series, which now has 24 trucks,
then moves to the Orange Show in San Bernardino on Saturday night.
Also racing tonight, starting at 7:30 p.m., will be NASCAR Late
Models, Grand American Modifieds and street stocks. On Saturday
night, starting at 7 p.m., racing will be for NASCAR Super Late
Models, Super Stocks and American Race Trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Nevill, who won the title despite being the ``Old Man'' of the
series at age 53, already has had success at Irwindale, winning the
Legends main feature last weekend. He said he hopes to win both
titles this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of devoted to racing,'' said Nevill, a two-time
Legends champion who began racing karts in the '80s, dropped out of
racing and then returned to the sport in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevrolet trucks have 330-horsepower engines with 1999 S-10
bodies. The intake manifold and timing cover have been sealed to
prohibit drivers from altering the truck's power. Pre-race
inspections also prevent altering of the engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're low maintenance and if they don't break, catch on fire
or if you don't crash, they don't cost that much,'' Nevill said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevill, who averaged 92.31 mph in testing at Irwindale last
month, said the car's chassis is what makes this series so special.
He said he did so well in the session that he has yet to change the
set-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as good as any late model touring car,'' he said of the
chassis. ``It's really stable. I've had some Winston West drivers
look at the chassis and they tell me how good it is and I say, `I
agree.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nevill says he learned chassis set-up from friend Donnie Johnson
when they raced together at Saugus Speedway. He said Johnson taught
him shocks, staggering and chassis and it's a reason why he did so
well last year. He won three races and finished in the top three
most of the season. He did it without benefit of a pit crew; his
wife won't watch him race after he broke his back in a 1995 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Steiner, who won the series inaugural title in '97, will
also be racing tonight after racing in a different series last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting younger drivers, but guys with experience, who
have raced midgets and modifieds,'' Nevill said. ``It's going to be
real competitive, yet, we hardly ever have any yellow flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just show up at the track by myself and say, `beat me.'''

 &HT;    A long wait for a perfect hero: Hank Aaron
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like that night exactly 25 years ago, it was cloudy
with threatening rain. But it was cold at Atlanta-Fulton County
Stadium the night Hank Aaron swung his way past Babe Ruth, a cold
that had nothing to do with the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little out of sorts 25 years ago. We didn't know
what was going to happen,'' said Billye Aaron, the slugger's wife.
``And while we were anticipating the breaking of the record, it was
an odd kind of feeling of what will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron's work done that night was properly _ and finally _
completed before the Atlanta Braves played Philadelphia on
Thursday. As part of the season-long anniversary salute to Aaron's
715th home run, Major League Baseball formally presented the new
Hank Aaron Award that will go annually to the game's leading
hitters. With monies raised at his birthday tribute Feb. 5, Aaron
was presented a $1 million check for his Chase the Dream
Foundation. An Atlanta crowd once more stood to cheer him.
</P>
<P>
   But far beyond the material, Aaron's reaffiliation with the game
he felt had long shunned him seemed all but complete. Following the
video tributes shown on the scoreboard, following the address by
commissioner Bud Selig and the songs sung by Kenny Rogers, Hank and
Billye Aaron took a long slow cart ride around the park. While the
public appreciation for Aaron was palpable, more subtle was Aaron's
appreciation for how different this night was from April 8, 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say I was nervous, like I am tonight,'' he recalled.
``This is tremendous to have an award named after you in
perpetuity. It's going to be around as long as baseball. When I'm
no longer here, my grandchildren and great-grandchildren can go and
remember this thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous feeling. I'm very grateful for this.''
</P>
<P>
   If it seemed that baseball was trying to make amends, it was.
Selig, the other half of a long and sincere friendship with Aaron,
has spearheaded the Aaron project after confessing to worrying
about Aaron and his legacy. There was plenty that blighted Aaron's
breaking the record _ MLB's indifference, Ruth die-hards, racist
threats _ and Selig could not explain why the game had not yet done
anything in lasting tribute to Aaron's accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the appropriate time,'' Selig said.
``Twenty-five years later, fortunately everyone is in good health.
It's something that should have happened a long time ago but didn't
happen. Should have, could have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now. And Hank can enjoy the award and the recognition.
Like a lot of things in life, I'd wished they'd had a better
experience and I wish a lot of what happened hadn't happened. It
was unexcusable and unexplainable. Baseball can only do now what it
can do. And so I'm proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The night was not lost upon the Braves, many of whom were in
diapers when Aaron went deep off Los Angeles' Al Downing. If the
game is now played before a more tolerant world, the way Aaron
endured is still an object lesson in any clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He set a standard I don't think anyone can achieve,'' said
Braves right fielder Brian Jordan, who was 7 years old the night
Ruth's record fell. ``You look back as a black baseball player now,
what he had to go through to achieve what he did _the death
threats, people not wanting to see him do it because the color of
his skin _ he blocked all that out and remained focused to achieve
what no one else in baseball accomplished. That's a role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cast of characters were there. Downing sat with the
dignitaries. Ralph Garr, Aaron's teammate who physically picked up
Aaron's foot and placed it on the plate as he brought No. 715 home
that night, was there. Andy Young, the man who would be mayor, was
at the pre-game press conference taking pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (former Mayor) Ivan Allen understood what bringing a
major league team here meant at the time,'' Young said. ``One of
the reasons he worked so hard to get us a stadium and a team was
that he was trying to hold Atlanta together while the rest of the
South was pulling apart. And Hank was the perfect hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron was asked about his ownership of the 755-homer record and
he replied that Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr., is a perfect candidate,
both in talent and deportment. Like it's even close. At age 29,
Griffey is still 404 short of the Hammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been mine long enough,'' Aaron said. ``I believe in
sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is just what he did Thursday night.

 &HT;    Love joins two atop Masters
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ It was a long, tiring first day at the 63rd
Masters. It began at 8 a.m. with a ceremonial first shot struck by
97-year-old Gene Sarazen and, well, it never ended.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a 1-hour, 30-minute rain delay from a late-afternoon
storm Thursday and a 96-player field already slowed down by
threesomes, 12 players must complete play today at 9 a.m. before
the start of the second round at Augusta National Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   That just made Davis Love III's round all that more precious.
</P>
<P>
   With a 3-under-par 69 completed by midday, when 90-degree
temperatures and firm greens were the obstacles, Love, of Sea
Island, Ga., shared the top of the leaderboard with two other
strangers to such a lofty spot _ Scott McCarron and Brandel
Chamblee.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, after a late birdie at the 16th hole, needs only a
par at the 18th this morning to complete his 69 and join the
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everywhere you looked, there was major championship
success.
</P>
<P>
   Love, the 1995 Masters runner-up, took the 1997 PGA
Championship. Price has won two PGAs and a British Open. Among
seven players one shot off the lead at 2-under 70 were defending
champion Mark O'Meara, 1997 British Open champion Justin Leonard,
1994 Masters winner Jose Maria Olazabal and two-time U.S. Open
champion Lee Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron tied for 10th in his first Masters in 1996, but
Chamblee has never been here before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm pleased with a 3-under start,'' said Love, who
birdied the 16th and 17th holes for a back-nine 32. ``The course
played pretty difficult. I got away with not getting anything going
on the front and then I got something going on the back. A good
start, but there's a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at 70 stood Colin Montgomerie of Scotland, Andersen
Consulting Match Play Championship runner-up Andrew Magee and Jeff
Sluman, the 1988 PGA champion.
</P>
<P>
   With a surprising first round considering his recent troubles,
Australian Greg Norman, 44, a two-time British Open champion, was
the unexpected name at 71, two strokes off the lead. He was joined
there by twice U.S. Open champion Ernie Els, who double-bogeyed the
18th hole; Steve Pate, Bob Estes, 1991 Masters winner Ian Woosnam
of Wales and 1988 champion Sandy Lyle of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good day's work,'' said Norman, who is playing with a
different shoulder than the one that missed the cut the past two
years. ``It was a fairly stable, good, solid and consistent round.
Anytime you get off to a good start, it's a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite David Duval, the world's No. 1 player, also is at
1-under with the 18th hole remaining after suffering bogeys on the
12th, 13th and 14th. Stewart Cink, who found the water at the 15th
hole, also is at 1-under with three holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, the 1997 Masters champion and the favorite before
Duval won 11 of his last 34 events, settled for even-par 72 after
botching the par-5 second hole with a triple-bogey 8.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar, struggling with a virus, had a 77.
</P>
<P>
   Not very popular when the day began, the decision to use
threesomes became an even sorer subject when combined with the rain
delay. Those players able to finish had to do it in diminishing
light on greens of varying firmness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Threesomes made it all the more difficult,'' said O'Meara.
``Normally ,you cruise around here, but today with the rain you're
looking at a 6 and a half hour round. Mentally and physically, it's
taking a lot out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman missed a four-foot birdie putt at the 18th, failing to
climb within a shot of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Jumbo Ozaki, who had eagled the 10th hole to go 3-under,
finished with two straight bogeys for a 71.
</P>
<P>
   Els double-bogeyed the 18th hole to lose his chance at a share
of the lead. He drove into the fairway bunker, hit a 7-iron into
the greenside bunker, blasted our and then 3-putted from 35 feet.
</P>
<P>
   England's Nick Faldo, with three green jackets, continued his
mysterious slide with an 8-over 80.
</P>
<P>
   As the day unfolded, playing conditions changed. Depending on
the time of day, you had breezeless and hot, or breezy and cooler.
Without Thursday's rain, the greens would have been severely baked
out by today.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Couples, one of the pre-tournament favorites, managed a
2-over-par 74 and did nothing to promote confidence for a
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a long way to go tomorrow,'' Couples said. ``I putted
like a 12-handicapper. A lot was because I was just too far away
from the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   For Love, who has two seconds and a third this year on the PGA
Tour, it was a confidence-boosting beginning. The world's No. 3
player, Love said, ``It's nice to get started. After coming off the
PGA (in 1997), you think you're going to come in with a lot of
confidence and get going. But to not contend in any of them last
year, just kind of hang round in a couple of them, was kind of
disappointing.

 &HT;    Duval's human side: back nine
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Who was this guy, anyway? The top button of his
shirt was uncharacteristically unbuttoned long before the turn. His
sunglasses were gone by the 13th tee, just when things suddenly
grew really dark for David Duval. Yet for all his recent dominance
and seeming perfection, Duval knew this opening round of the
Masters would be nowhere near as one-sided as his past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``A round of golf doesn't involve nine holes,'' Duval said. ``It
involves both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides of David Duval were evident Thursday, including that
rarest of views: A most human side. After turning in 33, tied for
the lead at 3 under and looking every bit the most prohibitive
favorite since, well, Tiger Woods a year ago, Duval looked very
human in _ and then coming out of _ Amen Corner.
</P>
<P>
   He bogeyed No. 12. Then, after play was suspended because of
weather for 90 minutes, he bogeyed No. 13. Then, he bogeyed No. 14.
Back-to-back-to-back bogeys? When was the last time that happened?
Surely, long before Duval began ruling the game in October 1997,
when his run of 11 victories in 34 tournaments began.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, when play was suspended again, this time because
of darkness, Duval had finally righted himself with a birdie at 17.
That left him 1 under, two off the lead, with No. 18 left to be
played at 9 a.m. today before he, Nick Price and Bob Tway tee off
for the second round at 10:27.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 18 holes involved,'' said Duval, who actually had just
17 holes of involvement. ``On a course like this, you're going to
run into some bad stuff. You just try to outweigh it with some good
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The good stuff came early for Duval, who saved par on No. 1 with
a nice 15-footer, then looked like the guy who'd won two
consecutive tournaments (The Players Championship in his hometown,
then the BellSouth Classic last week at Duluth) and $2.5 million.
Duval made birdie at Nos. 2 and 3 to go 2 under. Never mind a bogey
at No. 5. Consecutive birdies at No. 7 and 8 moved him to 3 under
and into a share of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   But after starting the back side with two pars, Duval suddenly
gave the gallery a peek behind those shades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a poor decision on one hole,'' he said, ``a bad swing
on another. On 14, the wind kicked up and got us. That's the three
bogeys.''
</P>
<P>
   On No. 12, his tee shot stayed dry, but long and left of the
green. He chipped on, but short, then dropped his putter in
disbelief when a 10-footer to save par didn't drop.
</P>
<P>
   At 13, Duval snapped his drive high into a pine at the bend in
the dogleg. The ball dropped down into the creek. Duval was clearly
flustered. For nearly five minutes, he talked to an official,
gesturing toward the pines, walking back and forth. Finally, he
took a drop, hit out nicely and knocked his approach shot 9 feet
below the hole before play was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   When it resumed, Duval missed the putt for another bogey. After
a great drive on No. 14, with the wind gusting and the pines
swaying back and forth, Duval stepped away from his ball once, then
finally left it short. The ball hit the mounds on the front of the
green and rolled back off. He chipped on but barely up to the crest
of a ridge, where the ball stopped. A miss from 18 feet left Duval
with a third consecutive bogey and at even par.
</P>
<P>
   Two pars later (he just missed a 10-foot birdie at 16), Duval
finally found his form again. His approach on No. 17 stopped 3 feet
from the hole. He made the birdie, then walked back to the
clubhouse, with one hole left to finish this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard,'' Duval said of the course. ``The greens are
pretty fast, pretty firm.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the pace of play with threesomes: ``It's not exactly
quick. We expected that, but it's hard to keep your rhythm. We were
out there about four hours when the (first) horn sounded.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for finishing the first round this morning, Duval said,
``If you want to win this event, you've got to find a way to deal
with it.

BUSH SPELLS OUT POLICY ON BALKAN CRISIS &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, undergoing his severest
national criticism yet for the vagueness of his Balkan policy,
Thursday sharpened his position to say that NATO's use of force
should restore Kosovo to its native ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would define the mission as to restoring Kosovo so the
Kosovoians can move back in and at the same time teach Mr.
Milosevic that NATO and its allies and the United States will not
tolerate genocide,'' said Bush, a leading contender for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and NATO have been trying to halt the campaign
of ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovars by Slobodan Milosevic, the
Yugoslavian president, with airstrikes against Yugoslavia and the
Serb army.
</P>
<P>
   In his strongest and most extensive comments yet on the
2-week-old bombing campaign, Bush said, ``I'm concerned that a thug
like Milosevic, if left unchecked, would set a bad example for
other `ethnic cleansers' or other people willing to commit ethnic
genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been widely criticized for being slow to adopt a
position on Kosovo and then for making vague statements on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek said of Bush: ``GOP front-runner equivocates over
bombing. Make up your mind, Nacho Man!'' And the conservative Wall
Street Journal called Bush's original stance on Kosovo ``so vague
and tepid as to be almost Clintonian.'' Numerous other pundits have
chimed in with similar remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush shrugged off such criticism Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all. I took a very measured approach. I took my time in
making what I thought was a very important statement,'' Bush said.
``I'm going to get criticized. I understand that. But I'm going to
speak on my timetable and nobody else's.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past several days, Bush has moved closer in his stance to
GOP presidential rival John McCain, an ex-prisoner of war and the
only candidate with combat experience. McCain's political star has
risen since he has offered tough talk on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   George Christian, who was press secretary to President Johnson
during the Vietnam war, said he does not believe the public
evolution of Bush's position will hurt his presidential campaign in
the long run. But Christian said it gives the news media and Bush's
opponents ammunition for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's caught in a stance where he's expected to say something,
but he's got to be cautious,'' Christian said. ``He's taken some
flak on it because he's the leading Republican contender for
president. Any flak he gets is from people who want to do him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been meeting this week with experts who are trying to
bring him up to speed on foreign policy and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the governor met two days
this week with foreign policy advisers including former Secretary
of State George Shultz, Pentagon adviser Richard Perle, Stanford
University's Condoleeza Rice and Johns Hopkins University's Paul
Wolfowitz. All served in the administrations of presidents Reagan
or George Bush, the governor's father.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the meetings were scheduled before the Kosovo crisis
erupted into U.S. military action and were not set up in response
to the criticism of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism did not stop Bush from picking up key endorsements
Thursday from U.S. Rep. Jim Nussle and New Hampshire Sen. Judd
Gregg.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in an Austin news conference, criticized the Clinton
administration for not doing enough to enunciate a goal for the
Kosovo military action and indicated the bombing campaign might not
be a tough enough response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victory means exit strategy, and it's important for the
president to explain to us what the exit strategy is,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Although on Wednesday Bush said that a victory was paramount,
``even if that means ground troops,'' he said Thursday he believes
the military ought to make any decision to commit ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said America has a strategic interest in maintaining
stability in Europe. He said if military force is used to meet that
objective, it must be done so with ``ferocity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about whether or not the bombing campaign is done with
ferocity,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   On another foreign policy matter, Bush did not hesitate to
outline his position on China as Premier Zhu Rongji held a news
conference with Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the United States should continue to trade with China
while continuing to pressure the nation to adopt more humanitarian
measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is an important nation, and so is America. We ought to
be dealing with China,'' Bush said. ``We ought to make it clear to
China that we support human rights in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose father was U.S. ambassador to China, said improved
trade will help create high-quality U.S. jobs while also creating
an ``entrepreneurial class'' in China.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said that also means backing up allies Taiwan, Japan
and South Korea, though he said the United States should not
recognize Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need to maintain the one-China policy,'' Bush said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The endorsements Bush won Thursday will give Bush a boost in the
early states of Iowa, where the caucuses are the first test of
strength for 2000 presidential contenders and New Hampshire, which
holds the first primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a leader in this country to renew the national spirit
and bring pride back to the presidency,'' Gregg said. ``I believe
George W. will do this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his approach to leading our party to be more
inclusive,'' Nussle said. ``He brings people together, and he's not
a Johnny-One-Note on an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to headline a June fund-raiser for Nussle's
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also named his New Hampshire exploratory committee
co-chairmen: Rob Thompson, a grass-roots organizer for former New
Hampshire Gov. Steve Merrill and Barbara Russell, former assistant
chairwoman of the New Hampshire Republican Party.

PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW: ART AND COURAGE FORGED IN A CAULDRON OF
ADVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ANTARCTIC-ODYSSEY) 
(js) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frank Hurley was 28 in 1914 when he shipped out as a
photographer on Sir Ernest Shackleton's expedition to cross
Antarctica. Hurley had been to Antarctica already. Three years
earlier he had gone with his compatriot Douglas Mawson, the
Australian explorer, and the film he made about Mawson's trip was
one of the things that got Shackleton interested in having his own
trip filmed and photographed.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton figured that selling rights to Hurley's pictures of
the expedition would cover part of his cost. Hurley was an egotist,
a roughneck who had come up in the world through hard work, and he
was not easy to get along with. But he was nonetheless talented and
fearless.
</P>
<P>
   So Shackleton set off with a crew of 27, including Hurley, on
Aug. 8, 1914, a week after World War I began, in a 300-ton
Norwegian barkentine that he had renamed Endurance, after his
family motto, ``By endurance we conquer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had the slightest idea what kind of adventure it would
turn out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton's journey, one of the great epics of global
exploration, is recounted through more than 150 of Hurley's color
and black-and-white photographs as well as with artifacts and some
ingenious video displays in a show called ``The Endurance:
Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition,'' starting Saturday at
the American Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   If it is unbelievable that Hurley's pictures survive at all, it
is no less remarkable that so many of them, a large number of which
have never been exhibited before, are first-class works of art.
Sometimes the wildest and most extreme circumstances bring out the
best in a person, and this was clearly the case with Hurley, who
would never again be as good a photographer as he was on
Shackleton's trip. But then he never again faced anything quite
like what they went through.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton must have been an amazing, charismatic man. Like a
character out of Robert Louis Stevenson or H.G. Wells, he was a
dreamer, a chaser of quick fortune, a determined optimist,
unbelievably steady and indomitable in adversity, an instinctual
judge of men, whose total loyalty to him was based on the fact that
he stopped at nothing to save them when the going got bad.
</P>
<P>
   And go bad it did, more than once. He had been with Robert F.
Scott on a failed trip to the South Pole, then failed to reach it
on his own, getting within 100 miles before deciding to turn back
to safeguard the lives of his men. That was in 1909. In 1911 Roald
Amundsen beat Scott to the pole. So Shackleton proposed the absurd
idea of crossing the whole continent by foot, about 1,600 miles
from the Weddell Sea to the Ross Sea, simply because that had not
been done.
</P>
<P>
   Like Scott he was squarely in the crazy British tradition of
Arctic explorers _ impractical, brave, weirdly inured to suffering
_ and this helped make him a popular hero and got him knighted,
though it's useful to recall that official Britain, including the
people who ran the Admiralty, never entirely warmed to him. He was
not one of them, as Scott had been. He had grown up in Ireland. He
was middle class. Scott had been in the Royal Navy. Shackleton was
merchant marine. He was, to them, a schemer, hustling to raise
private money for his expeditions. Today he'd be called an
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   The Endurance sailed from England to Buenos Aires, then to South
Georgia Island, the last inhabited post, east of the Falklands,
before entering the uncharted Weddell Sea in early December 1914.
Conditions, which are never good there, were unusually bad that
year, and heavy pack ice quickly surrounded the boat.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-January, the Endurance had struggled to within 80 miles
of Antarctica, but it was being inexorably drawn clockwise by the
ice, back away from land, north. Crewmen tried desperately to saw a
lead through the thick pack but ultimately were forced to give up.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 10 months their boat was trapped in the floes, like
an almond in toffee, one of the crewman said, helplessly drifting
in the sea and slowly being crushed, as if in a vise, by millions
of tons of pressure. On Oct. 27, 1915, the Endurance finally began
to sink. The crew had to abandon ship and camp on the ice. They
took what provisions they could. At first Hurley had to leave his
film and bulky glass plates behind, but then he convinced
Shackleton that they should be saved, if possible, so he dove into
the icy water that now filled the ship's darkroom. He retrieved
more than 500 plates but ultimately destroyed most because they
were simply too heavy to take along. Who knows what was lost.
</P>
<P>
   For five months more Shackleton and his men fought to stay
afloat in horrendous weather on unpredictable melting ice that,
from time to time, cracked open beneath them. They were two dozen
men with only a wafer of frozen water between them and 2,000
fathoms of ocean.
</P>
<P>
   They lived on rations, seals and penguins, which they killed
when the animals climbed onto the floe, and on their own sled dogs,
which they reluctantly shot. Food was almost the least of their
problems. They had to hope by chance to be carried on the current
to a spot from which they could launch their three modest
lifeboats, which they had salvaged, toward one of the small islands
above the Antarctic peninsula. If the ice carried them in the wrong
direction or if it didn't open up in time, they would be swept into
the ocean void.
</P>
<P>
   They missed Paulet Island and the Danger Islets. This wasn't
good. All that remained before oblivion were Clarence Island and
tiny Elephant Island, 100 miles off. On April 9, 1916, the ice
suddenly gave way under their tents, almost killing a man, and they
had no choice; they scrambled into the boats, which were small,
stubby-masted vessels, designed more for rowing than sailing.
Picture something a little bigger than a Central Park rowboat. Now
picture rowing it in a hurricane across the North Atlantic in
winter.
</P>
<P>
   They fought through heavy winds for a week, nearly swamped by
icy waves, but miraculously they spotted Elephant Island, an
uninhabited speck in the sea, far from civilization, the first dry
land they had come to in 497 days. They clambered ashore,
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Now their real troubles began.
</P>
<P>
   The saga of what happened next has been told often, but good
stories bear repeating. Elephant may be the most inhospitable
island on the planet. Glacier cliffs provide water, but hurricane
winds turn the island's rocky shelf, which was the only place for
the men to go, into a virtual tundra. There is no shelter.

GALAXY COACH DISAPPOINTED IN FAILED DEAL
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano voiced his
disappointment over the Galaxy's failure to come to terms with the
Rose Bowl and build the Los Angeles franchise a practice facility
next to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Galaxy president Tim Leiweke cancelled plans to build
the site on the stadium grounds after learning the Rose Bowl raised
its price an additional $200,000, bringing the total cost to an
estimated, $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The last two seasons the Galaxy trained either at Occidental
College or on the Rose Bowl's parking lot grass. With the season
two weeks old, Zambrano's not sure where his team will train next.
</P>
<P>
   A lingering question in Zambrano's mind is why the deal to build
the site didn't happen when money never seemed to be an issue
during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the only thing I can think of is that maybe the fact
there is a football team coming to L.A. -- that had some impact and
made our ownership rethink certain things,'' Zambrano said. ``That
is a guess, speculation on my part. If that's not the case then for
sure our guys have been filled with broken promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this happened it was hard for me to address the guys
because it was almost like here we go again. I still think the
commitment of our ownership is strong towards getting us a
facility, but certainly now that we have this factor (of an NFL
team possibly) coming to town, I guess we can't ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy defender Paul Caligiuri said the team was looking forward
to the new training facility after talk of the plans since October.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had been at Azusa Pacific or at Mount San Antonio
(College) like we orginally planned everything would be fine and
constantly flowing,'' Caligiuri said. ``Now this is a blow, we're
scrambling. We relied on something that was never finalized. We
heard it was getting better and better, but in reality, we're back
to square one again.''
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) Following tonight's match the Galaxy is off for more
than a week before visiting Chicago April 17 to take on the MLS
champion Fire. Chicago swept the Galaxy in the Western Conference
finals last season.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles returns to the Rose Bowl April 24 to take on San
Jose.

 NEW YORK: no shelter.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crew built a leaky hut by overturning two of the boats and
laid sodden sleeping bags onto a freezing, stinking, wet bed of
stones covered with penguin guano. This wouldn't do for long. For
one thing, no one would ever find them there. Shackleton's only
option was to seek help in the third boat, which he had christened
the James Caird (after the expedition's main sponsor). The Caird's
rigging consisted of threadbare clothes and rotted bags. The crew
had a single sextant and a chronometer of unknown reliability.
</P>
<P>
   So with five men, Shackleton set sail again, this time to try to
get back to South Georgia Island, 800 miles to the east, skirting
the Drake Passage, the worst stretch of ocean anywhere. Winds gust
over 100 miles an hour. Temperatures are subzero. The Cape Horn
rollers, as they're called, swell to 100 feet and move at speeds
close to 40 knots. No one had ever done anything vaguely like this.
Since Shackleton, no one else has.
</P>
<P>
   At the museum, sure to please the crowds, is a clever video
simulation of the experience of the passage (along with the Caird
itself, freshly painted, alas, so it looks anonymous), although the
effect doesn't come close to recreating the rise and fall of the
big rollers. The museum realized that to do so would make visitors
sick.
</P>
<P>
   Every few seconds, after all, the Caird, as Shackleton recalled
in his memoir, would soar 50 feet or so, then dive headlong, the
sails going slack because the troughs were so deep, before another
giant wave loomed, threatening to drown the crew. This happened
thousands of times each day.
</P>
<P>
   The men were forced to huddle on a floor of rocks, used for
ballast, under a flimsy canvas flap in soaked reindeer sleeping
bags. The bags shed so much hair that when a man managed to fall
asleep, which was possible only from sheer exhaustion, he woke up
choking. The hair clogged the makeshift pump and spoiled the meager
rations.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly bad gale began to blow when the Caird got to sea,
and it lasted for days on end, among other things often making it
impossible for the crew to fix its position securely. If they
miscalculated their direction by a degree, they would miss South
Georgia. Then it was another 3,000 miles to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Worsley was Shackleton's captain. Fortunately he was a
genius. To read about Shackleton's expedition (the classic account
is Alfred Lansing's 1959 book, ``Endurance'') is to encounter more
than a few quiet, brave men who seem to belong to another era,
another species even. Worsley, whose memoir, ``Endurance: An Epic
of Polar Adventure,'' will be republished this month, was maybe the
most impressive. Somehow he guided the battered Caird to South
Georgia in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But their troubles still weren't over. The rocks made it nearly
impossible to land. Agonizingly close to their goal, the men
suffered through more days in a storm trying to get ashore, and at
one point they came very close to crashing into a huge cliff.
Worsley later wrote that he recalled feeling piqued when he
believed they would die off South Georgia because ``no one would
ever know we had got so far.''
</P>
<P>
   They did land. But there was yet another huge hurdle: They were
on the opposite side of the island from the whaling station and
unable to sail around to it. This side of South Georgia was
uninhabited and uncharted. They had to trek 22 miles over
unexplored glaciers and snowy mountains. No one had ever made this
trip, and all they had for equipment was a carpenter's adz and 90
feet of rope.
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of what they accomplished, you might remember
that in 1996 a young, well-trained, well-fed team of British
marines, stationed on South Georgia on winter patrol, set out with
mountain skis, aerial maps, superlight gear and electronic
equipment to break Shackleton's record for crossing the island
overland and only barely beat his time.
</P>
<P>
   It took 36 harrowing hours on a near-suicide march before
Shackleton and his men finally straggled into Stromness, their
faces blacked with soot and hidden behind matted beards, their
bodies dead white from soaking in salt water and covered in boils.
It was May 20, 1916. Shackleton, unrecognizable, asked to see the
station manager, Thoralf Sorlle, whom he knew. It had been nearly
two years since Shackleton had left the island and, especially with
the distraction of the war, his expedition had pretty much slipped
from people's minds. Everyone assumed he was dead. One familiar
account of the meeting with Sorlle comes from a Norwegian whaler in
his broken English:
</P>
<P>
   ``Manager say, `Who the hell are you?' And terrible bearded man
say very quietly, `My name is Shackleton.' Me _ I turn away and
weep.'' The other Norwegian whalers at Stromness, who knew the
Drake Passage better than anyone, could not believe the Southern
Ocean had been crossed in the Caird. They held a dinner for the men
and silently, one by one, they lined up and shook the hands of
Shackleton and his crew. He later said it was the greatest tribute
ever paid to him.
</P>
<P>
   As for the men on Elephant Island, it took Shackleton four
desperate trips and another three months, until Aug. 30, 1916,
before he could get through the ice to retrieve them. When he first
got to Stromness, he wired the British Admiralty for a rescue ship.
But Britain was fighting a war, and the Admiralty didn't have much
sympathy for him anyway, so he was compelled to appeal to another
country for help. Chile agreed and sent a tug, the Yelcho.
</P>
<P>
   When the men spotted the boat offshore, they hurriedly tried to
hoist a flag to signal their position, but the flag got stuck half
way up the post. Shackleton was devastated. He thought it signaled
that someone had died.
</P>
<P>
   But every man survived. Shackleton wrote to his wife: ``I have
done it. Damn the Admiralty. Not a life lost and we have been
through hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley had not been on the Caird or crossed South Georgia, so
his photographs tell only part of the story, although he did take
some pictures on Elephant Island with a vest-pocket camera he had
salvaged. Mostly he recorded the experience of the Endurance and
life on the floes.

   He went to technical lengths to set up dozens of cumbersome
lights in the dark to get stunning nighttime shots of the ship's
rigging, like spun-sugar candy, against blackness. He climbed to
the crow's-nest for pictures of the Endurance casting shadows on
the icy sea, amazing images that organize and give depth to an
essentially impossible white-on-white vista by projecting the
linear geometry of the ship's mast against it. And he took
beautiful, melancholic color photographs of the ship marooned in
ice.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Alexander, who put the exhibition together and wrote
the accompanying book, describes the pictures Hurley took later in
his career as bland color postcard snaps. The photographs here have
a calm, abstract beauty. Perhaps the immensity of the subject
tempered his inclination to melodrama. He made decent portraits but
did not photograph images of individual suffering or despair.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the photographs are mostly of groups, the individuals
anonymous, reflecting the character of an expedition whose members
depended so completely on each other for their lives. We see
clothes hanging on lines to dry in the camp, and the men, like sled
dogs, hauling their boats over ice, black silhouettes against empty
whiteness. Many pictures simply show boredom and inaction, men
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The best pictures have an extraordinarily modern quality, a
reduction and irregularity of geometric forms that can even put you
in mind a bit of Calder or Ellsworth Kelly. A few photographs also
come out of Romantic landscape painting, staged but exquisite: a
stunning panorama of snowy South Georgia, for instance, that mimics
Friedrich. Worsley and another crewman are atop a cliff,
overlooking the island, with the Endurance in the harbor below.
</P>
<P>
   After the expedition, Hurley went to photograph the war at
Ypres, Belgium. He made a popular film of the Shackleton
expedition, which has recently been restored and released on video.
He spent most of the rest of his life in Australia, photographing
in the South Pacific, and died in 1962, at 76, on assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the crew enlisted immediately upon their return
to England. Having lasted two years with Shackleton, Tim McCarthy,
a seaman, was killed at his gun in the Channel a few months after
he got back. Alf Cheetham, one of the officers on the Endurance,
drowned when a German submarine torpedoed his minesweeper just
before the armistice.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Greenstreet's war service began when the Yelcho landed in
Chile. He took command of a tug returning to Britain. He was the
last survivor of the expedition, dying in 1979, at 89, as Ms.
Alexander points out, an explorer from the era of masted ships who
lived to see the public become indifferent to moon landings.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton returned to a world that had endured too much death
and dying to glorify a frivolous adventure without reservation. He
was embraced, up to a point. But he was undeterred. He cooked up
several more wild schemes, until in 1922, back at South Georgia,
with plans to hunt for Captain Kidd's treasure, he had a heart
attack and died. He was 47.
</P>
<P>
   His wife declined an offer to have his body returned to England,
and at her request, he was buried in a small graveyard for
Norwegian whalers on South Georgia.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition''
opens Saturday at the American Museum of Natural History, Central
Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5000, and is there through Oct.
11.

 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Erica Aguilar, a Mexican-American born in Denver, is 21
years old and has three children, ages 4, 2 and 8 months. The
children have Medicaid, and for them she uses Denver's La Casa
Family Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Aguilar herself has no health insurance. She works 26
hours a week as a sales clerk at Montgomery Ward for $6.50 an hour,
and as a part-timer, she is ineligible for insurance even if she
could pay her share of the premium. Yet she earns too much to get
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   So for herself and sometimes her children, she uses home
remedies. ``I go by what my grandmother tells me,'' she said. She
douses her eyes with sugar and water to cure eye irritations. To
cure colic, she rubs the baby's stomach with warm oils.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aguilar's story is emblematic of a striking disparity in the
nation's health care. For reasons that are largely economic, but
also cultural, 34 percent of the nation's 31 million Hispanics have
no health insurance, compared with 22 percent of blacks and 12
percent of non-Hispanic whites. Overall, 43 million people in the
nation are without insurance, up from 31 million a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanic people appear to be gaining in economic and
political strength, they disproportionately lack insurance coverage
and ready access to professional care. That is particularly true
for the three-quarters who are from Mexico and Central America.
Cuban-Americans tend to be older and wealthier and to have
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The social costs of the uninsured come with the dangers of
untreated contagious diseases and an eventual reliance on emergency
room care, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has a vast Hispanic population, making up a quarter of
the city's half-million residents compared with 11 percent
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic residents here are mostly young and mostly from Mexico
and Central America, and as in many cities their lack of
professional health care sustains a thriving system of alternative
care built on religion, tradition and home remedies. Often it
works. But just as often, it delays and impedes crucial care.
</P>
<P>
   Health system officials and community leaders here say the
menial jobs for relatively young and uneducated Hispanic workers
make health insurance unlikely for them. But the disparity in
coverage is worsened, the officials say, by cultural and
bureaucratic barriers and a political climate that has darkened for
immigrants, both legal and illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to be poor,'' said Ann Zuvekas of the George
Washington University Center for Health Policy Research, the author
of several studies of minority health. ``They tend to work for
small employers, in low-wage jobs, cleaning buildings and
gardening, in car washes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cultural differences and language barriers,'' Ms.
Zuvekas added. ``And a number are immigrants. Public policy has
been to make sure that many immigrants don't get insurance.'' Under
the overhaul of the welfare system three years ago, for example,
legal immigrants must wait five years to apply for Medicaid, the
health insurance program for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the $48 billion, 10-year program that Congress and
President Clinton enacted two years ago to expand government
insurance to all groups of poor children, little has been done to
treat the gap in the Hispanic population's coverage. ``We are being
lobbied to improve our children's care,'' said Richard Allen,
director of Colorado's Medicaid program. ``But regarding Hispanics?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   Some who do qualify for programs like Medicaid still won't
enroll for fear that doing so will encourage politicians to use
rising enrollments of immigrants to argue for slowing future
immigration, including relatives of immigrants already here
legally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're frightened,''said Dr. Richard Wright, chief executive
of Community Health Services of Denver Health, the city's nonprofit
health care system. ``They think, `If I enroll, that will work
against me as an immigrant.'''
</P>
<P>
   For most uninsured Hispanics, the disparity in coverage arises
from erosion of job-based benefits. Only half of all Hispanics are
covered through employment, compared with two-thirds of
African-Americans and three-quarters of white workers.
</P>
<P>
   When employers do offer insurance, usually asking their workers
to pay a share of the cost, Hispanic workers are the most likely to
refuse it because they earn less than other workers and have more
mouths to feed on their slimmer wages.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau says that in 1996, Hispanic men earned a
little over $16,000, about $10,000 less than non-Hispanic white
men. And 27 percent of Hispanic families have five or more members,
compared with 12 percent of other families.
</P>
<P>
   While economic reasons dominate, issues of culture also emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``People rely on faith a lot,'' said Luz Collins, who was born
in Mexico and manages the Westside Family Health Center, one of 11
Denver Health clinics. ``They wheel and deal with God. You call it
home medicine. It's our actual medicine. A lot of it's hidden
because we realize it's not accepted by the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Some home medicine tends to be harmless, as in the case of Irene
Chavez's 2-year-old granddaughter. Recently, Ms. Chavez lovingly
displayed a framed photograph of the toddler with her deep happy
dimples and wavy black hair. ``She's a beautiful granddaughter,''
Ms. Chavez says, ``so beautiful that people just can't believe
she's real.'' The beauty, she contends, was the child's undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Whether from spite, envy or admiration, Ms. Chavez said, someone
gazed overly long at her granddaughter and in so doing marked her
with the evil eye, or ``mal de ojo.'' A day or two later the child
fell ill, with vomiting, diarrhea and a high fever. Doctors said
she had a virus. ``They said, `Stop being paranoid,''' Ms. Chavez
said. ```There's nothing wrong with her.'''
</P>
<P>
   Unconvinced, the family called in Louise, their 77-year-old
neighborhood curandera, or healer. Chanting prayers, the woman
rubbed an unbroken egg over the child, tracing signs of the cross.
Then she broke the egg, put it in a cup, placed a cross made of
twigs in the yolk, and put the cup under the head of the child's
bed. By morning the child was well. The egg, Ms. Chavez said, had
exorcised the curse.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But when such efforts fail and patients belatedly show up at
doctors' offices, says Dr. Alicia Vazquez, the primary care
physician at Denver Health's La Casa de Salute clinic, they have
been drinking cocktails of exotic herbs or using cheap,
under-the-counter prescription medicines that bodegas smuggle in
from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 32-year-old female comes in with a five-day history of sore
throat, runny nose and a cough and reports that she's been taking
an antibiotic from Mexico because that's all she could get,'' Dr.
Vazquez says.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vazquez takes a culture of the patient's mouth to see if she
has strep throat. It proves negative. ``But is that because she
does not have strep throat, or is she partially treated?'' she
said. Not knowing which, she said, leaves the doctor with the
choice of treating a condition the patient may not have or waiting
to see if the conditions worsens.
</P>
<P>
   Even the act of going to a clinic is novel to some Hispanics.
``In Mexico, there are so many things around for curing yourself
that you don't go to the doctor,'' said Juvenica Acevedo Flores, a
hearty widow who is 4 feet, 4 inches tall and 87 years old.
</P>
<P>
   She has Medicare but rarely used it until a few years ago when
she was found to have diabetes. Now her daughter takes her to the
Westside clinic for checkups. ``It's necessary,'' Ms. Acevedo said
with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Brodsky, a clinic manager whose grandmother was a
curandera, said the whole notion of insurance could be foreign.
``The culture isn't one to ask for help outside the family,'' she
said. ``Then when something really bad happens, you turn to the
family for money'' to pay for professional care.
</P>
<P>
   Language is also a barrier, both in efforts to get patients to
enroll in health care programs and in communicating with them once
they sign up.
</P>
<P>
   At Denver Health's Community Health Services, which oversees the
clinics and serves a predominantly poor and Hispanic clientele, 83
percent of the 80 physicians are non-Hispanic whites. So are all
eight senior social workers and 84 percent of the 97 registered and
advanced-practice nurses.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said Ms. Collins of the Westside clinic, ``A
Hispanic is given heart medicine and it's not well-explained. They
end up taking it when they have a chest pain, not every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Sanchez-Martin, director of the Center for Community and
Behavioral Health at the Denver branch of the Latin American
Research and Service Agency, says the problem is one of ``cultural
competence,'' not just language. Relations between men and women,
for example, clash with American norms.
</P>
<P>
   At the private, largely church-funded Tepayac Clinic, husbands
sometimes stop their wives from having pap smears. ``If the
doctor's a man,'' said Jim Garcia, chairman of the clinic's board,
``the husband says no. The idea of another man touching his wife is
beyond comprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we try to relieve that,'' said Susan Gallo, a psychologist
and the clinic's executive director, ``by having a female attendant
in the examining room _ a chaperone.''
</P>
<P>
   Barriers like these reinforce Denver's unofficial safety net.
One strand is the neighborhood curandera, and another the bodegas
and four or five botanicas and yerberias that dispense herbs, teas,
incense, powders, charms, sprays and oils, some with proven
medicinal value and often prescribed by curanderas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rick Padilla, a family physician at Westside, estimates that
100 to 200 curanderas serve the city, nearly all working from their
homes and known only by word of mouth. In a random survey of 405
adult Hispanic patients, he found that 29 percent had sought a
curandera's intervention at least once in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some charge nothing, Padilla said. Others accept a meal, or a
donation ranging from $5 to $100. ``They're not very well
regulated,'' he said, ``and there's a lot of potential for abuse.''
But when he feels that Hispanic patients' fears and suspicions
obstruct their care, he refers them to a trustworthy curandera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Latin people think their diseases are related to someone
having put a hex on them,'' said Toni Palma, a Hopi Indian married
to a Mexican and a counselor to the elderly at Westside. A woman
might say she has been cursed and made sick by another who wants
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the disparities in insurance coverage do not
translate into conclusive evidence of a sicker population.
Nationwide, the average Hispanic is a first-generation immigrant,
26 years old _ 10 years younger than the rest of the population _
and less likely to have contracted the diseases that develop later
in life.
</P>
<P>
   Still, among the three largest population groups _ white, black
and Hispanic _ statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention show that Hispanics have the highest rates of diseases
like mumps, tetanus, whooping cough and German measles. They have
lower levels of HIV infection, diabetes and tuberculosis than
blacks but about twice the levels of whites.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight percent of Hispanic children are uninsured, the
journal Health Affairs reports, compared with 18 percent of black
children and 12 percent of white children.
</P>
<P>
   But once Hispanic immigrants have lived in America for a decade
or two, physicians here say, their diets begin to shift from beans,
grains, fruit and vegetables to fast and processed foods.
</P>
<P>
   So once they are settled, said Robin Weinick, social scientist
at the federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research,
``Hispanics tend to be in poorer health.'' And, she said, ``They
have the poorest access to care of any population we measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright of Denver Health said, ``We've got to learn. We've got to
talk to people in the community. We've got to have a dialogue so
our system and their beliefs can be more in sync.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, Wall Street was stunned when Jessica M.
Bibliowicz, daughter of the financier Sanford I. Weill, abruptly
quit her father's company after clashing with James Dimon, her boss
and a man widely seen as Weill's heir apparent. To some, it seemed
as if Weill was favoring a man he viewed like a son over his own
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, Dimon was himself ousted from Citigroup, the
giant company formed by the merger of Weill's Travelers Group and
Citicorp.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Bibliowicz has announced plans to once more follow in
her father's footsteps _ but this time at her own firm. She said
Thursday that she had resigned as president of John A. Levin &AMP; Co.,
the New York money manager, to become chief executive of National
Financial Partners, a start-up financial-services company financed
by the investor Leon Black. The company caters to wealthy
individuals and midsize businesses and hopes to acquire 300 small
financial planners, insurance brokers and investment advisers in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bibliowicz, 39, who had joined Levin after resigning as
mutual funds chief at the Smith Barney unit of Travelers, said she
took the new job because it offered an unusual chance to build a
company from the ground up _ not unlike the way her father rose to
prominence a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just irresistible,'' she said, adding that she
expects to spend all of her time negotiating acquisitions of firms
across the country in hopes of preparing her new employer for a
stock offering in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to follow a model perfected by Weill, now co-chief
executive of Citigroup, who built a financial empire by
acquisitions, culminating with Travelers' purchase of Citicorp last
year. In fact, she was recruited by a former lieutenant of her
father's, Robert L. Rosen, who is National Financial Partners'
chairman and a longtime associate of Black and his Apollo Advisors
investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Black, who was in charge of mergers and acquisitions at Drexel
Burnham Lambert during the 1980s, now invests billions of dollars
for pension funds and private investors.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he has become a major investor in nursing homes and
assisted-living centers, and he is leading the rescue of Patriot
American Hospitality Inc., the troubled Dallas real estate
investment trust.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo is investing $125 million in National Financial Partners,
and it expects to have about a 30 percent stake after the firm
expands rapidly by buying small financial-services companies with
cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking the new job, Ms. Bibliowicz said, she never
discussed returning to work for her father. ``I've actually only
focused on this,'' she said. Asked whether she expected to be in
business again with Weill, she added, ``Maybe I'll be a client.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Levin, which is based in New York, said that Ms.
Bibliowicz departed on good terms and that her duties would be
taken over by an operating committee of executives. Ms. Bibliowicz
also said her leaving was amicable.
</P>
<P>
   The new job represents a long-term commitment for Ms.
Bibliowicz, and a way to potentially make a huge profit herself.
She has taken an equity stake in National Financial Partners,
though she declined to provide details. The company's backers,
meanwhile, do not plan to take the firm public until they think the
market will value its stock at close to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the new firm faces tough competition from large
banks, brokerage firms and insurers, as the financial-services
industry's consolidation leads more people to handle all of their
affairs at one company. But that is also what Bibliowicz seeks to
exploit: The companies National Financial Partners acquires will be
run with a fair degree of autonomy by their former owners, who will
even retain the right to pick successors, Rosen said. At the same
time, the entire organization will use its heft to negotiate better
deals from insurers, mutual fund companies and banks.
</P>
<P>
   The individual firms need ``to have the scale to negotiate
efficiently for the products they deliver to customers,'' Rosen
said. ``Jessica more than anybody else has the ability to spearhead
our merging with these individual companies.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, National Financial Partners has acquired 28 companies
for $87 million, and it expects to spend an additional $25 million
to buy 15 to 20 more firms in the next six weeks. The firm also has
signed letters of intent to buy 60 or 70 more companies by later
this year, Rosen said.

EDWARD TRIPP, FORMER EDITOR OF YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS, DIES AT 79  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Conn., Calif., Wash., Pa.)   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Tripp, who served as editor in chief at Yale University
Press for 13 years, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Franklin,
N.C. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Among Tripp's accomplishments at Yale was the conception of the
acclaimed ``Encyclopedia of New York City,'' which was edited by
Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia University,
and published in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one with even a passing interest in New York will be able
to live without it,'' a reviewer wrote about the book in the The
New York Times in 1995. ``In one whopper of a volume about the size
of the Manhattan white pages, `The Encyclopedia of New York City'
serves up 4,300 articles by 680 authors, along with tables, lists,
charts and 688 illustrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that Tripp ``called me up out of the blue and asked
me to do an encyclopedia of New York City in 1982, and I had never
heard of such an encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He shepherded it through for the first few years and retired
before it was done, but lived long enough to see it finished and
shared in the pride,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1988 in The New York Times about the
then-book-in-progress, which was published with the New-York
Historical Society, Tripp said, ``There are books about the city,
but if you try to get any comprehensive view about the city of New
York, you'll have a very hard time _ there's just no place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why no one thought of it before,'' he added. ``I
guess New Yorkers are too busy doing other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, who lived in Hamden, Conn., acquired more than 200 books
during his years at Yale. Few, if any were as well known, however,
as the ``Encyclopedia of New York City.'' Those books included
``The Bonds of Womanhood'' by Nancy F. Cott, ``Origins of Sex'' by
Lynn Margulis, ``Vampires, Burial and Death'' by Paul Barber, ``A
Handbook of Russian Literature'' by Victor Terras, ``Paganism and
the Roman Empire'' by Ramsay MacMullen, ``A Handbook of Clinical
Dietetics'' from the American Dietetic Association and ``The
Chronicle of the Lodz Ghetto'' by Lucjan Dobroszycki.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp was born on March 9, 1920 in National City, Calif., and
raised in Whittier, Calif. He attended George Washington University
in Washington, Temple University in Philadelphia and Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 20 years working as a social worker in New York City
and as a professional violinist before entering the publishing
field in 1959 at T.Y. Crowell, a publishing house that is now part
of Harper Collins, where he headed the reference department.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, along with William Brown, an assistant professor of
African history at Yale, Tripp first approached the black historian
Rayford W. Logan to start ``The Dictionary of American Negro
Biography,'' which was published in 1983 by W.W. Norton &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   He then joined the Yale University Press in July 1971 as an
editor, became editor in chief in 1973 and editor at large in 1986
before retiring in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the most imaginative and wide-ranging editor that I
worked with in my 35 years here,'' said John G. Ryden, director of
the Yale University Press.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp also contributed to numerous articles for Scholarly
Publishing, a periodical; a children's book, ``The Tin Fiddle''
(1954), that was illustrated by Maurice Sendak, and ``Crowell's
Handbook of Classical Mythology'' (1970).
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Rhoda.

fund manager, died April 2 in New York City, his wife, Sheila,
said. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Until his retirement in 1996, Hartwell was the president of his
own firm, J.M. Hartwell &AMP; Co., which managed private accounts and
university endowment funds.
</P>
<P>
   Admired for his candor, geniality and acumen, Hartwell was
widely quoted in business publications. ``He was one of the early
pioneers in identifying the inherent value in growth stocks and
growth industries,'' said Alexander Lazer, a principal with J.M.
Hartwell &AMP; Co. ``Using his research methods, several of his former
partners went on to start well-known money management firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Everett, Mass., Hartwell graduated from Harvard College
in 1936 and from the Harvard Business School two years later. He
taught economics and accounting at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and at Rutgers University before joining the Navy as an
officer in World War II. He was awarded the Purple Heart for wounds
received during the invasion of the Marshall Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Before founding his own company, Hartwell worked as an economist
for Mutual of New York and an economic analyst in New York for Ford
Motor Co. He was also the treasurer of Piedmont Life Insurance Co.
and special assistant to the chairman of the finance committee of
the Vick Chemical Co.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, the former Sheila Walker, of New York
City, Hartwell is survived by three children, Robert, of Dorset,
Vt., John III, of Greenwich, Conn., and Kathryn Hartwell of New
York City; a brother, Richard, of Bellevue, Wash.; a sister, Tina
Hartwell of Loma Linda, Calif.; two stepchildren, Jonathan Walker
and Jason Walker, both of New York City, and two grandchildren.

AL TAYLOR, ARTIST OF QUIRKY SCULPTURE AND DRAWINGS, DIES AT 51  
(DW)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Taylor, an artist whose quirky linear sculpture
and drawings brought lyricism and charm to the austerities of
Process Art, died on March 31 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in Manhattan. He was 51 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Debbie Taylor, his
only survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was born in Springfield, Mo., and studied painting at the
Art Institute in Kansas City, Mo. He also attended the Yale-Norfolk
Summer Session in Norfolk, Conn., and the Whitney Museum of
American Art Independent Study Program in New York. He moved
permanently to New York in 1970, supporting himself by working as
an art mover and installer, a set designer's assistant and for
eight years as a studio assistant of Robert Rauschenberg.
</P>
<P>
   For many years he painted, but in 1980 he traveled to Africa and
returned without enough money to buy canvas to paint on. Inspired
by the way children in Africa fashioned toys out of trash, he began
working with materials he found on the street. His first
three-dimensional works were spare wall pieces made of broomsticks
and thin wood slats that resembled skewed architectural models or
functionless farm tools. He resisted calling himself a sculptor,
expecting to work his way back to paint on canvas.
</P>
<P>
   This seemed a distinct possibility in the early 1990s, when he
started working with liquids and gravity, creating rivers of paint
and ink that seemed to have flowed down terraced planes of clear
plastic. But some of his last works were the most sculptural,
particularly a series of iron sculptures he made in 1997 in a
village in Bavaria with the help of the local blacksmith.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had his first exhibition in New York at the Alfred Kren
Gallery in SoHo in 1986 and subsequently exhibited at the Lorence
Monk Gallery and at Nolan/Eckman. A retrospective of his work will
open at the Kunstmuseum in Lucerne, Switzerland, in July. His work
is represented in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the
Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.

SWITCH SUITS USC'S FLETCHER

<TEXT>
<P>
   Miguel Fletcher was recruited to USC to play tailback, but he
didn't resist a switch to cornerback when it was suggested this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faster playing time and more opportunity,'' the Alemany High
graduate said.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher resisted a position change last August but now sees his
future as a cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like defense and I like hitting people, too. I'm not afraid
to hit at all,'' Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being inexperienced, Fletcher has had some nice moments
in spring practice and has caught the eye of USC coach Paul
Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can plant his feet and accelerate. Once he makes his mind
up, you just watch him go,'' Hackett said. ``He has great catch-up
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher is also continuing his track career. He ran the 100
meters in 10.4 seconds earlier this season and is hoping to be down
around 10.2 when he returns to track in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of myself as a track and football player,'' Fletcher
said. ``I think I can do both.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough shines: Running back Sultan McCullough was the star
of a mini-scrimmage Thursday, breaking off about a 40-yard
touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the guy that is making a little bit of a move is
Sultan,'' Hackett said. ``Every day he gets a little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska eyes Thomas: Nebraska coaches have asked USC for
permission to contact quarterback Jason Thomas, who has decided to
transfer. Hackett said about six schools have expressed interest in
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Also interested is Nevada-Las Vegas, which is coached by former
USC coach John Robinson.

<P>
   Sol Hoffman, a longtime labor leader in the Northeast, died on
March 27 at a friend's home in Jersey City after suffering a heart
attack. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, who lived in Teaneck, N.J., was a vice president of
Unite, the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile
Employees, and a director of Unite's Pennsylvania, Ohio and South
Jersey joint board.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 8, 1932. After receiving a
bachelor's degree in economics from Brooklyn College and a master's
in economics from the University of Michigan, he began his union
career in 1954 at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union
Training Institute. He spent the rest of his career with the ILGWU,
which later became part of Unite.
</P>
<P>
   He held various positions with the union, organizing and
representing workers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Maryland,
Virginia and West Virginia. He was elected a vice president of the
ILGWU in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He was a participant in the civil rights movement in the 1950s
and the protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very much against the war,'' said Hoffman's wife,
Catherine Lewis. ``He was one of the leading organizers in
Harrisburg.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman was also chairman of the trade union council of the
Jewish Labor committee, a trustee of William Paterson College in
Wayne, N.J., and chairman of the college's board of trustees in the
early 1980s. He received an honorary doctorate of human letters
from the university in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis L. Santillo, director of external relations at what is
now William Paterson University, said Hoffman served 15 years on
the board, ``longer than any trustee in the history of the
university.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Hoffman is survived by two daughters, Florice,
of Pasadena, Calif., and Simone, of Roswell, Ga., and two
stepdaughters.

   THE LANGUAGE EXPERTS WILL BE LISTENING. Language and its power
to distort meaning to prop up political or ideological agendas
concern more people than elected officials, reports columnist Bill
Maxwell. It concerns scholars in the graduate program in rhetoric
and composition at the University of South Florida (scholars
everywhere place USF's program among the top five in the nation).
``They study language, especially the ways that words and sentence
structure map our thinking, values, emotions and actions at given
times on specific subjects,'' he writes. USF Professor Lynn Worsham
told him, ``I try to introduce students to the idea that language
shapes the world and that what we say matters.''
</P>
<P>
   DIVORCE IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. The most corrupt part of the
federal government, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
must be split apart. An agency, half corrupt, half inefficient,
cannot stand, insists columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras. ``If
reorganization does not occur soon _ splitting apart the law
enforcement and the naturalization departments, problems will
worsen. There will be more illegals; legal immigrants will be
caught up in a tangled bureaucratic web while trying to become
citizens; and millions of dollars will be spent with nothing to
show for them,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANS USED AS MASCOTS IS OFFENSIVE! IS THAT SO HARD TO
UNDERSTAND? The word Indian women today find so degrading _ squaw _
was derived from the Algonquin language and may have just meant
`woman' way back when. But since then the interpretation and
association of the word ``squaw'' by white men was ``whore,''
explains columnst Tim Giago. A North Carolina high school teenager
was recently seen on national TV expressing her pride at being
called a `squaw' _ the name of her school athletics team. ``But
this is only one of hundreds of examples of Indians being used as
mascots,'' he writes. ``Why is it so hard for people to understand
this is really offensive to Indians?''
</P>
<P>
   VIOLATIONS OF `DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL' CONTINUE. Five years into
the Clinton Administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on
gays in the military, the number of gay discharges (1,149) in 1998
is the highest in a decade _ up 86 percent since 1993, representing
a total cost to the American taxpayers of $130 million dollars,
notes columnist Chuck Colbert. What's more, he adds, anti-gay
harassment surged 120 percent _ up from 182 incidents of anti-gay
harassment in 1997 to 400 incidents in 1998. ``This doomed policy
is far too costly _ in terms of dollars spent, servicemembers
discharged, and careers ruined,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   A NEW FACE IN FITNESS. Like many of her sixth-grade girlfriends,
Ceci Gonzalez turned to sports and exercise to relieve the boredom
of growing up in Brownsville, Texas. There was one important
difference, however, writes Cary Cardwell in Hispanic Business
magazine. Ceci was the only girl lifting free weights with the boys
at St. Joseph Academy High School. Now this Latina has made her
mark in an industry dominated by Anglos. Recently winning the Ms.
Fitness USA crown, she wants others to follow her lead.

 By BILL MAXWELL 
 &HT;    (Bill Maxwell, African American, is an editorial writer and
columnist for the St. Petersburg Times in St. Petersburg, Fla. He
can be reached on the Internet at maxwell(at) sptimes.com) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TAMPA, Fla. _ As part of his campaign to revamp public education
in the state, Florida's new governor, Jeb Bush, convinced many
voters that his tuition ``vouchers'' proposal _ using tax dollars
to pay for students to attend private schools _ was benign, and he
persuaded lawmakers to pass legislation to that effect.
 &HT;    To prevail, the governor rarely used the term ``vouchers'' in
his campaign discourse. He knew that ``vouchers,'' weighed down
with images of Darwinian elitism and hints of racism, may have cost
him too many votes and too much legislative capital.
 &HT;    He used, and continues to use, the euphemism ``opportunity
scholarships'' _ language that makes the world seem like a brighter
place for everyone. After all, what rational adult opposes
``opportunity,'' especially when it helps children escape public
schools that fail to educate them?
 &HT;    Such language and its power to distort meaning to prop up
political or ideological agendas concern more people than elected
officials.
 &HT;    Scholars in the graduate program in rhetoric and composition at
the University of South Florida are concerned, too. They study
language, especially the ways that words and sentence structure map
our thinking, values, emotions and actions at given times on
specific subjects.
 &HT;    Lynn Worsham, one of the USF professors whose academic duties
revolve around language and literacy, researches and writes about
the power of expressions such as ``vouchers'' and ``opportunity
scholarships'' and their denotations and connotations.
 &HT;    In the past, English departments, including that of USF, focused
on having students read, say, an E.B. White essay and write a
500-word composition in response to it. Or students had to write
the venerable paper about their summer vacation.
 &HT;    Although these practices continue, Worsham and her colleagues,
who train future public school teachers and college professors,
believe that preparing them to teach merely the ``process'' of
writing is not enough.
 &HT;    ``One of the questions that we're interested in is who sets
standards of literacy?'' Worsham said. ``Whose literacy are we
talking about? Is it a kind of white middle-class literacy, a
literacy of professional white men, or are there multiple
literacies that we need to have access to and be fluent in so that
we can move around in the world with success and without too much
discrimination?''
 &HT;    Considered one of the nation's leading feminist theorists,
Worsham, 45, wants students to become critical thinkers. ``I try to
introduce students to the idea that language shapes the world and
that what we say matters,'' she said. ``It's not just the ideas
that get reproduced but the emotional connotation of the ideas.
 &HT;    ``So, language has a way of placing us in the world and opening
up or circumscribing possibilities. Those possibilities are not
only how we think and what we think is possible, but how we feel
and how we are placed affectively in the world with others and in
relation to ourselves.''
 &HT;    Worsham studies how language transforms events, and she is
particularly interested in the relationship between language and
violence and emotion. In fact, she believes that violence is the
most important public health issue in the world. She wants her
students to ask questions about where violence comes from, what
perpetuates it and what role language plays in inculcating a way of
thinking and feeling that are preconditions for violence.
 &HT;    ``Author Toni Morrison, in her Nobel lecture, says that
representations of violence are not just representations. They are
violence,'' says Worsham. ``Language has a way of doing violence.
 &HT;    ``I mean language in a very broad sense, the language of
everyday life, the language that is the foundation of our
institutions, the language of pedagogy. How is it that the very
ways that we teach do some cultural violence?
 &HT;    ``I'm interested in particular emotions, and I'm interested in
shaming rituals and the effects of the constant barrage of shame on
the individual at the social level to produce outbursts of a
righteous, humiliated rage. Righteousness here doesn't mean that
violence is justified. But you can understand how someone who's
been systematically denigrated over time can just lose it
entirely.''
 &HT;    Worhsam's challenge, along with that of her colleagues in the
rhetoric and composition program, is guiding students into the
various academic disciplines _ science, ethics, sociology,
philosophy, literature, medicine, art, law _ and helping them look
at their world and think about it critically, ``read'' it and write
about it. Above all, she wants students to understand that their
research is intimately linked to the ``real world.''
 &HT;    As such, even though the department's focus is on theory, the
field of rhetoric and composition is increasingly conducting
``service learning'' programs. Students go into the community to
find writing projects, which ensures that their writing will have
meaning to them.
 &HT;    ``Through service, we really are attempting to build bridges
between the academy, the workplace, the community, the
neighborhood, the church,'' Worsham said. ``We want students to see
that what they do in the academy is relevant to what they do out
there in the world full of work.''
 &HT;    USF's rhetoric and composition program is one of Florida's
best-kept secrets. Scholars everywhere place it among the top five
in the nation. It has one of the country's best records for placing
graduates in professorships. And now, with the addition of Worsham,
who joined the faculty last year, the program is attracting some of
the best graduate students.
 &HT;    ``Our program is known as a ``theory' instead of a research
program,'' said Gary Olson, director of the program. ``Our program
studies and writes about some of the most important intellectual
trends that are going on now across disciplines and their
applications for relevance to the questions of written discourse.
As one of the foremost theorists in the field, Lynn brings cutting
edge theory to the program. She adds significantly to our
strengths.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Worsham, a postmodernist with many publications, and her
students will be listening to Bush. Worsham and company will be
equally attuned to the rhetoric of Ward Connerly as he brings his
anti-affirmative action initiative to the state. They will observe
his use of language. As he did in California and Washington state,
will Connerly use terms such as ``quotas'' and ``preferential
treatment'' to shape voters' perceptions? Will he and his
supporters continue to appropriate the inspired language of slain
civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a tool in a
campaign to kill a three-decade-old program that attempts to
redress institutionalized inequity?
 &HT;    In their theory classes, Worsham and her students will be asking
these questions and writing papers that encourage honest discourse.

 By RAOUL LOWERY CONTRERAS 
 &HT;    (Raoul Lowery Contreras, Mexican American, is a columnist and
editorial board member of La Prensa San Diego. He hosts his own
radio talk show on KOGO-AM.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno announced that she will not add
another 1,000 officers to the Border Patrol. This has shocked the
anti-immigrant cabal that seeks to negatively frame the entire
immigration issue. Doris Meisner, Commissioner of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS), announced that Border Patrol
officers are to be reassigned to the border from the American
hinterland.
 &HT;    Finally, it seems, we won't have the specter of armed Border
Patrolmen chasing children through school yards in Nebraska and
spiriting them away to the border to kick them out of the country
without even notifying the schools or their parents. Scenes like
this have become common since Congress authorized the Patrol to
expand from a few hundred officers to 9,000 today.
 &HT;    When the expansion started, I appeared on a radio show with T.J.
Bonner, head of the Border Patrol union (San Diego), and he
conceded that the Patrol would never absorb such numbers, so
quickly. But, nonetheless, it has come to pass. The Border Patrol
is full of incompetent, untrained officers. Would another thousand
incompetent officers staunch the flow of illegals from Mexico and
Canada? No. Instead, they would be a waste of money.
 &HT;    Why, then, with hundreds of millions of dollars to spend, has
the INS not figured out some way to keep track of visitors planning
to overstay their visas? They can't keep them from crossing the
border, nor can they keep track of them or find them once they've
overstayed their legal visits. They also are unable to handle
applications for citizenship within a period of two years, or so.
What can the INS do right? Not much, it seems.
 &HT;    What, then, should we do with the INS? It must be split into
parts that are specialized:
 &HT;    _The law enforcement part, including the Border Patrol and the
investigative sections of the INS, should be transferred to the
Justice Department with its long history of running law enforcement
agencies, such as the FBI and the U.S. Marshall's Service.
 &HT;    _The Naturalization part must be made part of the State
Department. It must be separate from enforcement in any
reorganization _ and reorganization MUST occur.
 &HT;    If reorganization does not occur soon, problems will worsen.
There will be more illegals; legal immigrants will be caught up in
a tangled bureaucratic web while trying to become citizens; and
millions of dollars will be spent with nothing to show for them.
 &HT;    Both the attorney general and INS commissioner should be pushing
such a project, as they should for a larger guest worker program.
Let's face it, 9,000 Border Patrolmen can't seem to catch many
illegals _ unless they're children _ so something must change.
Either they throw up their hands and give up or they should seek
out positive methods of working with the problems of immigration.
 &HT;    Let me be clear in that I do not say immigration is a problem,
but there are problems in immigration. There are long waiting
periods for citizenship processing, sometimes into years upon
years. There is massive corruption of federal employees (The New
York Times had a five-part report naming the INS as the most
corrupt agency in the federal government). And, there are hundreds,
if not thousands of violations of civil rights that cost the
government hundreds of thousands of dollars.
 &HT;    Some of the violations occur across the border in Mexico. Yes,
Border Patrol bullets shot from inside the United States by
trigger-happy Border Patrolmen wounding boys _ unarmed boys _ in
Mexico. The shootings are punishment for throwing rocks. One Border
Patrolman murdered a Mexican, threatened his Patrol partner to keep
quiet, then walked out of court a free man because he ``feared for
his life.'' The Mexican victim was, of course, unarmed, shot in the
back and allowed to bleed to death.
 &HT;    Critics would destroy immigration and impose an immigration
moratorium, but that is senseless and doesn't fix the problems; it
only spreads them out over fewer people. Critics maintain that
there is some sort of national emergency with high immigration and
some illegal immigration. They are wrong. There is a national
emergency on the horizon, but it isn't immigration, it is the
graying of America. An old America that can't feed itself, that
can't replenish itself, that is unproductive and an America living
off of government checks.
 &HT;    Given proper administration by the government, the present
immigration system is a boost to America and will keep it on top of
the world in technology, social and political systems. The critics
of immigration must be stopped in their tracks before they place
the country in irreparable harm's way.
 &HT;    Proper administration starts with pruning the Border Patrol and
divorcing it from the INS. Ms. Reno, Ms. Meisner: do something
before it is too late. Border Patrol officers chasing children
through schoolyards in America is unacceptable.

 &HT;    (Tim Giago, Lakota Indian, is CEO of book publishers Lakota
Times Publishing, Inc., located in Sioux Falls, S.D. His Indian

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SIOUX FALLS, S. D. _ I do not recall ever writing a column that
could be considered as Rated R, but this one might come close.
 &HT;    It is pretty certain that the word Indian women find so
offensive _ squaw _ was derived from the Algonquin language and may
have just meant woman way back when. But, over the years, the most
common interpretation and association of the name ``squaw'' by
white men was ``whore.''
 &HT;    As the pioneers moved west and came across many other Indian
tribes who did not speak in the Algonquin dialect they still called
the Indian women they encountered ``squaws.'' It was not uncommon
for white men to say, ``I'm going to get me a little `squaw'
tonight.'' And they did not mean the size of the woman. Eventually
the word `squaw' took on all of the vulgar slang now used to
describe the private parts of a woman. All educated American Indian
women know this, hence their resentment of the word.
 &HT;    This came home to me as I watched the evening news on CNN and
saw a blonde, high school cheerleader from Erwin High School in
Asheville, N.C. stand in front of the camera and say, ``I'm proud
to be called a `squaw,''' which is the mascot name of the girls'
athletic team at this school.
 &HT;    Can you imagine any knowledgeable teenager standing in front of
a camera conveying her image internationally saying, ``I'm proud to
be called a `whore.''' And yet, to most of the Indian women
watching this newscast, this is exactly what the young white girl
was saying.
 &HT;    I have been writing about the use of Indian people as mascots
for more than 20 years. Over this period, 600 schools have dropped
the use of Indians as mascots, but nearly 2,500 have not.
 &HT;    I do not write as often about mascots as I once did. I only
write about it now because it is once more in the news and I hope I
can help to educate and change minds by giving an Indian point of
view.
 &HT;    The University of Illinois with its ``Chief Illiniwek'' is a
classic example of educated ignorance. Most of the student body,
faculty and alumni honor and cherish the ``fake'' Indian they use
as their mascot, but have venomous hatred for the ``real'' live
Indians who show up each year at homecoming to protest this racism.
Their fake mascot symbol is now more important to them than the
living race of people they once chose to honor and now dishonor.
 &HT;    There are no more Gaels or Norsemen and the Fighting Irish are
mostly African Americans. There are no teams named to honor the
Chinese, Mexican Americans or African Americans. There are no
Blackskins, Yellowskins or Brownskins, but there are Redskins. A
high school in Illinois called themselves the ``Chinks'' not too
long ago, but the school changed it because it was too racist. I
wonder why. Do you suppose the Chinese couldn't stand the honor?
 &HT;    It is true the Cleveland Indians were named for an Indian man
named Sokalexis who played for their team for about 18 months, but
would Sokalexis approve of the hideous caricature of a bucktoothed,
grinning Indian now used as a symbol on their ball caps? Reminds me
of the gruesome caricature once used to grace the walls and signs
of the infamous Sambo Restaurants. What ever happened to them? Much
too racist even to the hardcore bigots? But hey, the ugly Indian on
the hat of the Cleveland team is all right because it is meant to
honor Indians. Right? Some honor!
 &HT;    The Justice Department is now investigating the use of Indian
mascots at Erwin High School. They are questioning whether the
symbols create a racially hostile environment for the Indian
students attending that school. One argument by those favoring the
continued use of the mascots, the warriors and the squaws, has been
that the school population is only marginally Indian. If only one
Indian attending Erwin High finds the mascots degrading and
offensive, that should be reason enough to change them.
 &HT;    It should go without saying that a brand new high school,
college or professional team would never choose Indians, braves,
warriors or chiefs as mascots today. They would know these names
can be used to demean Indians and that Indians find them to be
insulting.
 &HT;    Most Indians choose not to be mimicked and ridiculed at sporting
events and all Indian women find the word ``squaw'' very offensive.
Again I ask; why is this so hard to understand?

 By CHUCK COLBERT 
 &HT;    (Chuck Colbert is a founder of the Gay and Lesbian Alumni of
Notre Dame/St. Mary's College, and serves on the board of directors
of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Five years into the Clinton Administration's ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy on gays in the military, the number of gay discharges
(1,149) in 1998 is the highest in a decade _ up 86 percent since
1993, representing a total cost to the American taxpayers of $130
million dollars.
 &HT;    What's more, anti-gay harassment surged 120 percent _ up from
182 incidents of anti-gay harassment in 1997 to 400 incidents in
1998. These incidents included not only verbal gay-bashing, but
also death threats.
 &HT;    This major finding and numerous other anecdotal accounts
document hundreds of routine violations of ``don't ask, don't
tell,'' according to a report recently released by the Washington,
D.C.-based Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN), a legal
advocacy and watch dog organization that represents gay men and
lesbians.
 &HT;    It is not supposed to be this way. Established in 1994, the
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy permits gays and lesbians to serve
in the military, but prohibits them from saying they are homosexual
or engaging in homosexual acts.
 &HT;    ``We will not witch hunt. We will not chase. We will not seek to
learn orientation,'' said Gen. Colin Powell, then chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, testifying in 1993 on behalf the new policy.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, ``our report concludes that lesbian, gay, and
bisexual service members face daily threats to their physical
safety and well-being _ not from enemies but from Uncle Sam,'' said
C. Dixon Osburn, SLDN's co-executive director.
 &HT;    Former Army Pfc. Joshua Jones experienced anti-gay harassment
first-hand in Fort Hood, Texas and ``feared for his safety when a
dead fish head was nailed to his barracks door, which in his unit
signified that the recipient would be beaten up. A note on the door
stated, `For you faggot,''' according to the SLDN report.
 &HT;    ``Military leaders have been AWOL when it comes to stopping the
anti-gay harassment. Service members have nowhere to turn inside
the military when their peers and supervisors harass and threaten
them,'' said Michelle Benecke, SLDN's co-executive director.
 &HT;    Perhaps the most disturbing trend documented by SLDN is the
growing link between asking questions and anti-gay harassment.
``Hostile commanders, supervisors, colleagues and investigators
hound service members with constant questions about their sexual
orientation and conduct. Sometimes they question the individual
directly. Many times, they question service members in front of
their peers. Lesbians, gays and bisexuals experience the
questioning not only as asking, but harassment, intimidation, and
hostility,'' states the report.
 &HT;    ``The Pentagon has officially held no one accountable for asking
or harassing a service member in violation of the policy,'' the
report continues. ``As a result more service members are disclosing
their sexual orientation in response to the asking and harassment
as the only means to protect themselves.''
 &HT;    That's what one ensign, a Naval Academy graduate, had to do:
``Living in forced isolation, in constant fear of investigation and
inadvertent disclosure is harmful to gay service personnel. Each
day I am witness to unprofessional, anti-gay comments and
attitudes. The Navy takes no action to stop this improper and
outrageous behavior on the part of its best and brightest officers.
My witness to this unfortunate anti-gay climate, and the direct
harm it causes me, forces me to disclose to you that I am gay,'' he
wrote in a letter to his commanding officer.
 &HT;    Pentagon officials have yet to respond to the SLDN report. Two
months ago, however, the undersecretary of defense for personnel
and readiness stated that 87 percent of gay discharges resulted
from voluntary statements.
 &HT;    But SLDN found that heavy-handed tactics forced many
``voluntary'' statements. Such ``statements'' include ``disclosures
made to psycho-therapists; in personal diaries; in response to
direct questions about their sexual orientation; in anonymous
on-line profiles; and those coerced out of service members due to
fear, intimidations, assaults, death threats and threats of
criminal prosecution,'' the reports states.
 &HT;    Ironically, it is the military's own heavy-handedness that is
ultimately undermining the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. The
latest 1998 Gallup poll showed 77 percent of American adults
support letting gays serve in the military. A recent poll of Army
males showed a big drop in strong opposition to gays in the
military _ down from 63 percent in 1993 to 36 percent in 1998.
 &HT;    Even the architect of don't ask, don't tell, Professor Charles
Moskos of Northwestern University, has stated that ``heavy-handed
enforcement ... will inadvertently undermine the ... policy.''
Continuing, ``It is these kinds of actions by the military, rather
than lobbying by homosexual-rights advocates, that pose the
greatest threat to the efficacy of the policy ... '' he said.
 &HT;    The sooner the more likely it is for ``don't ask, don't tell''
to implode. This doomed policy is far too costly _ in terms of
dollars spent, servicemembers discharged, and careers ruined.

 c. 1999 Hispanic Business 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Like many of her sixth-grade girlfriends, Ceci Gonzalez turned
to sports and exercise to relieve the boredom of growing up in
Brownsville, Texas. There was one important difference, however.
Ceci was the only girl lifting free weights with the boys at St.
Joseph Academy High School.
 &HT;    ``It was pretty much just me and the football team in the weight
room,'' she recalls with a laugh. Some of her girlfriends may have
snickered, but her track coach assured her that strength training
would help her excel outside the weight room _ in track,
gymnastics, and later in her career.
 &HT;    Now age 24, Ceci Gonzalez Evans credits her continued interest
in strength and fitness training for helping her succeed. She
earned a track scholarship to the University of Houston as a
sophomore in 1990, and most recently was crowned Ms. Fitness USA
1999 during a national competition in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    ``When I graduated from U of H, I still had a competitive drive
and needed an outlet. I was still into lifting weights, but I
didn't want to go into body building. I didn't want to get big,''
she says. ``I heard about a fitness competition at the U of H the
next month, and I went to it and decided it was for me. It was high
energy, perfect for someone like me with a dance and gymnastic
background.''
 &HT;    Fitness competition for women is a growing trend, with events
pulling in major sponsors such as Bally Total Fitness and MET-RX, a
nutritional supplement. It differs from body building by
emphasizing body shaping as opposed to building muscle mass.
 &HT;    ``The look the judges want is like a model with muscles,''
Gonzalez Evans
 &HT;    says. ``You have to look lean and feminine. It's not that
`ripped-to-the-bone' look of body building. They want you to look
feminine but defined, with muscles.
 &HT;    ``It's like a beauty pageant with muscles,'' she says of the
contests, which include evening gown and talent competitions as
well as a swimsuit event that reveals muscle tone. ``It's the same
sequence as a real beauty pageant, but it focuses more on the
feminine side of body building.''
 &HT;    Gonzalez Evans, who met (and later married) her coach, Tommy
Evans, while he was playing football and she was performing as a
heptathlete for the University of Houston, says she would like to
see more Hispanics take up strength and fitness training.
 &HT;    She recently returned to Brownsville as a guest of her cousin
Frank Trevino, a counselor at Vela Middle School, where she talked
to at-risk teens. She pointed to Selena as an example of the energy
and grace that can come from fitness and strength training.
 &HT;    ``I got a lot of my ideas from her, and used Latin routines to
set myself apart from the other girls (contestants), most of whom
were doing hip-hop and funky dance routines,'' Gonzalez Evans says.
 &HT;    She spoke to about 100 kids, who eagerly responded with
questions and requests for autographed pictures. ``When we left, my
cousin told me that many of those boys I had been talking to were
gang members, but I had touched a side of them you usually don't
see, because they have to act tough all the time. These kids just
need something else to put their energy into.''
 &HT;    It took Gonzalez Evans three years of competition to win the Ms.
Fitness USA crown. But she says exercise routines aren't just for
those at the competitive level. With women's sports on the rise at
both the amateur and professional levels, she says this is a
perfect time for women of all backgrounds to set goals and work out
_ especially Hispanics.
 &HT;    ``Maybe there aren't that many into it because you don't see
many Latinos on television doing the fitness stuff,'' she says.
``But I could have shied away from it or gone with it. And I went
with it. Somebody's got to break those barriers. Right now, it's an
industry that's pretty, blond, and blue-eyed _ and that's got to
change.''

splendid minutes, I had the place all to myself. I could look at
things as Thoreau did when he explored the thicket of ideas about
self-reliance and spiritual immanence that he later shaped into
``Walden,'' one of the great works of American transcendentalism. I
also savored the amusing fact that I had come to this abashed,
intense interlude of personal reflection primarily as a customer of
a new vehicle of historical tourism called the Literary Trail of
Greater Boston. By Will Joyner.

POLICE PROFILING DEBATE: ACTING ON EXPERIENCE, OR ON BIAS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Conn., Fla., Ill., Ind., Mass., Md., Mo., Ohio,
N.J., N.Y.,   Pa., Texas, Va.)   (rk) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The police consider it a crucial crime-fighting tool based on
street savvy. Critics contend it is a potentially fatal weapon that
betrays deep institutional racism.
</P>
<P>
   Profiling _ the use of race and ethnicity as clues to
criminality _ is at the heart of federal and state investigations
into police behavior in New Jersey and New York City. It is the
subtext of the outrage over the fatal shooting two months ago of
Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant, by four white New
York officers in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   It is the subject of bills pending in Congress and a dozen state
legislatures, and the U.S. Customs Service announced Thursday that
it would examine allegations of profiling by its inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Determining when and how the police should use race or ethnicity
to assess suspects and situations, though, is a complicated
balancing act of public safety and civil liberties. Law enforcement
experts insist that effective police work depends upon quick
analysis, and that skin color is one factor among many _ like dress
or demeanor _ that officers must consider.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing chorus of community leaders see a presumptive
linking of minorities to crime that has caused intolerable
humiliation and physical abuse of innocent citizens _ even Diallo's
death.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the aggressive policing strategy that has helped
reduce crime in New York and around the nation, officers often cast
a wide net in hopes of turning up illegal drugs and guns.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the profiling debate is the question of whether to
focus, for example, on the 9,500 arrests made over the last two
years by New York's Street Crime Unit, or the 35,000
stop-and-frisks officers reported that turned up nothing. How many
innocent people must be inconvenienced to keep streets safe?
</P>
<P>
   Several studies give credence to the complaints of black and
Hispanic citizens that compared with whites, they are so frequently
stopped on highways and frisked on city streets that only racial
profiling can explain the pattern. But African-American and
Hispanic people are also overrepresented among those charged with
major crimes _ especially murder and robbery _ and in the nation's
prison population.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers often use those statistics to justify profiling,
while critics question whether it has become a self-fulfilling
prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is law enforcement begins to use blackness as
the proxy for propensity to be involved in crime,'' said David
Harris, a law professor at the University of Toledo who is writing
a report on profiling for the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stop more blacks because more of them are in jail,'' he
said. ``When we stop them more, we'll find more stuff on them,
we'll arrest more of them proportionally, we'll convict more of
them proportionally, there'll be more of them in jail, and around
the circle we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Police chiefs acknowledge that some officers focus
inappropriately on African-American and Hispanic people, and say
that they are eager to address that fact through discipline and
retraining.
</P>
<P>
   But some are worried about overreaction: in rejecting a measure
that would have allowed troopers to stop motorists for not wearing
seat belts, Virginia lawmakers worried that officers would unfairly
concentrate on black drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cops are profiling all the time, your good cops;
unfortunately, now that's developing a bad name,'' said William J.
Bratton, former police commissioner of New York City. ``Whether
they call it profiling, or street smarts, awareness _ whatever the
names might be _ profiling is essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratton recalled a summer when he was a rookie patrolling in
Boston. There was a rash of stolen Lincoln Continentals, so
officers began looking twice when Lincolns passed. White
businessmen who seemed likely to own such vehicles were allowed to
keep driving, while black teen-agers were often pulled over, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   They found a lot of stolen cars, he recalled. What they can
never know is how many of the white drivers were car thieves as
well.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, officers in Illinois learned that trucks from
Texas were being used by drug couriers, according to Ronald S.
Neubauer, the police chief in St. Peters, Mo., and president of the
International Association of Police Chiefs. Troopers quickly
stopped four trucks with Texas plates; all four were driven by
Mexicans, all four were loaded with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean they're racially profiling Mexicans? I don't
think so,'' Neubauer said. ``We train our officers to be wary of
suspicious circumstances. I don't want my officers to act out on
bias, I want them to act out on their training and experience.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   New York City police cadets typically receive about six months
of training in the academy, including at least one seminar focused
on diversity and racial sensitivity. But most experts acknowledge
that the more important training comes once police officers hit the
streets, often at the hands of their veteran partners.
</P>
<P>
   There, officers develop what they call their ``sixth sense,''
the instinctive ability to sniff out situations or isolate
individuals who seem potentially unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is as simple as noticing a person out of place _ a
shabby youth in a tony suburb, for example, or a pinstriped suit in
a gritty ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is informed by a known criminal pattern, like
Bratton's Lincolns or Neubauer's Texas trucks. Often, though, it is
as vague and subjective as a furtive look or an uneasy gait,
something officers know as well as their own shield numbers, but
cannot precisely name.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a thin line between appropriate behavior and
inappropriate behavior,'' said James J. Fyfe, a former New York
officer who teaches criminal justice at Temple University in
Philadelphia. ``A person's characteristics are one of the things
upon which police officers base their actions; the problem is when
it becomes the primary thing, or the only thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The police have broad discretion in whom to stop. The legal
standard justifying a stop-and-frisk, the maneuver that has become
the controversial hallmark of New York's Street Crime Unit, is
``reasonable suspicion,'' a fuzzy concept. On the highway, evidence
of a traffic infraction is required to stop a car, but studies have
shown that so many drivers commit such offenses that it is largely
a matter of discretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cops work on an exception principle: they learn what's normal
in a neighborhood, and things that are abnormal draw their
attention; quite often, that involves issues of race,'' Fyfe
explained. ``Their whole frame of reference in approaching them is
framed by their experience. It's a police application of what we
all do.''
</P>
<P>
   Neubauer said: ``If you didn't stereotype in your life every
day, you'd have total confusion. We seem to have singled out the
law enforcement arena as the target to try and cure.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is because police officers have broad powers to
abridge individual rights. Some blame Diallo's death in a hail of
41 bullets on profiling; the four officers who have been indicted
in the case were searching that night for a black rapist.
</P>
<P>
   Most incidences of profiling are much subtler, but critics
contend that the increasing perception that the police mistreat
members of minority groups could have a corrosive long-term effect
on public safety that overshadows the short-term benefit of a crime
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every prominent black politician, athlete and businessman
_ not to mention urban teen-ager _ seems to have a personal story
of being stopped and searched, harassed and harangued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the impact of those stories, as they permeate those
communities, that causes problems for effective community-police
relations,'' said Karim Ismaili, a criminal justice professor at
St. John's University in New York who taught cultural sensitivity
seminars at the New York Police Academy last fall. ``There's this
spiral of fear and mistrust; this affects both the officer and the
citizen and the public in general.''
</P>
<P>
   At Citizens Opposing Profiled Police Stops (www.copps.org), they
hear complaints not only from black and Hispanic men, but also from
Grateful Dead fans and white kids with baggy pants, long hair and
tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Brown, the African-American sports agent who helped found
the group last year, said it has happened to him several times,
including a particularly painful incident while on a family
vacation in Florida. Officers pulled him over on the highway, told
him he ``fit a profile'' and asked to search his car. Finding
nothing, he recalled, they suggested he have a nice day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stuff is all over the highway. Have a nice day?'' Brown
said, angered anew. ``My wife's panties, her personal items _ they
went all through the stuff. How do you have a nice day?''
</P>
<P>
   There have been no nationwide studies analyzing the rate of
stops and searches by race, but several narrower surveys have
turned up results that Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., called ``too
outrageous to be a mere coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, the state police agreed as part of a court
settlement to track the race of drivers that troopers stopped and
searched on a stretch of I-95. Only 17 percent of the drivers on
that road were black, but more than 70 percent of those searched in
the first 20 months were African-American.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey judge found in 1996 that troopers had an illegal
practice of making targets of minority drivers, citing a ``stark''
disparity in which blacks were 4.85 times as likely to be stopped
as whites.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers is expected to introduce a bill in the coming weeks that
would require all police officers in the country to record the
race, among other things, of every person they stop on the highway.
Similar legislation passed the House last year but died in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, parallel measures are pending in at least a dozen
state legislatures, including Connecticut's and New Jersey's, and
police chiefs in Philadelphia, San Diego and San Jose have recently
decided to collect such data independently.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney general, Janet Reno, called Thursday for the
collection of information on police stops to examine ``the feelings
of Americans who feel that police officers are stopping them
because of race.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of profiling say the practice grows out of aggressive
policing strategies, like New York's, that stress statistics and
reward officers who make the most arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an organized tactic where we cast an extremely broad net
and we hope we're going to catch one or two drug runners,'' said
John Crew, the San Francisco lawyer who runs the ACLU's police
practices unit. ``If you're doing stops based on hunch, it's also
inevitable that both conscious and subconscious racism will creep
into those decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew said it was not enough to attack explicit statements like
those in a manual used by the Public Agency Training Council in
Indianapolis, which suggests stopping all cars with ``Jamaican
paraphernalia, bumper stickers or slogans.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a police supervisor just told his troops, ``What we're
really trying to do is target drugs coming up from Tijuana,'' it
could be problematic, Crew said, because officers might interpret
it as: Stop Hispanic drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves the law enforcement question: how to take aim at
drugs coming up from Tijuana?
</P>
<P>
   ``They once asked Willie Sutton why he robbed banks, and he
said, `Because that's where the money is,''' said James Savage,
acting president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association in New
York. ``Why do you send people into minority or high-crime
neighborhoods to look for guns? Because that's where the guns
are.''

CONGRESS STANDS BETWEEN CHINA AND GLOBAL TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: See also CHINA-U.S., CHINA-SCENE, NUKE-CHINA)  
(DW) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To complete the process of bringing China into the
global trading system, the Clinton administration must not only
resolve the outstanding economic issues between the two countries
but must also persuade Congress to amend a trade law that lumps
China with a group of pariah nations.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has no direct say over whether China or any other
nation can join the World Trade Organization, the body that
enforces the rules of global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But China is subject to a 1974 law that limits the trading
privileges the United States can grant countries that Congress
judges to be suppressing their own people, and some members of both
parties are intent on using the law to block a deal. Although China
could join the trade organization without a change in the law, the
effect would be to leave China subject to different terms from the
United States than it would have with the rest of the world, an
outcome that would be unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of
1974, legislation passed with the intent of pressuring the Soviet
Union and other Communist nations to allow more emigration. The
amendment allows an annual waiver if Congress and the
administration agree that it would promote the law's goals.
</P>
<P>
   China has been granted a waiver each year since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties in Congress have long used the leverage of trade
status to press China to improve its human rights record, curb its
exports of nuclear technology, create better conditions for workers
and open its markets. Anti-China sentiment in Congress has been
running strong in the last few weeks because of reports that China
stole nuclear secrets from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader,
said on Wednesday that he would oppose admitting China into the
World Trade Organization. Other members of Congress are considering
legislation that would require Congressional approval before any
deal that would clear China's admission.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a sizable bipartisan bloc eager to bring China
into the trading system, and it is backed by powerful interests,
including exporters who want greater access to China's huge market.

LAKERS' PATH GETS TOUGHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Several weeks and several upheavals ago, the
Lakers' goals were clear: Win the Pacific Division, capture the top
seed in the conference, gain home-court advantage throughout the
playoffs, win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   The last objective is still attainable, but the route to the NBA
Finals will probably be tougher because the other items on the list
are nearly out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, with 13 games to go in a compact season that has
evaporated in a flash, the Lakers were five games behind Portland
in the Pacific, fifth overall in the West and still battling to
gain even one round of home-court advantage in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But failing to win top seeding won't necessarily be considered a
failure, Kobe Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah and no. That was our ultimate goal and it still is a
goal. But to get to that in the first place, the main thing we
constantly said is you have to improve to get there. You have to
take it one day at a time and that's what we're trying to do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wanna be in front, don't get me wrong. If we could trade
spots and say we'd be at the top spot and have home-court advantage
throughout the playoffs, that'd be great.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not entirely out of reach. The Lakers will have a virtual
mini-playoff with Portland to decide Pacific Division supremacy, as
they face the Trail Blazers four times in the last 11 games,
starting Tuesday at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is play to improve, play to get
better,'' Bryant said. ``We're not even close to playing our best
basketball. But we're still in the hunt, we're still in the race,
we're still playing good basketball.... Like I said, just continue
to learn. It's fun, going through a trial process. It's all
good.'' &QL;

MAJOR TRADE DEAL ELUDES CLINTON, ZHU &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENNIFER DAY 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a distinct chill in Sino-U.S. relations in the
air despite the warm spring day, President Clinton and Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji failed to reach a major trade accord Thursday
but spoke out on issues including allegations of Chinese espionage
and human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   At a joint news conference, Zhu admitted his country has some
work to do in the area of human rights, long a major concern among
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I concede that there is room for improvement in human rights
in China,'' the premier said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, who is thought by many to be a moderate force, is visiting
the U.S. capital during his nine-day trip, the third in a series of
high-level exchanges between Washington and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   On a topic that has dogged the Clinton administration, Zhu said
he and Chinese President Jiang Zemin knew nothing about allegations
that China stole U.S. nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pressed the premier to cooperate with a U.S. Department
of Justice probe into those allegations as well as other charges
that a high-ranking Chinese military intelligence chief may have
donated $300,000 to the president's 1996 campaign through a Los
Angeles Democratic fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major items on the two leaders' agendas was to
produce a long-awaited agreement on China's membership in the World
Trade Organization, which enforces international trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton reported negotiators had made progress,
particularly in the areas of agriculture, no agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   Before Zhu and Clinton met in the Oval Office to discuss several
issues beyond human rights and trade organization access, a crowd
of about 100 gathered in a park opposite the White House to protest
over human rights issues, particularly in Tibet, and missiles aimed
at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the red-carpet welcoming ceremony when the
rousing music and gun salute stopped, faint echoes of the
protesters' chants could be heard.
</P>
<P>
   T. Kumar, Amnesty International's advocacy director for Asia,
said Zhu's statement was a step in the right direction but that it
had to be followed up by action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome that statement, but we want him to match the words
with deeds,'' Kumar said. ``When (Chinese leaders are) in the U.S.
and looking for access to WTO, they will make statements like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said that he also believes different countries have
different standards for what constitutes human rights, a claim
Kumar rejected on the grounds that China has signed two
international covenants on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The premier also needled the president a bit, saying a friend of
his had come to him with examples of human rights violations in the
United States and told him to ask Clinton about them during his
visit.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu did not, he said, ``because I trust you are able to
resolve your own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not respond to the comment, but earlier in his
opening statement said there is still disagreement between the two
countries on the meaning and reach of human rights. He also said he
regrets that China has failed to open talks with the Dalai Lama,
the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I am convinced that greater freedom, debate and
openness are vital to improving China's citizens' lives as well as
China's economy over the long run, it is troubling that in the past
year, China has taken some steps backwards on human rights in
basically arresting people basically for seeking to express their
political views,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent crackdowns on democratic activists have been one of many
factors to anger U.S. legislators in recent months. Reports that
China stole nuclear secrets have also spurred criticism of China
and of Clinton's handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Zhu's denial of any episodes of espionage,
Clinton said it is possible it could have occurred without

   ``China is a big country with a big government, and I can only
say that America is a big country with a big government, and
occasionally things happen in this government that I don't know
about,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Several legislators have said they could not trust any agreement
made with China, including one on World Trade Organization
membership, in part, because of the spying allegations. Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., is heading a panel investigating
technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
   He said Thursday on CNN's ``Moneyline`` that he believes the
United States must continue talks with China, as all nations must
continue to communicate effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to sell and import Beanie Babies, provided
they're not made with slave labor,'' Cox said. ``It's another thing
entirely to have a Wal-Mart for our nuclear weapons.''

<P>
   Clinton said he hopes soon that both countries will ratify the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to end all nuclear testing and
encouraged China to settle its differences with Taiwan peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks on Taiwan came after Zhu said he could not
rule out aggression against the island, which for many years was
recognized by the United States as the legitimate government of
China after Communists seized control of the mainland. Under
Clinton, however, U.S. policy has shifted to support Taiwan's
reunification with China.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said he could not rule out force ``because if we were to
make such a pledge, make such an undertaking, then I'm afraid
Taiwan would be in a perpetual state of separation from the
motherland.''

 &HT;    Buchanan brings vote-rocking views to Bush's turf
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Pat Buchanan, who history says can't win the
presidency but can make life miserable for others who can, is
heading into the heart of Bush country.
</P>
<P>
   The third-time GOP candidate is bringing his fire-and-brimstone
campaign to Midland-Odessa next Wednesday for a town meeting
centered on what can be done to shut the valve on ``cheap foreign
oil.'' Buchanan campaign manager Jay Townsend said Thursday the
Texas trip is targeted at an issue, not a foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message is that we have disagreements with the White House
and some people in our party over U.S. trade policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about George Bush,'' Townsend said. ``The time for
that discussion will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Buchanan is a long shot for the GOP nomination, the
eventual winner will have to go through him in New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary. In 1992, Buchanan picked up 37 percent
of the New Hampshire vote in running second to then-President
George Bush, offering the first hint that the incumbent was in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Buchanan won the New Hampshire primary, throwing a
major scare into eventual nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's 2000 campaign already is heavy on evidence that he
and Bush are headed for major disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not born to vast wealth or a famous political dynasty,''
Buchanan said in a fund-raising letter. ``In this campaign, we will
be facing candidates who enjoy these advantages.'' On issues, Bush
and Buchanan differ in approach and philosophy. Both oppose
abortion rights, but Bush says he does not believe the country is
ready for a constitutional amendment banning the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan fired back by saying, ``I think leadership requires you
to stand up and say `This is wrong, and our goal is to end abortion
in the United States.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's early campaign rhetoric also is heavy on the
isolationism that marked his previous races and puts him on a
collision course with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no vital American interest in fighting over whose
flag flies over Pristina,'' Buchanan said when the bombs started
flying in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, after hours of briefings with foreign policy advisers, has
stuck to a carefully worded stance on the Serbian conflict. He said
Thursday that it is in the United States' best interests to
preserve a ``stable, peaceful Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that a thug like Milosevic, if left unchecked,
can set a bad example for other ethnic cleansers,'' said Bush,
adding he is concerned about ``whether or not the bombing campaign
is being done with ferocity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Buchanan also disagree on the North American Free Trade
Agreement. To Buchanan, it's a deal that ``sold out America's
workers, ravaged our manufacturing base and caused disruption in
our small towns and farming communities.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bush, NAFTA is ``an enormous success.''
</P>
<P>
   The foes also differ on China, a foreign policy issue that Bush
tackled publicly Thursday for the first time, calling for dealing
with China ``in a very firm and consistent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we ought to have trade with China. I also believe
that free trade with China will help develop the entrepreneurial
class in China,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Dead wrong, says Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first myth is the Utopian belief that peace descends on
the wings of trade,'' he said in a San Francisco speech on Monday.
``As long as we trade with China, it is said, we need never
confront China. History, however, reveals this notion to be bunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, and only at a reporter's urging, Bush on Thursday
delved into the differences between himself and Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not subscribe to protectionism, isolationism,'' he said.
``I think it would be a big mistake for America to retreat during
this era when we have got a chance to influence the world in a
positive, constructive way. At home, I know that walling off Texas
from Mexico would be an unmitigated disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan puts his name on the idea, promising to ``lengthen the
`Buchanan Fence' on the southern frontier, repatriate illegals and
repair the great American melting pot.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious differences, Buchanan has said he will keep
his rhetoric against Bush to a minimum, at least for now. Buchanan
has promised to give Bush and Elizabeth Dole ``a decent interval''
to lay out their agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Bush picked up a major political plum Thursday
when New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg, who wields the state's best
political machine, signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Former state GOP Assistant Chairman Barbara Russell and Rob
Thompson, a businessman and former top political aide to former New
Hampshire Gov. Steve Merrill, will be co-chairs of the Bush
campaign in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's point person in New Hampshire is Shelly Uscinski,
chair of the state's Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush promises to do no out-of-state campaigning until
after the Texas Legislature adjourns on May 31, he took advantage
of satellite technology Thursday evening to talk directly from
Austin to New Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to come up to New Hampshire and begin a grass-roots
campaign,'' he said in a live interview on WMUR-TV of Manchester.
``I understand that New Hampshire is retail politics and I look
forward to coming up there to shake as many hands as I can, look
people in the eye and tell them where my heart is.''

 &HT;    Tort reform bill passes committee
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A specially created Senate subcommittee handling
all tort-reform bills this session passed a key civil justice
reform measure Thursday, but senators, lobbyists and the House
committee chairman who would get the bill say it may be too late to
pass it for the session.
</P>
<P>
   Senators and lobbyists say the subcommittee passage of the
tort-reform bill illustrates a strategic miscalculation by Lt. Gov.
Rick Perry and by the subcommittee chairman, state Sen. Troy Fraser
(R-Horseshoe Bay) one of the Legislature's foremost tort-reform
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Perry called the miscalculation allegation ``bad information''
and said bringing up the bill for a Senate vote next week should
not harm its chances.
</P>
<P>
   Failure of the third-party liability bill _ a top priority for
Texans for Lawsuit Reform and its principal backer, Houston
developer Dick Weekley _ would mark the third session the proposal
died. The bill would limit how much businesses might pay for
injuries when they are not the sole cause of the harm.
</P>
<P>
   Perry had referred the third-party liability bill directly to
Fraser's subcommittee instead of to the full Economic Development
Committee in a rare move that bypassed the committee's chairman,
Sen. David Sibley.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's bumpy ride brought to the forefront _ again _
Fraser's awkward relationship with Sibley (R-Waco), who authored
the tort-reform bill. Sibley had been the point man for tort reform
measures in past sessions, but Perry has tried to give the lead to
Fraser, a longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser's subcommittee on technology and business growth approved
the bill by a 3-0 vote, with two senators absent.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the legislation had been conducted March 18. Fraser
had tried to refer the measure to the full committee without a
subcommittee vote, but withdrew that effort after several
colleagues criticized the effort as an extraordinary breach of
Senate procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser said Sibley had offered the motion. But Sibley said he
signed the motion, as the bill's author, at Fraser's request.
</P>
<P>
   If it had worked, the bill might have reached the Senate floor a
week earlier, perhaps increasing its chances for passage.
</P>
<P>
   Senators and lobbyists close to the tort-reform effort say
Weekley was ``livid'' and ``went berserk'' about the delay in
getting the bill to the Senate floor. But Weekley denied that
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed,'' Weekley said. ``But I'm thrilled to
death that it got out today.''
</P>
<P>
   The delay does not mean the bill is dead, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill stalled in what had been considered a sympathetic
five-member subcommittee, widely assumed to have been created by
Perry to benefit Fraser. But one Republican Sen. John Carona of
Dallas, who has been supported by Weekley's group, would not commit
to the legislation after hearing predictions of higher worker
compensation insurance rates for business owners.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would allow juries to allocate fault in
personal-injury lawsuits in two ways that could reduce damages paid
by businesses. Carona was concerned about one that would allow
juries in personal-injury cases to calculate damages against an
employer and another company when both had liability for an
on-the-job injury.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee heard testimony that the bill might lead to
higher worker's comp rates for employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Trial Lawyers Association, one of the chief opponents
of the bill, contends injured employees would be forced under the
legislation to lose money they might have recovered in full from
the second company.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Carona was lobbied hard over the long Easter
weekend by tort-reform groups. Carona would only say that he told
Fraser last Friday that he would vote the bill out of the
subcommittee. State Rep. Fred Bosse (D-Houston), House Civil
Practices Committee chairman, said the delay in getting Sibley's
bill to the House would dim its prospects. Bosse said he did not
favor the legislation but intended to give it a full hearing, if
possible, considering as many as 70 bills awaiting hearings in his
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one I intend to put on high priority,'' he said.

FEDERAL JUDGE THROWS OUT DOW JONES LIBEL RULING &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ED ASHER 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A federal judge on Thursday threw out a $22.7 million
libel ruling against Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones &AMP; Co.,
saying the plaintiff, a now-defunct Houston investment firm, had
withheld important evidence.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Ewing Werlein said he will void an
earlier judgment in favor of MMAR Group Inc. and give Dow Jones a
new trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``From clear and convincing evidence, the court finds that MMAR
obtained its favorable verdict through its own misconduct and
misrepresentations,'' preventing Dow Jones from ``fully and
fairly'' presenting its defense, the judge said in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Paul Steiger, managing editor of The Wall Street
Journal, said: ``We are very pleased with the court's decision and
are quite optimistic as this case returns to the District Court.
We've long maintained that we did not cause MMAR's collapse but
merely chronicled it.''
</P>
<P>
   MMAR attorneys could not be reached for comment late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   MMAR, a brokerage firm that bought and sold securities for
customers, sued for libel after the newspaper published a highly
critical story by reporter Laura Jereski on Oct. 21, 1993. The
company claimed the story had caused it to go out of business in
mid-November 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal wrote that MMAR had mispriced the market
value of some securities by 10 percent or more to hide portfolio
losses. Such procedures, the story also said, may have been a
factor in a $50 million loss by the Louisiana State Employees
Retirement System.
</P>
<P>
   A jury found in favor of MMAR in 1997, awarding it a stunning
$222.7 million in damages, the largest amount ever awarded by a
jury in a libel case.
</P>
<P>
   Werlein later struck the $200 million in punitive damages but
allowed $22.7 million in compensatory damages to stand.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, Dow Jones attorneys contended that they had
found out that MMAR had withheld, destroyed and altered evidence
that was central to their defense.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, the judge said a former MMAR employee, William A.
Fincher, told the paper's attorneys in July 1998 that the brokerage
had failed to turn over damaging tape recordings and that he had
copies of some of those tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Fincher also said that MMAR Chief Executive Officer Cory Miner
had pressured him in 1995 to erase portions of the tapes, which he
said he had declined to do.
</P>
<P>
   Fincher died July 8, 1998, when his private plane crashed in
Belize.
</P>
<P>
   Werlein wrote that several of the audiotapes, taken from an
``extensive tape-recording system,'' contain conversations that
would have been ``extremely helpful'' to Dow Jones, particularly in
its defense against one of the most damaging allegations in the
article: that MMAR hid a portfolio's losses by ``mismarking''
securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mismarking'' is misrepresenting the value of securities, that
is, by telling a client that a stock, bond or other security is
worth more than it will bring on the open market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The judge cited one conversation between Miner and Chuck Ramsey,
a former MMAR officer and salesman and the unnamed source Jereski
used to report the mismarking allegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Miner, apparently suspicious that Mr. Ramsey had been a
source for Ms. Jereski, recorded the conversation by using a
microphone concealed in what appeared to be a pen,'' the judge
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The two discussed the mismarking reported in Jereski's article,
the judge said, and Ramsey is heard on tape saying, ``I heard Rich
Evans, (not identified, but presumably an MMAR employee) stand
there day after day, talk about (expletive deleted) trying to get
that position in line. So if you don't think he was mismarking that
position? I know (profanity deleted) good and well he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Another conversation between MMAR officers leaves ``a reasonable
inference'' that securities were mispriced or mismarked, Werlein
said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said three tapes, ``in the aggregate, and each
individually, contain significant evidence to suggest that MMAR had
engaged in mismarking'' securities that Jereski had written about.
</P>
<P>
   Werlein continued, ``The evidence submitted in connection with
(Dow Jones' motion for a new trial) is clear and convincing that
MMAR engaged in serious misconduct during the pretrial discovery
phase of this case, and that MMAR's misconduct prevented defendants
from fully and fairly presenting their defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge concluded that MMAR's verdict was unfairly obtained
because of its ``misrepresentations and misconduct.''

FRANCO PLAYS THE LONG SHOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ You don't pull yourself out of poverty by being
passive. That much, Carlos Franco knows for sure. From a barefoot
caddie in his native Paraguay to a card-carrying member of the PGA
Tour, Franco has overcome odds more lopsided than Augusta National
Golf Club's severe, undulating greens.
</P>
<P>
   There were times during the opening round of the Masters on
Thursday when Franco admittedly would have been wise to back off
his attack. He came at Augusta National so boldly, lopping four
shots off par in the first 11 holes, you just knew it was just a
matter of time before the course struck back.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, she exacted her revenge on the 15th hole, a
beguiling 500-yard par-5 that dares you to ignore the water in the
front and back of the green and go for the flag in two. Franco, who
is as long as the list of professional golfers in Paraguay is
short, did just that.
</P>
<P>
   After crushing his drive, he took a 5-iron and flew his second
shot over the green and into the creek. A one-stroke penalty, a
chip and three putts later, Franco had registered a double-bogey 7
and relinquished his share of the lead, at minus-3.
</P>
<P>
   He'd give another stroke back on the next hole, a 170-yard
par-3, and miss by inches a birdie putt on 18 to finish at even-par
72.
</P>
<P>
   From all alone in first at 4-under par to tied for 21st (12
golfers weren't able to complete their rounds before play was
suspended because of darkness), it was a precipitous fall. Franco,
though, emerged from the experience unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Standing under the shade of an old oak tree near the clubhouse,
he described himself as ``(begin ital)muy contento(end ital).'' No
translation was necessary; Franco's beatific expression rendered
the interpreter's words redundant:
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he is very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Franco broke par for the first time before he ever
broke in a pair of golf shoes. He was 14 when he first played a
round with proper footwear and 18 before he owned his first set of
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the age of 33, Franco is a proud PGA Tour Qualifying
School graduate, Class of 1998. He is paid handsomely to use one
company's clubs and he never wants for shoes and his family wants
for absolutely nothing. Let other people count the strokes he
squandered; Franco would prefer to count his blessings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one moment I was first, in another moment I had an
accident,'' he said, shrugging. ``I'm not very concerned about it.
He who doesn't risk anything doesn't win anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco went for broke as a youngster, because then he didn't
have much to lose. He and his six siblings (including five
brothers, all of whom are excellent golfers) grew up in the
Paraguayan capital of Asuncion. Their father was a greenskeeper at
Asuncion Golf Club, one of only three courses in the South American
country of 5 million. Home was a one-room shack with no indoor
plumbing and no television.
</P>
<P>
   Franco was 18 when he saw his first Masters telecast. Two years
later, he watched Jack Nicklaus win the 1986 tournament at the age
of 46 and a dream took root.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked Jack Nicklaus because he is aggressive like
me,'' Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   One day, he decided, he would play Augusta National like Jack.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now it's not a dream,'' said the man who reminds his peers
of someone not named Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a Dalyesque golf swing,'' said first-round co-leader
Brandel Chamblee, alluding to the PGA Tour's Long John. ``He's very
talented. All the guys out here know who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who doesn't ``will know about him soon enough,'' said
former Masters winner Larry Mize, who was paired with Franco in the
first round (Jeff Sluman rounded out the threesome).
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who finished tied for third at the Honda Classic last
month, is exalted in his homeland. There are no Paraguayan
reporters here, but the tournament is being televised live in
Asuncion. His wife Celsa and two sons, ages 10 and 8, are ensconced
there, in a two-story, five-bedroom house.
</P>
<P>
   Franco's family is safe and secure, but his country is not. Late
last month, Luis Maria Argana, the vice president of the coalition
government, was assassinated, a sober reminder of just how tough
and tenuous a transition it is from a military dictatorship to a
democracy, even 10 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy because I'm playing golf,'' said Franco, a 1998
member of the international President's Cup team who spent five
years playing on the Japanese tour before coming to the U.S. ``But
when I think of the poor people, I am very concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   In seven PGA Tour starts, Franco has made four cuts and earned
more than $220,000. That's about a hundred times more than his
deceased father made in a year. No question he has earned this
flight of fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the leaderboard and saw my name and it was a nice
feeling,'' Franco said. ``I feel very confident. I think I can
create something here.'' &QL;

FIVE DIE WHEN SPEEDING CAR PLUNGES OFF L.A. COUNTY FREEWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGUA DULCE, Calif. -- Four young men and a teen-age girl were
killed Thursday when their speeding car careened off the Antelope
Valley Freeway, slammed into a mountain and rolled about 50 feet
down an embankment.
</P>
<P>
   Three carloads of friends stopped on the freeway near Vasquez
Rocks County Park and ran back to the crash scene, where three of
the victims had been thrown from the Acura Legend, with a fourth
passenger and the driver trapped inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth car was trying to catch up with the other three
cars when the driver lost control,'' said Assistant Chief Greg
Augusta of the California Highway Patrol's Southern Division. After
the crash, ``the drivers and passengers of the other vehicles came
running back up the freeway.''
</P>
<P>
   Four passengers died at the scene, all from Palmdale. They were
identified by the CHP as a 20-year-old man, two 18-year-olds and
John Kenneth Chu, 25. All were graduates of Palmdale's Highland
High School.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, a 17-year-old girl from Highland, was taken by
helicopter to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia. She
died shortly after undergoing surgery, said hospital spokeswoman
Janice Newbold.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told investigators the four cars were racing south on
the freeway about 1 p.m. when the rear car changed from the middle
to the right lane in an apparent effort to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   The black 1989 Acura Legend skidded on the pavement, veered onto
the dirt shoulder and sailed off the side of the road into a
hillside. Investigators estimated the car was traveling 85 to 90
mph.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen other young adults had been traveling in the three
other cars, which included a Honda Accord and a Ford Escort,
heading from the Antelope Valley to Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know that everybody knows everybody -- they're all
acquainted,'' said Officer Doug Sweeney of the CHP's Newhall
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there was some type of function that they were
going to, but we don't know what it was,'' Sweeney said. ``It
wasn't a school function.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of off-duty CHP officers who happened upon the scene
shortly after the crash stopped and tried to help, Sweeney added.

 &HT;    Hammerless: Braves shut down by Byrd
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thursday was Kevin Millwood's first night on his new
job as the Braves No. 4 starter, but it was Paul Byrd who had the
bigger point to prove to Atlanta's front office.
</P>
<P>
   The former Brave pitcher, who lost his job with Atlanta last
August, showed his former team a little of what he's been doing
since the Phillies claimed him off waivers last August. With a
little help from Rico Brogna and Scott Rolen, who each had solo
home runs, Byrd beat the Braves 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd held them scoreless through the first six innings before
the Braves started making some offensive noise with a total of
three runs in the sixth and seventh innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies needed four relief pitchers to hold the Braves down
in the eighth inning _ with no help from a pair of fielding errors
_ but did when Jeff Brantley struck out Andruw Jones with the bases
loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings in, Brogna took Millwood deep over the wall in left
center, just out of the grasp of a climbing Jones for a 1-0
Phillies lead. It took Millwood three batters to gather himself
before he drew a soft fly ball from Desi Relaford for the second
out.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he had runners at first and second after walking
Bobby Abreu and Mike Lieberthal (Lieberthal after having him 0-2)
and he still wasn't out of the woods. Byrd fought back from 0-2
down to run the count full before Millwood struck him out looking
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood struggled a little bit more with his control in the
next inning but Rolen bailed him out of a runner-at-first, one-out
situation by popping up a 3-0 pitch on the infield. Millwood
retired seven of the next eight hitters before Rolen got a home run
of his own in the sixth inning with a shot to the left-field seats
for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves spotted Millwood 5.1 runs per game on his way to 17
wins last year. Thursday they were struggling for the .1.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, who won five of eight starts after the Phillies claimed
him off waivers from the Braves last August, allowed only three
base runners through the first six innings on two walks and a
Millwood hit.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was coasting right through the Braves lineup until he faced
Millwood in the third inning. Millwood, who had only four hits last
season, doubled just inside the third-base line. But he was
stranded there when Otis Nixon struck out.
</P>
<P>
   The second Braves baserunner _ Brian Jordan on a walk in the
fourth _ fared no better as Javy Lopez struck out looking at an
off-speed pitch.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's air campaign has effectively cut fuel and
ammunition supply lines to 40,000 Yugoslav army troops and police
fighting in Kosovo, allied officials said Thursday in providing the
first details of damage to support their claim that the 16-day
bombardment was taking a steep toll.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Pentagon officials noted that Yugoslav armored
forces had stopped maneuvering and were hunkering down, they
conceded that the strategy to starve the Yugoslav war machine might
be too late. The Yugoslav army, they said, may have already
achieved its goal of defeating Kosovo rebels and expelling hundreds
of thousands of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   And after four days of clear weather _ ideal for bombing _ rain
and fog rolled in again Thursday night, forcing several
fighter-bomber missions to turn back to base. Pentagon officials
said the forecast called for bad weather for much of this week.
</P>
<P>
   NATO missions were also complicated by the unexpected return to
Kosovo of huge numbers of ethnic Albanians who were turned back at
the Macedonian and Albanian borders when Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic abruptly closed the borders. Though the
whereabouts of these refugees were not immediately known, NATO
officials acknowledged that they could put new limitations on
targeting.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Thursday that Yugoslav forces were
responsible for killing ``thousands'' of Kosovar Albanians and
creating ``hundreds of thousands of refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said, ``In 1998
alone, the death toll was 2,000.'' Moreover, he said, ``there are
growing numbers of credible reports of innocent people being killed
in the last two or three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said information on the killings was initially obtained
from monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe and was later supplemented by accounts from refugees and by
``all available means'' of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   As administration officials sharpened their rhetorical attack on
Milosevic, senior military officers said Thursday that Yugoslavia's
two main oil refineries had been knocked out of operation, and that
the main rail lines and roads leading into the besieged province
had been destroyed or severely damaged. Fuel shortages were
reported throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to see strong evidence of supply problems and
fuel problems plaguing these Yugoslav forces in a number of
different areas and among a number of different units,'' said Rear
Adm. Thomas Wilson, the director of intelligence for the military's
Joint Staff.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO warplanes again flew more than 400 missions, attacking
22 targets across Yugoslavia, including air defenses, fuel depots,
bridges and tanks in the field, allied intelligence reported that
the Yugoslav army was hunkering down, and hiding in abandoned
buildings and forests, curtailing its campaign to drive ethnic
Albanians out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unilateral ceasefire declaration by Milosevic,
Yugoslav forces continued to engage remnants of the Kosovo
Liberation Army. Allied officials said there was evidence that
Yugoslav forces were conducting mop-up operations, particularly in
the northern part of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials said the air campaign would intensify. Defense
Department officials said Thursday that they expected Gen. Wesley
Clark, the NATO military commander, to request at least half a
dozen A-10s and a dozen F-16 ground attack planes, bolstering an
air armada of 600 aircraft already involved.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Defense Secretary William Cohen have said that
whatever requests Clark makes to conduct the air campaign will be
honored. Cohen said Thursday that he was considering a request for
additional F-15E strike fighters, as well as aerial refueling
craft. The fighter can attack with precision weapons from high
altitudes, making it less vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
   As American officials geared up for a protracted air campaign
that could last several more weeks, lawmakers traveling this week
with Cohen to Brussels, Belgium, and Italy, to meet with NATO
officials and American troops, indicated that the administration
must consider additional measures.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member bipartisan delegation of House and Senate members
intend to send the president a letter on Friday urging him and the
leaders of the other 18 NATO countries to begin at least the
planning for ground troops, said congressional officials.
</P>
<P>
   While political pressure may be building here for considering
ground forces, NATO officials remain adamant that no such option is
under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   As the air campaign entered its 16th day, allied officials here
and in Brussels denied claims by Yugoslav authorities that NATO
bombing had caused widespread damage within Pristina, the
provincial capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who toured the city as part of a visit arranged by
Yugoslav officials filed reports on Wednesday describing the
damage. But U.S. officers said Thursday that most targets around
Pristina were in lightly populated suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Only two targets in the city itself were hit, a telephone
exchange used by the military and a police headquarters building.
While the officers acknowledge that the bombing might have caused
some damage around the telephone building, they denied the Yugoslav
claims, and said Yugoslav forces were responsible for the
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collateral damage is being done by the Serbs,'' Wilson
told reporters at the Pentagon. ``Towns and villages have been
damaged primarily by fires set by the Yugoslav forces as they've
gone through, as well as by shooting them up with artillery and
tanks and those kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than two weeks of air and missile strikes, Pentagon
and NATO officials say they have inflicted significant damage to
Yugoslavia's armed forces, but Clark said in an interview that many
targets remain, and he vowed to continue striking them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and NATO have left vague the exact
military objectives of the attack, saying the aim was ``to
degrade'' Yugoslavia's military and paramilitary police forces.
Senior Pentagon officials concede the standard was set so that the
attack could end at virtually any point and be considered to have
met that objective.
</P>
<P>
   Ending the strikes soon, however, could leave Milosevic with a
weakened but functioning military and considerable special police
forces, which he relies on to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
Clark, as well as the leaders of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wanted
to be able to continue to attack Yugoslav military targets for at
least a couple weeks more, if not longer, particularly since the
initial phases of the operation were hampered by foul weather.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday a senior Pentagon official said the general hoped to
escalate around-the-clock bombing, rather than limiting most of the
air raids to nighttime. The prospect of a significant diplomatic
initiative could force a halt to Clark's plans to escalate the
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   At Aviano Air Base in Italy, the nexus of NATO's air war against
Yugoslavia, Cohen's remarks to troops Thursday clearly underscored
a hardening of the Pentagon's view, leaving little prospect for a
deal with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic, as you all have seen, has carried all of us
into the heart of darkness,'' Cohen told an assembly of pilots and
airmen. ``It is a place where the law of rule drives its heel and
boot over the rule of law and where justice amounts to nothing more
than a bullet in the back of the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, military briefers described in the greatest
detail to date specific targets attacked and estimates on the air
war's effectiveness against certain kinds of targets.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes, for instance, successfully bombed a refinery at
Pancevo that produces nearly two-thirds of Yugoslavia's oil. But
Wilson acknowledged earlier in the week that the Yugoslav troops in
Kosovo had at least a couple of weeks' fuel with them when the air
war started, and while many forces showed signs of running low,
tanks and armored vehicles were not yet stopping in their tracks.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a glance, one might think she's still a
schoolgirl, still the small high school kid who began racing 20
years ago at age 15 on Michigan state and county fair tracks near
her Benton Harbor home, and who grew up to be the best female
jockey ever and, yes, one of the best jockeys, period, of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Krone says that the love of racing, the love of horses,
the love, even, of the barns and stables ``is still in my blood, in
my bones, in my heart.'' But Thursday Julie Krone, now 35 and
married, and who had endured the numerous physical and emotional
joys and hardships of her ``roller-coaster'' profession, as she
termed it, announced that she was retiring as a professional
jockey.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared in the press room of Aqueduct, the little girl
grown into a woman _ still small in size at 4 feet 10{ inches and
100 pounds _ but with the strong hands and, as she proved many
times over a spectacular career, the stout heart of a standout
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   After all, she rode the sleek, half-ton thoroughbreds to 3,500
victories, including the 1993 Belmont Stakes _ the first and only
woman to win a Triple Crown race.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Krone wore a light-blue pants suit, her blond hair was
cut short enough to expose a pair of silver earrings, her blue eyes
were expressive and her smile matched her various moods, from
pensive to playful.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the number of reasons for her decision were as
many as the stars in the sky. ``They'd fill up a constellation,''
she said. But a few reasons were brighter than others. ``I'm 35; I
wanted to go out on top,'' said the woman who recently rode five
winners in one day at the New Orleans Fair Grounds. ``I have
nothing more to prove, and, well, I don't want to get hurt again.''
</P>
<P>
   She is close to $80 million in career earnings. She was the top
money-earning female rider, from 1986 to 1996, with a career high
of $9.1 million in 1992. She was the third-leading rider in the
nation, in regard to races won, in 1989, with 368 victories; and
fourth in 1988 and sixth in 1987. On Aug. 20, 1993, she became only
the third jockey in history to win five races in one day at
Saratoga, joining Angel Cordero and Ron Turcotte.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But racing is hardly all winner's circles and the sweet mists of
the early morning on the backstretch. Krone has been in myriad
spills on the track, perhaps the most serious occurring on Aug. 30,
1993, at Saratoga, closing day at the races there, and just 10 days
after she had scored that sensational five-victory tour. She went
down hard, suffering a severely fractured right ankle, which
required two plates and 14 screws to reconstruct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lying in the hospital bed before my surgery,'' she
recalled, ``when a friend brought in my five-win picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the ultimate,'' she said. ``It was the very best of
racing, and the very worst of it. It was everything in the world,
and nothing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   She endured several other bad spills, breaking her hands at one
point, and sometimes, for a forgettable period, her spirit.
</P>
<P>
   She had fought through the discrimination of not getting mounts,
and then not getting good mounts, but now she had psychological
problems about being in a race, the pounding for position with
other tough jockeys and determined horses, fighting for the lead,
for the wire.
</P>
<P>
   She used to ride hard on the rail, now she seemed to be avoiding
trouble by sliding to the outside. And then, as she willingly
discusses, she met a psychologist and her therapy sessions with him
helped make her strong again.
</P>
<P>
   She got so involved with psychotherapy that Krone _ a high
school dropout who later earned her degree _ has taken
correspondence courses from Empire State College in Saratoga, a
division of the the State University of New York system. She says
she plans to pursue a Ph.D. in psychology. She also says that money
is no problem with her _ ``I've been earning and saving since I was
17 years old'' _ and that she likes art and television, and may try
her hand at broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also going to spend a little time just sitting on the
grass and looking at the sky,'' she said. ``I think I'm going to
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February, in the starting gate at the Fair Ground, a
fractious horse she was riding caused her to smash against the iron
side. For the next few days her ankle ``was on fire,'' and her
thoughts of quitting all this because of the pain endured _ and the
creeping fears of more injuries _ made her come to the decision to
end her riding career.
</P>
<P>
   She will ride her last race at Lone Star Park outside Dallas on
April 18, unless she gets a mount for the Kentucky Derby on May 1,
which she doubts.
</P>
<P>
   She was asked if she plans to have children. ``I once heard
Katherine Hepburn say that there should always be a little
mystery,'' said Krone, with a smile. ``So I'll leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the her place in history, she said that there were
moments of deep gratification for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most rewarding moments,'' she said, ``have been when
little girls, 10 and 11 years old, would run up to me and say
things like, `I played soccer with the boys and I was the best
goalkeeper out there.' This has happened hundreds of times. They'd
say that they read about me in a newspaper or magazine, or saw an
interview on television, and that they admired what I had
accomplished and how I had overcome adversity. If I had made even a
little difference with girls like that, if I had made some little
girl more brave than she had been, then that's what's been
important for me as far as being a female athlete is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after her news conference, Julie Krone left Aqueduct,
not on a horse but in an automobile, riding off happily, if a bit
wistfully, into the sunset.

F-16 FIGHTER ENGINES CRACKED: SERIOUS FLAW FOUND IN 17 LUKE AFB
JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BARRETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENX _ An inspection of jets at Luke Air Force Base has
revealed cracks in at least 17 engines, a discovery that may point
to the cause of a recent Arizona crash that led to the grounding of
400 F-16s nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. John Barry, the base commander, told ``The Arizona
Republic'' that the cracks were not discovered in previous
maintenance checks because the base did not have the equipment to
detect them.
</P>
<P>
   Since the March 26 crash, maintenance crews have found cracks up
to an inch long in the augmentor ducts of 17 engines. About 50 of
Luke's 200 jets have not yet been inspected.
</P>
<P>
   An augmentor duct helps provide thrust for the engine by forcing
air out of the engine's nozzle. Barry said the cracked ducts have
the potential to cause a crash and were pulled from the engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty concerned about it, obviously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five F-16s from Luke have crashed in the past six months _ three
in the Valley and two near Gila Bend _ at a cost of about $20
million each. One was caused by pilot error, but initial reports
indicate the rest were caused by engine problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ After the March crash, Air Force officials grounded 400
fighter jets nationwide that use the Pratt and Whitney 220 engine
involved in the Arizona crashes. Half of the grounded planes are at
the Glendale base.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 500 maintenance and support personnel have been trading
off eight-hour shifts day and night to inspect the grounded planes.
The Pentagon also sent five inspectors and provided new inspection
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Using an enhanced dye and blacklight provided by the Pentagon,
maintenance inspectors were able to spot hairline fractures in 17
of the Pratt and Whitney 220 augmentor ducts.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Burris, director of communications for Pratt and Whitney,
said his company also has sent inspectors to Luke, but he added
that many of the augmentor ducts were delivered in 1991 or earlier
and some use technology developed more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Luke's planes represent nearly one-fifth of all aircraft using
the Pratt and Whitney 220 engine. Although all F-16 aircraft are
manufactured by Lockheed Martin, the engines and some components
are made by both Pratt and Whitney and General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Burris defended his company's engine, saying that before a Luke
fighter jet crashed in December, it had been nearly two years since
the model 220 had been blamed for an accident. None of the F-16s
using the 220 engine is flying in the NATO mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Barry has requested more money from the Pentagon to replace the
ducts and other engine parts cited by crash investigators.
Officials also have singled out problems with the engine turbines
and fan blades.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barry wouldn't give the exact cost of replacing those parts,
but it would be in the tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is backing the funding request. If
approved, it could mean more money for parts within the next few
months, as well as an additional lump sum in the 1999-2000 fiscal
year, which begins in October.
</P>
<P>
   Those funds would be in addition to the $225 million allocated
in the 1999-2000 budget to pay for spare parts for engines and the
$257 million Air Force officials asked for earlier this year for
spare engines.
</P>
<P>
   While the base waits to learn whether it will receive the funds,
Barry is allowing a limited number of the jets back in the air
after they have passed a grueling inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The Glendale base began flying 90 daily sorties Monday _ about
half the normal number. Barry does not expect the base to resume a
full training schedule until July.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen jets that use a newer engine model began flying a
few days after the most recent crash.
</P>
<P>
   Luke already had boosted maintenance checks, as well as the
criteria for passing inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Barry said personnel at the base have done ``everything humanly
possible,'' but he acknowledges that may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only manage risks with inspections to a point, and then
no more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When training resumed Monday, Barry was the first pilot to fly a
sortie. &QL;

   NEW YORKK _ Howard Milstein will not say if he is frustrated or
incensed at the NFL for erecting the obstacles that forced him to
withdraw his application to buy the Washington Redskins for $803
million.
</P>
<P>
   He will not say if he feels the league's finance committee
judged him solely by the financing plan that he was told contained
too much bank debt and too little cash _ or by his character.
</P>
<P>
   He will not say if the league compelled him to get out by
forcing him to make so many changes to his financing you would have
thought he was providing a bailout loan for the government of
Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   And he will not say if facing approval by the NFL was like going
before the ultimate co-op board, which can spurn you if it doesn't
like your shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple,'' Milstein said Thursday by telephone, one
day after he, his brother, Edward, and Daniel Snyder, a Bethesda,
Md., businessman, bowed out of the bidding for the Redskins when
faced with certain rejection. ``If you play in the big leagues, be
prepared for big wins and big losses.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'm disappointed. We thought we presented the
strongest possible financial structure.'' He insisted that he did
not have to be persuaded to withdraw. ``I'm not a quitter,'' he
said. ``I'm resourceful. I can get across the goal line. But I was
not prepared to go down a path where the fans and team would be
hurt by a controversy that would paralyze the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing his bid was doomed, Milstein may have relished suing the
league. But the prospect of a tumultuous and nasty federal lawsuit
ended when the league assumed responsibility for recouping the $30
million that Milstein paid the estate of Jack Kent Cooke when his
group agreed to buy the team on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   What remains a mystery is why the league objected so much to
Milstein's initial bank financing plan for the Redskins, which was
identical to what he proposed to buy the the expansion Cleveland
Browns last year. The league knew plenty about the Milstein
financial empire and his proposed bank financing.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL thought he was worthy enough to proceed to the Final
Jeopardy round of Browns bidding and got him to provide a $45
million letter of credit, or 10 percent of his $450 million offer.
Had he bid $550 million _ $20 million more than the winner Al
Lerner bid _ would Milstein's money have looked as green?
</P>
<P>
   Was his money right then but wrong now? To satisfy the league,
Milstein made the financing of the Redskins strong enough so that a
$125 million loan from his father carried no interest and would
have insulated him, the team and Jack Kent Cooke Stadium from a
lawsuit if it were not paid after 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   League concerns over the the liquidity of Milstein's real estate
assets never told the full story. Was he the wrong millionaire? Was
he too headstrong, too political? Had he made mortal enemies during
the Browns' auction?
</P>
<P>
   Or was he not one of the NFL family, having no ally but the
Cooke estate? The league failed to get the Cooke estate to show it
a $680 million bid from John Kent Cooke, the late owner's son. The
estate said no. Why seek out a much lower bid? Cooke is a known
quantity, an under-the-radar club member.
</P>
<P>
   Funny. Milstein did not rule out trying to break into the NFL
elite again. ``You never know what tomorrow brings,'' he said. But
he might be better off learning how to become a quarterback and
become a top draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   How many tomorrows the Milstein family will share with the
Islanders, whom they bought in February 1998, is uncertain. The
legal and on-ice miseries of the Islanders under the ownership of
the Milsteins and Steve Gluckstern served as a negative model for
some owners of how he might run the Redskins. That Gluckstern has
been a NHL governor is irrelevant; only Milstein was buying the
Skins.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, they want out of the Islanders. Buyers may be in short
supply without a new arena to replace Nassau Coliseum in sight.
Clearly, Milstein thought he'd get one when he bought in. Although
selling may be a mere formality to end this saga, Milstein would
not reveal what his get-out-of-Uniondale strategy is.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should call my brother,'' he said. Recently, Howard
transferred his part of their 45 percent stake in the team to
Edward.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Milstein did not return a call seeking comment.

CUSTOMS SERVICE WILL REVIEW DRUG-SEARCH PROCESS FOR BIAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with complaints that black and Hispanic
people are unfairly singled out for searches at airports and border
crossings, the U.S. Customs Service created an independent panel
Thursday to study how customs inspectors look for drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a bias exists, whether perceived or real, it is paramount
that we find its cause and eliminate it,'' Customs Commissioner
Raymond Kelly said. While insisting that it is not his agency's
policy to single out people based on race, Kelly said, ``We want to
see if, in fact, maybe it's developed into a practice that we want
to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the panel would be made up of officials from other
government agencies and would have ``unfettered access'' to Customs
Service records and employees during its three-month inquiry. The
panel will be led by Constance Newman, undersecretary of the
Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the problem head on; we're dealing with it,''
Kelly said. ``The people on the panel are enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who called last month for an
investigation into complaints of racial bias by customs inspectors
at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta, said Thursday that
the formation of the panel was ``an important first step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is happening, not just in Atlanta, but in New York
and Chicago and other parts of the country,'' said Lewis, who
appeared at a news conference with Kelly. ``We need to determine
why so many of our citizens _ African Americans, Hispanics and
others _ are complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' press secretary, Jack Pannell, said Thursday that while
the congressman was very pleased with Kelly's response, he
considers racial-profiling by law enforcement so serious that he
wants congressional hearings on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 71.5 million air travelers who passed through U.S.
customs in 1998, about 51,000 were subjected to body searches, the
Customs Service said. Most searches were simple ``pat-downs,''
though inspectors sometimes resort to strip searches, body-cavity
searches and X-rays to detect drugs that have been concealed in
clothing or swallowed.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service faces numerous lawsuits over body searches.
About 100 black women are hoping to file a class-action suit in
Chicago alleging that they were singled out because of their race
and gender.
</P>
<P>
   The service's statistics seem to indicate that, while black and
Hispanic people are more likely to be searched, they are not more
likely to be caught smuggling drugs. Nationally, 43.3 percent of
those people subjected to body searches or X-rays in 1998 were
black or Hispanic. Drugs were found on 6.3 percent of the black
people searched, 6.7 percent of the white people searched and only
2.8 percent of the Hispanic people searched.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of searches are not random,'' Kelly said.
``We do target certain countries and certain flights. You don't get
a true picture if you just concentrate on the ethnicity.'' Flights
from Jamaica, Colombia and other Latin American countries get extra
scrutiny from customs inspectors, as do some from West African
nations, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said about 18 percent of the 7,000 customs
inspectors are Hispanic, 11 percent black and the rest white or
Asian. Roughly the same percentages apply throughout the service's
20,000 employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ms. Newman, who is black, members of the panel are Robin
Renee Sanders, the National Security Council's director for Africa,
and Ana Marie Salazar, deputy assistant secretary of defense for
drug enforcement policy and support. Sanford Cloud Jr., president
of the National Conference for Community and Justice, was named the
panel's adviser. Ms. Sanders and Cloud are black and Ms. Salazar is
Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he hopes to find ways to make searches less of an
ordeal, even when they are deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to be searched; it's an unpleasant experience,''
Kelly acknowledged, adding that conducting searches is unpleasant
for the inspectors as well.

DNA TRACES LINK SUSPECT TO 17 RAPES, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ DNA evidence has linked a Bronx man to 17 rapes in
the Bronx, upper Manhattan and Westchester County, police officials
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The police believe that Issac Jones, 34, was responsible for
raping or robbing as many as 51 women at gunpoint in 39 attacks
since 1993, the largest rape pattern in recent memory. The victims
ranged in age from 13 to 53, and in some cases several women were
attacked at once. In one case, the police said, a woman was raped
in front of her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was ordered held without bail on Thursday after he was
arraigned in Bronx Criminal Court on four counts of rape and
charges of burglary, robbery, menacing, possession of stolen
property and weapons possession.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was arrested on Tuesday afternoon when he and his
girlfriend went to a Bronx pawnshop to try to sell some jewelry he
is accused of stealing from a victim, the first deputy police
commissioner, Patrick E. Kelleher, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As he was being interrogated, police officials said, Jones
confessed to raping four women, and he was arrested. But the police
also took a DNA sample from Jones to see whether it matched DNA
evidence that was recovered at the scenes of 17 attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Kelleher said, the test results came back positive.
``In each of the 17 DNA samples,'' he said, ``we found a match to
that of Issac Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   More charges will probably be filed against Jones based on the
DNA evidence after a grand jury hears his case, police officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The four counts of rape Jones was charged with yesterday stem
from three attacks that took place in the Bronx in 1994, 1997 and
1998, according to the criminal complaint. In the last attack of
the three, the complaint charges, he raped two women after he broke
into their basement apartment, pointed a handgun at them and robbed
them of cash and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who worked as a floor polisher at the General Motors
Building in midtown Manhattan, lived in a basement apartment at
2001 Story Avenue in the Bronx with his girlfriend, the police
said. He was previously convicted of sodomy in 1983 and robbery in
1989, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rapes began in 1993, the police did not recognize a
pattern until 1997, police officials said. Then they began working
backward, adding cases that fit the pattern: rapes that took place
after midnight in certain neighborhoods by a man wearing a mask and
armed with a handgun. When they compared the DNA evidence collected
at the scenes, they had further confirmation that the attacks were
linked.
</P>
<P>
   The last attack took place early on Feb. 14 in the Washington
Heights section of Manhattan, when two women were raped in their
apartment building minutes after they were dropped off at the front
door by their boyfriends in a taxi cab, the police said. Several
pieces of jewelry were stolen in that attack.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives distributed pictures of the jewelry around the city,
and began to focus on two shops that sold similar jewelry. Then,
for seven weeks, they conducted surveillance outside the shops from
7 a.m. to 7 p.m., six days a week. On Tuesday afternoon, the police
said, Jones was picked up after he and his girlfriend showed up at
one shop, in the Bronx, to sell some of the jewelry.

EDITORIAL: WHITMAN LOOKS TO THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, April 9:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey is planning to run for the
Senate in 2000. Her announcement that she is setting up a
fund-raising committee is as positive a declaration of candidacy as
is seemly from a sitting governor who must convince voters she
intends to stay focused on the state's business for the next year
and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of adding a Republican woman of Whitman's stature to
the Senate will excite many people, and to the rest of the nation
she probably seems an odds-on favorite. She defeated the incumbent,
Jim Florio, in 1993 and presided over a growing New Jersey economy.
Like her neighbor, George Pataki of New York, she has identified
herself with two popular issues _ tax cuts and environmental
protection. Right now the leading Democratic candidate is Florio,
who left office identified with tax hikes, a concept that elicits
something less than universal enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman's entry does not mean she is an automatic winner.
New Jersey has not elected a Republican senator since 1972, and the
state seems to have trended Democratic in recent years. Whitman
herself has never gotten more than 49 percent in any state
election, including her surprisingly weak showing against State
Sen. James McGreevey in the last gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   A contest between Whitman, one of a large crop of successful
Republican governors, and Florio, who had to run the state in far
less prosperous times, would make for interesting debates. But some
Democratic leaders, still smarting from the fact that Florio's tax
plan cost their party control of the state legislature, are hunting
for another candidate. Others worry that a primary would leave any
Democratic nominee in a weakened condition to run against Whitman,
but that is not necessarily true. The winner of a primary often
simply comes out looking like a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem on everyone's mind is, as usual, campaign
funds. A tough Senate race is expected to cost more than $10
million. Whitman's fund-raising drive is going to be led by Lewis
Eisenberg, who has already been rewarded for past money-raising
efforts on her behalf with the post of chairman of the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Port Authority is a
troubled organization, and Eisenberg might do better to hand over
his job to someone else who does not have to worry about the state
of Whitman's war chest.

ABC PLANS A 24-HOUR SOAP HOUR CABLE CHANNEL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Texas)  (rk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the second move this week that pitted the
interests of a broadcast network against those of its affiliated
stations, ABC announced Thursday that it would create a 24-hour
soap opera cable channel. The decision means that for the first
time in broadcast history, a network's entertainment programs will
be repeated on a different channel in the same day.
</P>
<P>
   The affiliates opposed the channel, saying its reliance on
repeats of ABC's four daytime soap operas would undercut their
exclusive rights to ABC programming. They said the channel could
also have an impact on the ratings of both the original broadcasts
of the programs during the day and on some of the ABC programs that
will compete with the soap opera channel in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by ABC, which is owned by the Walt Disney Co., came
one day after the Fox network unilaterally reclaimed more than 20
percent of the prime-time commercials formerly controlled by its
affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the decisions by ABC and Fox represent what Pat
Fili-Krushel, the president of ABC, called ``a message that the
network business has to change.'' Struggling to be profitable, the
broadcast networks are seeking to reorganize their relationships
with the local stations, many of which are extremely successful.
</P>
<P>
   Networks have previously placed repeats of programs they own on
cable channels that they also own. NBC, for example, uses repeats
of its ``Dateline: NBC'' on its MSNBC channel. But no network has
decided to reuse entertainment programs in this way before.
</P>
<P>
   David Barrett, the head of the ABC affiliate board, and the
executive vice president of Hearst-Argyle Television, the largest
owner of ABC-affiliated stations, said the affiliates had been
prepared to accept ``some measure of the repurposing of ABC
programs'' in negotiations with the network. ``But those talks
ended last week,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Just over a week ago, ABC broke off negotiations for a
comprehensive new agreement that would have provided ABC with
financial help from the affiliates for its expensive rights fees
for NFL games, in exchange for some specific terms on when ABC
programs might be used on other channels.
</P>
<P>
   In that deal ABC had offered the affiliates a financial
participation in the soap channel. But the affiliate board refused
the offer, mainly because ABC sought the right to match any change
in the network-affiliate relationship that one of the other
networks put into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fili-Krushel said that the affiliates had been informed that
ABC would go ahead with plans for the soap channel without them. It
did so Thursday. ABC executives have also said they will now seek
deals both on program exclusivity and NFL rights with affiliates on
a case-by case basis.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said that affiliates had anticipated the ABC move. ``It
was no surprise'' he said, ``I don't rule out still accomplishing
the goal of working out a comprehensive agreement with ABC, though
Michael Eisner might not agree with that optimism.'' Eisner is the
chairman of Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ABC plans to start up the channel, which has yet to be named, in
January 2000. Anne Sweeney, the president of Disney/ABC cable
networks, said she hoped the new channel could achieve the same
initial distribution level the company reached when it began the
Toon Disney channel last year, 5 million cable homes. That channel
now reaches 12 million homes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC conceived the channel as a way to draw additional revenues
for its soap operas, which are expensive to produce and are not
repeated. Ms. Sweeney said the network had taken note of the
cultural changes that have affected the largely female soap opera
fan base, with many more women now working outside the home.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The network conducted tests of the channel last year in two
cities, Houston and Chicago and Ms. Sweeney said the network was
encouraged by the results. She said they showed overall increases
in interest in the soap operas when viewers could see episodes they
had missed the same night.
</P>
<P>
   But other ABC executives acknowledged that the tests did show
some cannibalization of the audience for the daytime broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said he doubted that any ABC affiliates would react by
pre-empting the ABC soap operas on their channel ``at least in the
short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sweeney said that ABC was in a singular position to create a
soap opera channel because it owns all four of its daytime soaps,
``General Hospital,'' One Life to Live,'' ``All My Children'' and
``Port Charles.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, April 9:
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of terrorizing ethnic Albanians and forcing them out
of Kosovo, Serbian forces are now apparently yanking them back.
They have closed and mined the borders with Macedonia and Albania.
Two nights ago, perhaps 80,000 refugees waiting to get into Albania
simply vanished, forcibly turned around by Serbian troops and
pushed back into Kosovo. The same may have happened to some 10,000
refugees on the Macedonian border. No one knows where all these
people are and how they are being treated. NATO must find out as
soon as it can, and warn Belgrade not to abuse them.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's new refugee policy may be part of a public-relations
effort, which included Belgrade's bizarre declaration yesterday
that Kosovo is now at peace. But if the ethnic Albanians were being
welcomed home, the Serbs would most likely have let reporters in to
watch. They have not. It is more likely that the returning refugees
will find terror similar to what they fled, and have to join the
hundreds of thousands of people who are now in the hills, with no
access to food or shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs might plan to use them as human shields, to deter NATO
bombs. Since the Serbs have not closed the border between Kosovo
and the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, they may be trying to
force refugees there in hopes of destabilizing Montenegro, whose
leadership opposes Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The tens of thousands of refugees who did get into Macedonia
have also been mistreated in the past few days. Some 45,000 people
were pushed onto buses bound for Albania, Turkey or other camps in
Macedonia. Getting them out of the squalid refugee encampment is
welcome, but the refugees were given no information about their
destinations. Scores, possibly hundreds, of families were
separated, and many were forced to leave behind the few possessions
they had managed to bring from their homes in Kosovo, including
family photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia is right to worry that the influx of ethnic Albanians
will worsen ethnic tensions there. But these people have already
been through an inferno. Mistreating them in order to discourage
further refugees is shameful.

WILLIAMS EXCITED ABOUT FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Williams _ remember him? _ is on the line, and the 1990
graduate of Long Beach Poly High and 26-year-old professional
heavyweight boxer is oozing with enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just so great and exciting for my career,'' says
Williams, who earlier this week signed to fight the fearsome Ike
Ibeabuchi for $150,000 on June 19 in a HBO televised match that
will be a co-feature with Michael Grant and Lou Severese either at
Madison Square Garden in New York or in Atlantic City. ``After I
beat Ibeabuchi, I'm going to be destined for some very high-paying
fights. And I will beat this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Williams will beat Ike Ibeabuchi, the lethal-punching
Nigerian who recently dealt Chris Byrd his first loss by stopping
him in five rounds and also conqueror of another Top 10 fighter,
David Tua, the chiseled 240-pounder who's being heralded as another
Sonny Liston?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, and Slobodan Milosevic is on the verge of being named
commanding general of the NATO forces and Bill Clinton is a role
model for connubial bliss and I soon will purchase a chopped-up
Harley and join up with the ``Hell's Angels'' after festooning my
anatomy with ``Born To Raise Hell'' tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Jeremy Williams possesses fistic skills and a potent
punch he has a 34-2 record with 31 knockouts but his chin has come
under severe scrutiny since it betrayed him terribly one sweltering
summer evening three years ago in Indio when it failed to withstand
a withering right hand launched by Henry Akinwande.
</P>
<P>
   Since suffering that unfortunate knockout, Williams has fought
infrequently and stayed in the shadows of his sport, scoring a few
victories over nondescript opponents and shifting his promotional
allegiance from Dan Goossen's America Presents to Dino Duva's Main
Events.
</P>
<P>
   His name recently appeared often in articles in the New York
newspapers before the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis fight because
he served as Lewis' top sparring partner for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Lewis people first called me, I said, `No way. I'm no
sparring partner,''' recalls Williams. ``But then I got to thinking
how Larry Holmes, who later would become a great heavyweight
champion, sparred with Muhammad Ali before the `Rumble in the
Jungle' fight with George Foreman. So I decided to do it to find
out how I'd fare against someone like Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   According to all reports, including ones not as biased as the
one given by Williams, he handled himself well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox Lewis hit me right on the button with two of his best
right hands and I did not go down,'' relates Williams. ``He sparred
with me like he fought Holyfield throwing a few punches and then
grabbing and holding. I actually got mad at his tactics a few times
and threw him to the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I did the sparring with Lennox. What it has done for
me is give me the confidence that I can hold my own against anyone.
Let's face it, Lennox Lewis beat Evander Holyfield, and he's the
true heavyweight champion. I wasn't scared of him when I sparred
with him, and I know I did pretty well. Why should I be scared of
Ike Ibeabuchi?''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Williams won't be scared, but this will be the first time
in his professional career when he enters the ring with no one
expecting him to emerge victorious.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people don't realize is that I'm a much better fighter
now than I was three, four years ago when I still was going through
the adjustment of going from being a light heavyweight to a
heavyweight,'' says Williams, who says he now weighs 220. ``I also
was younger and more immature and thought I knew everything. I
always had a good offense, but I never had a defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``My new trainer, Ronnie Shields, who has trained Evander
Holyfield and Meldrick Taylor, has taught me so much about defense,
about rolling my shoulders with the punches, about feinting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Ike Ibeabuchi is unbeatable. Who's he beaten in
his career? Chris Byrd? Good fighter, can't break an egg. David
Tua? He only has one punch a left hook. That's all. All you have to
do to beat David Tua is keep your right hand up high to block his
hooks. He can't move a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going down to Vero Beach, Florida next week, and train for
eight weeks. Remember, I trained one day for Henry Akinwande. That
was all. I'm going to surprise a lot of people in this fight.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jeremy Williams wins, he will. ...
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's silly macho credo don't dare lend a hand to an
opposing player when he seeks a foul popup on the lip of your
dugout was responsible for Mo Vaughn winding up with a badly
sprained left ankle the other night against Cleveland. At least one
Indian player could have stood up and kept Vaughn from tripping
over the steps and into the dugout. But everyone on the Cleveland
team remained seated when Vaughn took his tumble, even though it
could have resulted in Vaughn enduring a far more serious injury
like a broken leg, or ravaged knee than he did. This is one sacred
rite the baseball players should scuttle. ...

<P>
   I sometimes wonder if Kurt Rambis actually knows what he's
doing. ...

   The cruelest emotion is rejection, and now Dennis Rodman at
least will have a valid excuse for his bizarre behavior in the wake
of his getting dumped by Carmen Electra. ...
</P>
<P>
   Is George Steinbrenner aware that Don Zimmer made some of the
dumbest strategic moves in baseball history during his failed days
as a manager? Zim's a nice old guy, but Bobby Cox is a tactical
genius next to him ...
</P>
<P>
   I always thought men were the only miscreants who made fools of
themselves by talking shop into their cell phones at the bar, but I
actually saw a lady doing this insufferably phony bit the other
night at a joint on Pine Ave. ...

<P>
   Speaking of Pine Ave., its two-fisted pioneer, John (Don't Tread
On Me) Morris, is expecting a galaxy of celebrities, including
David Letterman, to show up at Mum's during next weekend's Toyota
Grand Prix of Long Beach. ...
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, I'm reading Emile Zola's ``The Debacle.'' It's
about the 1870 Franco-Prussian war, and not about the war NATO is

   My old pal Larry (Smiley) Kahn is doing a bang-up job on the

...
</P>
<P>
   I have to laugh when they say Dusty Baker does it with mirrors
in San Francisco. No doubt Baker is one of the best managers in
baseball, but he does happen to have a fellow on his team named
Barry Bonds. ...

   Jeremy Williams, a film patron, tells me he yells, ``Shut the
(expletive deleted) up!'' when some loudmouth is talking
incessantly in a movie theatre. I'd like to do the same, but
Williams is slightly more equipped to back up his threatening words
than I am. ...
</P>
<P>
   Who's more overweight, Shaquille O'Neal or Mo Vaughn? ...
</P>
<P>
   I'm afraid to phone my pal of 31 years, Jerry West, these days.
If it's painful for me to watch the Lakers' bumbling antics, how do
you think a perfectionist like West is taking it? ...
</P>
<P>
   It's so reassuring to know that people in the Balkans are now
being killed to save them from death. ...

HIGH-SCHOOL CANCER VICTIM'S PALS FIGHT TO MAKE SCHOOL LET HIM
GRADUATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LORI BAKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Ariz. _ Cameron Schmidt, who has battled cancer to
come within three credits of earning his high school degree, now is
fighting for the right to walk with his classmates at their
graduation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Mountain Ridge High School in Glendale say they
won't bend the rules to let him do so. No diploma, no commencement,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   But friends are backing Schmidt. Some of his classmates have
said they won't take part in the ceremony if he can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schmidt Walks'' is the demand on petitions signed by more than
700 Mountain Ridge students.
</P>
<P>
   The slogan also is inscribed on T-shirts being worn by many
students today (April 9) at school. It's also being circulated on
fliers, in letters and in e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Connie Harris told Schmidt, 18, that he can't walk
with the other 526 seniors in the May 20 ceremony because he's
three credits shy of the 22-credit requirement to graduate in the
Deer Valley Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known many of these kids for the past four to seven years
and to be able to walk with them would mean the world to me,''
Schmidt said. ``I've felt like an outcast for the past couple years
because of my cancer. To be able to be a part of this graduation
ceremony will make me feel like a normal kid again.''
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman, Schmidt had a B-plus average and was on the
basketball and football teams. In the middle of his sophomore year,
he fell ill and was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, a potentially
fatal form of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He worked to keep his studies up while recuperating from a bone
marrow transplant, chemotherapy and radiation treatments. He's
maintained a B average by studying at home and taking some classes
at school.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't able to earn credits fast enough to graduate with
the Class of '99.
</P>
<P>
   Harris wouldn't discuss Schmidt's particular case, which is is
being appealed to the district's Governing Board. But she said his
request is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several students each year who lack the credits but
want to walk with their class,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, girls who have left school early because of a
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan Stefan, a Mountain Ridge student who has known Schmidt
since the fifth grade, said his friend's situation is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school district says, `Where do we draw the line?' '' he
said. ``If a girl gets pregnant, she was responsible for that. It's
not Cameron's fault that he got cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, who hopes to be a marine biologist or firefighter, has
been cancer-free for 10 months. His hair is growing back and his
strength is increasing.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't expect to get a diploma until he earns the rest of
his credits in the fall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His father pleaded with Deer Valley board members March 23 to
let his son go through commencement.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Deer Valley administrators nor board members have
responded to his request. Next week, Schmidt and many of his
friends will ask the board again.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Susan Burke, who is chief of the state's Office for
Children With Special Health Care Needs, said she will support
Schmidt if the board votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deal with very sick kids all the time, so I know what
Cameron has been going through,'' she said. ``I think it's a
reasonable request to let Cameron walk with his friends. When you
have rules, you have to consider extenuating circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Board Vice President Richard Eng said he also would vote to
allow Schmidt to walk. But fellow members David Cantelme and Joan
Bennett worry about setting a precedent. Board President Ted
Carpenter could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Deer Valley administrators plan to meet next week to find out
whether other students are in a similar situation and to discuss
whether exceptions to the policy should be made.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt hopes his friends won't have to decide whether to
boycott the ceremony because of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anyone to miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime
event,'' he said. ``I understand they want to make a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Robbins, a senior who said she wouldn't go to
commencement if Schmidt can't, said that allowing him to take part
in the ceremony is the humane thing to do. &QL;

BLUE HEAVEN FOR TV FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER 
Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're around the age of 40 or older, then you remember a
time when Walter O'Malley held as a tight a fist on Dodger
television exposure as Slobodan Milosevic holds on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dodgers' first years here, the only games televised were
road games at San Francisco. In the early '60s, the schedule was
expanded to include games with pennant race implications. In the
'70s, the Dodgers flirted with televising home games for the first
time on a subscription TV service known as ON TV. And as cable
exploded in the '80s, the team eventually expanded their road
schedule to 75 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in year two of Fox's stewardship of the team, you can't
turn on a television set without seeing the Dodgers. They're on the
tube as often as that insidious Tae Bo infomercial.
</P>
<P>
   By seasons' end, at least 149 Dodgers games will be televised in
1999, including at least 75 of their 81 home games. The menu: 80
games on Fox Sports West 2 (52 home, 28 away); 50 games on KTLA (16
home, 34 away); three ESPN national appearances (two home, one
away); and eight Fox Saturday telecasts (five home, three away).
</P>
<P>
   There are also four games which might be carried on ESPN's
non-exclusive Wednesday package, and four Saturday dates in
September that Fox may air depending on the pennant races. There
are also five Sunday evening games that could find their way on air
depending on changes in ESPN's Sunday night schedule.
</P>
<P>
   About the only games you can definitely scratch off your TV
calendar are five midweek day road games and two Tuesday road games
in April. Otherwise, it's Dodger Blue Heaven for those attached to
their couch.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that was presumably losing money in the last years of
the O'Malley era and has since blown its payroll into the
stratosphere, the increased viewing seems a strange byproduct. On
the day the Dodgers gave Kevin Brown baseball's first $100 million
contract, Dodger President Bob Graziano said the team needs to grow
its attendance well beyond the comfortable 3 million, to 4 million.
</P>
<P>
   It seems odd on the surface to think the Dodgers can put that
many fans in seats when the product is being given away on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano says it's a matter of marketing two separate items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely diverging from the past,'' he said, ``but
things are so different now than they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at attending games and watching them as two different
experiences. We want to create an experience for those coming to
the games that you can't get from the living room, create a sense
that fans who watch at home are missing something by not coming to
the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we've found that televising a game early in a
homestand gets people interested in coming out to a game later in
the homestand. We have so many promotions this year that any night
at the park is going to give the fan something new to think about
or take home.''
</P>
<P>
   Those promotions this year run from the usual, Hollywood Stars
Night and cap day, to the current bean bear promotion the first
week, plus a few postgame concerts and a Brooklyn Dodger cap
giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much is driven by television these days,'' said Brent
Shyer, the Dodgers' director of broadcasting and media relations.
``That's the biggest change from Peter (O'Malley) to the Fox Group.
They bought the team in part because of the TV inventory, and they
know its value.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers are as successful all season as they have been
the first week of 1999, the TV exposure could launch more fans to
the park and perhaps even create some new ones. If not, then fans
will watch other teams chase playoff spots, if they watch at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are hardly the one baseball team trying to make this
dual experience work. Most teams now televise 100 or more games a
season through some combination of over-the-air networks (like
KTLA) and cable (FSW2).
</P>
<P>
   In year two of Disney's operation of the Angels, the Orange
County team will be on television at least 110 times. The Angels
will televise 50 games on Fox Sports West (46 home, 4 away) and
another 50 on KCAL (six home, 44 away). There will also be four
exposures on ESPN's national package and six Saturday games on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels could wind up appearing another four times on Fox in
September and as many as eight times on ESPN's non-exclusive
Wednesday package.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of success is to obviously put a winner on the field
and hope everything grows together. And in today's baseball
environment, where teams can be built up or torn down in a matter
of months (i.e., Florida Marlins, San Diego Padres), the hope for a
winner is never too far away.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's certain: We'll know if the theory works simply by
tuning into the wall-to-wall TV coverage and seeing if there are
fans in the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW THE NEWS (AND SOME GOSSIP):

EDITORIAL: POLICE POLITESSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, April 9:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's effort to create a more polite police
force deserves less of the sophisticated cynicism that we enjoy so
much in New York City and more celebration about the civilizing
possibilities. As Dennis Walcott of the New York Urban League has
been saying for some time, good police manners could do for
community relations what fixing broken windows does for crime
rates. Just as mending windows and pursuing small infractions
appears to keep down serious crime, so small courtesies between
police and public might yield better community relations on a
deeper level.
</P>
<P>
   New York's sharp-tongued mayor, whose pleas last year for a more
civil city provoked as much parody as praise, predicted the same
dismissive reaction this week as he passed out new palm cards on
manners to the police. The cards order officers to address each
person as ``,'' ``Ms.,'' ``sir'' or ``ma'am.'' The reminder tells
officers to ``respect each individual'' and ``his or her cultural
identity'' and requires police to explain courteously what they are
doing and apologize for inconvenience. The police are still there
to catch criminals, of course, but they should not leave a
community seething.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has also suggested that citizens should be polite to
police. That's fine, except for his oddly excessive idea that the
public should address an officer by rank. What mere civilian could
be expected to know which rank gets the gold leaf or who wears the
gold eagle? In such stressful situations, a simple ``officer''
should do.
</P>
<P>
   Since the police shooting of an unarmed West African in
February, residents in minority neighborhoods have made it clear
that they need more humane law enforcement. The mayor and Police
Commissioner Howard Safir have launched reforms in training and
recruitment and have revamped the Street Crime Unit. By contrast, a
few thank-you's may look like sugar dusting from on high. Still, as
long as it is not a substitute for the hard repair work that is
needed, a little more street diplomacy couldn't hurt.  &QL;

L.A. TEEN STAKES SPOT IN LINE FOR `STAR WARS,' SPARKS MAD SCRAMBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GLENN WHIPP, PHIL DAVIS AND DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Tarzana teen-ager Daniel Alter knew the line to
see ``Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace'' was supposed to
begin forming outside the Village Theatre in Westwood on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   The resident of a suburban Los Angeles community northwest of
downtown also knew what ``Star Wars'' crazies are like and that
some demented fan would want to get in line early.
</P>
<P>
   So he decided to be that fan -- first in line for the ultimate
movie craze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I've taken the past year off in anticipation of
this,'' said the hulking 17-year-old high school graduate, who
ignored a fever and common sense to stake his claim at 5 p.m.
Wednesday at the head of the queue for the movie that will open May
19.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone in hand, Alter was making arrangements Thursday with
a group of at least 100 people who will take turns holding down the
top spot.
</P>
<P>
   Alter's decision has sent reverberations throughout the ``Star
Wars'' universe of dedicated fans who don't want to miss the first
screening and now other ``Star Wars'' faithful soon have taken up
positions at both the Village and the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood
-- where a Web cam has been set up to continuously broadcast images
of the growing line at countingdown.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of hoping we wouldn't have to get in line this
soon,'' said Omar Rashad, a University of California, Los Angeles,
student affiliated with the Web site organizing ``Star Wars'' lines
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we saw this guy, we had to move fast to guarantee
second place in line. Fortunately, the drugstore down the street is
open 24 hours, so we were able to buy some beach chairs and stock
up on supplies to get us through the night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web-site squatters were so surprised by Alter's pre-emptive
strike that they were scrambling to come up with people to take
shifts in line. While these ``Star Wars'' fans are self-described
``crazies,'' they're not insane enough to pull round-the-clock duty
outside a movie theater for the next six weeks. Some of them have
jobs, classes and families.
</P>
<P>
   Alter said new volunteers are calling all the time but there are
rules: each recruit must put in 168 hours -- a full week -- to join
the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only exception is the woman who gave birth to me,'' Alter
said. ``My mother can show up the day of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The countingdown.com people in Westwood will cap their group at
250, with most pulling four-hour shifts, said 20-year-old organizer
Ilya Haykinson.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Chinese, leader Lincoln Gaskins said those in line
will earn points based on the number of hours they log. Final
positions will be doled out the day the movie opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool now,'' Gaskins said. ``But the day before it opens
-- bedlam. We're expecting it to go crazy in the last couple of
days before the premiere. We're just trying to have some organized
chaos and, hopefully, have some fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Theater managers aren't commenting on the early birds. Neither
are police, aside from the teasing barbs bicycle cops hurled toward
those shivering in line at the Village. (``I heard this theater
isn't even showing the movie,'' one officer joked.)
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Baker, vice president of marketing for Encino-based Mann,
said the theater chain hasn't even had time to formulate its
policies on how many tickets an individual can buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture has not been booked, so we can't guarantee
anything,'' Baker said. ``We really have nothing to say until that
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Chinese, Gaskins was armed with a Web cam in his
top-story rented room at the Roosevelt Hotel across the street.
It's pointed right at the line, so people on the Internet can log
on to countingdown.com and watch what's happening and read about
developments in other lines forming in New York, San Francisco and
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site encourages those in line to sign up people to
sponsor them by the hour. Proceeds will go to the Starlight
Children's Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps our credibility,'' Rashad said. ``It doesn't
make us look so silly.''

L.A. TEEN STAKES SPOT IN LINE FOR `STAR WARS,' SPARKS MAD SCRAMBLE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Tarzana teen-ager Daniel Alter knew the line to
see ``Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace'' was supposed to
begin forming outside the Village Theatre in Westwood on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   The resident of a suburban Los Angeles community northwest of
downtown also knew what ``Star Wars'' crazies are like and that
some demented fan would want to get in line early.
</P>
<P>
   So he decided to be that fan -- first in line for the ultimate
movie craze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I've taken the past year off in anticipation of
this,'' said the hulking 17-year-old high school graduate, who
ignored a fever and common sense to stake his claim at 5 p.m.
Wednesday at the head of the queue for the movie that will open May
19.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone in hand, Alter was making arrangements Thursday with
a group of at least 100 people who will take turns holding down the
top spot.
</P>
<P>
   Alter's decision has sent reverberations throughout the ``Star
Wars'' universe of dedicated fans who don't want to miss the first
screening and now other ``Star Wars'' faithful soon have taken up
positions at both the Village and the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood
-- where a Web cam has been set up to continuously broadcast images
of the growing line at countingdown.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of hoping we wouldn't have to get in line this
soon,'' said Omar Rashad, a University of California, Los Angeles,
student affiliated with the Web site organizing ``Star Wars'' lines
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we saw this guy, we had to move fast to guarantee
second place in line. Fortunately, the drugstore down the street is
open 24 hours, so we were able to buy some beach chairs and stock
up on supplies to get us through the night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web-site squatters were so surprised by Alter's pre-emptive
strike that they were scrambling to come up with people to take
shifts in line. While these ``Star Wars'' fans are self-described
``crazies,'' they're not insane enough to pull round-the-clock duty
outside a movie theater for the next six weeks. Some of them have
jobs, classes and families.
</P>
<P>
   Alter said new volunteers are calling all the time but there are
rules: each recruit must put in 168 hours -- a full week -- to join
the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only exception is the woman who gave birth to me,'' Alter
said. ``My mother can show up the day of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The countingdown.com people in Westwood will cap their group at
250, with most pulling four-hour shifts, said 20-year-old organizer
Ilya Haykinson.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Chinese, leader Lincoln Gaskins said those in line
will earn points based on the number of hours they log. Final
positions will be doled out the day the movie opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool now,'' Gaskins said. ``But the day before it opens
-- bedlam. We're expecting it to go crazy in the last couple of
days before the premiere. We're just trying to have some organized
chaos and, hopefully, have some fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Theater managers aren't commenting on the early birds. Neither
are police, aside from the teasing barbs bicycle cops hurled toward
those shivering in line at the Village. (``I heard this theater
isn't even showing the movie,'' one officer joked.)
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Baker, vice president of marketing for Encino-based Mann,
said the theater chain hasn't even had time to formulate its
policies on how many tickets an individual can buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture has not been booked, so we can't guarantee
anything,'' Baker said. ``We really have nothing to say until that
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Chinese, Gaskins was armed with a Web cam in his
top-story rented room at the Roosevelt Hotel across the street.
It's pointed right at the line, so people on the Internet can log
on to countingdown.com and watch what's happening and read about
developments in other lines forming in New York, San Francisco and
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site encourages those in line to sign up people to
sponsor them by the hour. Proceeds will go to the Starlight
Children's Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps our credibility,'' Rashad said. ``It doesn't
make us look so silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Alter isn't as self-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a Web site or a publicity person or a charity,''
he said, reclining in his chair outside the Village Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have one simple objective -- to be the first people in
that theater and get the best seats.'' His pick: Row P, Seat 107.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I wanted to make this just a classic, old-fashioned
line like you might have seen back with the original movie,'' Alter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, back then, you didn't have cell phones, laptop
computers or Web cams. In that way, things have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rashad and Haykinson have been powering their laptops through
extensions plugged into their cars' cigarette lighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be able to check our e-mail,'' Haykinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Steve Cotie of North Hills, put the emphasis on
creature comforts. Cotie brought a tent, sleeping bag and cooking
stove to the Chinese Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The free-lance camera assistant said he will stay in line as
long as he doesn't get called out on a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ought to be interesting,'' he said, looking around the
sidewalk that he hopes to call home for the next six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bromley, manager of BJ's Chicago Pizza, next door to the
Village Theatre, has a different take.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen,'' she said.
