<HEADLINE> Sudanese Opposition Reiterates Support for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Sudanese opposition
leader on Saturday reiterated his alliance's support for an
Egyptian-Libyan initiative aimed at realizing peace in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) supports the initiative
because it is a comprehensive peace plan aimed at bringing
together all parties related to the Sudanese issue, NDA leader
Osman el-Mirghani told reporters after meeting with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed in August a five-point peace plan
calling for permanent cease-fire in Sudan and a preparatory
meeting for a peace conference to be attended by the related
parties.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim political parties within the NDA, which also
includes the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), have accepted
the proposal. But SPLA has rejected the plan, saying it favored
the mediation by the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development,
or IGAD, an Eastern African group.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim parties want to share power with the Sudanese
government while SPLA, led by John Garang, have been fighting
since 1983 for greater autonomy for the mostly Christian south.
</P>
<P>
The alliance believes that it is important to hold a national
reconciliation conference to be participated by all factions,
el-Mirghani said.
</P>
<P>
But the IGAD "had in mind only two parties to the conflict: the
Khartoum government and the southern rebel group," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Libya initiative calls on the Sudanese government,
the opposition, Egypt and Libya to send representatives to the
peace conference.
</P>
<P>
Observers in Cairo said the difference between Sudan's
opposition Muslim parties and the SPLA over the Egyptian-Libyan
peace plan resulted from SPLA's distrust of the two Muslim
countries and also the parties' distrust of IGAD's countries.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Campaign Against Telemarketing Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday announced a new mail campaign to fight against
telemarketing fraud.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton announced that every
American household will soon receive a postcard with tips on
avoiding telemarketing rip-offs.
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest consumer protection mailing in our
history," Clinton said. "It will provide information you can keep
by the phone to help you distinguish between fraudulent and
legitimate telemarketers."
</P>
<P>
The postcards, to begin arriving on November 15, will include a
set of warnings, such as telling people to avoid giving unknown
callers important financial information.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also directed Attorney General Janet Reno to send him a
plan to combat consumer fraud and to increase prevention and
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Many older Americans face a greater threat from "a scam artist
on the phone" than from a criminal on the street, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Telemarketing fraud takes between 40 billion dollars and 60
billion dollars a year from Americans, according to a report from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

<TEXT>
<P>
Principal Advisor to the African Infrastructure Fund, Edward
Jaycox, said this when meeting with Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa at the State House Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Set aside by the American International Group, the fund has
major investments from the International Finance Corporation and
the African Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has been selected to benefit from the fund in
recognition of its conducive investment climate in infrastructure,
said Jaycox, who is also a former vice-president of the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
"With approximate 400 million U.S. dollars available for
investment, it is the largest fund operating in Africa focusing on
building modern and world-class infrastructure in the continent
and fueling the social and economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other countries earmarked to benefit from the fund are Morocco,
Egypt, Tunisia, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Botswana, Mozambique,
Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The fund's annual net foreign direct investment in the
reforming countries increased more than six folds since 1993 from
less than two billion dollars to nearly 14 billion dollars in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The fund is also expected to benefit the rapidly growing field
of private investment in infrastructure development in Africa.

Museveni will hold talks with his Rwandan counterpart Pasteur
Bizimungu on the bilateral relations of the two neighbors, the
President's Office said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents will lead two high-profile delegations to
the one-day summit in Uganda's southwestern district of Kabale
Monday, the President's Office said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Uganda and Rwanda have been soured by

Since troops of the two countries clashed with each other in
Kisangani, the third largest city in the DRC in mid-August, there
have been exchange of views and visits between top government
officials of the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have been trying to massage the bruised relations,
but there has not yet any indication of any improvement of ties
between them although they have denied any worsening of the
relationship.

KAMPAPA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of Presidency
Ruhakana Rugunda will lead a Ugandan delegation to Kigali to talk
with his counterparts there over Rwanda's ban of Ugandan goods,
Radio Uganda reported on Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, which has been relying heavily on Uganda economically,
has banned importation of fish, milk and bananas from Uganda, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Rugunda told the general public in Uganda Saturday that he
would try to persuade officials in Kigali to lift the ban in order
to benefit people in both countries.
</P>
<P>
He did not say whether the ban is economically or politically
motivated.
</P>

Rwanda export most of its things through Uganda and the two
countries, both politically and ethnically connected, had been
close allies before their troops fought each other in Kisangani in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo in mid-August this year.
</P>
<P>
Rugunda denied that the ban could have any big impact on
bilateral relations although the presidents of these two countries
will meet in Uganda Monday and this issue is likely to be part of
their agenda.
</P>
<P>
The ban will seriously affect the life of people in Uganda's
southwestern districts of Kisoro, Kabale, Rukungiri and Ntungamo,
said Radio Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Police Move Against Satanist Cult in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian police Saturday moved
against a Satanist cult, informing 17 people that they were under
investigation and face possible charges of criminal conspiracy,
extortion, fraud, sexual violence and mistreatment of animals.
</P>
<P>
The Italian news agency Ansa reported that among those notified
was the 23-year Rome branch leader of the Children of Satan
Corporation, who was also arrested for drug possession and
trafficking along with four other people.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made after police found 50 kilos of marijuana
and hashish, cannabis paste, 20 marijuana plants and 20 million
lire in cash in a farmhouse on the capital's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
Police also made searches in eight other Italian cities and
confiscated robes, photographs, membership cards, goat skulls,
chalices, cure and magic potion formulas, some written in blood.
</P>
<P>
Also found was the text of the pledge that members of the
Children of Satan Corporation cult had to pronounce and then sign
in blood.
</P>
<P>
Devil worshipping appears to be on the rise in Italy with a
dozen or so Satanic sects operating in the country involving as
many as 30,000 people, according to a report from the Public
Security Department on Religious Sects.
</P>
<P>
Rituals, Black Masses, the search for Black Magic,
transgressions and the practical use of "evil" are the main
activities of the growing number of people working the
anti-Christ, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report placed Italian satanic sects into three general
categories: the rational Satanism, acid and Lucifer.
</P>
<P>
In the first group, Satan represented "a symbol of rebellion,
anti-conformation, hedonism."
</P>
<P>
In the acid group, on the other hand, Satanism "is more a
pretext to unleash and practice perversions, through drug-induced
experiences, orgies or acts of violence." This, the report said,
was the most dangerous and uncontrollable group.
</P>
<P>
The school of Lucifer, instead, views Satan as the one of the
vital principals, not the incarnation of evil but simply the
opposite of God.
</P>
<P>
Groups operating in Italy, which can rely on over 26,000
internet sites dedicated to the devil, are for the most part in
the rational and acid groups, the report found.
</P>
<P>
Among the more well known groups are the Children of Satan, Iod
Astrum Aurum and Light From the Underworld.

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary Presses Russia Over Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain Saturday urged Russia to
end the fighting in Chechnya and allow humanitarian organizations
into that area to meet the needs of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Robin Cook telephoned his Russian counterpart,
Igor Ivanov, to express concern about the civilian casualties in
the breakaway republic, the Foreign Office said.
</P>
<P>
During the 45-minute telephone conversation, Cook expressed
Britain's concern on the plight of the refugees in the conflict,
said a Foreign Office statement.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Cook called for a halt to the fighting and told Mr Ivanov
that he was concerned about the lack of a political strategy....
He asked for early access to the area for humanitarian
organizations, particularly to meet the needs of the refugees,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Ivanov agreed to brief Western ambassadors
in Moscow on the situation Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister also agreed to meet Cook
personally at the upcoming Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe summit in Istanbul on November 18-19.
</P>
<P>
But the statement gave no more details of Ivanov's responses.
</P>
<P>
Cook's call for a halt to the fighting in Chechyna follows a
letter from British Prime Minister Tony Blair to his Russian
counterpart, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Blair sent a letter to Putin, his second about
Chechnya in a month, and expressed concern about civilian deaths
and injuries and the plight of refugees and urged Russia to give
free access to humanitarian relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said almost 200,000 refugees have fled Chechnya
following Moscow's campaign against Moslem rebels in that region.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Proper Settlement of Riot in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Saturday that the recent street rioting in Kuwait
involving Egyptian workers there should be handled with care and
without any tense feelings.
</P>
<P>
Although the incident has led to a sense of dissatisfaction,
both Egypt and Kuwait are keen on maintaining good ties, Moussa
said in remarks carried by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"All things are now going back to normal," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
A quarrel between an Egyptian worker and a Bengali shop
assistant led to a serious street rioting in a suburb of Kuwait
City a week ago. This was believed to be the worse rioting in the
history of the Gulf sheikdom.
</P>
<P>
Immediately following the incident, Egyptian officials got in
touch with their Kuwaiti counterparts and expressed hope that the
incident would not affect the bilateral ties. Kuwaiti officials
assured them that the ties will remain normal. Meanwhile, Kuwaiti
authorities have detained 25 Egyptian workers involved in the
rioting.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Egypt's presidential political advisor, Osama
el-Baz, has said that Egypt will not allow the dignity of any of
its nationals abroad to be undermined as "this is the dignity of
Egypt and its people."
</P>
<P>
El-Baz told the October magazine, which will be published on
Sunday, that "it is not in the interests of any side to exaggerate
the incident."
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Egyptian community should be decently
treated," he underlined, saying that if it was proved that an
Egyptian national was treated in an indecent way, we would
interfere."

SINGAPORE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Tony Tan Keng Yam Saturday officially launched the first
light rapid transit (LRT) system in this island state, the Bukit
Panjang (BP), saying the system has brought a number of firsts to
the country.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony, Tan said the firsts include the
first fully-automated operation, the integration of the depot of
the LRT system with a commercial building.
</P>
<P>
Tan urged the Land Transport Authority to continue to be bold
and imaginative in its approach to building up a comprehensive
integrated transport network that will be fast, reliable and
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
The BP LRT comprises 7.8 kilometers of elevated guideway or
track, 13 stations, a shuttle station and a depot.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the guideway started in mid-1996 and was
completed in April 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran supports the resistance
of the Syrian and Lebanese people against "the Zionist
occupation," said Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who was carrying a message from Iranian President
Mohammed Khatami to his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad, made
the statement upon his arrival at Damascus International Airport.
</P>
<P>
He said that to support the struggle of the Syrian and Lebanese
people against Israeli occupation is one of the major foreign
policies of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Israel now occupies the Golan Heights of Syria captured during
the 1967 Middle East war. It also has bee holding an enclave in
southern Lebanon of about 1,100 square kilometers since 1985.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister lashed out at the endeavors of Israel, to
which Tehran has not given political recognition and always refers
to as "the Zionist entity," to separate the Syrian and Lebanese
tracks of the Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi hailed the "good" relations between Iran and Syria and
stressed that "the current regional and international developments
necessitated ceaseless consultations between the two sides."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister then met with Syrian Prime Minister
Mahmoud Zouebi on means of boosting bilateral ties as well as
economic and trade cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Evildoing of Falun Gong Should Not be Allowed in U.S.: Li Zhaoxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Falun Gong should not be
allowed to do harm to people any longer in the United States, said
Li Zhaoxing, Chinese Ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong is a cult rather than a religion, a conspiratorial
political organization rather than an exercise group, Li Zhaoxing
said at a speech at the North Carolina University Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that Falun Gong has led to death of more than 1,
400 people, harmed health of so many others, damaged many happy
families and violated the human rights of many people in China.
</P>
<P>
The peoples of both China and the United States, who respect
science and cherish human life, should keep alert to the danger of
the cult led by Li Hongzhi, Li Zhaoxing added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador criticized the "double standard" of some
U.S. politicians in dealing with cult, saying a few U.S.
politicians made indiscreet criticisms as the Chinese government
banned the Falun Gong cult, despite the fact that the U.S.
government and people are also against cult.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that this is interference in China's internal affairs
and will do harm to the normal development of Sino-U.S. relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 15,000 Lebanese
workers in public sectors will stage a strike early next week to
protest against the government's failure to meet their demands for
pay hikes.
</P>
<P>
The Water Workers Union, which has estimatedly 2,500 members,
held an emergency meeting Saturday after which they announced the
strike as of next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although water supplies in the country's southern, northern
and eastern areas will not be cut off on the day, the union has
warned of further protests if the government fails to respond.
</P>
<P>
One day earlier, the Confederation of Public Institutions and
Utilities Unions has decided to launch another strike next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The confederation, estimated to have more than 10,000 members,
comprises unions at the state electricity company, the state-run
Regie tobacco company, the public transport sector, the state-run
Ogero telephone company and the National Social Security Fund.
</P>
<P>
Confederation leaders complain that although the government
announced approval of their demands at a cabinet session last
month, it has not taken any concrete steps until now.
</P>
<P>
An earlier strike threat by the confederation was called off
after the government promised to resolve their demands.

<HEADLINE> Britain Warns Warring Parties in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain warned Northern
Ireland's feuding parties Saturday that they had reached a
"crucial point" on the road to breaking the deadlock and securing
a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
But Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson urged
people to be patient after the peace talks broke off last week
without Irish republicans and pro-British Ulster Unionists
reaching a breakthrough over guerrilla disarmament and the setting
up of political structures, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
"These talks might, just might, bring the compromise that
secures a peaceful democratic future for generations to come,"
Mandelson told a conference of the Irish nationalist Social
Democratic and Labor Party in the Northern Ireland capital of
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"A few days is a small price to pay. So give the politicians
time. They know what is at stake. They want to deliver. For
everyone's sake they must."
</P>
<P>
He was speaking on the eve of what is seen as a final effort to
revive the stalled landmark peace accord by U.S. mediator George
Mitchell in fresh talks with pro-British Ulster Unionists and Sinn
Fein, the political ally of the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
The parties have failed to bridge a wide gulf on guerrilla
disarmament and new political structures in nine weeks of
negotiations chaired by Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said that while the parties were "not out of the
woods yet," he believed the differences could be bridged. The
coming days, after talks are resumed Monday, would be crucial.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson was emphatic the parties must translate the accord
into political reality so as to build prosperity and stability
after years of strife.
</P>
<P>
"As long as I am Secretary of State the agreement will endure.
For as long as local politicians continue keep talking, it remains
the best hope for Northern Ireland."
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said he was encouraged the parties were working
together, face-to-face, and acknowledged the efforts to secure
peace of Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, UUP leader David Trimble
and the SDLP, Northern Ireland's main political party representing
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
SDLP leader John Hume said people had waited too long for the
Unionists and Republicans to break the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Hume, forced to break off from the talks to undergo emergency
surgery after falling ill two months ago, warned politicians not
to throw away the opportunity to broker a deal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the second day of the SDLP's annual party
conference, Hume said the time was right to end the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating to watch an agreement we have worked so hard
to create placed at risk," he told delegates.
</P>
<P>
But he said he believed the talks being chaired by Mitchell
would succeed. "We have never been closer to success than we are
now. We have the future in our hands," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Wants Closer Ties With Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia wants to forge
closer bilateral ties with Malaysia, Malaysian Foreign Minister
Syed Hamid Albar said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia believes that such relations could contribute to
regional peace and stability, he said while briefing reporters on
the outcome of a meeting between Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
and Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid here.
</P>
<P>
Both countries reaffirmed their non-interference policy in the
internal affairs of each other, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting between Mahathir and Wahid was friendly and
warm, with both agreeing to reinstate regular get-togethers
between the leaders of the two nations to enable them to exchange
views on various matters.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has requested an additional 200 million U.S. dollars
to the 100 million dollar credit line extended to it by Malaysia's
oil giant Petronas to purchase rice, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid expressed his gratitude to Mahathir for Petronas'
assistance, he said, adding that Mahathir told the Indonesian
leader that the Malaysian government would encourage Petronas to
increase the credit line to Indonesia if possible but it was up to
the national oil corporation to decide.
</P>
<P>
According to the Malaysian foreign minister, Wahid suggested to
Mahathir that Malaysia send an investment delegation to Indonesia
to further enhance bilateral trade and investment linkages and
Mahathir agreed to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said that there should be close relations between
Malaysia and Indonesia and that "we should contribute to help
Indonesia in its economic development."
</P>
<P>
He said President Wahid indicated Indonesia's preference for
increased usage of the Bilateral Payments Arrangement (BPA)
between the two countries as a means to enhance two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said the two leaders also discussed the East Asia
Monetary Fund mooted by Mahathir in Singapore recently to enable
East Asian economies to fend for themselves during a financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
They also touched on the use of different currencies in
bilateral trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian president arrived here earlier Saturday from
Singapore for a two-day working visit as part of his four-day tour
of eight Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The president is leaving for Myanmar Sunday to continue his
tour of ASEAN countries.

<HEADLINE> Rate Hike Not to Threaten EU Recovery, Prodi Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Last Thursday's half-point
interest-rate hike by the European Central Bank will not
jeopardize the recovery of the European economy, European
Commission President Romano Prodi said in the Italian northern
city of Milan Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a university conference, Prodi said the increase in
the ECB's refinancing rate to 3 percent would not be enough to
reverse a trend shown by all major indicators.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, an economist by profession, said that "we have suffered
over the past few years in Europe because of an economy that grew
too little."
</P>
<P>
Then, he stressed that Europe was now at a stage of great
opportunity, "all the economic indicators say we are at the start
of a phase of recovery, a recovery that is certainly not called
into question by a half-point increase in interest rates."

<HEADLINE> Putin Remains Vague on Whether to Storm Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin remained vague Saturday on whether to storm Grozny, capital
of the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Moscow planned no storming of Grozny, but such an operation
cannot be ruled out, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything possible to avoid storming," the prime
minister said. "We will try to (achieve) our goals... by other
means. But the goal remains unchanged -- destroying terrorist
bases and conditions for their existence."
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops launched an offensive against Chechen
rebels following two waves of armed incursions into neighboring
Daghestan and a spate of terrorism bombings that killed over 300
people in Moscow and two other Russian cities. Authorities have
accused Chechen warlords Shamil Basayev and Khattab of
masterminding the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Colonel General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the
General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, reiterated Saturday
that the current military campaign would last until Chechnya
ceases to be the base for "terrorists," the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov's
appeal earlier in the day for an end to the military actions and
the start of "any form of negotiations" with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
No talks with Maskhadov would make any sense before he
distances himself from "terrorists," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
"Maskhadov has put himself outside the limits of a negotiation
process" and so there can be no talks with him before he disowns
Chechen guerrillas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Manilov expressed the confidence that Russia's political
leadership would let the military carry the armed operation in
Chechnya to completion.
</P>
<P>
The Russian North Caucasus command said earlier Saturday that
federal Su-24 and Su-25 fighter jets and Mi-24 helicopters had
made about 50 raids in Chechnya over the previous 24 hours,
killing more than 50 guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The raids were mainly limited to the areas of Gudermes,
Samashki and Grozny because of poor weather, Interfax reported.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Three alleged members of
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) were detained
here as the perpetrators of the robbery of two Panamanian
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Head of Panama's State Security Council Pablo Quintero Luna was
quoted by Saturday's local press reports as saying that the
suspected hijackers were taken to the offices of Deputy Attorney
General Carlos Augusto Herrera to be interrogated.
</P>
<P>
Quintero Luna said that the three men have as their specific
task to supply the FARC high command with ordnance, heavy
equipment and other articles.

<P>
He also revealed that the Colombian army authorities confirmed
to have seen the two aircraft in the Colombian sector of Uraba,
the historical territory of the FARC guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Aleman said that the
investigations will take some time, since each of the three
detained suspects carried two passports, one Colombian and the
other Ecuadoran, at the moment of their arrest.
</P>
<P>
Aleman said that the Panamanian authorities are trying to
ascertain, through diplomatic channels, the true identity of the
detained.
</P>
<P>
Five alleged members of the FARC hijacked on November 2 the two
Panamanian helicopters in the indigenous zone of Kuna Yala in the
Caribbean.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Italy holds the world record as
the nation that increased taxes the most over the past 20 years,
according to a report from the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the report showed, taxes paid in Italy were equal to
26.8 percent of GDP, while in 1998 this increased 16.7 percent, by
well over half, to 42.5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The Italian news agency Ansa commented, "No other nation
examined in the OECD report saw such a marked increase in taxes,
and Italy's 16.7 percent rise was far above the average rise of 6
percent for European Union countries."
</P>
<P>
The closest EU country to Italy, which started reducing its
taxes in the 1998 financial year, was Portugal, where taxes were
up 12.5 percent, from 22.4 percent to 34.9 percent of GDP,
followed by Spain up with 10.9 percent, to 34.2 percent, and
Finland up with 10.2 percent, to 46.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan remained in a league of their own,
the OECD report said.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, taxes today are equal to 28.8 percent of GDP, only
4.4 percent higher than the 24.4 percent of 1979.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, on the other hand, taxes in 1978 were
27.3 percent of GDP, only 2.4 percent higher than 29.7 percent in
1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUATEMALA CITY, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 4.46 million
Guatemalans qualified to vote are ready to go this Sunday to the
ballot boxes to elect their 21st president.
</P>
<P>
The 7,602 voting tables distributed in all of Guatemala will be
opened to the voters at 07:00 local time Sunday. They will elect
a president, a vice president, 330 municipal mayors, 113 deputies
to the Congress, 20 delegates and 20 stand-ins to the Central
American Parliament (Parlacen).
</P>
<P>
The voting will be closed at 18:00 and the preliminary results
will be announced 10 hours later, according to the Supreme
Electoral Court (TSE).
</P>
<P>
The election will be the first after the signing of the peace
accord in 1996, which ended a 36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Most Guatemalans say they want the government to continue
implementing the peace accords, and most are more concerned about
survival.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 international observers have arrived in Guatemala City
to watch, together with more than 2,000 local observers, the
Guatemalan presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Also more than 17,000 policemen and 12,000 army troops will
care the ballot boxes to guarantee that the process will be
transparent.
</P>
<P>
A law that bans the sale of alcoholic beverages will be in
force starting at midday Saturday to assure the public order and
will be lifted at 18:00 on November 8.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu called in a previous speech to
the elections on the citizens to go to the polls to turn Sunday
into a civic feast, to elect the authorities that will guide the
country into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The electoral law says that the presidential candidate who gets
at least half plus one of the votes will be proclaimed president.
</P>
<P>
If none of them obtains that absolute majority, the top two go
into a runoff on December 26 of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The winner will take office on January 14, 2000, replacing the
current President Alvaro Arzu.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll showed Alfonso Portillo, the candidate of the
rightist Guatemalan Republican Front (FGR), is the front runner
followed by Oscar Berger, of the ruling National Advanced Party
(PAN), and Alvaro Colom, of the New Nation Alliance (ANN) trailing
third.

Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the ruling Awami League
(AL) in southeastern Bhola district and between opposition
activists and the police in Chittagong, also in southeastern
Bangladesh. No casualties or injured were reported.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party and its front organization, meanwhile,
sponsored anti-hartal processions in the city.
</P>
<P>
Over 6,000 security personnel were deployed in the capital to
maintain law and order during the two-day strike, the 13th hartal
program of the opposition this year. The opposition will observe
another dawn-to-dusk countrywide stoppage on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is also president of the AL,
on Sunday made a fresh offer of talks with the opposition on any
issue, the BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to discuss any issue with the opposition, even the
one-point demand (of the opposition to dislodge the government),"
she was quoted as saying after the parliamentary party meeting of
the AL in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, comprising the BNP, the Jatiya Party,
the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Jamaat Oikya Jote (Islamic Solidarity
Front) called the shutdown on Sunday to protest the government's
cancellation of November 7, the "National Revolutionary and
Solidarity Day" as a public holiday, and Monday's strike to
protest the Election Commission's announcement to hold elections
to three of the country's four city corporations in early
December.
</P>
<P>
Destructive strikes are very common in Bangladesh, where
opposition parties call strikes to oppose the ruling party while
the latter adopts anti-strike activities, often resulting in
clashes and causing heavy economic losses.

<HEADLINE> Nelson Wants to Face Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Johnny Nelson is deadly serious
when he suggests the laughable notion of a showdown with the now
disgraced Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
It sounds ludicrous and implausible, but WBO cruiserweight
champion Nelson, promoter Frank Warren and trainer Brendan Ingle
are not smiling. The trio believe this fight will finally give the
Sheffield star the recognition he fully deserves despite an
unforgettable last eight months.
</P>
<P>
Nelson became champion only in March and defended his title for
the fourth time on Saturday night with a fourth-round stoppage of
Frenchman Christophe Girard at Widnes' Kingsway Leisure Centre.
</P>
<P>
He desperately wants to unify the division, but Warren claims
WBC champion Juan Carlos Gomez and WBA king Fabrice Tiozzo are "
asking for ridiculous sums of money" to put their belts on the
line. So, scenting an opportunity, Warren is looking to bring
Tyson to Britain and put him in the ring with Nelson in what would
be one of the biggest box-office draws in this country for many
years.
</P>
<P>
There is still a mystique surrounding the once self-proclaimed
"baddest man on the planet" despite the scandal of his derailed
life both in and out of the ring.
</P>
<P>
His most recent fight sham when he clearly punched Orlin Norris
after the bell in a bout which was eventually ruled a no-contest,
served only to do more damage to his already tarnished reputation
wrecked by the ear-biting of Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
Now heavily in debt, Tyson looks set to seek pay-days away from
the United States, and Nelson wants to be the first in the queue.
</P>
<P>
"I am serious," said Nelson, trying to make people believe such
an idea could ever come to fruition. "I've got to convince you to
believe what I say.
</P>
<P>
"The Nevada State Commission don't want him to box over there
any more - so they're trying to make him fight over here in Europe,
and I've heard that Cardiff could be a possible venue.
</P>
<P>
"If that's the case they've got to get a credible opponent for
him to fight, and apart from Lennox Lewis there are really no
credible heavyweights in Britain."

<HEADLINE> Premier League to End Player Wages Madness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League chairman
Dave Richards is determined to end the growth of player power
before multi-millionaire stars strangle the game to death.
</P>
<P>
The Sheffield Wednesday chairman, who will remain Premier
League chief until March 2000, fears the English game may be left
deserted and abandoned by the prospect of a possible one billion
pounds television deal.
</P>
<P>
"There is talk of a one billion pounds television deal. If that
happens you will see multi-millionaire players, and then tell me
if they are going to run through a brick wall for you every
Saturday -because they ain't," Richards said.
</P>
<P>
"The players are queuing up to come here from Italy, Germany
and France. This last month, I have been offered six players from
Italy under the Bosman Ruling.
</P>
<P>
"They have suddenly realised there are a lot of players out of
contract and they think they can come over here and earn 750,000
or one million pounds a year, and it is not hard to do.
</P>
<P>
"The major thing you have to convince them of is if they want
it to carry on. The television deals are getting bigger and bigger,
and it is all going to players.
</P>
<P>
"We need some corporate governance. Supporters are getting fed
up paying to watch a guy who is paid one million pounds and doesn'
t do it for them, and they are on 300 pounds a week. It cannot
carry on.
</P>
<P>
"The Premier League needs to start taking some responsibility
and start looking at how they put money into the game and what
happens to it.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at what's happened over the last three years with
the explosion of television, is it just coincidental that 190
million has come from television and 190 million has gone out to
players?
</P>
<P>
"It is time that football started looking at itself and asked
what it needs to do on contracts, agents, wages and transfer fees.
Ten years ago I was elected Wednesday chairman, and the highest-
paid player was on 310 pounds a week. Within 10 years, we have
players on one million pounds a year."

<HEADLINE> Wahid Wants to Learn From Thailand in Addressing Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Newly elected Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid said here Sunday that he is willing to
learn from Thailand's successful experience in addressing
crisis-related problems, especially social problems.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai at the
Thai Government House, both agreed that the economic situation in
the region has shown signs of improvement, although many problems
still hinder the recovery, Thai Government Spokesman Akapol
Sorasuchart said at a briefing after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chuan thanked Indonesia for the good intention it showed when
Thailand was hit by the financial crisis in mid-1997, saying that
Thailand and Indonesia have always enjoyed good relations.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had agreed to contribute 500 million dollars to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)-led rescue package for Thailand
before its own economy collapsed as a result of the spread of the
crisis later in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wahid emphasized the great potential that Thailand and
Indonesia have in developing their cooperation in fishing.
</P>
<P>
With three-tenths of its territory are covered by seas,
Indonesia has rich fishing resources, which will provide a field
for more Thai investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesia president also briefed Chuan about his talks with
Myanmar leaders. Both sides agreed to strengthen cooperation with
Myanmar in the fields of culture and tourism.
</P>
<P>
They hoped that Myanmar will develop along with other ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) members.
</P>
<P>
Wahid arrived in Bangkok from Myanmar on Sunday evening and
will leave for Laos Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province
has collected a total of 126 million yuan ( 15.1 million U.S.
dollars) in relief money and materials to assist local people
affected by natural disasters which have struck the province in
the past 14 months.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 50 million yuan worth of donations have already
been sent to people victimized by draught, earthquakes, floods and
pestilence for more than a year, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
Since last September, a series of natural disasters have hit
the province, killing 68 people and causing tremendous economic
losses estimated at about 13.33 billion yuan, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Over 2.8 million hectares of crops in the province also were
affected by the disasters, sharply reducing the province's grain
production.
</P>
<P>
Grain production was reduced by 50 percent in some 58 counties,
and by as much as 80 percent in 20 of them, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has made great efforts to reduce the
impact of the disasters by sending rescue teams, relief materials
and money to the stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Due to their efforts, the people there are now leading a normal
life, with good security and a peaceful social order.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Zou Jiahua, vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
urged the people's congresses and their standing committees at all
levels to increase supervision over the enforcement of laws for
the protection of the environment and resources.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a NPC forum on the protection of the environment
and resources in central and western regions, which ended here
today, Zou said that the key to accurate law enforcement lies in
strengthening the supervisory system.
</P>
<P>
According to Zou, China has enacted six environment laws and 13
resources laws over the past two decades, basically forming a
legal framework in these two areas suited to the country's
political, economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Zou said that efforts should be made in particular to enhance
the supervision of law enforcement personnel and establish and
improve supervisory bodies.
</P>
<P>
He asked the people's congresses and their standing committees
to publicly promote these laws and increase the public awareness
of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Zou stressed the importance of environmental protection in the
country's central and western regions, which are facing severe
ecological problems, saying this is essential for the sustainable
development of the national economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian left-wing organizations
marked the 82nd anniversary of the October Revolution Sunday by
demonstrations and rallies in Moscow and other major cities around
the country.
</P>
<P>
A rally in the Lubyanskaya Square was attended by an estimated
7,000 people, including representatives from 26 Russian regions,
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Georgia and Belarus, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov told the rally
that "by pooling efforts of all patriotic forces, it is possible
to correct the situation and to revive again the ideals of
fraternity and justice."
</P>
<P>
He said the top-priority tasks of Communists are to revive the
Slavic brotherhood of states of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian Interior Ministry estimates, 170,000
people attended Sunday's activities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite a decree by President Boris Yeltsin in 1996
designating November 7 as the Day of Accord and Reconciliation,
many Russians continue to mark the day as the anniversary of the
October Revolution.
</P>
<P>
On November 7 and 8, 1917, the Russian Bolsheviks led by
Vladimir Lenin seized the Winter Palace in Petrograd (now St.
Petersburg) and overthrew the provisional government. The
revolution was named for the date on which it commenced under the
old Julian calendar (October 24).

<HEADLINE> Arab League Supports Syria's Stand on Resuming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Sunday
reiterated support for Syria's stance on the resumption of the
country's peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Syria's Tishrin newspaper, the league
secretary general, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, said the Syrian-Israeli
peace negotiations must re-start from where they broke off,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Syria's negotiations with Israel came to a halt in early 1996
due to disputes over the future of the Golan Heights that Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
After Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak took office in July,
the leaders of the two countries said they were interested in
resuming the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Syria demanded the talks be resumed on the basis of a promise
made by late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin that Israel
would pull back from all of the strategic plateau. But Barak
failed to respond positively.
</P>
<P>
Peace is not a gift that Israel will give to the Arabs, the
chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum said.
</P>
<P>
Peace is in the interest of Israel and it will also be in the
interest of the Arabs if it is comprehensive and just,
Abdel-Meguid stressed.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid criticized Mauritania, a league member, for

<HEADLINE> 527 People Dead or Missing in Floods in Central Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Heavy floods that have hit
Vietnam's central provinces over the past week had left 527 people
dead or missing and caused material losses of over 710 billion
Vietnamese dong (50.7 million U.S. dollars), Vietnam News Agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports, the death toll was the highest
in Thua Thien-Hue province, reaching 341, followed by Quang Nam,
Quang Tri, Da Nang, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh and Phu Yen.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, the central region was hit by three
consecutive tropical storms which killed 267 people and injured 92
others. Total losses were then put at 1,295 billion Vietnamese
dong (93 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the climate reportedly remains complicated in the
central provinces with much clouds, although rains have stopped.
Water levels are going down slowly in those provinces.
</P>
<P>
People in other parts of the country are supporting the
flood-stricken area by all means. A government delegation led by
Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Le Huy Ngo arrived
in Quang Ngai on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The provinces continue to receive relief aid from the
government, fellow compatriots at home and abroad as well as
international organizations, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday and Saturday, more than 800 million Vietnamese dong
(57,200 U.S. dollars) and dozens of tons of food and clothes were
sent to the seven flood-ravaged provinces.

<HEADLINE> Likud Criticizes Saguy's Remarks on Syrian Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua)-- Israel's opposition Likud
party Sunday urged Prime Minister Ehud Barak to clarify by the end
of day about the government's policy concerning Israel's peace
talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Likud made this call after learning remarks made by Uri
Saguy, whom Barak has intended to assign to head Israel's
negotiating team with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
A local daily in Nazareth, northern Israel, on Sunday quoted
Saguy as saying that Syria would receive no less from Israel than
what Jordan and Egypt have received in their framework accords
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace treaty with Jordan had led the desert kingdom to
get every piece of land it wanted, and Israel's peace treaty with
Egypt had led to Israel's withdrawal from all the Egyptian
territories Israel had occupied, Saguy told the daily.
</P>
<P>
Saguy maintained that Syria is well aware how far Israel would
go to achieve peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Likud party believes that Saguy is not in the position to
make such policy remarks concerning Israel's peace talks with
Syria and so the party requests the prime minister to clarify on
that, said the party.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the remarks will give others the impression that
Israel will hand over all the Golan Heights to the Syrians before
the peace talks concluded, the Likud said.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East War
and negotiations between the two sides to resolve this issue had
been stalled for three years.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic efforts have recently been doubled to help the two
sides reopen talks and there was no sign that they will restart
negotiating very soon.
</P>
<P>
During his trip to Paris on Monday, Barak is scheduled to
discuss this issue with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Barak is to attend the meeting of the Socialist International
set for Monday in Paris. France has promised to help in this
regard, due to its good relationship with the Syrians.

</P>
<P>
The clash was more a match between the Croatian captain Barbara

<HEADLINE> Robot Developed to Clean Tall Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A lightweight robot that can
scale tall buildings and clean their exterior walls has been
created in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Positioned on a sturdy cable, the remote-controlled robot can
move up or down nearly 30 floors at 2-10 meters per minute. Using
a vacuum hose, it removes grit and grime from the surface of
ceramic tiles or glass by sucking dirt or spraying water.
</P>
<P>
The small, efficient robot can do the work of four people,
according to its creators, a team led by Prof. Wang Yan with
Harbin Polytechnic University in Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his colleagues experimented with several weightier
versions of the robot before ending up with the 23.2 kilogram body
-- about a third of the weight of other robots used for the same
purpose.
</P>
<P>
The robot is operated by people on the ground using a hand-held
remote control device.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Wang said that before his invention, the traditional
robots currently used in China and abroad require pre-positioned
tracks on the buildings, or are clumsy because of their size.

WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A year before Election Day 2000, voters know what they want:
a strong president with personal values and convictions worthy of
respect and a Congress prepared to act effectively on the problems
of health care, education and the other family issues most
Americans think Washington has been neglecting.
</P>
<P>
-- Although most see her as an outdated throwback to colonial
days, Australians decided in a landmark referendum on Saturday to
keep Britain's Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. The
result was a major victory for Prime Minister John Howard and
other monarchists, who claimed a victory for stable government.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- American embassies are "perilously close to the point of
system failure" because of antiquated buildings and grossly
inefficient computer networks, an independent commission reported
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- At least five million Colombians marched late last month in
more than 700 cities and towns to urge an end to the three-decade-
long civil conflict and related human rights abuses.It is also a
show of support for formal peace talks just getting under way
between the government and leftist guerrillas.

<P>
TEHRAN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Saudi Minister of
Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ali Bin Ibrahim al-N'aimi on
Sunday underlined the cooperation between Riyadh and Tehran for
stabilization of the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day gathering on Persian Gulf gas resources
which opened on Sunday, al-N'aimi said the cooperation between the
two sides has served to restoring stability to the international
energy market, which benefits of both energy producers and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
He said the mutual cooperation and friendship between the two
countries have proved to be highly fruitful for peace its economic
growth and prosperity in the region, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this mutual respect and friendship will continue
through consistent consultation, exchange of ideas, strict
adherence to key decisions, when they are taken, and ensuring
that any future initiatives or actions will be made collectively,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Iran helped the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reach
agreements to reduce crude outputs and brought about a halt to the
sharp fall of oil prices in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the status of the Saudi gas industry, al-Naimi said the
country's current natural gas reserves reach 214 trillion cubic
feet and the country's efforts are centered on non-associated
gas, or gas produced entirely independent of oil.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to virtually more than double the existing
capacity of the master gas system, through a year-by-year
development program that will expand the entire gas network
through the installation of new processing facilities,
transportation and distribution systems to meet the economy's
growing demand," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Army Inquires into Northern Debacle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's army commander has
convened a court of inquiry to investigate last week's military
debacle in the northern Wanni region, the Defense Ministry said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement said that the court of inquiry, headed by
three senior officers from the three armed services, will look
into circumstances and persons leading to the fall of the camps in
Wanni to the rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
"Depending on the outcome of the Court of Inquiry severe
punishments will be meted out to all those who are found
responsible," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise offensive that began late last Monday, LTTE
rebels overrun several strategic towns during the last six-day and
by Sunday they had regained a large part of the Wanni region which
had been recaptured by the army last year.
</P>
<P>
Following the military debacle, President Chandrika Kumaratunga
has made amendments under the Public Security Ordinance to impose
censorship on the local and foreign press with effect from
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
These amendments preclude the publication, broadcast or
transmit of any material pertaining to any matter inclusive of
military operation carried out or being carried out or proposed to
be carried out in the Northern and Eastern Provinces except with
the permission of the Competent Authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the army commander has made several changes to the
command structure of the Wanni operational command, said the
ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
Among the changes, Major General Neil Dias replaced Wanni
security forces commander Major General Wasantha Perera, who was
made commandant of the army staff college. Some divisional
commanders also had their jobs changed.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland for
the minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Rebels Slow in Handing Out Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations officials have
 complained in Freetown that Sierra Leone's rebels are slow in
disarming themselves, reports reaching here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There had been only several hundred fighters so far reporting
at a disarmament reception center near Freetown, said a UN
official on Saturday, adding that many of the rebels who turned
themselves up at the center were child soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the west African country disarmament has been even
slower than in the Freetown area, an official with the UN Mission
in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) said.
</P>
<P>
"In some other areas, there hasn't been a single turnout," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and Sierra Leonean government officially
launched the long-delayed disarmament program on October 20. The
program should have been started in mid-August as designated by a
peace agreement signed in Togo's capital Lome this July between
the rebels and president Tejan Kabbah' s government.
</P>
<P>
There are about 45,000 former combatants waiting to be
disarmed, including the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels
and former military junta soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Foday Sankoh, leader of the RUF, and the former short-lived
junta ruler Johnny Koroma had offered to cooperate in helping
disarming their followers.
</P>
<P>
However, clashes in northern part of the country between the
RUF rebels and former junta soldiers are threatening plans to
disarm and to deploy a 6,000-strong UN peacekeeping force
scheduled next month.

</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the regular meetings between the leadership
of the two countries, and said these visits, along with the
Mongolia-China friendly and cooperative relationship treaty signed
in 1994 and a joint statement signed in 1998, form the "political
and legal framework" of bilateral ties in the coming new century.
</P>
<P>
"More efforts should be made to implement the agreements
already reached by our two countries," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Through his current visit, including talks with Chinese Premier
Zhu Rongji, "the two countries further exchanged views on a number
of key issues and reached a wide consensus," he said, adding that
the visit can be called "a historic tour" for it is being made in
the wake of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of Mongolia-
China diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that economic and trade cooperation also constitutes an
important part of the visit. Just returned from Tianjin, a major
port and industrial city 120 kilometers from Beijing, he stressed
the importance of the port facilities for Mongolia. "As we are a
land-locked country, the port of Tianjin is the most convenient
distance for Mongolia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to cooperation between Mongolian enterprises and
corporations and the Tianjin port and the Tianjin development zone
in construction projects, he said, "The Mongolian government will
support such cooperation."
</P>
<P>
In his view, the two countries can expand cooperation in other
fields, such as joint research on the economic development of
Northeast Asia conducted by educational institutions of both
countries.

<HEADLINE> 27 Injured in Bomb Explosion in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven people were
injured, two of them seriously, in a pipe bomb explosion in the
northern Israeli coastal city of Netanya Sunday, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The police have confirmed that the blast was a terror attack
and have arrested a number of suspects, including a Palestinian
who was caught on his way to the West Bank, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off at about 10:30 a.m. local time (0830 GMT)
next to a trash can outside of a large bank in a busy shopping
area of downtown Netanya.
</P>
<P>
The twisted remains of a bicycle and a garbage can that caught
fire lay on a charred sidewalk at a downtown intersection.
</P>
<P>
The police have defused four other similar bombs found near the
same site, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has condemned the
attack. PNA General Secretary Tayeb Abudel Rahim said the
attackers attempted to destroy the peace process, accusing some
elements in Iran of being behind the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Rahim said the PNA has arrested 25 members of the Islamic
militant group Hamas and the Islamic Jihad over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office issued a statement, saying
that Barak viewed the bombing as "a serious development" and
that Israel would commit itself to fighting against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said on Israel Radio that
he does not believe this minor pipe bomb will disrupt the whole
peace process between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The latest peace deal between the two sides, or the Sharm
el-Sheikh Memorandum, is under relatively smooth implementation.
</P>
<P>
At the Oslo tripartite summit that was held on November 1-2,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Barak have promised U.S.
President Bill Clinton to work hard for the conclusion of a
framework deal by next February to pave the way for the reaching
of a permanent peace agreement by next September.
</P>
<P>
The bombing happened one day after the military wing of Hamas,
Izzadin Kassam, threatened to step up terror attacks to protest
against the settlement policy of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Militants of Hamas, who opposed the peace process and vowed to
liberate all occupied Palestinian territories, have carried out a
series of terror attacks in Israel over the last few years in an
attempt to derail the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians are to begin the long-overdue
final-status talks in earnest in the West Bank city of Ramallah
Monday. Barak warned earlier Sunday of possible terror attacks as
the two sides are working to achieve a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the previous hard-line government led by Benjamin
Netanyahu, which often imposed collective punishment for such
attacks, Barak's government has carried on its commitments in
peace deals to prevent the peace process from being disrupted.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian PM Visits Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian Prime Minister
Rinchinnyamiin Amarjargal and his party today visited the port
city of Tianjin, 120 kilometers to the southeast of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian guests this morning went to Tianjin port, the
bonded zone, and the economic and technological development zone
in the city.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Lichang, secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of
the Communist Party of China, and Li Shenglin, Tianjin Mayor, met
with the Mongolian delegation at noon.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told the guests that the city has close economic ties
with Mongolia, and Tianjin has also formed a sister-city
relationship with Ulan Bator.
</P>
<P>
Li said that economic cooperation between Tianjin and Mongolia
has seen rapid growth in recent years, and that the Mongolian
prime minister's current visit will definitely boost the further
growth of bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Amarjargal said that the Sino-Mongolian relations have grown
rapidly in recent years and the leaders of the two countries have
decided the direction of trans-century cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
As a land-locked country, Mongolia attaches great importance to
the construction of export-related facilities, he said, adding
that his country is willing to create closer ties with Tianjin in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Amarjargal and Li also met entrepreneurs from both countries
and attended the signing ceremonies for an economic agreement
between the companies in the afternoon.

<HEADLINE> At Least 44 Die Of Suffocation In North India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- At least 44 people died of
asphyxia and 13 others were injured Saturday night in a major fire
at a busy marketplace in Sonipat in the northern state of Haryana,
the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While 35 people were choked to death as they shut themselves
inside plastic, crockery and cassettes shops in the market to
escape the blaze, the others died of burn injures.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the trapped shoppers, including nine members of
four families, were found early Sunday morning when the shutters
of the shops were prised open, PTI said, quoting a local officer
in the state of Haryana.
</P>
<P>
Police said a short circuit in one of the shops in Sonipat, 70
km north of New Delhi, might have caused the fire which spread to
nearby shops selling crackers and other inflammable goods for
Diwali, a major traditional festival in India.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the fire might have started following sparks
in the high tension wires over the market which fell over a
cracker and a cloth shop.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which gutted at least 23 shops, broke out early in
the evening on Saturday and continued till early Sunday morning,
as 13 fire tenders and private water tankers battled the flames
throughout the night, according to PTI.
</P>
<P>
This is the second major fire incident in the state in recent
months. In December 1995, a fire claimed over 400 lives in Sirsa
district during a school function.

agriculture-related works.
</P>
<P>
Yet, their contribution to the gross domestic product in 1997

<P>
CAIRO -- The technical secretariat of the Arab League Council

<HEADLINE> Philippines Seeks Support From World Y2K Readiness Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is coordinating
with an international Y2K readiness group to prevent disruptions
in the health care sector on January 1, 2000 and beyond, a senior
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Amable Aguiluz, chairman of the
Presidential Commission on Year 2000 Compliance, said that his
agency has linked up with the RX2000 Solutions Institute to
prevent any disruptions in health care in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Aguiluz said his commission has access to this through its
affiliations with the International Y2K Cooperation Center based
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Through this," he added, "we will be able to address any
possible problem faster and easier."
</P>
<P>
The RX2000 group was formed in 1997 to address the common
problems of hospitals in dealing with the Y2K bug problem,
including hospital machinery and their Y2K state of readiness.
</P>
<P>
With less than two months to go before the new millennium, he
said, the country's health sector is now more than 80 percent Y2K
ready.
</P>
<P>
Private hospitals have achieved 82 percent in Y2K readiness
progress, while government hospitals averaged 77 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the medical care sector is doing its best to
achieve a 100 percent Y2K readiness in securing the lives and
health care of the people.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a built-in flaw in older computers that
prevents them from correctly recognizing dates from January 1,
2000 onward and therefore, possibly causes disruptions in
computer-dependent services.

TOKYO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Hideki Todaka beat fellow
Japanese Akihiko Nago in a unanimous decision to retain his World
Boxing Association (WBA) super flyweight title here on Sunday.

the start and went on to put heavy pressure on the challenger,
keeping himself on the offensive throughout the bout, and never
giving Nago a chance of countering.

It was Todaka's first defence of the title he won from Jesus
Rojas of Venezuela in July after drawing with Rojas in their first
encounter in March.

<HEADLINE> Russian Assaults on Chechen Rebels Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops continued
their assaults on rebel positions Sunday in the breakaway republic
of Chechnya, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In Grozny, capital of Chechnya, federal artillery pounded the
Oktyabrsky district, hitting the settlement of Tridtsaty Uchastok
and the former oil-industry workers' settlement No. 20, Interfax
said in a dispatch from the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
The villages of Prigorodnoye, Gikalo and Chechen-aul outside
Grozny were also targets of shelling.
</P>
<P>
Federal forces have secured control of 40 percent of Chechnya
in a military campaign launched following armed incursions into
neighboring Daghestan and a spate of terrorist bombings that
killed over 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Chechen warlords Shamil Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian native
known only by his last name, have been accused of masterminding
the incursions and the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Besides artillery assaults, federal air planes also continued
their raids on rebel positions in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Su-24 front-line bombers, Su-25 attack planes and Mi-24
helicopters delivered more than 100 air raids over the previous 24
hours, Interfax said, quoting the headquarters of the federal
grouping in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The raids destroyed two of the rebels' strongholds, two command
headquarters, one arms depot, three anti-aircraft systems and more
than 10 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In the face of fierce federal assaults, Chechen rebels are
planning to cross into neighboring Azerbaijan, Interfax said,
citing military intelligence.
</P>
<P>
It also quoted unidentified sources as saying that Shamil
Basayev's envoy had returned from Pakistan following talks with
extremist organizations on arms, ammunition and medicines supplies
to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
International terrorist Osama bin Laden is reported to have
given him about 50 shoulder-held Stinger systems which are to be
brought to Chechnya through Georgia or Azerbaijan before December
10, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Georgia has repeatedly denied reports that rebel personnel or
arms move into Chechnya through its territory.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Zamfara State to Implement Sharia Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The small state of Zamfara in the
north of Nigeria will officially introduce Sharia law, an Islamic
legal system, from January next year just as President Olusegun
Obasanjo has declared the adoption of Sharia unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The state government has started constructing at least 30
buildings to be used as Sharia courts for dispensing Islamic
justice to Zamfara's population of 2.23 million, local press
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Development Bank, the most active institution
within the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) of which
Nigeria is a member, has reportedly granted the state government
500 million U.S. dollars of loan for development projects in the
state.
</P>
<P>
The interest-free loan is a response to the "bold and
encouraging" move of state governor Alhaji Ahymed Sani in adopting
the Islamic legal system, according to a source at the Nigerian
Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The state governor said Sharia law would help to curb crime,
however, protests against the adoption of Sharia law intensify in
the rest of the west African country.

<HEADLINE> Abu Enein Protests Death Sentence by Lebanon Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior member of the
Revolutionary Council of the Palestinian Fatah Movement has
rejected the death sentence against him handed down by a Lebanese
court.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier-General Sultan Abu Enein, also a member of the
Palestinian National Council, told the "Voice of Palestine" Sunday
the sentence was not aimed against him personally but "against the
Palestinian people in the Lebanese territories."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Court of Justice late October sentenced Abu Enein
to death in absentia on charges of "forming of a gang in Al Boss
Camp in the southern Lebanese town of Tyre, with the objective of
terrifying citizens, encroaching on properties and challenging the
authority of the State."
</P>
<P>
He was also charged with leading the gang and involvement in
delivery and sale of military arms.
</P>
<P>
However, Abu Enein asserted that the background and reasons
given for the verdict passed by the Lebanese court were not based
on any legal evidence.
</P>
<P>
He added that the sentence was a political decision rather than
a judicial one, and that this case could only be resolved through
dialog between the political leadership of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Abu Enein expressed hope that the settlement of this case and
revocation of the sentence would rectify Palestinian-Lebanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) had officially
requested last Sunday the League of Arab States to use its good
offices with the Lebanese government to nullify the verdict.
</P>
<P>
The PNA complained that the sentence was "outrageous, swift and
unjust, causing instability and tension in relations between
Palestine and Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Farouk Kaddoumi, head of PLO's Political Department
who was currently on a visit to Syria, has expressed readiness to
proceed to Beirut for talks with the Lebanese officials on the
Abu Enein case.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will meet Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in
Paris to tackle the developments in the Middle East peace process
following the just concluded Oslo tripartite summit of
U.S. President Bill Clinton, Arafat and Barak.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa met Saturday with
visiting Iranian Foreign Undersecretary Moshtabah Taj on means of
promoting bilateral trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting, the Iranian minister said his talks
with Moussa took up the progress achieved in these two domains as
well as organizing two trade exhibitions in Cairo and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Moussa Saturday discussed the Egyptian-Libyan peace
initiative on Sudan during a meeting with a Sudanese opposition
figure.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting, Osman el-Merghani, chief of the
opposition umbrella National Democratic Alliance, renewed the
opposition's backing to the initiative, which calls for permanent
cease-fire and a conference on Sudanese national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Fightings between Sudanese government and the south and north
opposition groups have claimed nearly 2 million lives in the poor
African country.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- An Egyptian Foreign Ministry official Saturday categorically
denied that an Egyptian delegation that wound up a visit to Kuwait
Saturday, had requested to attend interrogations conducted by the
Kuwaiti authorities into the recent street clashes.
</P>
<P>
"This is a Kuwaiti affair in the first place," said Egyptian
Assistant Foreign Minister Asem Megahed in Kuwait City just before
leaving here after a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The visit came to defuse possible dispute between Egypt and
Kuwait following a street fighting in southern Kuwait, which
involved thousands of Egyptian and Bengalese expatriate workers in
Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explodes in Israel, Injuring 18 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen people were lightly
or moderately injured in a pipe bomb explosion in the northern
Israeli coastal city of Netanya Sunday, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The police were treating the blast as a terror attack and have
arrested a number of suspects, including a Palestinian, the
reports said. But the police have not confirmed the report about
the arrest.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office issued a statement saying
that Barak viewed the bombing as "a serious development" and that
Israel would commit itself to fighting against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said on Israel Radio that
he does not believe this minor pipe bomb should disrupt the whole
peace process between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off at about 10:30 local time (0830 GMT) in a
trash can which then caught fire, the radio said. The police were
dismantling a second pipe bomb near the same site at a main road
junction, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether the motive of the attack
was criminal or terror. Netanya is known as a city of organized
crime in Israel, and pipe bombs have been used by gangs.
</P>
<P>
The bombing happened one day after the military wing of Hamas,
Izzadin Kassam, threatened Saturday to step up terror attacks to
protest against the settlement policy of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Militants of Hamas, who opposed the peace process and vowed to
liberate all occupied Palestinian territories, have carried out a
series of terror attacks in Israel in the last few years in an
attempt to derail the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians are to begin the final-status
talks in the West Bank city of Ramallah Monday. Barak warned
earlier Sunday of possible terror attacks as the two sides are
working to achieve a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the previous hard-line government led by Benjamin
Netanyahu, which often imposed collective punishment for such
attacks, Barak's government has carried on its commitments in
peace deals to prevent the peace process from being disrupted.

HONG KONG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- China, birthplace of Wushu or
Chinese Martial Arts, showed its superiority and mastery in the

<P>
"I am very satisfied with my 13 athlets' performance,
especially Shanshou fighters in the tournament, I'd say we have
reached our aim," said Chinese team leader Li Jie, who is general
secretary of the International Wushu Federation.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote Wushu to the world, Chinese, who won eight
golds in last championships in Rome two years ago, restrained
themselves by limiting each of their 8 Taolu athlets to compete in
only one event.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, all the eight athlets were crowned in their events
in the tournament which featured 20 Taolu events and 11 Shanshou
categories.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's competitions, China's Jian Zengjiao did not meet
problems by winning the men's Daoshu in 9.60 points. The silver
medal went to South Korean Park Chan Dae who scored 9.41.
</P>
<P>
Ng Siu Ching of Hong Kong, China, defended her world title in
women's Nanquan in 9.43 points. Vateran Ng has collected four
golds in the previous world championships.
</P>
<P>
Macao's Lei Fei won the silver medal with a difference of 0.10
points.
</P>
<P>
In the Shanshou competition, four out of five Chinese shanshou
athlets sailed into the finals, with three of them winning in
their categories respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chen Long, Wang Wenjun and Zheng Kunyou were triumphed in 48kg,
52kg, 56kg respectively while Jian Zhengjiao was beaten by
Djanpolad Boudagov of AZE in the 70kg category.
</P>
<P>
Russia became the sixth team to snatch a gold in the tournament
as Ahhadov Murat clinched won the 65kg category by beating Loriaux
Alain of the United States in Shanshou.
</P>
<P>
His compatriot Ataev Boziget won the 80kg category.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Kim Gwee Jong clinched the second gold for his
country in the tournament when he overwhelmed Diep Bao Minh of
Vietnam in the 60kg final.
</P>
<P>
In the other categories, Iran won two golds while the other two
titles went to Ukrain's Chamic Magomedov of 90kg and Egypt's
Elkenam Ibrahim of 85kg.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 362 athletes from 55 countries and regions are
competing for 31 gold medals in the four-day tournament.
</P>
<P>
Wushu, an ancient Chinese defense art also known as Kungfu, is
now an increasingly popular sport in the world, with 60 million
people in China and over 10 million fans outside China practicing
it.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka Army Launches Counter-Attack in North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
Sunday launched a counter-attack on Tamil rebels in the north of
the country after losing several key bases to the rebels in fierce
fighting in the past six days, media sources here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The troops had moved from three flanks from the north of the
government-held Vavuniya, a frontier town 250 km northeast of
Colombo, the sources quoted officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have
captured seven key towns, as ferocious battles were rage in the
north of Sri Lanka, leaving up to 1,200 combatants dead on both
sides, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has now regained control of towns of Mankulam,
Olumadu, Oddusudan, Karuppaddamurippu, Ampakamam, Nedunkerni and
Puliyankulam, which were recaptured by government troops last
year.
</P>
<P>
The heavy artillery duels and fierce fighting are continuing
for the sixth day as the Sri Lankan army is fighting to stop the
LTTE rebels' southward march, media sources here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the jobs of several army commanders in the north
were changed, a press release issued by the Defense Ministry said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Among the changes, Major General Neil Dias replaced Wanni
security forces commander Major General Wasantha Perera, who was
made commandant of the army staff college. Some divisional
commanders also had their jobs changed.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting for a separate state for the
Tamil minority in the north and east of the country since 1983.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai employed 8.36 million
people by the end of 1998, with 3.47 million people engaged in the
tertiary industry, 230,000 more than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics reveal that the manufacturing industry reduced its
employees by 200,000. Shanghai started to readjust product
structure in the 1980s, and efforts have been focused on
developing finance, trade, transportation, postal and
telecommunications and other service industries in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, the proportion of tertiary industry in the city's
GDP has been growing at an annual average rate of 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the tertiary industry achieved 176.25 billion yuan in
added-value, or 47.8 percent of the city's total GDP. Experts
predict that employment structure of Shanghai will continue to
change with the retooling of the state-owned enterprises.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Izzadin Kassam, the military wing of Palestinian radical
group Hamas, threatened Saturday to step up terror attacks in
response to settlement policy of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Preventive Security chief in the West Bank Jibril
Rajoub dismissed the threat as nothing new and said the timing was
no surprise. It showed that there are some individuals who want to
use violence to boycott the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has begun preparing for the
forceful eviction of Jewish settlers from illegal outposts in the
West Bank this week if the Yesha Council of Settlements, the
settlers leadership, does not convince the residents of these
outposts to leave voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
While Prime Minister Ehud Barak has set Monday as the deadline
for the settlers to accept the plan to dismantle 15 outposts, he
has hinted that he would agree to extend this deadline if the
Yesha Council demonstrates that it is making progress toward
carrying out its plan.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The final-status negotiating teams are to hold their first
working meeting Monday in Ramallah, ahead of an expected flurry of
diplomatic activities in Paris on the Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which were opened formally almost two months ago,
are now to begin in earnest, officials at the Prime Minister's
Office said Sunday. Barak and Syrian President Hafez Assad's son
Bashar will visit Paris separately this week.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The IDF is preparing to remove six military bases in the
West Bank for the further Israeli troop withdrawal slated on
November 15 under the latest Sharm el-Sheikh agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet will meet Wednesday to approve the
second transfer of land.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Sri Lanka's War Strategy Suffers Severe Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- In a surprise offensive that
began late Monday, Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels had overrun one army
base another and by Sunday had regained a large part of the
northern Wanni region which was captured by the army last year.
</P>
<P>
"The Sri Lankan government has taken a severe blow in its
military strategy to capture the Tamil homeland," said Anton Raja,
a spokesman for the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE).
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman Brigadier Sunil Thennakoon said the LTTE rebels
struck in retaliation for army advances on the rebels'
headquarters of Mullaitivu on Sri Lanka's northeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, the bloodiest in 14 months, has proved the
government's military strategy is in tatters, just weeks before
President Chandrika Kumaratunga was asking voters for a new
mandate in the forthcoming presidential poll on December 21 to
finally settle the 16-year-old ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE said the offensive, codenamed "Unceasing Waves 3," was
planned and directed by its leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has been concentrated in the heavily forested
Wanni region, about 280 kilometers north of the capital Colombo.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting the rebels have captured about 10 army
bases strategically located west of its present headquarters of
Mullaitivu, which was captured by the rebels in July, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels said they had lost 100 fighters and the Defense
Ministry said 211 of its troops were dead or missing in the
action. But military sources said the casualties could be much
higher.
</P>
<P>
"Over 1,000 troops have been killed and double that number
injured during the last four days of heavy fighting," the LTTE
said in a statement on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been fighting a drawn-out war against the
government for an independent homeland in this tropical island's
north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
In a war that has been dragging on so long, neither the
government nor the LTTE rebels seem able to win. Successive
governments have failed to find a solution to the deadlock, unable
to win the war and unwilling to allow the rebels to establish a
Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga was elected in November 1994 on a promise that she
would bring peace through talks. After her talks with Tiger rebels
ended in failure in April 1995, Kumaratunga adopted what is known
as a war-for-peace strategy to contain the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The government's strategy has been to weaken the LTTE
militarily to force them to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the army has scored significant gains by capturing
LTTE's former stronghold Jaffna in 1996 and reducing the amount of
rebel territory from 9,100 square kilometers in 1994 to 3,200
square kilometers at present.
</P>
<P>
Though the army's territorial gains in the north and east since
1995 have been important successes, government soldiers have
become tied down to the newly acquired real estate, leaving hardly
any manpower for more operations.
</P>
<P>
Before the latest fighting, there had been concerns that the
military was over-stretched and spreading too thin and didn't have
enough manpower to hold on to the area it had taken during the
past series of operations.
</P>
<P>
The 120,000-strong army needs at least 20,000 more men if the
current war against the LTTE is to be conducted with any degree of
success and at least twice its present number for a decisive
victory, military analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
However, the army finds it hard to recruit newcomers and many
soldiers are suffering from war-fatigue.
</P>
<P>
Despite the significant gains, victory is elusive and neither
side seems able to finally defeat the other. The seesaw battle
indicates that a military solution to the war is impossible,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The latest loss follow earlier losses of key bases like
Kilinochchi in September last year and Mullaitivu in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Kilinochchi's loss forced the government in last December to
call off its biggest ground offensive codenamed Sure Victory
against the LTTE that was launched in May 1997 to open a land
route to the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"The LTTE have time and again shown they are capable of hitting
back at key points. It seems difficult to weaken them militarily
and then force them to negotiate peace," a diplomat here said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Kumaratunga proposed a peace proposal in August 1995
to devolve powers to regional councils to partly meet the LTTE's
demand for independence. But four years later, she has failed to
push the proposal through the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The president has blamed the main opposition United National
Party for not backing her plans for devolution of power as a way
out of the ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Kumaratunga said peace is still within her grasp.
She set early presidential election for December 21 in the hope of
gaining a strong mandate to end the war. She had said peace will
be achieved within a couple of months if she was reelected to the
office.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said she was counting on a strong military advance
before the vote to show she could force the rebels into
negotiations. But now, the government has suffered heavy losses
and must deal with claims that election tactics were behind the
deaths.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alleged the military setback is a result of the
government trying to use the army to boost the president's
fortunes in the run-up to the presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said any further escalation of fighting and greater
losses could affect Kumaratunga's reelection hopes. But it's by no
means certain that the bloodshed will have a decisive effect on
the vote as people have accepted the seemingly unending bloodshed
as a way of life.
</P>
<P>
Mounting deaths among government troops and more losses of
territory may even encourage the president to postpone the
election citing security reasons, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga used the ongoing war to postpone
provincial council elections that were due in August last year
till April this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kumaratunga said in a letter made public Friday that
she planned to start talks with the rebels "as soon as it is
practically possible to do so."
</P>
<P>
The president has said the doors were open for talks if the
rebels agree to lay down their arms, giving up their demand for a
separate homeland and accept a timeframe for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
If the latest loss emphasized that a military solution to the
conflict was not possible and the two sides need to talk urgently,
it could be seen as a positive development, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
But if it is taken as a humiliating situation that needs to be
responded, then the war will be only protracted, they said.

JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen people were
injured, one seriously, in a pipe bomb explosion in the northern
Israeli coastal city of Netanya Sunday, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded at about 10:30 local time (0830 GMT) in a
trash can which then caught fire, the radio said. The police were
dismantling a second pipe bomb nwas criminal or terror. Netanya is known as a ci

</P>
<P>
The bombing happened one day before Israel and the Palestinians
are to begin the final-status talks in the West Bank city of
Ramallah. Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned Sunday of possible
terror attacks as the two sides are working to achieve a permanent
peace.
</P>
<P>
The military wing of Hamas, Izzadin Kassam, threatened on
Saturday to step up terror attacks to protest against the
settlement policy of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Hamas militants have conducted a series of terror attacks in
Israel in the last few years, but pipe bombs were not their
typical means.

</P>
<P>
The event, which runs from November 7-14, is hosted by the
Chinese Association for Science and Technology (CAST) along with
42 government groups.
</P>
<P>
"International Week will help to push forward the process of
science and peace in China, as well as international exchanges in

<HEADLINE> 40 Percent Palestinian Requests to Use Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel has rejected 40
percent of the Palestinians who have applied for using the safe
passage between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, local daily
Ha'aretz reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Since the opening of the route 11 days ago, some 10,000
applications have been submitted, but the Israeli security
authorities have issued the necessary magnetic cards to only
about 6,000 Palestinians, a senior security source told the daily.
</P>
<P>
The high rejection rate grows out of the fact that a large
proportion of the applicants are residents of Gaza who are on the
list of those barred from entering Israel, and some of the
applications are still being processed, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Replies are supposed to be given within 48 hours after an
application is received, but in some cases, if special checks are
deemed necessary, the Israel's reply can be delayed by another 24
hours, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Security authorities and the military police personnel who are
in charge of the checks for the safe passage said so far, they
have not encountered any unusual problems or attempts to smuggle
in arms or explosives.
</P>
<P>
Every day, about 500 Palestinians from Gaza Strip are using
the passage, the majority traveling in buses and cabs. This is
about twice as many as those leaving from the West Bank side, at
the village of Tarqumiya, near Hebron.

<HEADLINE> NSC Proposes Israeli-PNA Water Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel's National Security
Council has advised the government to refrain from making a
permanent division of water resources with the Palestinians in a
final settlement.
</P>
<P>
But Israel should agree to the joint management of the West
Bank's water resources only at the conclusion of a lengthy interim
period, the NSC said in its report submitted to Prime Minister Ehud
Barak a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Ha'aretz on Sunday made known the report which
recommended what the government should do in reaching a
final-status agreement on water resources division with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the new peace deal signed by Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in early September in Egypt, the division of
water resources is one of the thorniest issues to be settled
between the two sides in final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
During the proposed interim period, the report said, Israel
should continue to control the major groundwater reservoir in the
area, on the western slopes of the Samaria hills, and the
Palestinians would have to demonstrate their ability to manage the
water resources.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the NSC recommended intensive efforts should
be made to develop new water resources, while asking the United
States to exert pressure on Jordan and the Palestinians to take
part in a regional water desalination project.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) have
proposed in the past that Israel establish its own desalination
system and transfer to them a larger proportion of natural and
cheaper water that is available on the grounds that Israel has the
economic wherewithal to finance such a project.
</P>
<P>
The report cautioned against an Israeli agreement to jointly
manage the western aquifer, saying the principle danger stems
from the Palestinians' meager ability to enforce the agreement,
leading to a plethora of private, wildcat drillings and an
excessive pumping of water that would deplete the quality and
quantity of the water in the aquifer.
</P>
<P>
There is a huge gap in water usage between the Israelis and the
Palestinians. The Palestinians use a per capita average of 35
cubic meters of water a year, whereas consumption in Israel stands
at 104 cubic meters.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Agree on Regional Trade Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- An agreement on Southern

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Reaction Mixed to Philippine Passport Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A decision by the Philippine
embassy in Jordan to provide new passports to Philippine workers
whose travel documents was forcibly held by a third party met with
mixed reaction here.
</P>
<P>
The measure was welcomed by human activists, but drew
widespread outcry from recruitment agencies, the semi-official
Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new measure by the Philippine mission, any passport
will be regarded canceled and can be renewed when the owner
announces its loss or he or she believed the passport is being
forcibly held by the recruitment agencies or employers.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,000 Philippine workers are believed to be working in the
desert kingdom, most of them are women domestic helpers working
with a monthly salary of 80 to 120 Jordanian dinars (112 to 168
U.S. dollars) plus food and accommodation.
</P>
<P>
Only half of the workers had legal work permits and residence
visas from the Interior Ministry in Amman, Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Philippine workers had their passports detained by
the employer or recruitment to ensure that they will not leave the
places where they are working or leave the country without
settling their financial obligations, such as fines which were
imposed on the workers when they outstay their visas.
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups welcomed the new measure by the Philippine
embassy, saying it is easier for the "stranded" Philippine workers
to get a new passport without going through a maze of bureaucratic
rules.
</P>
<P>
However, recruitment agencies said they had no choice but to
confiscate the passports of the workers as a personal guarantee
from them, or the agencies had had to pay the overdues for the
workers if they leave their employers or leave the country.
</P>
<P>
The losses could be up to thousands of dollars for each case,
the agencies said.

<HEADLINE> Last Head of Demolished Village in Nature Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man is Huang Xingrang, the last village head of Yinyuhe in
central China's Shennongjia Nature Reserve. He was helping his
fellow villagers move things from their old homes in the village
to their new homes outside the deep mountains.
</P>
<P>
The village, situated in the center of the reserve in Hubei
Province, will be demolished after all the 200 villagers are
relocated in different new villages they chose so that they set
aside open space to wildlife and plants in the area.
</P>
<P>
Since he became head of the village four years ago, Huang has
always been busy with household moving on rocky path to other
places. And so far, 30 out of the 70 households in his village
have moved out in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
This year, the remaining 40 households also decided to abandon
and leave their homes at the village to resettle in the outside-
mountain areas. Huang realized that his term as a head of the
village will expire and Yinyuhe Village disappear in the reserve.
</P>
<P>
Whenever he began to help one household after another relocate
in other sites, he would said, "I hope that all of my folks could
find new happy, contented life at their new villages, I'm at ease
so I will try my best to help everyone."
</P>
<P>
"It is both painstaking and back-breaking to remove households
like this: carrying old things forth and back for scores of times
along such a bumpy path," 33-year-old Huang said, "Our forefathers
did so for generations. Now it's our turn to move out, but surely
our coming generations will no longer endure such hardships."
</P>
<P>
In the past the villagers substituted on hunting and hurb
collecting.
</P>
<P>
When the Shennongjia Nature Reserve was established in 1986,
some 30 hunting guns owned by villagers were turned in. But,
subsequently life was harder and tougher still and an increasing
number of needy farmers moved outside as hunting was banned and
lots of crops eaten by the wildlife.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few junior high school grades here, Huang served
as the fifth village head four years ago. Every year he led his
folks to seek and collected relief goods from the township
government.
</P>
<P>
"At present, every household knows that resettlement means the
only way to get rid of the poverty and become better-off," he said.
</P>
<P>
Today, Village head Huang himself has built his new home around
the seat of the township 50 km away and his family has been
allocated a two-hectare plot for farming and fruit raising. Huang
said, "Apart from farming, I am thinking of buying a motor vehicle
for doing transport jobs by means of easy traffic conditions. I
wish I will be an affluent farmer instead of village head."

<P>
CHENGDU, November 7 (Xinhua)-- A large number of stone carvings,
mostly stone coffins, have been excavated recently in dozens of
ancient tombs in southern Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Bamboo Ocean, running across the counties of Changning and
Xingwen in southwest China's Sichuan Province, is one of the
country's top 40 scenic spots. The tombs were found in Changning
county.
</P>
<P>
The tombs belong to the Eastern Han Period (25 A.D.- 220 A.D.).
From these well-preserved tombs, Chinese archeologists have
unearthed many sarcophaguses containing various vivid patterns.
The carvings vividly depict the life-like games and activities
such as football, Weiqi chess (better known in the West as "go"),
horse riding, archery and acrobatics some 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
These stone carvings are regarded as valuable artifacts in
studying the ancient culture and history of the Han dynasty in the

<HEADLINE> "Wild Birds" Found in Northwestern Shaanxi Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 7 (Xinhua)-- Hundreds of brown-colored "wild
birds", which were discovered in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province, have been confirmed as an endangered species (
crossoptilon mantchuricum), according to some international
experts.
</P>
<P>
These rare birds only live in China and head the national
protection list. The adult bird weighs some five kg with a body
length of one-meter and a tail resembling a tail of a horse. The
birds were discovered in Shanxi Province but only in small numbers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, more and more of these birds have appeared in the
city of Hancheng in central Shaanxi, the neighboring province of
Shanxi. Locals took them for some kind of wild bird.
</P>
<P>
Last October, ornithologists from New Zealand, Australia, the
United Kingdom and China conducted a joint survey and confirmed
the birds' identity.
</P>
<P>
According to a woodman, since September this year, groups of
crossoptilon mantchuricums have been flying around in the 20,000-
ha-forest with an estimated number of approximately 1,000.
</P>
<P>
After verifying the identity of the bird, the Shaanxi
Provincial Forestry Department applied to the central government
to build a natural reserve for these birds and to conduct further
researches, said Zhao Jianzhong, section manager of the local
forestry office.

<HEADLINE> 38 Soldiers Killed Combating Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-eight Iranian anti-drug
soldiers were killed in a recent armed clash with drug traffickers
in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan, local daily
Jomhuri Islami reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The daily said the Iranian soldiers were ambushed Wednesday by
an international drug trafficking group near Iranshahr city. Over
40 others were injured in the clash.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no details about the fighting.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference to local media on Saturday, Deputy
Commander of the Iranian security force Mohsen Ansari confirmed
the killings of security forces in clashes with drug traffickers,
but did not give the number.
</P>
<P>
He said the soldiers were starting to go to a dock holding
between 2.5 to 3.5 tons of drugs along with some ammunition, but
on their way came in contact with another caravan which had
entered from eastern borders which the drugs originated.
</P>
<P>
Some of the soldiers were martyred, an unspecified number of
drug traffickers were killed, and the said dock was destroyed,
local press quoted him as saying on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iranian security force launched seven large-scale
anti-drug operations in the provinces of Khorasan, Fars, East
Azerbaijan, Sistan-Baluchestan and Tehran during the past five
days.
</P>
<P>
In the operations, 3,316 kilograms of drugs were confiscated
and an additional five tons of drugs were burned, Ansari said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an Iranian official said 146 Iranian anti-drug
personnel lost their lives in various operations since the
beginning of this Iranian year, bringing the total number
martyred to this end to 2,088 since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly complained that it has been fighting alone
against drug trafficking and the country spends over 8,000 billion
rials (about 2.67 billion U.S. dollars) annually for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The country has been a transit for drug smuggling from south
and west Asia to European and the Gulf markets.

<HEADLINE> Bright Future Predicted for S.Africa's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, Nov 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's economy is
forecast to be rosy in the first year of the new millenium with a
continuation of the upswing recorded in the fourth quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Rian le Roux, head of South African Old Mutual Asset Manager's
economic research unit, said that South Africa's consumer spending
should grow by 0. 5 percent this year, and this would grow by
three percent next year, given the continued upswing. GDP should
also rise by three percent in the year 2000 compared with about
0.5 percent this year, local media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Le Roux said that South Africa's foreign reserves had improved
markedly, money supply and credit growth had fallen further, and
inflation had dropped to the lowest level in 31 years.
</P>
<P>
Favorable financial conditions had made further interest rate
cuts possible. The prime rate was cut recently by two percent to
15.5 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Forty-two people died of
asphyxia and 13 others injured Saturday night when a major fire
destroyed a marketplace in Sonipat, 70 kilometers north of here,
the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The victims, including 18 women and two children, died of
suffocation after they locked themselves inside a crockery shop
and were trapped while trying to escape the blaze late Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
Their bodies were found early Sunday morning inside the shop,
PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Police said a short circuit in one of the shops in the area
might have caused the fire which spread to nearby shops selling
crackers and other inflammable goods for Diwali, a major
traditional festival in India.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which gutted 17 shops, was not serious but the
shoppers made the mistake of locking themselves in the shop and
were trapped, said the police.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least seven people were killed, six injured and
two dozen houses gutted Saturday morning when a fire broke out at
an illegal fire cracker trading center on the outskirts of New
Delhi.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Sunday Indonesia feels that bilateral
problems between the republic and Malaysia can be resolved through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid in a
meeting with him here Saturday, Mahathir told reporters at the
Deepavali (festival) open house of Works Minister S. Samy Vellu
here.
</P>
<P>
"We (Malaysia) found that in terms of bilateral relations,
there are not many changes, except that they (Indonesia) feel that
any problem between Malaysia and Indonesia can be resolved through
negotiations without referring to third parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral problems between the two countries include the
overlapping claims over two small islands -- Ligitan and Sipadan.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his discussion with Abdurrahman was to touch base
because Malaysia wanted to get to know the new Indonesian
government better.
</P>
<P>
Abdurrahman left for Myanmar earlier Sunday after a two-day
working visit to Malaysia.

GUILIN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have found
five 800 year old hemlock trees around the scenic city of Guilin
in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the trees were found from a cliff
of a nature reserve over 1,700 meters above the seal level built
along Mount Mao'er inside Guilin and have a diameter of 80 cm each.
</P>
<P>
Hemlock trees, dubbed as living plant fossils, are on the brink
of extinction and now enjoy state protection in China. Ordinary
hemlock trees have an average life expectancy of about 300 years.
Hemlock trees grow slowly, with an annual growth length of about
two cm and a diameter of 0.12 cm.

Scientists hold that findings provide precious material for
rescuing the special plant from extinction as well as research
into ecological evolution.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rate Continues to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate
recorded a 0.11 percentage point increase to 2.95 percent for the
week ended October 23, as the recent hike in diesel prices
continued to manifest in the prices of most commodities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve bank of India, the annual rate of
inflation, based on Wholesale Price Index (WPI), rose for the
fourth consecutive week to 2.95 percent from 2.84 percent in the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
The rise in inflation rate is mainly due to the increase in the
prices of fuel, power, light &AMP; lubricants and primary articles
which registered an increase of 0.2 percent each during the
reference week.
</P>
<P>
The steep increase (40 percent) in diesel prices effected on
October 5, continued to reflect its indirect impact on prices of
other essential commodities.

<P>
MANILA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The per capital consumption of
fish in the Philippines is one of the highest in the world, as 80
percent of the country's fisheries products are consumed locally,
according to a report published here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Per capital consumption of fish (in the Philippines) is
estimated at between 35 and 40 kilograms, one of the highest in
the world," said the 1999 Philippine Fisheries Situation Report,
which was published by the Community-Based Coastal Resources
Management.
</P>
<P>
It said that about 80 percent of fisheries products are
consumed locally, while 20 percent are exported.

The fisheries industry in the Philippines provides employment
for about one million people, or 5 percent of the country's labor
force, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that around 50,000 people are employed in the
"ancillary industry" that includes post-harvest handling,
processing and marketing, boat-building, equipment manufacturing
and distribution.

KATHMANDU, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Chairperson of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Chandrika
Kumaratunga sent a letter to Nepali Prime Minister Krishna Prasad
Bhattarai Saturday informing him that the summit scheduled for
late November would be postponed.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka president Kumaratunga's letter was handed over
Saturday to the prime minister by the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to
Nepal Pamela Dean.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official of the Nepalese Foreign
Ministry, the letter said Nepal may now stop the preparations for
the summit.
</P>
<P>
It said that after the press release issued by the Indian
Ministry of External Affairs the date fixed earlier is
insignificant since not all countries agree on that.
</P>
<P>
The present SAARC charter stipulates that decisions at all
levels should be made on basis of consensus.
</P>
<P>
But the letter has not fixed the next date for the summit.
</P>
<P>
India had issued a press release Thursday stating that it would
be appropriate to defer the summit in view of the military coup in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan military ousted the civilian government led by Nawaz
Sharif in a bloodless coup on October 11.
</P>
<P>
SAARC was formed in 1985 and groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, the

<P>
The EC decided to postpone the elections in Chittagong, Khulna
and Rajshahi after consultation among the election commissioners
as they found that aspiring candidate wouldn't be able to collect
nomination papers on Sunday and submit on Monday due to the
two-day shutdown enforced by the opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
The elections were scheduled for December 6. No new schedule
has been set for the polls.
</P>
<P>
A single-judge court of the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court on Saturday stayed a High Court order which stayed elections
to the three city corporations for one week.
</P>
<P>
The EC on Saturday filed provisional leave petitions with the
Supreme Court against the High Court order on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The EC announced on October 28 that polls to three of the
country's four city corporations would be held on December 6. The
date for submission of nomination papers is November 8.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance comprising the major opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the Jatiya Party, the
Jamaat-e-Islami and the Jamaat Oikya Jote (Islamic Solidarity
Front) have threatened to boycott all the elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BNP-led opposition alliance on Saturday has
reduced its 42-hour hartal (strike) to 24 hours in order to have
dawn-to-dusk countrywide shutdowns on Sunday and Monday, and to
help the Hindu community celebrate their religious festival in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
The opposition called the hartal on Sunday to protest the
government's cancellation of November 7, the "National
Revolutionary and Solidarity Day" as a public holiday, and
Monday's strike to thwart submission of nomination papers for
elections in the three cities.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorian President Calls On People to Be Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian President Jamil Mahuad
on Saturday called on his people, affected by one of the worst
economic crisis in 70 years, to be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
In his customary speech, the president asked people to continue
struggling with economic crisis and forge ahead.
</P>
<P>
He said he was satisfied that the congress finally passed the
increase to the Value Added Tax from 10 percent to 12 percent, one
of the main sources of government revenue.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad is sure that he will reach agreement with the
International Monetary Fund that will facilitate the disbursement
of resources for the nation.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad's call followed a poll result published a few days ago,
which showed that only 14 percent of the 12 million Ecuadorians
believe in their president.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, 84 percent of the population reproves or
chose not to give an opinion to the work of the leader, who had a
rate of confidence of 66 percent when he assumed the presidency on
August 8, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The steady increase of prices, which put the inflation at 50
percent, the highest in America, the increase of the poverty that
affects more than 60 percent of Ecuadorians, and the incessant
political disputes are main reasons for the popular disapproval of
the presidency, according to the polling firm "Cedatos".
</P>
<P>
Ecuador is going through an acute crisis with the government
forecasting an economic decrease between 5 and 7 percent in 1999.

in Kathmandu on the previously scheduled dates -- November 26-28,
said a press release issued Saturday night by the Sri Lankan
Foreign Ministry.
</P>

the Summit for the time being.
</P>
<P>
It added that having regard to the provisions of the SAARC
Charter, which stipulates that decisions at all levels should be

SAARC Summit would not take place in Kathmandu on the previously
scheduled dates.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Stable Timber Imports Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7(Xinhua)-- An official of the State
Forestry Administration predicted that China's timber imports are
not expected to increase much during the year 2000,according to
China Daily Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
"The country's timber imports will stabilize at about 10
million cubic meters," said Dong Xinmin, deputy director of the
administration's forest products co-ordination centers.
</P>
<P>
Domestic supply is expected to be 60 million cubic meters in
2000, with demand at 70 million cubic meters, he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned timber importers not to overestimate a projected
timber shortage in China stemming from the central government's
logging ban. The ban was imposed in the second half of last year
to protect natural forest.
</P>
<P>
Under the ban, forests in the upper reaches of the Yangtze and
Yellow rivers may no longer be logged. But the areas do not
account for much of China's total timber output.
</P>
<P>
Forests in the northeastern forest area, which account for the
biggest share of the total volume, and mature forests planted 50
or more years ago, can be logged.
</P>
<P>
Even though State-owned forest operations are restricted in
their production, they are not always required to follow the ban
to the letter, since large amounts of funding designated for
compensation and to assist them in their move to other businesses
have not been fully allocated yet, said Dong.
</P>
<P>
He said timber importers should learn a lesson from the deluge
of timber imports which resulted in an oversupply and lower prices
on the Chinese market during the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
To avoid timber shortages, the central government has reduced
tariffs on timber imports and has cut wood-product tariffs to zero.
</P>
<P>
It has allowed many more firms to import timber than prior to
the logging ban.
</P>
<P>
China imported about 5.5 million cubic meters of timber during
the first half of this year, compared with 6 million cubic meters
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The imports have set a record in terms of amounts, varieties
and sources, Dong said. The imports are mainly from Southeast Asia,
Russia, Europe, Africa and the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
As stockpiles grow, timber buyers are getting picky and the
prices of timber are sliding, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Stone Materials Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics indicate that China exported 390 million U.S.
dollars worth of stone products in January-September this year, up
3.5 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 27,000 firms involving stone material
exploration and processing, and its annual production last year
was 135 million sq m, ranking the second in the world, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
An industry insider contributed the pick-up to economic
recovery of Asian countries, to which more than half of China's
stone products were sold. Another important reason is the improved
production capacity of processed stone products, which accounts
for more than 70 percent of total exports.
</P>
<P>
Chinese stone materials exporters are attaching importance to
the markets in Europe, which is the world's largest stone market,
according to Zhang Wenbo, secretary-general of the China Stone
Material Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese firms hope to expand exchanges and
cooperation with their European counterparts so as to improve
China's mine capacity and increase exports.
</P>
<P>
The association has organized a delegation to attend the Italy
International Stone Material Exhibition in September, he noted,
adding that they also plan to invite foreign counterparts to

<HEADLINE> Ultraviolet Radiation Increases in Northern Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The north of Peru registers an
increase of ultraviolet radiation because of the thinning of the
ozone layer in the upper atmosphere, an expert said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Niceforo Ia Maguina, the director of the Training Center of
the National Meteorology and Hydrology Service (Senamhi) said that
the 200 meteorological stations installed by Senamhi in Peru
confirmed the formation of some "holes" over the north of Peru.
</P>
<P>
Studies showed the "holes" are formed by the destruction of
ozone layer by the freon gas used in chemicals for agriculture and
in pesticides in the area, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite international recommendations against the use of freon
and other gases that destroy the ozone layer, peasants and
refrigerator manufacturers still use the substances that contain
them, he added.
</P>
<P>
Those gases are easily dissolved in the atmosphere and in a
short time destroy the ozone layer, permitting the passing of
ultraviolet radiation, Maguina explained.

<HEADLINE> Peru Warns against Permanent Damage to Ecosystem in Amazonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 250,000 hectares of forest
have been cut every year in the Peruvian Amazonia by the so-called
migratory agriculture, and the area may have lost some genetic
materials to reforest forever, the National Natural Resources
Institute (Inrena) warned on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The areas most affected by the deforestation are San Martin,
Amazonas, Ucayali, and Loreto.
</P>
<P>
Inrena said that when farmers make openings in a careless way
in the forest and a large extension of wildwood is cut, the
possibility of recovering the genetic material to reforest is lost.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the lumber industry exploits in a selective
manner the resource and leaves species that will later form a new
Amazonic forest, said Inrena.
</P>
<P>
The soil of the cut forests produces good harvests in the first
two years. The farmers abandon it by the fifth year and cut trees
in the adjoining land for new cultivation, specially corn, yucca,
papaya, bananas and beans.
</P>
<P>
Largely affected by the accelerating deforestation in Amazon
area, most Latin American countries had suffered a lot from the El
Nino climate phenomenon, Inrena added.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in Venezuela Soars in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in
Venezuela reached 22 percent in October, up almost five percent
over September, labor unions and economic analysts said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Economist Juan Carlos Larranaga with the High Administrative
Studies Institute (IESA) said that the hike of the jobless rate
last month surpassed the less optimistic estimate of under 20
percent at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Local press quoted him as predicting that the 22-percent rate
could increase a little more in the coming months of the year
because of the promulgation of the new Constitution that will
reduce the length of the working day.
</P>
<P>
The National Constitutional Assembly (ANC) approved last week
to reduce the working week to 40 hours for workers.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Workers Confederation (CTV) President Carlos Navarro
put his estimation of the unemployment rate at near 22 percent in
November and December, blaming the rise to the difficult economic
situation starting last year, when the prices of oil, the major
prime mover of the Venezuelan economy, dropped.
</P>
<P>
The more conservative data of the Datanalysis private company,
which are also shared by the government, forecast that the
unemployment rate will stand between 15 and 16 percent at the end
of the year.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Parliament Chairman Leaves for New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Popular Power National Assembly
(parliament) President Ricardo Alarcon Saturday left here for New
York to attend the U.N. General Assembly discussions.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon will attend the discussions in the General Assembly
about a resolution project presented by Cuba to end the economic
embargo the United States imposed on the island country 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The discussions on the resolution project that Cuba presents
every year to the General Assembly will be held next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cuba expects that as on previous occasions, the General
Assembly will adopt a resolution that rejects the U.S. blockade
and demands its lifting.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon said at his departure that the approval of the project
will face difficulties because some countries that have always
supported it will not be able to vote because they are behind in
their contributions to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is a very intense campaign from Washington,
which pressures several governments to abstain from backing the
project.
</P>
<P>
He said he has copies of letters on this matter that Washington
sent to several countries and that he will make the respective
denunciation during his participation in the General Assembly
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon underscored "the rabies" of the U.S. extreme right
sectors for Cuba's achievements at the national and international
level and the imminence of the 9th Iberoamerican Summit, which has
increased the political and diplomatic hostility.

<HEADLINE> UK, French PMs Hold Informal Beef Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair held informal talks with his French counterpart, Lionel
Jospin, on the British beef dispute when the two men met at the
World Rugby Cup final Saturday, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers, sitting together during the game,
which France lost to Australia, in Cardiff, Wales, had a brief
discussion about beef during the interval, a Downing Street
spokeswoman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
France has continued to refuse to lift its ban on British beef
exports amid fears of a health risk from mad cow disease. But both
Blair and Jospin "remain confident of a swift resolution to the
situation," the Downing Street spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
She said it was "hardly likely" that Blair had made any
concessions in the discussion with Jospin, but gave no further
details of the talks, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
British and French officials held talks about the beef dispute
in Brussels Friday, but ended the session with no plans for a
further meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany are the only two European Union countries
still with import bans on British beef despite the European
Commission decision earlier this year to lift an EU-wide embargo
imposed more than three years ago.
