   EXPLOSIVE (Phoenix) _ More explosives are stolen in Arizona than
almost anywhere else in the country, but so far, the state has done
next to nothing to regulate the industry. Throughout the state,
explosives are stacked in storage magazines outside mines, rock
quarries and construction sites with little security. All it takes
are some good tools and a getaway vehicle to haul off a few hundred
pounds of blasting materials. That's exactly what happened Dec. 12,
when 1,000 pounds of explosives disappeared from a rock quarry near
the rural community of Drake in north-central Arizona. The theft,
coming amid fears of terrorism on the eve of the millennium,
alarmed law-enforcement agencies, who now acknowledge that they are
out of leads despite posting a $10,000 reward. By MARK SHAFFER.

   NAVAJOS (KYKOTSMOVI, Ariz.) _ Beyond the battles over which
tribe has the stronger spiritual connection to the land or the more
powerful claim for historic justice, the Navaj-Hopi dispute has
also been a battle of public relations. For years, that worked to
the advantage of the Hopis, long celebrated among non-Indians for
their highly spiritual, peace-loving ways. Most outsiders heard
``Hopi'' and thought: kachina dolls. In the 1970s, Hopi tribal
leaders bolstered their position with a PR campaign portraying the
Navajos as marauding bullies. Today, however, it's the Hopis' turn
to be cast as the villains. Clayton Honyumptewa, director of the
tribe's lands office, hears it in telephone calls about the forced
relocation of thousands of Navajos from land granted by federal law
to the Hopis. By JERRY KAMMER. Story will move in the ``A''

   HULL (Phoenix) _ In 1962, Jane Hull, Arizona's present governor,
was a 26-year-old schoolteacher who left a comfortable Kansas City
suburb and moved to Chinle, a remote town on the Navajo Reservation
in northern Arizona. There was no theater, no library; only a few
trading posts. There was no supermarket, so Hull did her shopping
in Albuquerque, planning family meals six weeks at a time. Hull's
time in Chinle offers a striking image of the governor as a gritty
frontier woman. But now, as she begins her third year in
office,lawmakers are grumbling that the real power is held by
Hull's chief of staff, Around the capitol, the whispers have
started. Has the Iron Lady started to rust? Hull and her staff
laugh off such claims. She says Collins takes most of the flak,
because that's his role as chief of staff. By BILL MULLER. Story

A LOT OF CREDENTIALS; NOT A LOT OF CHOICES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe there is a greater sense of credit-card
security. Or it's just that vicarious thrill of lining the pockets
of three of our country's greatest sports stars.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, if buying an overpriced pair of
cross-trainers or a set of barbells from a Web site supported by
John Elway, Wayne Gretzky and Michael Jordan sounds too cool to
pass up, then they've succeeded in getting your business at
MVP.com, which launched this week in concert with heavy promotion
at the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   What the All-Star Cafe is to food, MVP.com hopes to be more for
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The three may have little experience with Internet ventures, but
lending their name to this is ``something that definitely helps us
on the marketing side, especially with all the dot-coms out
there,'' said Elway, MVP.com's chairman. ``Critics say, `well you
think you'll be successful because you have a lot of high
visibility athletes involved.' Well, we know it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will really contribute to this business,'' promises Jordan.
``It's not just a name or an endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 25,000 items for sale, but ironically, nothing from
Jordan's gravy train, Nike. Items, especially footwear, from other
big-name makers like Adidas and Converse are also limited to just a
few styles.
</P>
<P>
   The other hook to this is that the icons will offer suggestions
and tips on what to buy. Jordan, for example, says about basketball
shoes: ``If you don't have a shoe that offers support for your feet
and ankle, you're headed for lots of injuries.'' Thanks, Dr.
Scholl.
</P>
<P>
   Financial backers of MVP.com include L.A.-based venture capital
funder Freeman Spogli. It also has established a sales link with
CBS SportsLine.com, and plans are to spend $50 million in
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Without much to choose from, what's the point?

MICHAELS SAVES THE DAY IN TELECAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What smoked, choked and provoked us to check out
another dot-commer-come-lately during Sunday's TV Super Bowl event:
</P>
<P>
   Michaels' memorable calls: Proving again to be the network
maestro behind the mike, Al Michaels eclipsed blathering partner
Boomer Esiason with several poignant quips at the end of the game
that otherwise needed nothing said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a movie called `The Longest Yard' _ there is your
sequel,'' Michaels said in reference to the final play of the game,
Tennessee's Kevin Dyson trying to stretch the ball over the goal
line as time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   After a few more believable cries of ``unbelievable!,'' Michaels
closed the telecast with a story of Kurt Warner's rise from nowhere
with the phrase ``this is the look of a fairy tale'' as Dick
Vermeil and Warner hugged.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels' call was almost deja vu for anyone who remembers the
Warren Beatty movie ``Heaven Can Wait,'' where Dick Enberg has the
winning Rams quarterback in the Super Bowl locker room and asks,
``What's it like right now to be Tom Jared?''
</P>
<P>
   Boomer's boners: Too many to document. Or care about, after a
certain point.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't stepping on Michaels or a referee's call
</P>
<P>
   the ABC booth's version of ``Who's Line Is It Anyway'' _ Boomer
was jammering out countless uninsightful, cliche comments that
didn't make any sense.
</P>
<P>
   His argument with Michaels late in the game about why he thought
Tennessee should take a timeout with 31 seconds left instead of
spiking the ball came back to slap him in the face.
</P>
<P>
   And his final take on the Warner story: ``He just completed, in
my estimation, the greatest season ... or one of, if not maybe, the
second-greatest season ever by a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   What?
</P>
<P>
   Two hours too much: As tight, balanced, insightful and
tear-jerking the four hours of pregame ABC infotainment was, this
proves again that an even tighter two-hour production would have
more impact and viewer retainment.
</P>
<P>
   Pregame boosts: 1) a slightly puffy Andrea Kreamer, fresh off
the birthing table, is back live on the ESPN set with her
unsettling piece on family obligations that players are often
guilted into, 2) the Fritz Pollard feature, especially with an NFL
Films' never-seen interview with him in 1970 finally shown, 3) the
Marino family adoption of a little Chinese girl, 4) the ever-prude
Barbara ``I Just Don't Get All The Whoo-Ha'' Walters forced to
recoil again when her co-hosts of ``The View'' asked the question:
``Would women watch the Super Bowl if players' pants were looser?''
</P>
<P>
   Pregame busts: 1) Chris Berman's voice; 2) Was that cornball Jim
McKay piece a spoof?
</P>
<P>
   Commercial successes: 1) Muhammad Ali spots for WebMD; 2) the
cat wranglers by EDS.com; 3) FedEx delivers helium balloons to the
Lollypop Guild munchkins; 4) the cyclist who pulls the Mountain Dew
out of the cheetah's belly; 5) E-trade showing a monkey dancing the
cucaracha and exclaiming ``Well, we just wasted 2 million bucks ...
what are you doing with your money?''
</P>
<P>
   Ads to subtract: 1) Mike Ditka pushing ``Runaway Bride''
videotapes; 2) ABC's Regis Philbin dream miniseries; 3) Wayne
Gretzky on the Zamboni.
</P>
<P>
   Questions that need to be asked: 1) What critter has burrowed
its way into Leslie Visser's hair? 2) Was Steve Young wearing a
piece of gold on his ring finger?
</P>
<P>
   A better bettor than bowler: On the Don Carter Classic bowling
tournament carried on ESPN during ABC's pregame show, Northridge's
Eric Forkel predicted a 21-10 Rams victory. He then went out and
lost his first-round match.

STATE CURBS URGED ON EXPLOSIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY MARK SHAFFER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   More explosives are stolen in Arizona than almost anywhere else
in the country, but so far, the state has done next to nothing to
regulate the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the state, explosives are stacked in storage
magazines outside mines, rock quarries and construction sites with
little security. All it takes are some good tools and a getaway
vehicle to haul off a few hundred pounds of blasting materials.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what happened Dec. 12, when 1,000 pounds of
explosives disappeared from a rock quarry near the rural community
of Drake in north-central Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The theft, coming amid fears of terrorism on the eve of the
millennium, alarmed law-enforcement agencies, who now acknowledge
that they are out of leads despite posting a $10,000 reward.
</P>
<P>
   It prompted state police agencies to quadruple the number of
officers guarding the Legislature for Gov. Jane Hull's recent State
of the State address.
</P>
<P>
   And it has lit a fuse among some officials, who are calling for
the Legislature to require that the estimated 200 blasters in the
state be licensed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem:
</P>
<P>
   _Arizona is one of only 13 states that do not regulate those who
use explosives, despite its numerous mines and high use of blasting
for new construction.
</P>
<P>
   _The state is third in the nation in the amount of explosive
material stolen and first in the amount of stolen material
recovered, according to the most recent federal statistics
available.
</P>
<P>
   _The state doesn't have a handle on how much explosive material
there is or where it is stored. The feds do, but they don't readily
share that information because they are putting together a database
that state officials cannot yet access.
</P>
<P>
   _And although the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms keeps track of the total amount of explosives stolen and
recovered, a spokesman said he has never seen a breakdown of those
incidents. &QL; 
LEADING THE CHARGE &QL; 
Mining Inspector Doug Martin is leading the charge on the
Legislature to require that blasters be licensed.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, the State Fire Safety Committee is charged with
issuing permits to manufacture, transport or use explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still waiting to see my first fire-safety explosives
permit,'' said Phil Howard, assistant state mine inspector.
</P>
<P>
   He added that municipalities such as Phoenix tightly control
blasting, but there are no such regulations in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature tried to regulate blasters, albeit
half-heartedly, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A study committee on explosives regulation was formed but one of
the committee members, Rep. Joe Hart, R-Kingman, said he doesn't
remember it meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling then was that if no one has been killed by
blasting agents, then we shouldn't worry about a law,'' Martin
said. ``I've been saying all along that this is about prevention.
Now, we've got the threat of terrorism, and more explosives were
stolen in Drake than were ever threatened to be brought across the
Canadian border.''
</P>
<P>
   But Doug Lindsey of Phoenix, who has been in the business of
selling explosives for more than 40 years, said the state effort
overreached and would have duplicated the oversight that the
federal government already provides.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ATF's role of documenting transactions and
storage facilities, the U.S. Department of Transportation governs
the transportation of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lindsey said that no amount of regulation would stop
determined criminals. Lindsey said that his company, Lindco
Equipment and Supply, had 600 pounds of blasting powder and more
than 1,200 sticks of dynamite stolen in 1991. Lindsey said most of
the stolen material was recovered over time, dumped in the desert
of the West ern part of the state &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``More regulations are not going to affect theft,'' Lindsey
said, noting that he had upgraded security on 15 explosives storage
magazines around the state after anxious blasting operations called
his office for help in the wake of the Drake theft. &QL; 
TRAINING, TESTING &QL; 
Lindsey says he favors a state license that would require training
and testing for all blasters.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lindsey says even more pressing is a need for a federal
license for buyers, which would require background checks at the
time of the purchase, much as the Brady Law does for guns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Institute of Makers of Explosives, &UR; a Washington, D.C.-based
safety association of the commercial explosives industry in the
United States and Canada, also has been pushing mightily for a
national license to buy explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any person can walk into an explosives distributor and, with a
signature on a form, buy explosives,'' said Chris Ronay, a retired
FBI bomb expert who is director of the institute. ``We've been
trying to close that loophole for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronay said the institute lobbied Congress to address that
loophole and got a rider on a juvenile-justice bill currently
before the assembly, ``but that bill appears dead now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A good example of the problems in monitoring are last year's
statistics,'' Ronay said. ``There were 28,000 pounds of explosives
stolen and half again as much which wasn't reported. There were
100,000 pounds of stolen explosives recovered, some of it going
back years, and a lot of it there were no records on.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute also has lobbied for uniformity in state laws
across the country. There are more than 3,000 regulating bodies for
explosives, Ronay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states can exceed federal regulations, and that would be a
good situation to have,'' Ronay said. ``For example, the feds could
require a minimum number of locks on magazines but Arizona could
decide that it wants explosives in bombproof bunkers instead.'' &QL; 
TOUGH CALIFORNIA LAWS &QL; 
Howard, the second in charge at the state Mine Inspector's Office,
would welcome any state law to control the handling of explosives.
He said he managed a mine in California that has the toughest
regulations for blasters on the books, requiring three years'
experience, training courses and exams for a license.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the area of our mine, the sheriff's office also required a
background check,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of that, we found the true identity of a felon who had
assumed a man's identity who had been killed in Las Vegas five
years earlier. Being careful pays nice rewards.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: DORSETT CAN'T DRAW THE LAST LINE

  (Subs for rewriting throughout)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Every Super Bowl has an X factor: a play, a player, a
happening that emerges from the shadows to alter the course of the
glitter-drenched championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Miami, the X factor turned out to be a late-hour,
off-field incident involving Eugene Robinson, the Atlanta Falcons'
veteran safety and team leader, who was arrested on charges of
soliciting a prostitute for $40 the night before the game. It was a
disruption the Falcons could not afford against a Broncos team that
ultimately outclassed them.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, the X factor was Terrell Davis, who had a
breakout game in a breakout season. There was Desmond Howard's
kickoff return for Green Bay in Super Bowl XXXI in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sunday night's Super Bowl between Tennessee and St.
Louis, Anthony Dorsett was the X factor. The Titans' free safety
was thrust from his special-teams role onto center stage when he
was forced to fill in for Marcus Robertson, the Titans' veteran who
suffered a broken ankle. His father is Tony Dorsett, the Hall of
Fame running back for the Dallas Cowboys. The father-son angle
became one of the compelling story lines this week with the young
Hawk, as Dorsett is called, being asked to look at his celebrity
father through a child's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night into early Sunday morning, Tony Dorsett put
aside the paternal feeling and looked at his son the way the Rams
were looking at his son: like the hunter looks at the deer, like
the lion looks at the zebra.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at him as prey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was game-planning the Titans,'' Dorsett said, ``and I got
a young guy stepping in there, starting for the first time in the
biggest game of the year, I'd test him. I'd test him early and I
might test him often until he gave me reason to say: `O.K., he's
going to hold his own. We might be shooting some blanks thinking
that we're going to win this game going in that direction.' If he
steps up to the plate, that's fine; if he doesn't then they're
going to come at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see if he's going to be the weak link. I just
don't want him to be the reason that things go bad.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly all of the first three quarters and most of the
fourth, young Dorsett played an error-free game. He made jarring
hits on Marshall Faulk, did not give up the obvious game-breaking
play, patrolled the secondary like a center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   But with just under two minutes remaining, both Dorsetts' worst
nightmare unfolded. The Titans had just tied the game at 16-16 on a
field goal by Al Del Greco. Then Kurt Warner and the Rams did what
they had done all season: they made the quick strike. Warner hit
Isaac Bruce with a 73-yard touchdown pass. Bruce beat cornerback
Denard Walker on the catch, but Dorsett, the Titans' last line of
defense, overran the play and missed an arm tackle when Bruce cut
back. Racing away from Dorsett, he sped into the end zone with the
winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, Tennessee's last gasp fell short. Titans
quarterback Steve McNair hit Kevin Dyson with a slant pass just
inside the 5-yard yard line, but Mike Jones, an eighth-year
linebacker, made a sensational open-field tackle and brought Dyson
down at the 1-yard-line, holding him there as Dyson desperately
tried to stretch the ball over goal line.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bitter ending for the Titans, their secondary, and
Dorsett. Considering Tennessee's predicament, the secondary,
playing man to man across the field, played heroically against the
National Football League's most prolific offense. Warner completed
19 of 35 passes for 277 yards in the first half alone, 24 of 45 for
414 yards for the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams scored just 9 points in the first half. The
evidence of Dorsett's inexperience was apparent just once in the
first quarter, when Faulk was wide open down the right sideline and
ran for a 52-yard gain. Dorsett was checking coverage with another
defensive back when St. Louis went on a quick snap, and he was late
getting over. But the secondary, as it had done all game, closed
ranks with airtight coverage, tips and pressures from the line. St.
Louis reached the 9-yard-line but missed a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Until Warner's game-breaking play, that was the pattern of the
game. The Rams sliced up the secondary from the 20 to the 20, then
the Titans defenders made plays: they would force Warner to hurry a
throw or make a bad throw under pressure. With 8 minutes 24 seconds
left in the third quarter, Blaine Bishop, the heart and soul of the
Titans' defense, was injured and forced to leave the game after a
head-first tackle on Ernie Conwell. He was replaced by Perry
Phenix, a second-year safety. Three plays after the long, somber
delay, Warner hit Torry Holt for the game's first touchdown.
Tennessee cut the lead to 16-13 with 7:21 to play. Then the defense
held: Faulk was held to a 2-yard gain; Jason Fisk knocked away a
slant to Holt, and Warner was hurried into an incompletion.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dorsett played in Super Bowl XII in 1978 when Dallas
defeated Denver, 27-10; he also played in Super Bowl XIII when
Dallas lost to Pittsburgh, 35-31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Anthony, think about this: I don't know who's
going to be introduced, offense or defense, but if they introduce
that defense, they're introducing you to the world,''' Dorsett
said. ``You got a big stage, a big platform to perform in. The
feeling that you're going to have is unexplainable, it is the best
feeling you're going to ever have, being introduced for a football
game, in your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may come back, but you won't experience it like you're
going to experience it the first time. You ain't going to be able
to wait for that ball to be kicked off.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss in a tough game, a great game, there is the
magic for Tony Dorsett of being able to play in two Super Bowls and
have a son become a central figure in the third.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Dorsett said that win or lose, he would say he
watched his son play in the game of both of their lives.

HOW ARE PARENTS EXPECTED TO DISCIPLINED THEIR KIDS?

</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ ``Webster's Third New International Dictionary''
defines discipline as ``training or experience that corrects,
molds, strengthens or perfects, especially the mental faculties or
moral character.'' And it's through such training that kids become
responsible members of their families and communities, says Paul
Miller, an associate professor of psychology who teaches about
child development and socialization at Arizona State University
West.
</P>
<P>
   In this process, parents ``are not incidental players _ they are
IT, period,'' Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   The parent-child relationship ``acts in a way to temper behavior
that's out of bounds and to reward behavior that's in bounds,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That relationship is both a comfort and a safety zone,''
Miller adds.

   Most of the world's major religions address the role parents and
other adults are to play in raising future generations. The
biblical book of Proverbs, for example, urges youth to adopt moral
values that will inform their daily lives, as well as their
spiritual formation. In fact, the two are seen as inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   We asked representatives of five religious traditions to answer
these questions from their faith's perspective: &QL; 
What does your faith tradition say about parental responsibility
when it comes to disciplining children? Does it distinguish between
physical and verbal chastisement? &QL; 
 &QL;

<P>

``The Holy Koran directs parents to acknowledge that children have
rights and should be respected by the parents. Parental
responsibility for Muslims when it comes to disciplining the
children begins with teaching and demonstrating proper respect for
Almighty God (Allah in Arabic, the language of the Koran). The
Muslim parents begin immediately to train the children that there
is only one God, and that God created everything in the universe,
including all human beings.
</P>
<P>
   We try our best to demonstrate God-consciousness to the
children, which further helps to develop their character and
self-control. The religion of Al-Islam puts strong emphasis on the
young, who know right conduct from wrong conduct _ and those who
don't know it are not held responsible, even if they cause damage
because of their unintentional actions. The Holy Koran teaches the
parents that our children are being entrusted to us, and as parents
we have an obligation to care for them, be kind to them, and
educate them.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Koran further states, ``In punishment there is life to
you, if you can reflect and think.'' Muslim parents that understand
their religion usually will punish their children for the wrong, by
first explaining the wrong that has been committed and reprimanding
the children with firmness laced with gentleness. If correctiveness
is rejected and the child shows open disrespect, arrogance and
rebellion, then the Muslim parents will discipline the child with
the best methods available at our time.
</P>
<P>
   The religion of Al-Islam clearly makes a distinction between
verbal and physical chastisement, because the Holy Koran does not
direct the parents to physically punish the children, but to
admonish the children with knowledge, wisdom and understanding. The
first obligation and duty in Al-Islam is to worship and obey
Almighty God; the next in line is for children to be respectful and
obedient to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Koran recognizes very clearly that parents are not always
immune from overprotectiveness or negligence, and has established
certain guidelines with respect to children. &QL;

   ``Parents are accountable to God for their parental
stewardships. All humans are created in God's image and are his
spirit children. When God sent us here to gain experience and
progress toward perfection, he intended for us to be born into
loving, nurturing families. With each birth, God entrusts to
parents the responsibility to love and teach his children. For
parents who accept the divine principles of parenthood,
disciplining children in righteousness is paramount.
</P>
<P>
   While volumes have been written about disciplining children,
adherence to a few basic principles results in a successful
parenting experience and the fulfillment of our divine parental
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   First, every parent must have selfless love for each child.
Without it, disciplining is a chore and can result in anger and
violence; with it, disciplining, although not easy, brings great
joy as the fruits of a disciplined child are realized.
</P>
<P>
   Second, children must be treated with kindness and respect.
Although younger, smaller and less experienced than we, our
children are our equals in God's plan and must be treated with the
respect they deserve as his children.
</P>
<P>
   Third, children learn with consistent expectations and
discipline; they must know their limits and suffer consequences
when those limits are exceeded. This prepares them to live by the
rules of society and the commandments of God.
</P>
<P>
   Corporal punishment and demeaning chastisement are
counterproductive and inconsistent with Christian principles. The
child may obey, but obedience generated by fear is temporary and
produces negative results. Exhibiting an increase in love after
discipline helps the child to understand its purpose and engenders
a respectful parent-child relationship. Finally, love, respect and
discipline must be accompanied by examples. Years of teaching can
be wasted if parents expect children to ``do as I say, not as I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Applying principles of righteous parenting brings tremendous joy
and the fulfillment of a divine charge to love and nurture God's
children.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``Parenting is one of the most challenging and most enriching
parts of my own spiritual journey. Just yesterday, one of my
daughters asked, ``Is there a day you wish you could live over,
because you did something to hurt someone else, and you want to fix
it?'' When I pay attention, my children have so much to teach me
about discipleship.
</P>
<P>
   At its root, the word discipline is not primarily about
chastisement. Rather, just like the word ``disciple,'' the root
meaning of discipline is ``to learn.'' In the Christian tradition,
parents are called to guide their children in learning to be
disciples of Jesus the Christ who calls us to love God and love
neighbor. Thus, discipline takes place in all our interactions with
our children, not just when they have done something ``wrong.''
It's that simple, and it's that difficult.
</P>
<P>
   This is a particularly hard goal to keep in mind when we are
feeling pushed to the limits and are tempted to resort to physical
chastisement. However, I believe this a temptation we should
resist. I often said to my children when they were little, ``You
may not hit me. I don't hit you. We don't hit in this family.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's parents grew up in a time when their central
question was, ``Will my life have meaning?'' For many of today's
children, the central question is, ``Will you be there for me?'' We
must be there for our children. It is our calling as parents to be
present. It is our responsibility to set firm and clear boundaries,
so that our children can eventually learn to discipline
themselves.'' &QL;

<P>
   ``Buddhism teaches the concept of oneness of life and its
environment. Human life and its environment are inseparable.
Therefore, the key to children's discipline is the children's
environment. Adults, including parents, teachers and community
leaders, play an essential role because they are the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism also teaches the concept of the Ten Worlds. Each World
describes a state of human life. Most of the time, we experience
the lower worlds (Six Paths) in our daily life: Hell, Hunger,
Animality, Anger, Humanity, Heaven. As long as we dwell among the
Six Paths we are largely controlled by the changing circumstances
of our environment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Worlds of Learning and Realization, we awaken through
study and observation to the impermanence of all things. The World
of Bodhisattva is a condition of compassion, devoting ourselves to
helping others, performing altruistic actions on their behalf. The
10th World, Buddhahood, is the supreme jewel in the depths of our
being, a condition of absolute and indestructible happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism explains that we elevate our life state to higher
levels so that we can create indestructible happiness. In other
words, through changing our inner world at a fundamental level, we
change the outer world by becoming a better human being who serves
others and our society. We call this transformation of character
Human Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Adults whocontinuously strive to do their own Human Revolution,
regardless of socioeconomic status, naturally create an optimal
environment for children. To create the best environment for our
children, adults must work hard to grow.
</P>
<P>
   As Daisaku Ikeda, president of our Buddhist group, Soka Gakkai
International, writes: ``The first ones who should reflect on their
lives are adults. Otherwise, they are not qualified to scold
anybody.'' Through elevating our life state, we become people of
courage, compassion and wisdom, and from this elevated state of
life, we can conduct dialogue with children that both teaches and
disciplines them.'' &QL;

   ``Discipline occupies a central role in Jewish child rearing. &UR; It
is considered a ``mitzvah'' (a commandment from God, not a parent's
prerogative) to discipline our children.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly from a biblical point of view, there are texts about
discipline which might make us uneasy. The most classic of these
texts discusses what parents must do in the case of the
``rebellious son.'' According to the text, the child who is
stubborn and insubordinate to his parents should be stoned to death
by the community at large!

   Furthermore, there are many biblical verses which seemingly
encourage using the rod with children: ``Withhold not from a lad
correction, for if thou beat him with the rod he will not die. You
will indeed beat him with the rod, but (in doing so) you will
deliver his soul from perdition.`` (Proverbs 23:13).
</P>
<P>
   Does Judaism advocate physical discipline? It would appear
likely from these texts that we do _ yet this is not the case.
Although there were some cases in which ``using the rod'' might
have been taken literally, it seems that the use of the rod is
truly meant to be figurative. The rabbinic sages clearly limited
the use of physical discipline by restricting parents in the
following manner: ``. . . if you hit a child, strike him only with
a shoestring.'' (Talmud, Bava Batra 21a). Moreover, Jewish law
insists that discipline must be accompanied by expressions of
warmth and love, as is shown by the following passage: ``A child,
discipline him with the left hand and draw him closer with the
right hand.``
</P>
<P>
   Another fundamental principle is that the punishment must fit
the crime, and it must be ``immediate,'' preventing a child from
fearing the punishment over a long period of time, and thereby
maintaining a child's sense of dignity and self-respect. Therefore,
Judaism advocates parental discipline in order to guide our
children to adulthood, while severely limiting the role of physical
discipline.'' &QL;

KURT VONNEGUT HOSPITALIZED AFTER HOUSE FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A fire at Kurt Vonnegut's Manhattan home sent the
77-year-old author to the hospital suffering from smoke inhalation
on Sunday night, and slightly damaged his four-story townhouse on
East 48th Street, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the blaze was under investigation, but fire
marshals believe that careless smoking by Vonnegut may have played
a role, said a fire official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have been smoking in the room, left it, and then the
blaze started,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Weill Cornell Center of New York-Presbyterian
Hospital, where Mr. Vonnegut was admitted, would not comment on his
condition, but his 17-year-old daughter, Lily, said he was
``okay,'' though he will probably remain hospitalized for a few
days. No one else was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, in a study on the top floor, was spotted around 7 p.m.
by a man who lives across the street from Vonnegut's white-brick
house, Lily Vonnegut said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A neighbor saw smoke and ran over,'' she said. ``The two of us
basically saved my dad. He couldn't see. There was black smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire department was able to put the one-alarm blaze out
within 20 minutes, and Ms. Vonnegut said damage to the study was
minimal. Vonnegut, the nation's unofficial curmudgeon laureate and
the author of ``Slaughterhouse-Five'' and other modern classics,
has lived in the house for more than 20 years, the fire official
said.

HOW ARE PARENTS EXPECTED TO DISCIPLINED THEIR KIDS?

<P>
   PHOENIX _ ``Webster's Third New International Dictionary''
defines discipline as ``training or experience that corrects,
molds, strengthens or perfects, especially the mental faculties or
moral character.'' And it's through such training that kids become
responsible members of their families and communities, says Paul
Miller, an associate professor of psychology who teaches about
child development and socialization at Arizona State University
West.
</P>
<P>
   In this process, parents ``are not incidental players _ they are
IT, period,'' Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   The parent-child relationship ``acts in a way to temper behavior
that's out of bounds and to reward behavior that's in bounds,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That relationship is both a comfort and a safety zone,''
Miller adds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's major religions address the role parents and
other adults are to play in raising future generations. The
biblical book of Proverbs, for example, urges youth to adopt moral
values that will inform their daily lives, as well as their
spiritual formation. In fact, the two are seen as inseparable.

HIGHLIGHTS, LOWLIGHTS OF SUPER BOWL TELECAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching Super Bowl XXXIV was a fine way to spend a Sunday
afternoon, especially the second half, when the Titans fought their
way back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   But here's hoping you ended your viewing day by 7 p.m., and
missed the visual everyone in Southern California dreaded Rams
owner Georgia Frontiere holding the Lombardi Trophy and saying
``This proves we made the right decision going to St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Georgia, that, the free stadium and all that PSL money.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of heartburn will last awhile, but at least ABC spared
us a longer Georgia monologue. The camera kept its sideline shots
of her to a few, and L.A. resident Al Michaels needled Madame Ram
several times about her changing the pronunciation of her last
name.
</P>
<P>
   As Super Bowl telecasts go, ABC's effort scored high in several
areas and low in a few others.
</P>
<P>
   The production was crisp and intimate in the style of ABC Monday
Night telecasts, and nary a pivotal replay was missed. Credit
director Craig Janoff for his decision to stick to the basics and
not over reach for a new tech toy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some past Super Bowl telecasts that were choppy due to
too many commercial breaks, ABC's show had a decent pace. Most
breaks lasted less than two minutes, and there were only two times
all game in which the game dragged because of TV timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   There was an 18-minute span in the first half in which less than
eight minutes was football action, and an 11-minute break in the
second half around the injury to Tennessee's Blaine Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   But on the down side, a lot of those breaks feature ABC promos
for their prime time shows. In the first half, there were five
promos for ABC series and three more for ABC made-for-TV movie
about the Beach Boys. The second half presented more of the same.
Millionaire quizmaster Regis Philbin was in so many of the promos
that I expected him to show up in the Rams huddle.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasting booth delivered a split decision. Al Michaels
performed flawlessly as usual. The first half of the game was
choppy, but he didn't try to paint a pretty picture. He let the
Rams errors in the red zone tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   When action picked up in the second half, Michaels kept pace and
advanced the story. When Boomer Esiason criticized a late decision
by Tennessee's Steve McNair to not call time out, Michaels said the
Titans would likely need that time out later, and they did after
the next play, a completion inside the Rams 10.
</P>
<P>
   And when the game ended with the Titans Kevin Dyson a yard away
from the end zone, Michaels summed things up powerfully: ``There's
a (football) movie called The Longest Yard, and there's your
sequel.''
</P>
<P>
   Esiason, in his second year at ABC, had a formful day. He got
off to a slow start and made many of the mistakes he's made all
year, like talking over a play and embracing the quick cliche.
</P>
<P>
   He also spends most of his energy telling us what happened
moments after we've seen it. The best analysts in the business give
the audience an idea what might happen and what the coaches are
thinking. Boomer doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   One first quarter sequence underscored Michaels' experience and
Esiason's lack of same. Boomer spent a lot of words trying to
explain the Titans' personnel problems. The camera then panned to
Rams coach Dick Vermeil and all of the ex-coaches on his staff, and
Michaels tells viewers that Vermeil said ``I love to collect
professors.'' Succinct and informative.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the Rams' fairy tale season, Michaels said ``This
story is too good for a movie.'' At show's end, Michaels told the
story of how noted astrologer Georgia told John Shaw that Kurt
Warner might be the next Johnny Unitas. Said Michaels: ``How else
can you explain that the Super Bowl champs are the St. Louis
Rams?''
</P>
<P>
   The revelation in the pregame show was how sharp Steve Young was
with a microphone. He co-hosted with Chris Berman and the four-hour
show actually had a nice paced and balance. Kudos to Berman, too,
for noting in the postgame that the 1951 Rams won a NFL title with
a 73-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial-wise, this was known as the e-Bowl, what with almost
a third of all companies buying spots selling their Internet site
or technology. They generally fell into two categories confusing or
boring and they all could use a little dot.comedy. The best example
was the website whose pitch was text saying ``We don't know diddly
about making commercials.'' No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   The best and worst of the lot:
</P>
<P>
   Five worst:
</P>
<P>
   5. The cat herders for a website.
</P>
<P>
   4. The black-and-white commercial for a website showing a
confused woman surrounded by people delivering cryptic comments.
</P>
<P>
   3. The website ad with doctors saying a guy is bleeding money
out his wazoo.
</P>
<P>
   2. The site that was essentially selling spam, saying it would
give you money if you attach an ad to your email and the recipient
buys something.
</P>
<P>
   1. The 7-Up ``show us your cans'' commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Five best:
</P>
<P>
   5. Tie, the Schwab ad showing Charles Barkley, Barry Sanders and
Tara Lipinski in a retirement home, and the Busch designated driver
ad, with Wayne Gretzky driving a guy home in a Zamboni.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Muhammad Ali ad, where he shadow boxes to a camera for
WebMD.com.
</P>
<P>
   3. The acting dog who finds his howling motivation by recalling
the day he chased a Budweiser truck and smashed into a van.
</P>
<P>
   2. The E-Trade ad with a monkey dancing to a boom box, followed
by this line of test: ``Well, we just wasted $2 million.''
</P>
<P>
   1. The Mountain Dew ad, where the biker catches a racing
Cheetah, pulls a can of Dew out of his mouth, and says ``bad
kitty.'' The other Dew commercial set to Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody
was pretty cool, too.
</P>
<P>
   The ad by Britannica.com also got our attention with this
mocking question: ``How do Houston and Los Angeles feel now?''

EX-OILER FANS FIND IT HARD NOT TO PULL FOR FAMILIAR NAMES &HT;

<P>
   HOUSTON _ With a little remorse, a little envy, but a good deal
of sportsmanship, former Houston Oilers fans packed area sports
bars Sunday to cheer on the Tennessee Titans in their first Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   From Tina Turner's opening number to the Titans' heart-breaking
23-16 loss, they watched the familiar names and the unfamiliar
uniforms charge down the gridiron in football's final contest. It
took a change of climate and finally a change of name to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can hide the fact that their roots are
here,'' said Gorge Luna, a pharmaceutical sales representative
watching the game at Griff's bar in the Montrose area. ``It's an
incredible franchise, so I root for them. I'll root for them until
our new franchise gets here.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Oilers banners hung from the wall amid posters wishing the
Titans good luck and predicting they would ``ram'' St. Louis. Oiler
blue was the color of the day and a few even displayed the old
familiar oil derrick one last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really do need to get their own identity now that we're
getting our own team,'' said Tanya Eagle, a sales administrator who
was wearing her old Oilers jersey. ``I would really like to see
them (Houston's new team slated for the 2004 season.) named the
Oilers, but I know it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The much maligned Titans owner, Bud Adams, was a favorite target
for criticism when thoughts turned to what might have been. A sign
on the wall said, ``Good luck Tennessee. Good riddance Bud.'' But
even he found some sympathy in the day's high spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Oilers should have stayed here,'' Griff's co-owner
Robert Martinez said. ``I think (former) Mayor (Bob) Lanier was a
little hasty at shutting Bud out. Granted, Bud nickeled and dimed
us to death. I don't like it, but I don't blame him, and I wish the
Titans the best of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams took the Oilers to Tennessee after disagreeing with local
officials over the need for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Ernie's on Banks sports bar, benefits manager Scott
Strother, celebrating his 33rd birthday, said he still felt a
connection with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game I wasn't certain if I was a Titans fan,'' he
said. ``but when it kicked off I was rooting hard for them. I guess
there's still a place in my heart for Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie's owner, Kim Elston, said the game wasn't about the
politics or Bud Adams or the demise of the Oilers name. He said
Super Bowl XXXIV was about the franchise veterans such as safety
Blaine Bishop and offensive guard Bruce Matthews, who wore the
Oilers uniform through many disappointing years and only
reluctantly changed it for a darker shade of blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, to me it's all about Bishop and Matthews,'' Elston
said. ``I would say (kicker Al) Del Greco, too, but he gagged that
field goal. They were the three captains out for the coin toss.
That's probably part of the symbolism. They didn't want to leave
Houston and that's the only reason I'm rooting for the Titans.
Those guys deserve it.''

<P>
   RUSSIA-HOLOCAUST (Yantarniy, Russia) _ The slaughter of 7,000
Jews, mostly young women, in Kaliningrad four days after the
liberation of Auschwitz in 1945 may have been the last, and one of
the most forgotten, episodes of the Nazi campaign of genocide. That
is, until Sunday. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA-MAVERICK (Mount Gerlitzen, Austria) _ To many Austrians,
Joerg Haider is that southern governor with the odd blend of
liberal spending plans and anti-immigrant sentiments they might
quietly agree with but that they know look bad to the European
Union. To his local fans, he is their maverick man shaking up the
fat cats in Vienna who for decades handed out jobs based on
political connections rather than brains or talent. To foreigners,
he is that xenophobic Austrian who once said several pro-Nazi
things. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   DAVOS-CLINTON (Davos, Switzerland) _ After seven years of
pushing harder than any post-War president to expand trade between
the United States and the rest of the world, President Clinton told
global leaders here this weekend that the American people have had
enough. Congress and society at large have less enthusiasm for
exchanging goods and services with the world than they did when he
first took office, Clinton said. If new trade deals are going to
get done, he said, the world needs to reinvent the way it thinks
about trade and globalization to accommodate this American
political reality. By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-HACKERS (Tokyo) _ In what has become almost a daily
ritual, Internet hackers posted messages on the web site of Japan's
postal service criticizing this country's wartime role in China in
the 1930s. At least 11 government agencies here have been attacked
by the Internet hackers. In each incident, the hackers have
denounced Japan's involvement in the murderous 1937 sacking of
Nanjing by Imperial Japanese troops. The security breeches have
deeply embarrassed the Japanese government, which has rushed to
create a special task force to catch the intruders. By Howard W.
French.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-CONGO (Undated) _ When an unusual meeting of African
leaders and the Security Council ended last week, there was general
agreement that the United Nations will have to be given a major
role in bringing peace to Congo. But when, and in what form, are
still open questions that are expected to dominate council
discussions in coming days. By Barbara Crossette.

   SCHOOL-VOUCHER-DEBATE (Albuquerque, N.M.) _ The school voucher
debate is playing out all across the country with increasing
intensity these days as more than 25 legislatures are considering
bills that would create some type of system in which public dollars
would be used for private and parochial schools By Michael
Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ALTERNATIVE-MEDICINE (Baltimore) _ A $2.5 million federally
financed study at the University of Maryland represents a new wave
in academic medicine: the application of rigorous, Western
scientific methods to test alternative therapies, from ginkgo
biloba to shark cartilage to a mystical Chinese healing art known
as qi gong. Just five years ago, many academics would not have gone
near such studies, for fear they would become a laughingstock. And
while alternative therapies remain hugely controversial,
multimillion dollar clinical trials are getting under way this year
at some of the nation's most prestigious university hospitals. By
Sheryl Gay Stolberg.

   NH-INDEPENDENTS (Manchester, N.H.) _ Only two days before the
primary in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Bill Bradley and John McCain
are locked in an improbable struggle over a tiny pool of truly
independent voters who are allowed to cast ballots in the
Democratic or Republican contest and _ it turns out _ are torn
between the two men. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-DYNASTY (Washington) _ They were on the same platform on
Saturday, George Bush and George W. Bush, father and son, former
president and would-be president, plus the family matriarch,
Barbara Bush, and three of George W.'s four siblings, seeking votes
in the New Hampshire primary. But you will incur the Bushes' wrath
if you compare their family to that other well-known American
political clan, the Kennedys. By R.W. Apple Jr.

blur the lines between advertising and journalism that are routine
in older media companies like Time-Warner. By Saul Hansell.

RAMS HANG ON TO BEAT TITANS IN SUPER FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 BOWL-LEDE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After 27 weeks, through 259 games, the NFL season
ended Sunday at the 1-yard line at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams, not the Tennessee Titans, are Super Bowl
XXXIV champions this morning because, with no timeouts remaining
and time for only one snap for the Titans, the Rams made the last
stop to win, 23-16.
</P>
<P>
   Rams quarterback Kurt Warner was named this game's MVP, getting
13 of a possible 15 first-place votes. But it was Rams outside
linebacker Mike Jones who executed the perfect open-field tackle on
Tennessee receiver Kevin Dyson at the end of a 9-yard pass play
down to the St. Louis 1 as time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Both on the surprising underdog Titans ... and on a NFL season
filled with surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson, whose miracle return for a touchdown on a trick play in
the final seconds beat Buffalo in the first round of these
playoffs, wound up on his belly on the Georgia Dome turf.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson squirmed, fought and wrenched his 6-foot-1, 195-pound body
in a desperate attempt to break the plane of the goal line with the
tip of the ball held in his outstretched hands.
</P>
<P>
   But Dyson was down.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans were out.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rams had their first Super Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rams, it was a feat this franchise was unable to
complete in Los Angeles, before Georgia Frontiere moved the team to
St. Louis in 1995. For the Titans, formerly the Houston-Tennessee
Oilers, this was their first Super Bowl appearance, and came down
to 1 longest yard, separating defeat from forcing overtime for
Titans' 77-year-old owner, Bud Adams.
</P>
<P>
   This was definitely a game with a punch line.
</P>
<P>
   After spotting the Rams a 16-0 lead, the Titans held on defense
_ except for one 73-yard pass play from Warner to Isaac Bruce _ and
reeled off 16 unanswered points to make a game of it.
</P>
<P>
   The only defensive lapse by the Titans came on the first play of
the Rams' final possession. Warner threw downfield for Bruce.
Titans cornerback Denard Walker slipped and fell. And the home-run
play resulted in a 73-yard touchdown that gave the Rams a 23-16
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to make a play on the ball,'' said Bruce, who
caught six passes for 162 yards, the third-most-prolific receiving
game in Super Bowl history. ``I was dog-tired. Kurt threw it up. I
knew I had to make an adjustment on the ball ... and God did the
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee played about 90 percent man-to-man coverages, and
played the final quarter without either of its starting safeties.
Free safety Marcus Robertson missed the game with a broken ankle
and strong safety Blaine Bishop with a knee sprain, in which he was
taken off the field strapped to stretcher for precautionary
measures.
</P>
<P>
   The play in the Rams' playbook is called ``Nine Ninety-nine,''
and Bruce knew he was going to draw one-on-one coverage. And he
sensed the Titans had to be as tired as he was, or moreso.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been moving the ball up and down the field all day, and
there was no reason that we couldn't do it for (the final) two
minutes and put us at least in field-goal range and win this
thing,'' said Warner, who completed 24 of 45 passes for a Super
Bowl-record 414 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, a former Arena League and NFL Europe quarterback who was
working as a stock boy five years ago, threw 41 touchdown passes
this season. He threw two touchdown passes Sunday, including the
73-yard game winner to Bruce on the first play of the Rams' final
drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had one last shot. Quarterback Steve McNair, who
scrambled for a Super Bowl-record 64 yards, ad-libbed for 12 yards
and drew a 15-year face-mask penalty (Dre' Bly) to get Tennessee
into Rams territory. Later on that drive, on third-and-five, McNair
escaped a two-man tackle by defensive ends Kevin Carter and Jay
Williams to hit Dyson for 16 yards to the St. Louis 10.
</P>
<P>
   McNair ``has the heart the size of a basketball,'' Carter said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee burned its final time out.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, the game ended with McNair hitting Dyson
inside the St. Louis 5. Dyson made it to inside the St. Louis 1.
And what would have been the first overtime Super Bowl was averted.
</P>
<P>
   Nerves were on edge when this Super Bowl of ``teams that didn't
belong when this season began'' unfolded. Both teams blew
field-goal opportunities early _ St. Louis twice, Tennessee once.
</P>
<P>
   Rams kicker Jeff Wilkins never had a chance to kick a 34-yard
field goal when holder Mike Horan fumbled the snap on the opening
drive of the game. Then Titans kicker Al Del Greco was wide left
from 47 yards, then, later in the second quarter, Wilkins was wide
right from 34 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams did manage three field-goal drives of 54, 73 and 67
yards in the first half. But in a 9-0 game, the underdog Titans
were allowed to hang around.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis ranked second among NFL teams in red-zone offense this
season, scoring 84.7 percent of the time (50 of 59) inside the
opponent's 20, and scoring a touchdown 64.4 percent of the time (38
of 59).
</P>
<P>
   In the first half alone, Warner threw a Super Bowl record 35
times (surpassing Drew Bledsoe's 29 attempts for New England in the
first half of Not even one by accident.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Rams had three field-goal drives on five first-half
trips into the red zone. Warner was 0-for-11 in red-zone passing,
19-for-24 everywhere else on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans came out for the second half thinking they could win.
But the momentum slipped away when a 47-yard field-goal attempt by
Al Del Greco was blocked. Rams cornerback Todd Lyght brought
through from the defensive left side to smother the ball on Del
Greco's foot.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Warner hit Torry Holt, whose 109 yards (on
seven catches) were a Super Bowl record for a rookie, for a 9-yard
touchdown play on a quick post, and the Rams took a 16-0 lead on
the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   This was Tennessee's wakeup call.
</P>
<P>
   And it led to the most dramatic ending to a game in Super Bowl
history, all XXXIV of them. nn

THE MOST, THE BEST, THE GREATEST... THIS WAS REALLY SUPER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a Super Bowl that had all the makings of a big
nothing. A couple of longtime nothing teams in a nothing game
providing nothing in the way of a national showcase for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The honest football fan, and certainly skeptical media types,
will admit to having been totally underwhelmed by what Rams-Titans
figured to offer.
</P>
<P>
   But this morning, of course, apologies are in order. And so are
the thank yous. Going back three decades-plus, entertainment,
adventure and thrills have been hard to come by in Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Rams and Titans gave us all that, in addition to the
greatest comeback in Super Bowl history and the greatest finish in
Super Bowl history. Except in No. XXXIV, this finish lasted for the
final quarter and a half, with nonstop, bang-bang action that was
breathtaking, and good to the very last drop.
</P>
<P>
   Or the very last second. Or the very last yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed America what the Super Bowl is all about,'' said St.
Louis Rams coach Dick Vermeil. America certainly agrees.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' 23-16 victory was secured only after unheralded,
veteran linebacker Mike Jones made the most-clutch tackle in Super
Bowl history. (Have you noticed all this
``most...greatest...most...greatest'' stuff?) But that was the name
of this Super Bowl. After a drowsy start, it was the ``most'' and
the ``greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' tackle came at the 1-yard line. As time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Titans receiver Kevin Dyson squirmed in Jones' grasp, fighting
to break loose. But Jones got the takedown, leaving the
second-guessers for quarterback Stece McNair. With no time outs and
six seconds remaining at the snap, why did Steve McNair dare throw
anywhere except the end zone?
</P>
<P>
   But that second-guess is also cheap. First of all, the
McNair-led rally by the Titans from a 16-0 deficit midway through
the third quarter will forever be part of Super Bowl lore. As will
the performance of his Rams counterpart, Kurt Warner, who broke the
Super Bowl passing-yardage record and collected game MVP honors to
go along with season MVP honors.
</P>
<P>
   But linebacker Jones answered best why McNair threw underneath
to Dyson, meaning short of the end zone. ``It was man-to-man
coverage,'' said Jones. A linebacker singled up on a wide receiver
_ and Dyson had some separation on Jones _ is a high-percentage
gamble for a quarterback, even with not a second to spare.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job was to wrap him up and get him down,'' said Jones. He
did. Game over. ``Great'' game over. Behind McNair, the Titans had
moved 87 yards in the final 108 seconds, having only one time out.
But 87 yards wasn't the 88 they needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' story, like the Warner story, went the full 180
degrees with this Super Bowl survival Sunday night. From worst team
of the '90s, to world champs. From grocery store stocker/Arena
League nobody, to the best quarterback in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   But the Titans had fairy tales of their own to tell about the
season, and about the playoffs, and about making the Super Bowl
after almost 40 years of franchise frustration.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, only one story of record in the first 2 1/2
quarters. It was all about how the Rams had built a 16-0 lead, and
how it could have been double that, and they were apparently on the
way to a blowout kind of win.
</P>
<P>
   But as St. Louis repeatedly malfunctioned in the red zone (five
consecutive trips inside the 20-yard line in the first half
produced nine points), it was obvious the Rams flirted with
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The red-zone problem was no running game from Marshall Faulk.
Warner had thrown 35 times in the first half, hanging up huge
yardage, yet was TD-less. The Rams needed the Faulk alternative,
but it never came, almost proving fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, however, the Rams were breathing easy as receiver
Torry Holt juggled, then grabbed a short Warner TD pass on the
Rams' first possession of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Warner had been 0-for-12 in the red zone until then. But with
the score 16-0, the hully-gully Titans offense appeared to have
zero chance of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, however, started to scramble, and a seasonlong trend
continued. When McNair goes to his feet, the Titans are energized.
Plus, Tennessee had ignored running back Eddie George in the first
half. Wisely, there was no panic, even down by 16 points. George
suddenly got the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was on. The momentum changed quickly. No Super Bowl
team had ever rallied from more than 10 points down, much less done
it in the second half. McNair, however, was a buzz saw. With ease,
he and the Titans erased the 16-0 lead and tied the game with 2:16
to play.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there was a wasted timeout during Tennessee's second
TD drive that would prove costly. So did a failed two-point
conversion after the first TD when McNair flat missed a wide-open
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   But the knife to the Titans came from Rams' big-play man Isaac
Bruce on the first play after it was 16-16. Offensive coordinator
Mike Martz went to the bomb quickly. Warner actually threw short to
a well-covered Bruce, but the receiver slowed, stopped, and caught
the pass. At that point, cornerback Denard Walker fell down. Isaac
Bruce was gone for the game winner. Seventy-three yards of Super
Bowl glory and history.
</P>
<P>
   Except the one minute and 54 seconds remaining was almost too
much to allow McNair and the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   The big nothing had turned out to be the big show. And the best
of all Super Bowls. nn

RAMS WIN REFLECTS FINANCIAL CLIMATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Well, crime _ err, greed _ does pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, those carpetbaggers from Los Angeles who descended on
St. Louis four years ago when they were able to fleece the city for
a $300 million public-subsidized stadium, are now undisputed
champions of the football universe in a development that is an apt
reflection of the mercurial financial climate of modern-day
America.
</P>
<P>
   In beating the gallant Tennessee Titans 23-16 on Kurt Warner's
73-yard scoring pass to Isaac Bruce with 1:54 remaining before
72,625 at the Georgia Dome, the Rams not only won the first Super
Bowl in their history, but also assured their lovable caretaker,
Georgia Frontiere, a place in the sporting pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   Frontiere now holds the distinction of being the first female
NFL owner to accept the Vince Lombardi Trophy, which she did here
Sunday evening from NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue to the loud
applause of the good citizens of St. Louis, where this hometown gal
has become an overnight icon because of the thrilling heroics of
her team.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, did she take this opportunity to crow, and, oh, did she
mock L.A in another classic display of her charming nature and
sterling grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proves we did the right thing in going to St. Louis,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time nightclub singer isn't exactly these days a revered
figure in Los Angeles, where she scandalously mismanaged the Rams
franchise for so many years and became such a despised figure that
she was forced into having her financial guru, John Shaw, go
through the ungodly spectacle of hustling her team around the
country to the highest bidder among NFL-starved cities.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis turned out to be the biggest civic spendthrift, and
it's ironic that this fine hamlet next to the Mississippi River is
in a position to celebrate today only because of Frontiere's
shameless corporate bungling in Los Angeles and because the
Missouri politicians weren't shy about sticking their constituents
with taxes that would cover the Rams expenses.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Rams had been an imperative part of the Southern
California landscape for 49 seasons, and their fans went through
all their countless heartaches and their occasional joys that
never, alas, included a Super Bowl triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, those old Rams loyalists in L.A. would have had a passionate
fondness for this Rams team that exorcised so many past playoff
demons because it happens to have a masterful quarterback, Kurt
Warner, a modern-day John Unitas, who has developed a knack for
throwing game-winning touchdown passes in late January games.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Deacon Jones, deprived in his career of even making
it to the Super Bowl with punishing road losses on the tundra
against the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings, has to be
smiling today.
</P>
<P>
   So does Jack Youngblood, the great defensive end who played with
a stress fracture in his leg in the Rams' loss to the Pittsburgh
Steelers in the 1980 Super Bowl and was deprived of making a couple
of other Super Bowl appearances because of bitter losses to the
Vikings and the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm sure Dennis Harrah and Tom Mack and Fred Dryer and Roman
Gabriel and Marlin McKeever, all who suffered so many frustrating
moments with the Rams, have to feel a sense of happiness about the
vast accomplishment of their former team that stylistically looks
the same on the field with the players still adorn in the trademark
Ram horn helmet and royal blue, gold and white uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Rams, as Georgia Frontiere coyly pointed out
during her postgame blatherings, is now a St. Louis proposition.
</P>
<P>
   And Warner, who as recently as five years ago at this time was
bagging groceries in Iowa to supplement his income, has surpassed
Mark McGwire as the leading St. Louis cult figure.
</P>
<P>
   There is something talismanic about Warner, because such good
fortune never visited the Rams in the past when the fates always
seemed to conspire against them concluding a season successfully.
</P>
<P>
   He earned the MVP trophy for his 24-for-45, 414-yard,
two-touchdown performance against the Titans, but it was that
73-yard scoring pass to Bruce that that will be replayed well into
the new millennium and that ultimately settled the tense issue.
</P>
<P>
   And what made the completion even more impressive was that
Warner was heaved to the turf a moment after he threw the pass, a
condition he suffered often against the fierce Tennessee rush.
Nothing intimidates this remarkable rags-to-riches fellow who has
emerged as one of best quarterbacks in the league, which is a
shining testament to the judgment skills of NFL scouts who never
thought he could play in the league.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, Warner saved the Rams from almost certain doom
against Tampa Bay with that 30-yard, game-winning scoring pass to
Ricky Proehl.
</P>
<P>
   And, until he and Bruce hooked up with their magic act that
resulted in people dancing on the streets in St. Louis and people
in Los Angeles reacting in a bittersweet manner, it seemed as
though the Titans might pull off still another implausible victory.
</P>
<P>
   But these Rams aren't like their failed predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, so noble, so courageous, so resilient right down to
the final play of the game when Kevin Dyson was stopped at the Rams
1-yard line by linebacker Mike Jones after catching Steve McNair's
pass, would quickly find that out much to their distress.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans staged the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history,
but that made no difference.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Vermeil was too old and as destined to be fired this
season, but that made no difference.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Frontiere was bitterly booted out of L.A., and was
advised to start her own laughing academy, but that made no
difference.
</P>
<P>
   She's on top of the world today.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a parable that says a lot about the world in which we
now reside.

MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS OF COVERAGE HAD ITS MOMENTS BUT NOT ENOUGH

 BOWL-TV-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stupor start, Super finish and 81/2 hours of couch potato utopia
between.
</P>
<P>
   With neither the Rams nor Titans possessing any history,
villains or captivating story lines going into Super Bowl XXXIV,
there was little interest going in. Despite the Rams' 23-16 poorly
played escape ending up closer than a Roy Firestone interview,
there is even less coming out.
</P>
<P>
   If not for Toni Braxton's ridiculously bad lip-synching, David
Blaine's mesmerizing magic or creative commercials featuring God
splattering Tabasco, cowboys herding cats and ``Whazzuupp?!''
exchanges, the 130 million of us American viewers would've flipped
over prematurely to TBS's ``Matlock'' marathon instead of enduring
ABC's four-hour pregame and an elaborately silly halftime show
weaved around an absolutely mundane football game almost bailed out
by a climactic conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rams fill the Georgia Dome's postgame podium with
Jesus and tears before getting fitted for their tainted crowns as
the best team of the NFL's worst season, a look back at 34 reasons
Super Bowl XXXIV felt more like a random game and less like a
monumental event:
</P>
<P>
   1. The Titans came within one yard of pulling off the greatest
comeback in Super Bowl history. Inexplicably, ABC analyst Boomer
Esiason capped his awful performance by calling Tennessee's
game-losing pass a ``terrific play call.'' Seems like a better idea
would've been to throw it into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   2. ABC obviously needed another week to prepare. It twice came
back early from commercials (once catching Al Michaels singing),
three times missed penalty flags and once missed an entire play.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``The View's'' Meredith Vieira actually said the Super Bowl
``is all about the butts'' and the Question of the Day was ``Would
women watch the game if players wore looser pants?'' Imagine the
National Organization of Women's reaction if NBC's Jim Gray
previewed a WNBA playoff game by saying, ``It's all about the
cleavage.''
</P>
<P>
   4. The bad news: ABC's pregame show lasted four hours. The good
news: Fox's show last year lasted seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   5. Sideline reporter Leslie Visser, who sported a mushroom
hairstyle and a suit right out of Sigfried &AMP; Roy's Vegas closet,
actually quoted Mike Tyson coming out of halftime.
</P>
<P>
   6. Don't be ashamed if you were caught in a dot.com daze all
day. The pregame show was sponsored by, in order, OurBeginning.com,
Britannica.com, Hewlitt Packard, WebMD.com, MicroStrategy.com and
Motorola. That, of course, was followed by the Charles Schwab
kickoff show, the E-Trade halftime show and capped off by the
Lincoln Post-Game show.
</P>
<P>
   7. Rams owner Georgia Frontiere: 7 husbands, 1 championship.
</P>
<P>
   8. Lie of the day belonged to Hershey executive Mike Pasquale,
who told a kicker attempting to win $1 million, ``We were rooting
for you.'' Instead, the kicker missed and Pasquale handed him a
check for only $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   9. During chef Emeril Lagasse's pregame cooking feature, fans
actually cheered garlic.
</P>
<P>
   10. Second-most competitive score of the day: Shots of Brenda
Warner and her feathered sweater 10, Mechelle McNair 7.
</P>
<P>
   11. He wasn't alone, but ABC stand-in analyst Steve Young looked
silly by predicting early in the day that ``the Rams will hang 40
points on this Titans defense.''
</P>
<P>
   12. Can the day be far off when the Microsoft.com Seahawks host
the Visa Cowboys?
</P>
<P>
   13. Who really wants to be a millionaire? Just prove you
predicted Kurt Warner to be Super Bowl MVP back in July.
</P>
<P>
   14. How long will it be before the NAACP calls to pull
Budweiser's ``Whazzuupp?!'' ads because they degrade the
communication skills of African-Americans? Hopefully, they'll wait
until we get a few more chuckles out of them.
</P>
<P>
   15. Of all the talent at ABC's disposal, it had ``Good Morning
America's'' Charles Gibson conduct its one-on-one with Titans coach
Jeff Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   16. Vince Lombardi likely rolled in his grave despite the
late-game suspense. With the game on the line, the Rams repeatedly
lined up offsides, Titans running back Eddie George blocked a
cornerback while a pass hit him in the elbow and Tennessee
inexplicably called a game-deciding play that didn't go into the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   17. You think the dot.com business is confusing; former
Wimbledon champ Boris Becker was introduced as ``NFL Ambassador to
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   18. Were we groggy, or does Rams offensive coordinator Mike
Martz bear a resemblance to new Cowboys coach Dave Campo?
</P>
<P>
   19. Explain to us again the theory of wearing eye black in a
dome. Under that premise, shouldn't all NBA players get painted?
</P>
<P>
   20. There was finally a Barry Sanders sighting Sunday, albeit a
cameo in a Charles Schwab commercial.
</P>
<P>
   21. Despite ABC's countless talking heads, it was Gus the Volvo
truck driver who provided the best insight: ``Your haircut
shouldn't cost more than your hat.'' Amen.
</P>
<P>
   22. The Titans made a good showing, but they did it in the
worst-looking uniforms to ever disgrace a Super Bowl. Can you say
``Roller Derby rejects?''
</P>
<P>
   23. If the game had any early electricity, it was unplugged when
Titans safety Blaine Bishop was knocked out of the game and carted
off midway through the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   24. With decent, hard-working players and coaches on both
sidelines, it was almost impossible to love or hate either team.
Unless, of course, you live in Nashville, Tenn., St. Louis or had a
vested financial interest in everything from the coin flip to the
final score.
</P>
<P>
   25. Play of the day? Magician Blaine tore up the 7 of Clubs and
put it in the hand of Titans tight end Jackie Harris. He then, just
seconds later, squeezed Harris' hand and told him to open his
fingers, revealing the 7 of Hearts, un-torn.
</P>
<P>
   26. We longed for more of a snappy pregame intro that featured
``Seinfeld's'' Kramer, Wynonna and Tiger Woods, and cringed each
time former Saints coach Mike Ditka shamelessly plugged the movie,
``Runaway Bride,'' on video.
</P>
<P>
   27. Commentator Jim ``Grandpa'' McKay was kind enough to let us
sit at his knee while he spun old-school yarns about how we should
have sympathy for NFL players because ``they take enormous physical
abuse.'' He left out the part about how they make more in a month
than most of us in a year, and how they don't have to go back to
work until July.
</P>
<P>
   28. Only thing more glaringly absent Sunday than Rams running
back Marshall Faulk? Nike.
</P>
<P>
   29. Halftime performer Phil Collins' pregame stint consisted of
coughing into his hand, using the same hand to shake with Chris
Berman, admitting he doesn't ``understand the NFL game'' and then
saying he would root for the Titans because ``they're from
Tennessee, and I used to be a Davey Crockett fan.''
</P>
<P>
   30. What was so Super about offenses driving down the field,
stalling at the 30 and settling for missed field goals? Cowboys
fans saw that all season.
</P>
<P>
   31. Rams holder Mike Horan became the oldest player to ever drop
a perfect snap from center in a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   32. Just didn't look right for a Super Bowl coach (Jeff Fisher)
to be wearing an Old Navy fleece vest on the sideline. Tom Landry
and his fedora never looked better.
</P>
<P>
   33. In case you _ like him _ missed it, that was Anthony Dorsett
missing a tackle on Isaac Bruce's game-winning touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   34. In retrospect, ABC should've just run three hours of the
greatest runs by No. 34, Walter Payton.
</P>
<P>
   40. Winks straight ahead. If you made it through the whole 8 1/2
hours, you more than earned it.
</P>
<P>
   165. Days until training camps open. nn

RAMS _ BY A YARD 
</HEADLINE>
 BOWL-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The pretty boys can be gritty boys, too. And that
makes them champions. Deservedly.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the flashdancing Rams had been bullied by the
brutish Titans as they surrendered a 16-point lead, St. Louis
killed Tennessee with its velvet touch. And then, to keep the
Titans interred, the Rams used the steel grip.
</P>
<P>
   Most Valuable Player Kurt Warner hit Isaac Bruce for a 73-yard
touchdown pass with 1:54 left, giving the Rams a 23-16 victory at
the Georgia Dome Sunday &UR;  &LR; night and deciding perhaps the most
exciting and raucous Super Bowl in the game's 34-year history. But
even that wasn't the climax.
</P>
<P>
   The AFC champion Titans, the Rasputins of the NFL, wouldn't
expire meekly. Passes from heroic quarterback Steve McNair to wide
receiver Kevin Dyson on the last two plays consumed 25 yards.
Unfortunately for the Titans, they needed 26, and thanks to
linebacker Mike Jones, they didn't get them. On first and goal from
the 10 with six seconds left, McNair hit Dyson crossing from the
right, but Jones wrapped him up like a sack of rubies, and the
lunging Dyson came up a yard shy as the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   The death knell seemingly had sounded after Warner, the Arena
Football League and NFL Europe refugee who was an Iowa grocery
clerk five years ago, went for the prime rib. The Rams had the ball
at their 27 for their first play from scrimmage after Eddie George
had left them reeling with his second touchdown run, this one a
2-yarder, and Al Del Greco had converted a 43-yard field goal to
tie it, 16-16, with 2:02 left. But an offense that suddenly had
vanished _ going three downs and out twice in a row after driving
inside the Tennessee 20 on its first six possessions _ wasn't going
to stay back on its heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Martz (the offensive coordinator) had actually wanted to
call that play the previous series when we went one, two, three,
and out,'' said Rams coach Dick Vermeil. ``Earlier in the game, we
had a man open deep but didn't see him. So Mike said this time,
`Let's go for it. If we don't make it, we'll get the first down on
the next two plays. But let's get the ball in the hands of Isaac
Bruce.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Warner found Bruce, one of an array of playmakers on the NFL's
most prolific offense _ or, more accurately, Bruce (6 catches, 162
yards) found the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Warner eluded pressure and unloaded a bomb down the right
sideline as he was decked. The pass was slightly underthrown, and
Bruce stepped back behind Titans defensive back Denard Walker to
snare it. He then skipped around Walker. Titans free safety Anthony
Dorsett _ playing because regular Marcus Robertson had broken his
leg last week _ overpursued, and Bruce romped into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been playing man-to-man coverage all day,'' said
Bruce. ``I came back to get the ball. I saw the safety overrun the
play; that's why I cut back. Then I just ran my ass off.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could cut the heart out of the Titans, not even the
final bit of handiwork by Warner, the league's regular-season MVP,
who completed 24 of 45 passes for a Super Bowl-record 414 yards and
two touchdowns but never saw the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hit in the head,'' said Warner. ``I didn't see (Bruce),
but I knew he caught the ball. I didn't see what he did with it
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did see _ helplessly and in horror _ what the Titans, in
particular McNair, did with their final counterpunch.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over at his 12 with 1:46 to go, McNair parlayed shotgun
scrambles, passes, and Rams penalties to set up a third and 5 from
the St. Louis 26 with 22 seconds left. On the next play, NFL sack
champion Kevin Carter and fellow defensive end Jay Williams
apparently had McNair buried at the right sideline. But he somehow
stepped up and, on the run, gunned a pass to Dyson at the 10.
</P>
<P>
   Time for one more play _ or overtime.
</P>
<P>
   McNair dropped back, and when Vermeil saw the ball in the air,
he immediately phoned Martz to tell him to get a package ready for
OT.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play we called was for Dyson,'' said McNair.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams had it scoped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was combination coverage,'' said Jones. ``Billy Jenkins
(the strong safety) makes the calls in those situations, and he
made a great one. Both their guys released inside.''
</P>
<P>
   And McNair did what he wanted, hitting Dyson, who could taste a
tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I caught it, I was thinking yellow pay dirt,'' said
Dyson. ``When we called the play, I didn't think anybody would be
in the middle of the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was. And he had Dyson dead in his sights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he thought he was going to get in unless I closed
him,'' said Jones. ``But I was planted, and once I was, I said, `No
way this guy gets into the end zone. I've got him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Until the last 22 minutes, it seemed the Rams _ who had parlayed
a tapioca schedule and a supercharged offense into NFC eminence _
had put away the Titans, who had overacheived their way through the
AFC gantlet.
</P>
<P>
   Warner threw the ball 35 times in the first half, shattering the
record of 29 set by the Patriots' Drew Bledsoe three years ago, as
St. Louis pummeled the Titans between the 20s in the first half.
But Tennessee's resilient defense turned the red zone into a black
hole for the Rams, who had to settle for Jeff Wilkins field goals
of 27, 29, and 28 yards. Their two other trips inside the 20
resulted in a botched hold by Mike Horan on Wilkins's initial field
goal bid and a miss from 34 yards by Wilkins, who will undergo
surgery next week for tendinitis in his planting leg. So the
halftime lead was 9-0, and as usual, the Titans were hanging
around, even if they looked dazed doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were frustrated,'' said Vermeil. ``We were the best
red-zone team in the NFL and we weren't getting it done.''
</P>
<P>
   They did on their first possession of the third quarter after
Del Greco, who had missed a 47-yard kick in the first half, had
another 47-yarder blocked by Todd Lyght.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams made their sixth straight trip to the red zone, and
this time Warner cashed in, finding Torry Holt (a rookie-record 7
catches for 109 yards) with a 9-yard scoring strike on which Holt
shed Walker.
</P>
<P>
   That made it 16-0, and given the Titans' offensive prowess to
that point, it might as well have been 160-0.
</P>
<P>
   But the protean McNair, who completed 22 of 36 passes for 214
yards and ran 8 times for 64 yards _ a Super Bowl record for a QB _
and the indomitable George (28 carries, 95 yards) started pounding
and gouging away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to move the ball and got into our game plan,''
said George. ``We were able to run the ball and throw the ball
downfield.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair's 23-yard scramble _ yet another Super Bowl rushing
record for a quarterback _ to the 2 set up George's 1-yard scoring
blast off left tackle near the end of the third quarter. And even
though McNair misfired on a 2-point conversion toss to Frank
Wycheck, the Titans still had a pulse, trailing, 16-6. Then Del
Greco and George capped the comeback. For a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our defense caught its breath at halftime,'' said
Titans coach Jeff Fisher. ``We were on the field the whole first
half. We made some adjustments. We made up our minds at halftime we
were going to win this game. I credit Kurt Warner on the big play
or it's a different ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Rams' reinvented, pathologically emotional coach,
Vermeil _ who left the game for 14 years not long after losing the
1981 Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles _ finally has
something to really get weepy over. And cosmetically challenged
owner Georgia Frontiere can apply her makeup in front of the
glittering Vince Lombardi Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   And the city of St. Louis, which lured the Rams from Los Angeles
five years ago to replace the Cardinals, has its first world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tough town.

WARNER'S STORY BOOK SEASON ENDS WITH ANOTHER MVP PERFORMANCE
</HEADLINE>
 BOWL-MVP-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At this point, the obligatory trip to Disney World as
the Super Bowl MVP will be anti-climactic for Rams quarterback Kurt
Warner, whose wishes upon a star have come true all season.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's storybook season, which began when this former Arena
League and NFL Europe refugee was thrown in the starting lineup
because of an injury to Trent Green in the preseason, ended in
storybook fashion in Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who was named the NFL MVP after throwing 41 touchdown
passes in the regular season, passed for a Super Bowl record 414
yards and threw two touchdown passes. His 73-yard game-winning toss
to Isaac Bruce with 1 minute, 54 seconds remaining gave the St.
Louis Rams a 23-16 victory against the Tennessee Titans at the
Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Rams coach Dick Vermeil said fairy tales don't apply when you're
talking about his second-year quarterback, whose incredible story
should serve as an example to everyone that anything is possible if
you believe in yourself and work hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt Warner is Kurt Warner,'' Vermeil said. ``He is not a
fairy tale. This is real life. He is an example of what we all like
to believe in on and off the field. He is an example of persistence
and believing in himself and a deep faith. He was willing to work
and play a subordinate role until he got his opportunity. What else
can you write? He is a book, he is a movie, the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner's on-field story is accompanied by wonderful off-field
story, which includes being deeply religious and a strong family
man. He met his wife, Brenda, while working as a grocery stocker.
She stuck by him when he couldn't get a job playing in NFL after he
finished college at Northern Iowa. Warner, 28, stuck with her,
marrying her and adopting her handicapped son from a previous
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   His heartwarming story spawned Warner-mania in St. Louis, and
movie executives are already talking about putting his life on
film.
</P>
<P>
   Just like he has all season, Warner remained grounded after the
game, downplaying his personal triumph, while relishing in the
Rams' first Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
   ``First things first, I got to give the praise and glory to my
Lord and Saviour,'' Warner said. ``Thank you, Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of my story as a Hollywood story,'' Warner
continued. ``It's my life. Everything that's happened is
tremendous. I always believed in myself, and I've got a whole bunch
of people in here that believed in me. I'm blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner was close to brilliant against Titans, completing 24 of
45 passes to nine different receivers. His 277 passing yards in the
first half were second in Super Bowl history to the 307 by Doug
Williams of the Redskins in Super Bowl XXII.
</P>
<P>
   Also, his 35 first-half passing attempts are a record for the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   However, while Warner dazzled the Titans statistically in the
first half, he couldn't get them in the end zone. Five consecutive
drives inside the Titans' 20-yard line resulted in only three field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Warner changed that in the third quarter when hit Torry Holt on
slant from 9 yards out to give St. Louis a 16-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Warner and the Rams' offense bogged down until the two minutes
when he found Bruce for the game winner.
</P>
<P>
   Titans defensive back Samari Rolle echoed Vermeil after the game
when he said Warner was just being Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the MVP of the league, and that's how he played,'' Rolle
said. ``He's been doing that all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Making magic Disney would be proud of. nn

FOR WARNER, REAL-LIFE TALL TALE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Five years ago he was asking, ``Paper or plastic?''
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night Kurt Warner bagged the Super Bowl MVP Award.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXXIV _ perhaps the best yet, and certainly the first
to live up to its hype _ brought one of the great sports stories of
our time to Main Street, USA, as Warner completed his journey from
grocery clerk in Cedar Falls, Iowa, to American folk hero in a
23-16 St. Louis Rams victory over the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Rams coach Dick Vermeil said, ``It's not a fairy tale. It's real
life. He's a great example of persistence and believing in yourself
and having willingness to work. What else can you write? He is a
book, he is a movie, this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank all the players and coaches and everybody for
believing in me,'' Warner said at midfield, holding the Super Bowl
trophy aloft while gold confetti fell around his head.
</P>
<P>
   The lasting memory of this game will be that of Tennessee
wideout Kevin Dyson reaching for a final yard he could not get as
time and space ran out on the noble Titans. But two minutes earlier
it was Warner who made the biggest play of his life for the winning
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had battled back from 16-0 to tie the game, 16-16,
with 2:16 left when Warner struck with a 73-yard touchdown pass
play to Isaac Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been moving the ball all day and there was no reason we
couldn't move the ball again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the first snap from scrimmage, with all the momentum gone to
Nashville, Warner dropped back and floated a long pass down the
right sideline to Bruce. Warner was flattened by Jevon Kearse as he
released the ball (``I couldn't see it,'' said the quarterback. ``I
got my head up enough to see him come back, but I couldn't tell'').
The long pass was slightly underthrown, but Bruce came back to it,
made the catch, and ran into history. ABC cut to Brenda Warner,
Kurt's wife, celebrating in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Warner threw for more yards than anyone in Super Bowl history,
completing 24 of 45 passes for a record 414 yards. In the first
half, which ended with St. Louis leading, 9-0, he completed a
whopping 19 of 35 passes for 277 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Rams caught passes. He threw short and long. He connected
on crossing patterns and sideline routes. Early in the third, he
broke an 0-for-12 red zone slump, hitting rookie Torry Holt for a
9-yard touchdown pass. It was 16-0 and Warner was halfway to Disney
World.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their success, the Rams didn't get much national TV face
time in 1999. Warner's story was well worn on sports pages and
weekly magazines, but Sunday &UR;  &LR; night he crossed into mainstream
America. The made-for-TV movie can't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of my story as a Hollywood story. It's just my
life,'' said Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many great American tales, the story begins in Iowa.
Warner was a skinny ninth-grader when he showed up at Regis High in
Cedar Rapids and said he'd like to be a wide receiver. The astute
coach asked the tall boy to throw a couple of passes, and decided
that young Kurt would be better off at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   He made it all the way to the University of Northern Iowa, but
didn't start until he was a fifth-year senior. The Panthers were
bounced out of the Division 1-AA playoffs that year when they lost
to Boston University at Nickerson Field in double overtime. The BU
quarterback was Robert Dougherty. Try to find anyone in Greater
Boston who attended the game and noticed Kurt Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Warner was a rookie hopeful with the Packers in 1994, but they
were pretty deep at quarterback. They had Brett Favre, Mark
Brunell, and Ty Detmer. When your third-string guy is a Heisman
winner, it doesn't bode well for a kid from Northern Iowa. Green
Bay coaches Mike Holmgren and Steve Mariucci sent Warner home to
Cedar Falls, where he went to work bagging groceries at Hy-Vee.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't bagging, Warner sent out football resumes and
tapes. The NFL and Canadian Football League teams passed on him, so
he went to the Arena Football League and played for the mighty Iowa
Barnstormers of Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   From there it was off to the Netherlands, where he played for
the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe. He led the European League in
yardage, attempts, completions, and touchdowns. There were several
reporters from Amsterdam at  &UR; last night &LR; 's Super Bowl. Bet they
weren't in Miami for last year's game.
</P>
<P>
   After his year in Europe, Warner resumed calling NFL teams with
little success. The Rams were the 13th team he contacted. Former
Patriots scouting director Charlie Armey (now the Rams' general
manager) gave the journeyman kid a shot. Warner wears No. 13 to
remind himself of the 12 rejections.
</P>
<P>
   Warner was the No. 3 quarterback for the Rams in 1998, but
didn't play until the final game of the season. The Rams brought
Trent Green in from Washington this past offseason, but Green blew
out his knee in the next-to-last exhibition game and Vermeil told
the troops that Warner was going to be The Man.
</P>
<P>
   He was The Man, winning the regular-season MVP award. At the age
of 28, after six years of rollerball, Euroball, and No Ball. He was
an overnight success in the biggest, baddest league of them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let anybody tell you you can't accomplish something,''
he said. ``I believe in myself and there's nothing on the field we
can't accomplish. We worked hard for this and they stuck with me
through this whole season.''
</P>
<P>
   If you watched the game Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, you saw many TV shots of
Brenda Warner. She is a huge part of this incredible story. Brenda
was a divorced mother of two when she met Kurt. Her older child,
since adopted by Kurt, is disabled because of a head injury
suffered when he was an infant. Her parents were killed by a
tornado in Arkansas in 1996. She married Kurt a year later and they
have a son of their own. Small wonder Kurt and Brenda Warner are
extremely devout young adults.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big deal two years ago when John Elway finally got his
Super Bowl ring. This is even bigger. Kurt Warner. MVP of the best
Super Bowl of them all.

RAMS FINALLY PROVE THEMSELVES TO EVERYONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Take a deep breath, and then give the St. Louis Rams
their props. They are the champions.
</P>
<P>
   They are the best team in the NFL. They were the best team in
the regular season, and they were the best team Sunday in their
23-16 Super Bowl victory against the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever can take that from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you saw,'' Rams coach Dick Vermeil said, ``was no
fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   They no longer have to apologize for their schedule. So what
that the only three victories they had against teams with winning
records came in the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   They no longer have to hear that their statistics were
artificially produced. So what that they played only two defenses
ranked in the top 10?
</P>
<P>
   It should no longer be asked if they could beat the 1998 Denver
Broncos, the 1997 Denver Broncos, the 1996 Green Bay Packers or the
1995 Cowboys. So what that the NFL was watered down this season?
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing matters anymore: The Rams have a Lombardi Trophy
in their display case and rings on their fingers. They are No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, the Rams scored the third-most points
in NFL history. They outscored their opponents by 284 points, the
second-highest differential in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   During the postseason, they beat the Minnesota Vikings with
offense; they beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with defense; and they
beat the Tennessee Titans with heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're world champions,'' Rams quarterback Kurt Warner
screamed. ``How about them Rams?''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams proved their point.
</P>
<P>
   They were great in the regular season. They were the greatest in
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The strangest of strange seasons saw the Rams and Titans produce
the most dramatic finish in Super Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the Titans' eight-play, 28-yard drive that led
to an Al Del Greco field goal and a 16-16 tie with 2:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 18 seconds later, there was Warner's 73-yard touchdown
pass to Isaac Bruce that gave the Rams a 23-16 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 1:54 later, it was St. Louis linebacker Mike Jones making
a textbook tackle on Titans receiver Kevin Dyson at the Rams' 1 as
the gun sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams made the plays when they needed to. They made them when
they had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the plays when we had to make them, and we're world
champions,'' Vermeil said. ``We showed America what Super Bowls are
supposed to be about.''
</P>
<P>
   Say anything you want about the Rams. Just make sure you call
them champions.

AGASSI READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ So now Andre Agassi is a bodyguard for a couple of
geezers called McEnroe and Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   Just a part-time job, you understand, but Agassi is one of those
hypercharged guys for whom no reach is too far. Some people want to
boss towns. Agassi deals in continents. Having just collected
Australia, he will now take on Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi was saying to a Russian named Yevgeny Kafelnikov Saturday
in Rod Laver Arena that this continent isn't big enough for both of
them. Kafelnikov disputed that contention and knocked Agassi around
for a half-hour. But he didn't guard his own body closely enough.
Agassi got off the hard rock floor and proved his point by winning
the Australian Open for a second time, his sixth major, 3-6, 6-3,
6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's triumph climaxed the most resplendent fortnight ever in
the Aussie for Americans, who were winners in all five events. He
and Lindsay Davenport pulled off the first singles double by
home-grown Yanks since Californians Don Budge and Dodo Bundy won in
1938. Sharing the doubles prizes were Californian Rick Leach with
South African Ellis Ferreira, Pennsylvanian Lisa Raymond with
Aussie Rennae Stubbs, and Floridian Jared Palmer with Stubbs.
</P>
<P>
   First prize for Agassi is $485,000. His second prize is a free
ride halfway around the world to Harare, Zimbabwe, where he will
hunt a couple of local lions named Byron and Wayne Black on behalf
of the newly anointed US Davis Cup captain, 40-year-old John
Patrick McEnroe Jr.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe will need all the protection from the Zimbabweans that
he can get from Agassi because his dreams of an invincible 1-2
punch of Agassi and Pete Sampras were punctured when Sampras called
in sick the other day. Then so did Todd Martin, a mainstay last
year when Agassi and Sampras passed.
</P>
<P>
   There's a limit to how well Agassi can shield his captain. He
can probably win both his singles matches, but it's a five-match
series beginning Friday, and the pesky little Black brothers, who
grew up playing barefoot on their old man's avocado patch, are
capable of taking the other three points. They beat Australia in
the first round (in Australia) in 1998, and they gave the Cup
champs a close scrape last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although McEnroe shamed Sampras into enlisting by calling on him
publicly to do his tennis duty, the captain said he never believed
Sampras would show. Nobody really wants to make this safari, the
first US visit to Africa, anyway, but it was the luck of the draw.
Is it all in Sampras's hip, or his head, that he doesn't want to
track fierce Zimbabweans while wearing a pith helmet? He said he
strained his right hip in the first set while losing to Agassi in
the semis, although he competed splendidly the rest of the five-set
way. McEnroe must accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Mention of Sampras brings up security man Agassi's other client,
63-year-old Roy Emerson, deadlocked with Sampras at the male record
of 12 major singles championships. Emmo, a good old boy Aussie
residing in California, appears defenseless against the Sampras
surge that began with the US Open title of 1990. He hung on to the
record all alone from 1967 until Sampras took his 12th last year at
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been thrilling watching Pete go after the record, and if
he gets it, that's great,'' Agassi said. ``But I won't be happy if
he gets it at my expense. I'll do everything in my power to prevent
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He did just that last week, whacking Sampras even though he was
two points from defeat in their fourth-set tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   That was superb bodyguarding and good news in Blackbutt, a
cattle and timber town of 800 souls in the remote never-never land
of Queensland, the one-saloon settlement where Emerson was reared.
An old pal of Emmo's, Kevin Allery, said over the phone, ``We
really enjoyed Agassi beating Sampras. The Curse of Blackbutt is
still alive. We've got an Aboriginal witch doctor working on it.
Pete may have a piece of the record, but he'll never top Roy.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not, now that Agassi has emerged from the phone
booth in which he appeared trapped three years ago, looking like
supermasher of rubber lemons, and is in the chase with six majors
himself _ three in the last eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've accomplished more in those eight months than I ever
dreamed of,'' said Agassi of a wondrous swirl that has embraced
conquests of France, the United States, and Australia; a divorce
from one celebrated woman, Brooke Shields; and the squiring of
another, Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
   That's only the beginning, in his view. ``I want to do
everything,'' which means another Olympic gold in September,
retrieving the Davis Cup (last won by the United States five years
ago), and blocking Sampras's route with his own body. Collaterally,
he also would be keeping McEnroe and Emerson undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   Strong is good, but stronger is better in the Agassi canon. ``I
intend to get stronger. The stronger you are, the heavier the
rallying stroke, the more snap to your shots. I'm a better player
than I was winning here five years ago,'' said Agassi, who turns 30
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. Agassi was a very fine player, bursting with gifts
but not necessarily the desire to unwrap them with hard
conditioning labor. He regrets probably throwing away the French
Opens of 1990 and 1991, when he got to the finals casually trained
and couldn't beat the faded Andres Gomez and rising Jim Courier.
</P>
<P>
   Those guys are passe, and so is the Agassi of 1995, who looked
like a refugee from ``The Pirates of Penzance'' in head scarf, bold
earrings, and shorts that could have doubled as a buccaneer's
spinnaker. He has been fun, going through all the changes _ nail
polish, magenta ensembles, ponytail, and horselaugh. But now, in
pristine white, head shaved, he's become a head-breaking warrior
who must be considered among the all-time greats _ and rising.
</P>
<P>
   His firepower is astounding, particularly when you consider how
few are his blunders. His serve intimidates with accuracy rather
than power, and he can run for weeks. He's adept at mixing up
shotmaking, as Kafelnikov dourly discovered when Agassi's five
perfect drop shots at important junctures made him feel
quicksanded.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be his teammates in Africa? ``I don't know, and I don't
think John (McEnroe) knew when he got on the plane in New York,''
he said. ``Losing Sampras and probably Martin is unfortunate. Maybe
Chris Woodruff, who played so well against Pete, will be picked.
Doubles? Martin was going to play. Maybe Rick Leach and Alex
O'Brien.''
</P>
<P>
   If the rules were altered, McEnroe's choices would be easy. Just
select his bodyguard for all four singles. And maybe the doubles,
too, alongside the aged captain himself?

WHEN IT COUNTED, RAMS' BIG-PLAY OFFENSE PAID OFF
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The big-play Rams used, you guessed it, a big play to
win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise. Surprise.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't think the video-game Rams _ who scored the
third-highest point total in NFL history and had 62 pass plays of
20 or more yards in the regular season _ would be looking to settle
for a game-winning field goal attempt when they got the ball one
last time Sunday, did you?
</P>
<P>
   Rams receiver Isaac Bruce certainly didn't. He hauled in the
73-yard prayer that came via quarterback Kurt Warner's arm and gave
the St. Louis Rams a 23-16 victory over the Tennessee Titans in
Super Bowl XXXIV at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't me that was God,'' said Bruce, who caught six
passes for 162 yards, the third-highest total in Super Bowl
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was all God. I just knew I had to make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce got the chance after the Titans scored tied the score at
16 with 2 minutes, 12 seconds to go. With go-for-broke offensive
coordinator Mike Martz at the controls, he said he knew the Rams
were going to go deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't talk about it,'' Bruce said. ``I just know his
personality. He likes to throw it up.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Rams did, on the first play from their own 27-yard line.
The play, called ``ninety-nine nine,'' had Bruce working against
one-on-one coverage from Titans cornerback Denard Walker. Bruce
sprinted down the right sideline and Warner threw the ball a little
short. But the Rams' preacher-man receiver adjusted to the pass,
while Walker fell to the turf.
</P>
<P>
   A juke and a sprint later, Bruce was in the end zone and the
Rams were in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Warner was not surprised that Bruce, who led the Rams with 12
touchdown receptions in the regular season, was the one who ended
things. He preferred it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the play called earlier and they came back and told me
Isaac could eat him,'' Warner said. ``I knew we needed a big play
and Isaac is our go-to-guy. He came up with the big play for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The play was particularly deflating for the Titans defense,
which despite giving up a bushel of yards to Warner, had done its
job by keeping the Rams from making big plays, and out of the end
zone for a good portion of the game.
</P>
<P>
   And after giving up a 9-yard touchdown pass to Torry Holt to
make the score 16-0 in the third quarter, the Titans defense found
a way to stop the Rams. St. Louis' only two punts of the game came
between the touchdowns by Holt and Bruce. At the same time, the
Tennessee offense rallied for 16 points and the tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to keep them in front of us,'' Titans cornerback
Samari Rolle said. ``We did that up until the last play. Bruce made
the catch and we didn't make the tackle. We came up short.'' nn

`SLIVER' WILL STICK WITH STECKEL 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The greatest Super Bowl ever was in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Les Steckel sat in the Tennessee coaching room high above the
field and loved what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed 10 yards. When I saw that, I got excited,'' Steckel
said. ``We had the perfect play for that situation. I knew we could
get a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Steckel, the offensive coordinator of the Tennessee Titans,
leaned forward and sent orders down to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sliver Right. Sliver Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall in the St. Louis coaches box, Rams defensive
coordinator Peter Giunta wondered what Steckel would do. Like
Steckel, he faced the biggest call of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Fischer vs. Boris Spassky. Steckel vs. Giunta, in the most
critical situation in Super Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the time left (just six seconds) I thought they were
going to throw,'' Giunta said. ``I know they loved to run, and they
killed us with the run in the fourth period, but I thought they
would throw. We called a combination coverage where we would have
three of our guys covering two of theirs. We thought the ball would
go to a wide receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis was holding on for dear life. The Titans already had
roared back from a 16-point third-quarter deficit, only to fall
behind, 23-16, on a 73-yard Rams touchdown with 1:54 to play.
Tennessee again came back, moving to the St. Louis 10-yard line,
but now had time for just one more play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had practiced this play three times (Sliver Right),'' said
Steckel. ``And every time it worked. We got the coverage against us
that we thought we would, but it just didn't happen for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Steve McNair went back to pass and looked to his
right. He watched for his tight end to clear underneath the
three-man zone Giunta had put together, and saw wide receiver Kevin
Dyson slanting toward the middle of the field. McNair, who had not
thrown well most of the night, threw a perfect strike to Dyson, who
caught the ball at the 4-yard line and had to get into the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   But linebacker Mike Jones saved the game and the world
championship for the Rams. ``On our coverage I just drop back and
look for someone coming inside,'' Jones said. ``I saw the wide
receiver coming, so I broke on the ball and went for him. I knew we
were near the goal line. But I didn't think about anything else but
getting him on the ground. Nothing else mattered. I just wanted to
get him on the ground. When I did, I knew he didn't make it. He was
still on the 1-yard line.''
</P>
<P>
   Steckel was shattered. All his brilliant work calling plays over
the last 20 minutes and moving Tennessee into position for a
remarkable victory evaporated in front of his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens under pressure is that a player tends to do
things a little too quickly,'' Steckel said. ``They cut things
short. Our guy (Dyson) did that. He should have run a little deeper
before he made his move into the end zone. But that's what happens.
I feel so sorry for our guys. Putting up such a great battle and
coming so close was hard to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Giunta knew his defensive unit, which had completely shut down
Tennessee in the first 40 minutes, was lucky to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were beating us physically at the end of the game,'' he
said. ``Their offense wore our guys out. We were tired. I give them
all the credit in the world for being behind like that and still
running the ball. Les made some great calls for them.''
</P>
<P>
   What Steckel, a former Patriots coach under Raymond Berry, did
in the fourth quarter was completely unorthodox. Teams just don't
continue to run the ball down 16 points with time running out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, we had 23 plays. They had 50. We weren't
playing our game,'' Steckel said. ``We were calling in running
plays, but Steve was reading the defense and checking to passes. He
went for what he thought would be the better play. But it wasn't
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the half, I told our team we had to go out there and beat
them up. We knew we could beat them up physically. That's our game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reminded them of a game we had with Tampa Bay a year ago.
Tampa Bay has a great defense, and they had us down, 17-3, at the
half. We still ran the ball in the second half, and took it to them
to win the game. They couldn't believe it after the game, and they
admitted it. I told them we were going to run and keep on
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee did just that. After rushing for just 30 yards in the
first half, the Titans finished with 159 on the ground against the
No. 1 defense in the league against the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it going our way in the first half,'' said Giunta. ``We
put them in third-down-and-long situations, and we got them off the
field. They couldn't convert on third down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But (late) in the third period, they started going to the
running game and making big gains on first down. First down started
to kill us and they kept pounding the ball. In two games we played
against these guys this year, they did not turn the ball over once,
and we are a defense that has taken the ball away from teams all
year. Twice in the fourth period we had a chance to make an
interception and stop them, but we didn't make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, the Titans beat St. Louis in Tennessee,
24-21. The Titans led, 21-0, in the second period, and St. Louis
came roaring back at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Both games were settled on the final play of the game. In
Tennessee, the Titans won when St. Louis missed a field goal to tie
it. Sunday night, St. Louis won when the Titans missed the tying
touchdown by a yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game time ran out on them,'' said Tennessee wide
receivers coach Steve Walter. ``The clock saved us. Today, the
clock saved them. That's how close these two teams are.''

BELANGER TRIES TO ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After missing 34 games because of post-concussion
syndrome, left wing Ken Belanger returned to the Bruins' lineup
Saturday night against the Buffalo Sabres at the FleetCenter. He
only logged three shifts and just more than two minutes of ice time
in Boston's 1-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said he eased Belanger back, but conceded
Belanger has a specialized role and hopes his enforcer understands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he'd stop worrying about everything. He worries about
everything,'' said Burns, whose team takes on the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks Monday night at the FleetCenter. ``He worries a lot about
(Gino) Odjick playing a regular shift, but the Islanders are out of
it and we're in it. He worries about a lot of things like that. He
worries about (Washington forward) Chris Simon, but Chris Simon has
been in the league for a while. How many full seasons has
(Belanger) had? We have to work with him on that and spend some
time with him. He has to stop worrying about all that crap.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said all players who primarily are enforcers go through
some sort of an identity crisis at some point in their careers.
Belanger said he wants to make his game more complete, but Burns
said the 25-year-old shouldn't be distracted by what goes on with
other players on other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common thing with those types of players,'' said Burns.
``I had it with (Ken) Baumgartner in Toronto. We had the same
situation with him. The way they have to think is, `This is what I
do, this is what I've got to do best.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Stu Grimson has the same thing in Anaheim. You have to come to
terms with that, that this is your job. Like Grimson says, (he
creates) a safe environment for his teammates. If you don't accept
that job, you've got to do something a hell of a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said the enforcers he's had in the past eventually have
come to terms with their role.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not until they understand they can make a pretty good
living at it if they do it well,'' he said, ``like Baumgartner came
to terms with it and so did (John) Kordic and Grimson. They sold it
to us. We didn't sell it to them. They sold that package to us,
that that was the player they were. But then when they get into it,
they start thinking they should do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said some have suggested Belanger be used on the power
play because of his booming shot, which has been a hit at skills
competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the skills competition, you have time to set it there and
take a running start. Sure, your shot is going to be hard, but when
you have pressure on you, everything is bang, bang, it's a
different story,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Burns appreciates that the enforcer's role isn't easy. ``You
have to really respect them because it is a tough job to have to go
out and do that and maybe not getting the ice time,'' he said.
``Marty (McSorley) made himself a better player, but he knows his
role and still does it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Belanger said he understands Burns's point of view but still
wants to challenge himself to be a more complete player. He knows
the layoff has affected his conditioning, but said he would like to
work his way into more ice time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your first two years, you don't expect too much, but the more
years you play in the league, the more respect you get and the more
room you get on the ice and the more you can expand your game,'' he
said. ``You get to build the coach's confidence and he can put you
in different situations like I did in the playoffs last year, where
I got to play regular. It takes time to prove yourself. When you
get a regular shift, you're not worried about making a bad pass and
not getting another shift. It's all part of the game that takes
time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Joe Murphy, who felt ill after the game Saturday,
didn't practice Sunday because he was still under the weather.
Burns said he expects Murphy to be fine Monday night . . . Burns
said it's likely center Shawn Bates (wrist injury) and left wing
Joe Hulbig (groin injury) will be sidelined until after this
weekend's All-Star break.

 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ AmericaOne was licking its wounds Sunday
as Prada resisted the irresistible: envisioning itself as the
winner of the Louis Vuitton Cup next week, and sailing for the
America's Cup Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   During the lay day, both camps went on, business as usual,
getting ready for Monday's Race 5 of the nine-race series.
</P>
<P>
   Up, 3-1, Prada must win only two of the next five, while
AmericaOne has to win four. It's a tall order, but AmericaOne
skipper Paul Cayard ignores the loss column.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to do what we had to do yesterday,'' he said,
``win four races.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the last two AmericaOne losses, one in which
AmericaOne got beaten up in a gale that Prada survived and the
other in which a controversial penalty call in the last 300 yards
took it out of the lead, the future looks bleak.
</P>
<P>
   How does Cayard now rally his troops to the daunting task of
winning four against battle-toughened Prada?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not giving (my crew) much rah-rah talk,'' said Cayard,
looking forward to a few hours of recuperation and preparation time
before Race 5. ``They don't need that. They're as tough as I am. We
all feel pretty cheated by the (race-ending penalty) call. We just
can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard was reflecting on AmericaOne's misfortunes on the last
leg of Saturday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened is that the wind died. If the wind had stayed
up, they would not have caught up. So first the wind dies, then
they catch up, and the penalty just finished us off.''
</P>
<P>
   Very much like a charge/block call in basketball _ and subject
to interpretation _ the umpire boats called the penalty on the
final run to the finish. After conferring by radio, two umpire
boats _ one astern of each racer _ decided AmericaOne was guilty of
violating Rule 11 of the canons of maritime law known as
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, from
which modern race rules are derived.
</P>
<P>
   The situation: On the final run, the Italian Luna Rossa, sailing
in more breeze and 3 knots faster, closed from behind AmericaOne.
Skipper Francesco de Angelis was on the advantaged starboard tack,
and Cayard gybed to windward, putting AmericaOne on starboard with
Luna Rossa to leeward.
</P>
<P>
   Luna Rossa gradually gained an overlap to leeward and, as the
boats came close together, both protest ``Y'' flags went up.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires penalized AmericaOne under Rule 11, which states:
``When boats are on the same tack, and overlapped, a windward boat
(AmericaOne) shall keep clear of a leeward boat (Luna Rossa).''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they found Luna Rossa not to have violated
Rule 17, which AmericaOne accused it of doing: ``A boat that
establishes a leeward overlap (Luna Rossa) . . . shall not sail
above her proper course during that overlap.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cayard and tactician John Kostecki maintain that Luna
Rossa did sail above proper course (the straightest line to the
finish), the umpires saw it differently and flagged only AmericaOne
for Rule 11.
</P>
<P>
   With AmericaOne leading just slightly at that point, the
penalty, requiring a 270-degree turn, was fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes up must come down again,'' Torben Grael, Italy's
tactician, said afterward, referring to the race at the end of the
semifinals in which the umpires ruled in AmericaOne's favor in a
similar confrontation. ``The difference (between that race and
this) is that we were not sailing above proper course today.
(Cayard) tried to sail below and squeeze us up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Grael was still steamed about an earlier confrontation on
the Leg 2 run. During a luffing match, AmericaOne ripped its
spinnaker, and with just a mainsail up was able to luff Luna Rossa
so high the Italian boat spun out of control in the 25-knot wind,
coming almost head to wind, with the spinnaker in mayhem. By the
time the crew got the boat under control, Prada had lost more than
half a minute.
</P>
<P>
   During the flurry, both boats raised protest flags and shouted
exchanges, but the umpires green-flagged (no-foul) both boats.
Grael still maintains Cayard violated the ``seamanship'' clause in
the rules by luffing Luna Rossa as hard as he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did was unseamanlike,'' Grael said. ``If one boat
doesn't have a spinnaker and the other boat has one up in 25 knots
. . . if that's not unseamanlike, I don't know what is.''
</P>
<P>
   So no love is lost as the two boats square off Monday in what
has become AmericaOne's fight for survival. Two more losses and the
United States faces the prospect of the first America's Cup in the
event's 149-year history without an American boat.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard has won such fights before _ most notably in 1992, when
he came from behind, 1-3, to beat New Zealand, 4-3, in the Louis
Vuitton finals.
</P>
<P>
   But that was seven years ago in vapid San Diego, against an
opponent that was unraveling fast. Facing a tough, solid opponent
out on the washing machine of Hauraki Gulf, it's hard to see how
history will help AmericaOne.

   BOSTON _ Boston's America East basketball fans are glad to see
Drexel senior guard Bryant Coursey leave town.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday Coursey delivered his second winning shot of the weekend,
sinking a one-handed runner off the glass with less than a second
to play and giving the Dragons a 57-56 victory over Northeastern at
Cabot Gym. His off-balance 12-footer with four seconds left gave
Drexel a 62-61 overtime win at Boston University Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a special weekend for him,'' said Drexel coach Steve
Seymour. ``I don't know how many players in Division 1 have made
game-winning shots in back-to-back games like he has. It was just a
special weekend for a special kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Coursey, who ended up with 12 points: ``I was just trying
to get to the basket. I was hoping to get fouled and win it that
way with a couple of free throws.''
</P>
<P>
   While Coursey stood in the middle of a happy mob of teammates
and celebrated Drexel's stunning rally from an 11-point deficit
with 2:52 to go, Northeastern coach Rudy Keeling darted across the
court, went into the stands behind press row, and heatedly
complained to Charles Diehl, America East coordinator of officials,
about the officiating of William Laubenstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played well enough to win and I felt Drexel
played very well in coming back and getting back into the game,''
Keeling told reporters after the game. ``When it comes down to one
shot, you'd like to think your guys can defend for one shot. We're
up 11 with less than three minutes to go and we got a lot of foul
calls, a lot of little calls which stopped the momentum. They just
marched to the line and stopped the flow and it really hurt us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the one official (Laubenstein) was the official we had in
Vermont (an 85-82 loss Jan. 21) and he called a very poor game in
Vermont and I let him know about it,'' Keeling said. ``I'll let you
see the tape, but the first call he called for us (Sunday) was when
he called the foul against them right at the end (with 10.2 seconds
left) and George (Aygar) shot the foul shot. It was the first time
he called a foul for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind if you get mad at me, but you don't, as an adult,
take the game away from the kids, and that's what happened. I
thought he took it away from us. No way was there enough time for
them to win the game unless he consciously did that. I know it
sounds like sour grapes because we lost, but if we had won by 1, it
would've been the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeling's plea to Diehl fell on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of his buddies, so he's not gonna (do anything),''
Keeling said. ``He saw the game like we saw the game. If he was
honest about it, he would've said, `I thought there was something
strange,' if nothing else. There's nothing he can do about it now,
but at least he could've been fair about it and he wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 31-21 halftime lead, the Huskies (4-15 overall,
2-8 conference) appeared well on their way to victory when Aygar
(who had a team-high 12 points) hit a baseline jumper that gave NU
a 54-43 lead with 2:53 to go. The Dragons (9-11, 6-4) then went on
a 12-2 run and pulled within 1 (56-55) when Ashley Howard knocked
down a line-drive trey with 1:08 left.
</P>
<P>
   NU's Cortez Bond committed a costly turnover with 32.6 seconds
left but atoned for the miscue when he blocked a shot by Stephen
Starks to give NU possession with 11.7 seconds left. Aygar took the
inbounds pass, was immediately fouled by Robert Battle, and went to
the line for a crucial one-and-one.
</P>
<P>
   Aygar, however, opened the door for Coursey's heroic shot when
he missed the front end. Starks controlled the rebound for Drexel
and worked the ball to Coursey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some stupid things,'' Keeling said. ``I mean, we threw
the ball away, and we didn't execute and we didn't make our shots
when we had a chance. All those things would've won the game, but
to put us in that situation is a different story.''

CELTICS PACE THEMSELVES FOR INDIANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ The Celtics had three days to prepare for
Tuesday's game against Indiana. That appears to be an optimal
amount of time for the team members to gain perspective and for
coach Rick Pitino to instruct them in the ways and means of the
Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a two-fold advantage,'' Pitino said Sunday. ``There
is the advantage of getting ready for the team that has the
strongest home-court advantage in the league, and this will allow
us to get healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana is 18-2 and has a 15-game winning streak at home. The
Pacers have not lost in Indianapolis since a 107-99 defeat against
Detroit Nov. 25. That was three days after a 95-85 loss to the
Celtics in Boston and marked a low point in the Indiana season. The
Pacers have won 22 of 31 games since.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Celtics have won only four games on the road.
Pitino said the Celtics' road failures have often resulted from
lack of preparation time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting into a groove offensively and defensively,''
Pitino said. ``We will be prepared. We are going to know their
plays. But what it comes down to is us making our shots and forcing
them to miss theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike most teams, which run fast breaks for layups, they run
fast breaks for 3s. And they are very good at it. We have outplayed
them for 60-70 percent of games, and then they hit a barrage of 3s
and we're out of it. It's very difficult to defend them the way
they run the break.''
</P>
<P>
   This is sort of like redirecting Pitino's favorite weapon
against him. Pitino's teams usually utilize 3-pointers as their
point of reference. But they are having to become more concerned
with stifling the long ball than launching it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the 3, but the most important thing is to stop it if
it's there,'' Pitino said. ``The important thing is the
differential. I don't want them making 12 and us making 3. At
Kentucky, we would have a 21-point differential on 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do is not stop the 3 but stop the attempt.
Because if you give them the attempt, in this league, with guys
like Reggie Miller, they are going to make 40 percent of those
shots. And that is better than making 50 percent on 2-point shots.
Most of our losses, there has been disparity the other way on 3s.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker are expected to be the Celtics'
answer to Miller, though mostly inside the 3-point circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul and Antoine put a lot of pressure on the defense,''
Pitino said. ``And that opens it up for others. They take the heat
off the defense, and that allows others to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they work out during the offseason, and if they continue to
grow together, they are going to become a lethal weapon. That means
they also have to continue to work on defense and be the best
defensive players on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eric Williams returned to practice for the first time after
being placed on the injured list with a right knee injury Jan. 25.
Williams, who has not played since a 94-90 win over Toronto Jan.
19, is eligible to return against New Jersey Friday . . . Pervis
Ellison (strained left calf) participated in a practice that was
open to a youth group but closed to the media. Ellison was listed
as ``not with team'' during a 91-88 win over Phoenix Friday . . .
The Celtics meet Miami Wednesday at the FleetCenter.

HOFSTRA DEALS BU 7TH STRAIGHT LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
 UNIVERSITY-HOFSTRA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You lose five of your previous six games in the final
seconds and you figure your fortunes are due for a turn. Boston
University has been ever so close to turning around a season
riddled with injuries and setbacks; a win Sunday against America
East leader Hofstra would have been a major step in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, BU did the moonwalk. Trailing by 2 with 17:00 left, the
Terriers succumbed to a 16-0 Hofstra run.
</P>
<P>
   Such a surge would be tough for any team to overcome. When you
dress just seven scholarship players and have two walk-ons (one a
former team manager), as the Terriers do, it all but guarantees
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   BU never threatened after the onslaught and Hofstra overcame
some sloppiness down the stretch to record a 64-49 triumph before a
Case Center crowd of 505.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Richardson had 17 points and Craig Claxton added 16 for
Hofstra (14-5, 9-1), which overcame poor shooting in the first half
(39 percent) by hitting 52 percent in the second and forcing 20 BU
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were taking the same shots in the second half as we were in
the first,'' said Claxton, ``but in the second half they just fell
for us, and that was the difference in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That made Sunday's contest a contrast from BU's previous six
outings, which the Terriers lost by a total of 8 points (including
two in overtime). BU (3-17, 2-9) has dropped seven in a row, its
most consecutive defeats since 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   The Terriers played aggressive defense in the first half, were
within 5 (27-22) at halftime, and pulled to 31-29 with 17:00 left.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson drained a trey with 16:07 remaining, teammate
Lars Grubler sank two free throws, and Richardson followed with a
layup. The rout was on. Hofstra capped the run with a 3-pointer by
Claxton for a 47-29 advantage with 11:07 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't score for a long time,'' said BU coach Dennis Wolff,
who has lost two players to season-ending injuries and one to
academic problems. ``We made some fatigue mistakes in the second
half.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Hofstra's 16-0 run, Wolff said, ``At that point, because of
the makeup of our team, with its numbers, and it being the second
game of the weekend _ and I'm not making up excuses here _ we hit
the wall at a certain point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids still showed a little bit of life when we tried
trapping, but we don't have a whole lot of energy and a lot of
options.''
</P>
<P>
   The Terriers got no closer than 13 after Hofstra's run, and a
4-point play by Hofstra guard Jason Hernandez with 5:43 left put
the Flying Dutchmen up, 55-36.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got beaten by a better team,'' said Wolff, ``and in my
opinion, they didn't play their best.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Jean Avebe led BU with 12 points, 7 rebounds, and 3
steals. Teammate Paul Seymour, last week's America East rookie of
the week, had 11 points, but failed to score in the first half on
0-for-5 shooting from the floor, 0 for 4 from 3-point range. BU
shot 38 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Terriers have a much needed week off before playing at
cross-town rival Northeastern Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to come back working every day. That's the only
way I know to go about it,'' said Wolff. ``We have to accept it and
keep trying to improve.''

VERMEIL MAY LEAVE _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It might be justice if Dick Vermeil decided to walk
away after winning the Super Bowl with the Rams here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Just about a year ago this time, the Rams asked him to walk
away, and he couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   They can deny it if they want, but a year ago this time, after
finishing a dismal 4-12 season, the Rams did not want Vermeil back.
</P>
<P>
   He offered to take a settlement on the remaining three years of
his contract and walk away from coaching forever.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, if a coach gets fired, the team has to pay his
contract in full. Vermeil had only finished two years of a
lucrative five-year contract. The Rams owed him three years. If
they fired him, they'd have to pay him for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   They offered Vermeil a settlement. He didn't think it was enough
and rejected it. So they brought him back to lead the Rams on one
of the most incredible runs in pro football history.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Rams also tried to get rid of Kurt Warner, the
season and Super Bowl Most Valuable Player, just about the time
they were trying to say goodbye to Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   All 30 teams in the NFL had to leave some players exposed to the
expansion draft to stock the Cleveland Browns last February. Warner
was put on the list. Cleveland could have had him for nothing, but
they didn't pick him, so Warner returned to the Rams _ and a date
with destiny.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling how good the Titans' Steve McNair would be if
he could throw the ball with accuracy. McNair once again showed the
football world he is probably the greatest running quarterback ever
to play the game. The Rams made it their first item of business not
to let him run successfully, but they couldn't stop him as he ran
eight times for 64 yards, an 8-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   McNair is a wonderful playmaker and clutch player. He seems to
get better when the game is on the line in the fourth period,
improvising and creating havoc with the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half we did a lot of good things, and then
stopped ourselves with mistakes,'' said McNair. ``We were stopping
ourselves. They couldn't stop us. In the second half, we stopped
making mistakes, and we started moving the ball. Their linebacker
(Mike Jones) made a great play on the last play. I thought
(Kevin)Dyson might break the tackle and get into the end zone, but
it didn't happen for us.''

GLORY OUT OF REACH FOR DYSON 
</HEADLINE>
 PLAY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The play is called ``Sliver Right'' and if ``Sliver
Right'' unfolded in the ``slowest of slow-motion,'' as Tennessee
fullback Lorenzo Neal saw it and felt it and will relive it for the
next year and beyond, then that sliver stuck sharply underneath the
fingernails of the Titans. For ``Sliver Right'' came up a yard
short.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is such a roller coaster . . . I know it now,'' said
the Titans' Kevin Dyson, who ran ``Sliver Right,'' delaying his
slant while his tight end, Frank Wycheck, occupied Rams linebacker
Mike Jones. ``And when I caught the ball, I was open and I thought
I was in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sliver Right.'' Under the fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson is the Titan who ran the ``Music City Miracle,'' that
lateral and 75-yard run that won Tennessee's first playoff game
against Buffalo with 16 seconds left. ``We were down against
Buffalo . . . then the lateral. We were down today . . . and we
came back,'' said Dyson. ``And I was open . . . it's such a
roller-coaster ride . . . I don't know . . . to come up a yard
short.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for lack of effort, no, definitely not.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson was running into the end zone _ in the clear it seemed _
with his next step, ``but their guy got me by my feet,'' the
Tennessee wide receiver said.
</P>
<P>
   No Super Bowl had ever come down to this. Six seconds left, one
play left in the game, one play to tie up Super Bowl XXXIV, one
play from the 10-yard line of the St. Louis Rams. One play called
``Sliver Right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good play,'' Wycheck thought as quarterback Steve
McNair called it in the huddle. It called for the Titans to run two
routes on the right side, Wycheck heading down the seam and Dyson
slanting inside. Jones was going to have to make the decision of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had run the play against Pittsburgh this year ``and
we were confident in the play,'' said Wycheck, ``and it had gotten
us a touchdown then. It was a good call.''
</P>
<P>
   On the play before, one of the greatest of Super Bowl history,
McNair somehow eluded two Rams who were seemingly jumping on his
back. He ducked underneath the behemoths, somehow scooting free,
scrambled right, and hit a wide-open Dyson for a 16-yard gain to
the 10-yard line. ``That was Steve at his most courageous,'' said
Wycheck, ``and after Steve somehow made that play, we all thought
we were going to tie it up.''
</P>
<P>
   A timeout. Wycheck knew the Titans were in this precarious
predicament, striving to drive 88 yards in 1:46, with only one
timeout left, ``because we had used two timeouts earlier when maybe
we didn't have to,'' said the tight end. But ``Sliver Right'' was
the right call, Wycheck knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play was designed for Jones to run with me and sort of
double me up,'' said Wycheck, ``and have Kevin come straight
underneath on the slant. And if Jones dropped off on Kevin, then
Steve'd have me in the back of the end zone. If Jones stayed with
me, there'd be Kevin.''
</P>
<P>
   As McNair dropped back, he patiently waited, ``knowing if a guy
was open in the end zone, you get it to him. But you don't have to
go to the end zone to score.'' He saw Wycheck head to the back of
the end zone and Dyson slip underneath ``and he was open,'' said
McNair.
</P>
<P>
   So he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was open and I saw the end zone,'' said Dyson. He thought a
cornerback was chasing him because ``I came off the linebacker and
he fell off of me and their cornerback must have made a good
play.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Jones piercing under every Tennessee fingernail with
that sliver. ``I thought when he got his hands on me, I was going
to break free and break the tackle. But he got my foot, tripped me
up, and wrapped up nice.''
</P>
<P>
   As he went down, Dyson elongated his body like some Rubber Man,
trying to will it one last yard, and when his body wouldn't
stretch, his arm did, reaching out as far as it could with the ball
in his fingers, but reaching up more than out.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson lay on the turf for the longest time. ``It was a sick
feeling,'' he said, ``to have come this far and come up just so
short.''
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't until later, much later, that Dyson realized
perhaps he hadn't done all he could to cross that final yard. This
man, who will be on every NFL highlight film from now until the end
of football with his ``Music City Miracle,'' realized in a hallway
outside the Tennessee locker room he might have done more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' Dyson said, ``I could have pitched it back to
somebody.''

BISHOP INJURY PROVIDES A JOLT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By now, virtually every Tennessee Titan was dressed
and leaving the locker room. A Tennessee equipment man was reaching
into the locker of Blaine Bishop and carefully placing Bishop's
highly polished black shoes, shaving kit, and clothes into a duffel
bag.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Robertson, Tennessee's other starting safety, stood by
Bishop's locker and said the game had turned when his closest of
friends was laid out on the field with a jammed neck early in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   All the Titans feared the worst for those 15 minutes when Bishop
lay immobile on the Georgia Dome field, ``but then coach (Jeff)
Fisher came over to us and told us Blaine was going to be all
right,'' said Robertson, who missed the game with a leg injury.
``And that's when we all got together and said we were going to win
this for Blaine. That's when we came alive.''
</P>
<P>
   (Bishop's X-rays proved negative, and he will return with his
teammates to Nashville Monday.)
</P>
<P>
   It was 16-0, St. Louis, at that moment. According to Robertson,
the turning point came when Bishop was carted off the field.
Tennessee did stage the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history _
tying the game at 16 _ but it was all to end a yard short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather we lost by 70 points,'' said Robertson, ``than by a
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Steve McNair had been noble, stepping up to the podium
and very calmly describing what had just happened. This had been
one of the most exciting Super Bowls ever, if not the most
exciting, but McNair was able to dissect it calmly.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Wycheck, McNair's tight end, had said what all of football
had just seen, ``that Steve McNair tonight put his stamp on the
NFL, for he played with so much courage.'' Yet, McNair seemed
dispassionate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance in the end,'' McNair said in the
understatement of understatements, ``but we just came up short.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair would go through the Titans' last drive, recalling what
he felt as he ran onto the field, with the ball on his 12-yard line
and 1:46 to go, only one timeout left in the kitty. ``I said (the
Rams) made one mistake by scoring; they gave us too much time to
score. That was my attitude going out on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   On the last pass to Kevin Dyson, McNair calmly said it was not a
mistake to not throw the ball into the end zone on the last play of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't force the issue,'' McNair said. ``The linebacker (the
Rams' Mike Jones) came off Frank (Wycheck) which, you know he made
a good decision, just peeled off and made the tackle. That
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotion will come later.
</P>
<P>
   For Eddie George was just then giving a clue of what McNair and
all these Titans will feel, because the Titan running back had
mounted a podium, told his thoughts, answered the questions, and
spoke some more, before heading back to the dressing room _ where
he sat by his locker, hands over his face, as every one of his
teammates dressed.
</P>
<P>
   And Eddie George did not move.
</P>
<P>
   Television cameras from Nashville and the networks approached
George. His hands kept covering his eyes. He could not move, could
not talk more than a word or two at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good game,'' a friend said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you.'' Hands still covered face.
</P>
<P>
   ``So close,'' George was heard saying.
</P>
<P>
   And there he sat, until virtually everyone and virtually
everything, including Blaine Bishop's shoes and shaving kit, had
left the Tennessee Titans' locker room.

   GORE, BRADLEY TRADE SHOTS AS CAMPAIGN GROWS INCREASINGLY BITTERBy 
 MARC SANDALOW and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  MANCHESTER, N.H. _ A tightening Democratic contest for
president turned increasingly bitter Sunday, as Vice President Al
Gore called his rival ``manipulative'' and former Sen. Bill Bradley
accused Gore of jumping ``in bed with special interests'' in the
latest election.
<P>
   The barbs, made during the final rallies before Tuesday's
first-in-the-nation primary, are rooted in disagreements over
campaign finances and Gore's record on abortion and have escalated
into the most personal and mean-spirited of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After months of low-key disputes over health care, gun control
and leadership style, the exchanges have left some Democratic party
leaders concerned that they might hurt the winner's chances of
defeating the Republican candidate in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bradley campaign has suddenly changed. Instead of the
promised character, courage and commitment, we have manipulative
attack after manipulative attack,'' Gore said in a spirited rally
before 1,000 supporters in Somersworth, N.H., where he aimed a
considerable portion of his remarks at his rival. ``Senator Bradley
is now stepping down to the level of personal vilification.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has faced renewed questions about his health,
appeared on ABC's ``This Week'' and called Gore and his fellow
Democrats' methods of raising money in the latest campaign
``disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we clean up our own house, Republicans are going to
clean our house in the fall,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp rhetoric came as polls show both the Democratic and
Republican races tightening. A CNN/Gallup poll released yesterday
found Gore and Bradley in a statistical dead heat. A Reuter's poll
found Gore up by seven points _ a drop from 11 points one week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The race is just as close on the Republican side. The CNN poll
found Arizona Sen. John McCain with a five-point edge over Texas
Gov. George W. Bush; however, other polls showed the contest
essentially even.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in tomorrow's primary are particularly high for
Bradley and McCain, both of whom have placed great emphasis here
and are given a better chance of defeating front-runners Gore and
Bush in New Hampshire than most anyplace else.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley to win the nomination, most strategists believe that
he also must do well on March 7 in California, where according to
the latest Field Poll he trails Gore by nearly 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because no one in California has even focused on this
race,'' Bradley said on ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the country, outside of Iowa, New Hampshire, the
media and the political pundits, have actually focused on this
campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Bradley's irregular heartbeat resurfaced after
he disclosed to the New York Times that in three times since 1996
he has undergone a procedure known as cardioversion, in which the
heart is jolted with electricity. The procedure requires a few
minutes of general anesthesia, prompting Bradley to acknowledge
that were such a procedure needed if he were president, he might
have to invoke the 25th Amendment to empower the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley received an unusual nod from the conservative Manchester
Union Leader, the state's most influential newspaper, which has
already endorsed Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial titled ``Almost an Endorsement,'' the paper
urged Democrats to vote for Bradley, stating: ``The cancer of the
Clinton Presidency has mortally infected (Gore), and he is
ethically damaged beyond repair. ... Bradley is much more liberal
than Gore, but at least he is honest. An honest liberal beats a
dishonest one any day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley began running TV commercials over the weekend suggesting
that he is the only candidate _ Democrat or Republican _ who has
always stood for a woman's right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Gore conceded that he had voted against federal financing of
abortions as a member of the House during the '70s and '80s but
said he has always supported the right to a legal abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley accused Gore of dishonesty, noting that among Gore's
votes was a 1984 vote in support of a civil rights amendment that
would have defined a fetus as a ``person.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the attacks prompted Democratic leaders in the
House and Senate _ both Gore supporters _ to issue an statement
urging an end to the personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Democrats, we urge that Sen. Bradley's campaign remain
focused on the issues and that he abandon negative, personal
attacks that do not bring credit to this nomination contest or to
the Democratic Party,'' Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and
House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt said in a statement
distributed by the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who are all opposed to legal abortions, also have
been fighting over their commitment to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life PAC sent a mailing to New Hampshire
residents urging them not to vote for McCain, quoting an interview
McCain did with The Chronicle's Editorial Board last year in which
he said that Roe vs. Wade _ the landmark Supreme Court decision
that upheld a woman's constitutional right to abortion _ should not
be immediately repealed because it might force thousands of women
to undergo illegal and dangerous operations.
</P>
<P>
   McCain contradicted that position Sunday, saying the decision
should be reversed, and pointed to his 17-year voting record
against legal abortions. The attack, he said, is motivated by the
anti-abortion group's fear that his plan to reform campaign finance
laws would limit their influence.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thinks a win in California, where he trails
Bush by a 4-to-1 ratio, is the key to nomination, McCain noted that
there are 13 GOP contests on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the nomination will be decided on that day, and I
believe California is very key,'' McCain said on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was joined on Saturday by his father, the former
president, and brother, the governor of Florida, said he was
growing more confident about his prospects in New Hampshire, where
he has trailed McCain in the polls for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my chances,'' he said between stops.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates all ended their schedules early yesterday so as
not to bother voters during the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had an event on his schedule marked as a Super Bowl Party
with John Madden.
</P>
<P>
   No, his staff explained, it was not the popular sports
broadcaster and former Oakland Raiders coach. It was instead a
campaign contributor from Amherst, N.H.

 GORE, BRADLEY TRADE SHOTS AS CAMPAIGN GROWS INCREASINGLY BITTER  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ A tightening Democratic contest for president
turned increasingly bitter Sunday, as Vice President Al Gore called
his rival ``manipulative'' and former Sen. Bill Bradley accused
Gore of jumping ``in bed with special interests'' in the latest
election.
</P>
<P>
   The barbs, made during the final rallies before Tuesday's
first-in-the-nation primary, are rooted in disagreements over
campaign finances and Gore's record on abortion and have escalated
into the most personal and mean-spirited of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After months of low-key disputes over health care, gun control
and leadership style, the exchanges have left some Democratic party
leaders concerned that they might hurt the winner's chances of
defeating the Republican candidate in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bradley campaign has suddenly changed. Instead of the
promised character, courage and commitment, we have manipulative
attack after manipulative attack,'' Gore said in a spirited rally
before 1,000 supporters in Somersworth, N.H., where he aimed a
considerable portion of his remarks at his rival. ``Senator Bradley
is now stepping down to the level of personal vilification.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has faced renewed questions about his health,
appeared on ABC's ``This Week'' and called Gore and his fellow
Democrats' methods of raising money in the latest campaign
``disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we clean up our own house, Republicans are going to
clean our house in the fall,'' Bradley said.

Republican races tightening. A CNN /Gallup poll released Sunday

ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY FIGHTS LIGHT POLLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK WIEBE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISBURG, Kan. _ Most evenings at Powell Observatory in
Louisburg, Kan., a faintly orange, hazy glow appears above the
southern horizon about a mile from the observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Like dust in the eye, that glow is an irritant to the members of
the Astronomical Society of Kansas City, (Mo.) which operates the
observatory.
</P>
<P>
   The glow muddies the heavens. It makes deep space _ that part of
the night sky that harbors faint or nearly invisible stars and
galaxies millions of light-years away _ nearly impenetrable. And it
makes the observatory's 30-inch Newtonian telescope, one of the
most powerful in a five-state region, seem not so powerful after
all.
</P>
<P>
   That glow, that irritant, has a name: light pollution. And as
more houses are built, more roads and parking lots paved, the
Astronomical Society's members find themselves spending more time
educating the public about how light interferes with their view of
the skies. ``We're not anti-light,'' said Nick Ruess, the
observatory's director. ``We're just anti-irresponsible light.''
</P>
<P>
   All of us live with light pollution. To motorists it's the glare
from improperly shielded streetlights. To homeowners living near
parking lots or convenience stores it's the light that splashes
through their bedroom windows. To some pedestrians it's buildings
and parking lots that are lighted up like they are in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   But one person's light pollution could be another's security
blanket. When Kansas City voters approved a $110 million bond issue
in 1997 for new lights, they did so, in part, because they thought
it would make the streets safer.
</P>
<P>
   To Kansas City resident Steve Stroade, who lives just south of
the Country Club Plaza, the new 110-watt lamp across from his house
and the eight others on his block are a blessing. He not only feels
safer, but he also has a brighter path for taking evening walks to
the Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can appreciate concerns about light pollution,'' he said.
``But if I want to see the stars, I'll go to Colorado.''  &LR; brk:Dark
skies
</P>
<P>
   Ruess, the observatory director, is a 46-year-old amateur
astronomer who moved from Kansas City to south of Paola, Kan., in
his personal quest for darker skies. He says reducing light
pollution and fighting crime are not necessarily incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many crimes are committed in the sky,'' Ruess said.
``Having something that's going to detect a hang glider doesn't
make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Light pollution is essentially misdirected light. The
Astronomical Society, following guidelines set forth by
organizations such as the International Dark-Sky Association in
Tucson, Ariz., suggests several ways for redirecting that light.
The basic guidelines, though, are fairly simple:
</P>
<P>
   - Use only the amount of light you need and direct it on the
object that needs illumination, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   - To light a street, mount the lamp in a fixture that does not
allow light to shine skyward. Cities can do that, Ruess said, by
housing their lamps so the lenses or bulbs do not hang beneath the
fixture like a teardrop but are shielded with flat glass.
</P>
<P>
   - To make a parking lot or some other property secure, be
judicious in the number of watts you use.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the sky glow south of the observatory. Part of it comes
from the dozen or so 1,000-watt metal halide lamps that light the
parking lot of a Price Chopper grocery in Louisburg. Ruess said the
lamps were properly shielded. But they are so powerful that a pair
of good eyes can read fine print standing 100 feet away from the
nearest pole. The same light that allows you to read is bouncing
off the parking lot and into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   When the supermarket opened two years ago, the society took its
concerns to the store's managers. Upon hearing they had unwittingly
brightened the skies, the managers agreed to turn off the lights
after the store's 10 p.m. closing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, late most nights, the sky glow suddenly shrinks a bit.
 &LR; brk:Positive feedback
</P>
<P>
   Often, Ruess said, all it takes to mitigate the effects of light
pollution is a brief discussion about how changes can reduce energy
costs. A little positive feedback doesn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the society has begun awarding businesses and
governments for responsible lighting. One award went to Kansas City
Power &AMP; Light Co. for the lights it used at a site in southern
Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   Ruess also gives jurisdictions such as Miami County, Louisburg,
Overland Park, Johnson County and Kansas City credit for their
efforts to put up good streetlights or monitor the way various
businesses and developments light their properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who put up irresponsible lighting, they just don't
know,'' Ruess said. ``Given a choice between a good plan and a bad
plan, most people will choose the good. Even though the responsible
fixtures might cost more, it saves them money in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes compromises a little easier. For example:
</P>
<P>
   - When Louisburg built a ballpark adjacent to the observatory,
the city agreed to turn off the lights by 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   - Several years ago the McDonald's restaurant across from Price
Chopper voluntarily readjusted its parking lot lights, which were
mounted at an angle and allowed light to escape. A nearby Burger
King later followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   - After hearing concerns from the Astronomical Society, the
Miami County Planning Commission began referring developers and
engineers to the society for recommendations on how to prevent
light pollution.  &LR; brk:Solutions
</P>
<P>
   Changes like these have noticeably improved the skies south of
the observatory, Ruess said. But it would take more than a modest
education campaign to reduce the massive glow that comes from the
hundreds of thousands of lights the Kansas City area turns on every
night.
</P>
<P>
   Members say that when the society headed for darker skies,
moving its observatory from Swope Park to Louisburg in 1985, that
glow stretched about 20 degrees above the horizon. Today they
estimate that figure at 45 degrees. The society has no illusions:
Kansas City's sky glow probably will not get smaller, especially
when brighter lights are increasingly seen as a critical tool in
the fight against crime.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lee, manager of Kansas City's streetlight services, oversees
the city's $110 million light project. He is aware of the society's
concerns and believes the city is at least addressing some of them
by trying to provide uniform lighting with as little glare, or
``trespass,'' as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But he also knows that reaching that goal is not easy. ``It's a
complicated design problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the first lights went up, the city has either
upgraded or installed 25,000 streetlights. When the job is done,
the city will have upgraded or installed about 73,000 lights.
</P>
<P>
   As the new lights go up, many of the older ones that used
energy-wasting mercury vapor lamps have come down, replaced by more
efficient and longer-lasting high-pressure sodium lamps.
</P>
<P>
   Wide, main thoroughfares are getting 250- and 400-watt lamps
with full, cutoff lenses that reduce glare and prevent most of the
light from escaping into the sky. Residential streets are getting
100-watt lamps with semicutoff lenses. Lee said the city could have
gone with completely shielded lamps in residential areas, but that
would have required the city to put up more fixtures and spend more
money in its quest for uniform lighting.
</P>
<P>
   The partly shielded lamps are not the perfect solution, Ruess
said, adding that the city's streetlights were a ``drop in the
bucket'' when compared to all the lights that contribute to the
area's sky glow.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Ruess and his colleagues will continue
monitoring the skies and pressing for more responsible lighting.
``I've got hope,'' he said. ``Some good can come from our
efforts.''

WICHITA MAN HAS $1,000 AND A YEN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. _ Vice President Al Gore may have the prestige of
Air Force Two.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush may have scads of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Oyler, though, has a Web site and a dream.
</P>
<P>
   And because Oyler, a Wichita engineer, also had $1,000 to spare,
his name will appear on the Republican ballot in the New Hampshire
presidential primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's right: Tom Oyler is running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Men like Gore and Bush _ with money and experience _ may get
most of the publicity. But there are 30 persons on the ballot in
New Hampshire this year. That's fewer than in recent elections _
more than 60 presidential candidates signed up in 1992, and 45 ran
in 1996 _ but still a lot more than the six Republicans and two
Democrats you see in debates and on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   The 22 others are the so-called ``fringe candidates.'' They may
not have much hope of winning. But like the more mainstream
candidates, they paid the $1,000 filing fee to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, they are a welcome part of the political
landscape, said former Gov. Hugh Gregg, the primary's unofficial
historian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them have a serious interest in some message they want
to deliver,'' Gregg said. ``They know they're probably not going to
get elected. They should be treated well because their hearts are
in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Oyler is 54, a bookish, graying little man with big,
friendly eyes and an easy smile. Like a smallish Fred MacMurray.
</P>
<P>
   He lives alone in Wichita in a trim little yellow-brick ranch
house that he inherited from his parents. He has a 70-acre farm
outside of town where he raises hay he sells to local farmers. He
smokes cigars and drinks, by his estimate, about one beer a year.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly he keeps to himself. Seemingly, an everyman.
</P>
<P>
   Except that beneath his placid demeanor boils a cauldron of
contempt for the federal government and the cookie-cutter
candidates he sees vying for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is, the common good is individual liberties,''
Oyler said. ``None of the other candidates, except maybe Alan
Keyes, has brought up the question of reducing the size of the
federal government. Even George Bush's education proposals would
expand the bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Oyler touts that smaller-government message on his Web site,
which he has dubbed ``The Dissenter.'' The site features editorials
dripping with sarcasm about the government, plus biographical
information on the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen, senators and President Clinton have been subjected
to the wrath of his tartly worded letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent a letter to Clinton about nine months ago,'' Oyler
said. ``He was giving away money right and left. I asked him for
$243,000 as long as he was giving money away. That was the first
estimate on the house I wanted to build. He never answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, lots of people have Web sites. Lots of people write angry
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Most don't spend $1,000 on a bid for president.
</P>
<P>
   Oyler whetted his political appetite with two U.S. Senate runs.
In 1996, he finished third of four candidates in the GOP primary,
with 23,266 votes. In 1998, Oyler got 11,545 votes as the
Libertarian Party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Oyler, who works at the Boeing company's sprawling plant in
Wichita, decided to take the big plunge this year after a
conversation at work in which colleagues derided the well-known
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest question people ask me is, `Why?' &UR; '' Oyler said.
``I don't know. Some days I think it's some kind of noble cause.
Other days, it's just that the guys who are running make me mad. I
can't give you a straight answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, running for president is kind of neat.
</P>
<P>
   Oyler's boss whistles ``Hail to the Chief'' when he passes
Oyler's desk. And, Oyler reports, his family is ``proud as punch.
Nobody's ridiculed me.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not likely anybody in New Hampshire would either, Gregg
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's taught they can grow up to be president,'' Gregg
said. ``We really honor that tradition here. We listen to people
you've never heard of, like Jimmy Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that it's so easy to get on the state's primary ballot.
Most states require signed petitions from a certain number of
voters. In New Hampshire, all it takes is $1,000. Candidates can
mail their checks, so there's no need to even go to the state.
</P>
<P>
   So the fringe flocks to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Call them the political progeny of Harold Stassen, the one-time
Minnesota governor who went from legitimate contender to national
joke during his record seven New Hampshire primary campaigns.
Stassen last ran in 1992, garnering 206 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Harold,'' Gregg said. ``He ran in New Hampshire
because it was a place he could express his views and people would
hear him. Some of his views might be a little far out, but people
listened.''
</P>
<P>
   Oyler hasn't been to New Hampshire for any one-on-one
campaigning (``I'm not really Mr. Social.'').
</P>
<P>
   He runs the campaign from the spare bedroom where he keeps his
computer. He answers e-mail and sends his editorials to newspapers
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   And he figures his campaign slogan _ ``Better Than None of the
Above'' _ might attract some folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you figure, 40 percent of the people are actually
going to vote?'' Oyler asked. ``So 60 percent of the people don't
vote or are fed up or don't think their vote matters. They're
essentially voting for none of the above. I wanted to find a way to
get to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oyler is realistic. He hasn't really bothered to plot a
post-New Hampshire strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have a chance, it's slim,'' he conceded wistfully as he
eased back in his favorite chair, the one with the faded flower
pattern. ``Maybe I can influence the election just by bringing up
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a pebble in the water...you know, a ripple can make
a wave.''

   &UR; THE CRIME OF SHEILA McGOUGH &LR;  By Janet Malcolm. Vintage, $12. A
rigorously intelligent journalist chronicles the drama of a
disbarred lawyer who claims she was framed but who may have been
the victim of her own relentless honesty, blinkered loyalty and
poor storytelling skills. ``No other writer tells better stories
about the perpetual, the unwinnable, battle between narrative and
truth,'' Margaret Talbot wrote in The New York Times Book Review in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EMPRESS OF THE SPLENDID SEASON &LR;  By Oscar Hijuelos.
HarperPerennial, $13. Lydia Espana, the heroine of this tender
novel by the author of ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,'' is a
romantic Cuban emigre who is forced by the death of her prosperous
husband to become a cleaning lady for wealthy New Yorkers. As she
navigates between two alien worlds, she struggles to reconcile her
instinct for self-invention with her inability to invent a suitable
self. ``The New York that emerges in this novel is as layered as
Lydia's inner life, as infused with meaning,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg
wrote last year. ``The city both echoes and shapes her moods.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BRAZILIAN ADVENTURE &LR;  By Peter Fleming. Northwestern University,
$16.95. In this Pythonesque 1933 travelogue, Fleming (a literary
editor and brother of Ian) recounts his voyage with a bunch of
squabbling Brits in search of a missing explorer deep in the
Brazilian jungle. His acerbic account of their ``hilarious safari''
is ``full of rich, rare and entertaining reading,'' C.G. Poore
wrote.

   &UR; SONNY LISTON WAS A FRIEND OF MINE: Stories &LR;  By Thom Jones. Back
Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95. The author's third collection of short
fiction features his usual gallery of lost souls and hard-luck
cases, many of whom are given to esoteric drug use because the
world has failed them. Each story is ``a raw, adrenalinized chunk
of conflicted emotion and barely suppressed rage,'' Dwight Garner
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KADDISH &LR;  By Leon Wieseltier. Vintage, $15. The author's journal
of the year in which he formally mourned his father is also a
deeply personal meditation on rabbinical tradition and the
relevance of sacred Judaic texts to his own life. The result ``is
an astonishing fusion of learning and psychic intensity,'' Harold
Bloom wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVELING MERCIES: Some Thoughts on Faith &LR; , by Anne Lamott
(Anchor, $13), is a collection of exuberant essays tracking the
author's rocky search for spiritual faith. ``Lamott is a narrator
who has relished and soaked up the details of her existence,
equally of mirth and devastation ... and spilled them onto her
pages,'' Alexandra Hall said last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SCAPEGOAT &LR;  By Daphne du Maurier. University of
Pennsylvania, $15.95. An unhappy British teacher meets his physical
double in a French bar, is drugged and wakes up to find that the
stranger has exchanged their clothing and documents, leaving him
little choice but to slip into another identity. Big mistake: It
turns out his alter ego had plenty to escape. In 1957 the reviewer
Anthony Boucher called this a ``magnificent thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE HOUSE ON THE STRAND &LR; 
($15.95), in which a rootless former editor becomes addicted to a
potion that allows him to commute between contemporary and
14th-century Cornwall. His own life soon pales in comparison with
the medieval drama. The result is ``prime du Maurier,'' David
Dempsey wrote in 1969. ``Her skill in finessing the time shifts is
enough to make one want to try a little of the brew himself.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FREDY NEPTUNE: A Novel in Verse &LR;  By Les Murray. Farrar, Straus
&AMP; Giroux, $14. This verse novel, which unfolds in relaxed
eight-line stanzas, is about an Australian sailor who loses the
ability to feel pain and drifts through the horrors of the 20th
century. The result is ``a haunting, loving, fiercely democratic
epic by a master poet,'' Ruth Padel wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``YOU AIN'T HEARD NOTHIN' YET.'' The American Talking Film:
History &AMP; Memory, 1927-1949 &LR;  By Andrew Sarris. Oxford University,
$18.95. This free-form collection of notes and essays by a seasoned
film critic known for his missionary zeal is less a history than a
personal tour of the images he encountered on the screen. ``The
prose is full of bounce and opinion ... and plenty of finely flung
allusions,'' Michael Wood wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of
Slavery &LR;  By Henry Mayer. St. Martin's Griffin, $18.95. This
dramatic biography seeks to re-establish the Boston abolitionist
newspaper editor as a major figure in 19th-century history who
wielded the power of a biblical prophet. ``Much of the narrative is
fluently and fascinatingly rendered,'' Carla Davidson wrote in
1998. ``Mayer has an especially strong sense of place.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SANDGLASS &LR;  By Romesh Gunesekera. Riverhead, $12.95. This
densely plotted tale focuses on two warring families in Sri Lanka
whose rift echoes the often violent divide between the country's
Sinhalese and Tamil peoples. Last year the reviewer Jacqueline
Carey called it ``an important novel.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Jan. 30, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CAMPAIGN-REVIEW (Nashua, N.H.) _ Bill Clinton is casting
a large shadow over this presidential race, and may cast one over
the next presidency. So as the New Hampshire primary nears, the
main candidates are trying a delicate balancing act: running
against Clinton's scandalous persona while not straying too far
from the political center he has defined in seven turbulent years
in office. By Alison Mitchell. (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-ISLAM-REVIEW (UNdated) _ Iranians are anguished after a
generation under ``the government of God'' and yearn for change.
Having wrested power from the shah in 1979 and created an
intolerant, often vengeful theocratic state that has ruined Iran's
economy, sponsored terrorist groups and left the country profoundly
isolated, most Shiite clerics are now widely unpopular. By John F.
Burns. (Moved in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SUBURBAN-SPRAWL-REVIEW (Undated) _ There has been subtle but
fundamental shift in the way major public works projects are
conceived, promoted and packaged: Sprawl has become a dirty word.
When the dividends trumpeted in the 1950s turned out to have their
own costs, officials and planners had to change their vocabularies.
Rather than proclaim the merits of suburban development and car
travel, they are framing new road projects in cautious, modest
terms, often coupled with ideas for mass transit and relief of
traffic congestion. Al Gore has made such initiatives a centerpiece
of his campaign. By David Chen. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-VOTING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Unlike established companies
that make traditional voting machines and maintain low public
profiles, startup companies that produce Internet voting software
are issuing press releases, placing their members on state advisory
boards, lobbying legislatures and persuading party officials that
trials in Internet voting would bring national attention to their
pet issues. But not everyone sees e-voting as a portal to a more
democratic future. By Rebecca Fairley Raney.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-DEFENSE-REVIEW (Washington) _ Politics, both domestic
and international, is driving the Clinton administration's
divergent public-private views on missile defenses. At stake are
not only U.S. defenses against new 21st-century menaces, and
whether the technology is ready to field, but also relations with
Russia, China and staunch European allies, all of whom are alarmed
by Washington's push to build a system. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   SNACKS-PERSONALITIES-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Snack Food
Association and the National Potato Promotion Board have
commissioned a study linking people's snack preferences with their
personality types. Surprise: People who inhale potato chips aren't
necessarily porcine gluttons but ``ambitious, successful, high
achievers.'' And cheese doodle lovers aren't slobs with orange
fingers but ``formal, always proper, conscientious, principled.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP-TAXCUTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Republicans try to decide
whether to bank on tax cuts once again as the best policy and the
best electoral strategy for winning the White House. For the first
time since 1980, the conservative orthodoxy on tax cuts in being
challenged from within the GOP. The challenger is John McCain, who
has attacked George W. Bush's plan in language redolent both of
old-style fiscal conservatism and Democratic class warfare. By
Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   TRADITIONS-SCIENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Much indigenous or
traditional knowledge has been found to have a sound scientific
basis. In agriculture, nutrition, medicine and other fields, modern
research is showing why traditional peoples do the things they do.
By Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-ITALY-REVIEW (Berlin) _ The Christian Democrats in
Germany and Italy are crumbling in tandem. And it is not just the
Sicilian echoes of Helmut Kohl's behavior that has summoned Italy
into the midst of Germany's political crisis. The difficulties of
German Christian Democracy inevitably invite parallels with those
of Italy's Democrazia Cristiana, a party whose utter dominance of
post-war Italian politics was matched only by the unutterable speed
of its disintegration in the early 1990s. The similarities are
intriguing. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   MYANMAR-TWINS-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Up Next, The Burma Shavers.''
What if Johnny and Luther Htoo, the 12-year-old twins who lead a
fundamentalist Christian rebel group in Myanmar, were to appear on
American television? By Bruce Kluger.

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

criticism from publishing houses.)

TESTING A MISSILE AND A TREATY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a missile failed to hit a mock warhead high
over the Pacific Ocean two weeks ago, the Clinton administration
rushed to slough off this setback to its plans to protect the
country against missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to the development of a limited national
missile defense system designed to counter emerging threats from
rogue states,'' said David Leavy, spokesman for the National
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, many administration officials were relieved.
The near-miss might give President Clinton reason to delay his
decision on whether to break ground on the system. ``The case is
now easier to make that the decision is not ripe,'' said one
Defense Department official.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that in an election year, politics
_ both domestic and international _ are driving the
administration's divergent public-private views on missile
defenses. At stake are not only America's defenses against new
21st-century menaces, but also the nation's relationship with a
host of other countries, all of whom are alarmed by Washington's
push to build a system that would violate the landmark 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which bars national defenses. The
prospect of such a system has made Russia jittery, China suspicious
and America's staunchest European allies resentful.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has always been ambivalent about such
a system, arguing for years that the threat did not warrant
spending billions of dollars on unproven technology, which had its
origins in the vaunted Star Wars proposal of the Reagan years. But
the White House did an abrupt about-face in mid-1998 after two
things happened. First, a bipartisan commission headed by Donald
Rumsfeld, a Republican and former defense secretary, warned that
within five years North Korea and Iran could conceivably reach the
United States with long-range missiles. Then, six weeks later, as
if on cue, North Korea took U.S. intelligence analysts by surprise
by testing a three-stage missile with perhaps enough range to hit
North America.
</P>
<P>
   By early last year, the White House was pledging its conditional
support and $10.5 billion over six years to a limited system. Last
summer Clinton signed into law the National Missile Defense Act,
which requires the United States to field a defense against a
limited missile strike when such a response is technologically
feasible. By year's end, the administration added another $2.2
billion over five years to the program, and promised that Clinton
would decide sometime this summer whether it was feasible to deploy
a system that would be ready by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   No one is talking about a return to the space-based,
rocket-zapping shield that President Reagan proposed 17 years ago
during the Cold War. Today's threat comes not from a barrage of
Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles but from rogue states
like Iran and North Korea, which could lob a warhead or two into
San Francisco or Anchorage. To combat that, the administration is
considering a scaled-down system of ground-based radars,
space-based sensors and 100 interceptors that could destroy a
handful of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents and supporters of missile defenses are watching the
calendar closely. The Pentagon has one more chance, in late April
or early May, to prove that the technology works before a formal
military review of the system begins in June. To protect the
political flank of Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
front-runner in the presidential race, the administration is
sticking to Clinton's schedule to decide this summer, based on that
review.
</P>
<P>
   But the missile-defense issue is causing an uproar overseas,
including in Russia, America's main nuclear rival, whose nuclear
stockpile is declining. Moscow has threatened to stop reducing its
7,000-warhead arsenal if Washington breaks out of the ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright begins talks Monday in
Moscow in part to convince the Russians to make modest change as in
the treaty to allow national missile defenses against limited
attacks. But Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said U.S.
negotiators face ``an uphill slog'' in persuading the Russians that
even that limited goal will not undercut Russia's nuclear
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   European allies are worried about their own security as well as
the fate of the landmark pact. ``The ABM Treaty is a cornerstone of
the international order in arms control,'' said K. Erik Tygesen,
Denmark's ambassador to Washington. To field an integrated system,
Washington would need Danish approval to use a ground radar station
in Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   And China says tinkering with the treaty could have disastrous
consequences. ``Amending it in search of national missile defense
will tip the global balance, trigger a new arms race and jeopardize
world and regional stability,'' Sha Zukang, director of arms
control and disarmament in China's foreign ministry, wrote recently
in the official newspaper China Daily.
</P>
<P>
   With so many questions, many Democrats and even Republicans who
support missile defenses are urging Clinton to let the next
administration decide. ``I think a new president and his team
should make the call on this,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who
supports missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, of course, has been hedging its bets all
along. Clinton will base his decision on four factors: the threat
to the United States, the cost of the technology, whether the
technology works and the impact on arms-control agreements. Each
factor is essentially an escape hatch, though two of them already
appear closed. Intelligence analysts say the threat is real; the
cost has become less of an issue now with large federal budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Which means this spring's test of the technology and the impact
on strategic relations are pivotal. Conservatives argue that this
month's test was not a failure at all, and follows a successful one
last October. ``We test because we expect to find problems and try
to solve them,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., a staunch
missile-defense supporter. ``This technology is not just within our
reach but is actually in our grasp now.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there's enough doubt the technology will not work, Moscow
is likely to agree to only the most modest changes to the treaty.
And barring some new unforeseen threat, no one expects Clinton to
make withdrawal from the treaty part of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians don't want a deal until they think we're really,
no kidding, going to go ahead with this,'' said one senior Pentagon
official. ``The failed test is one more indication that we're not
ready.''

ELECTION TIME IN IRAN: IN ISLAM'S STATE, AN ISLAMIC CRY FOR
CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he arrived at the shop of a specialist in old Islamic
scripts in Tehran, the mullah, about 40, was neatly bearded in the
way of the college-educated Shiite clerics. But he was dressed in a
business suit, not his cleric's attire, and he was flustered.
</P>
<P>
   Late for his appointment, he explained that he had waited in the
street in his white turban, black cloak and collarless white shirt,
and had seen a dozen empty taxis pass. So he returned home and
changed to a suit, and the next taxi picked him up. But the driver,
eyeing his fare's salt-and-pepper beard in the mirror, asked,
``You're a mullah, aren't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well yes, I must confess that I am,'' the mullah said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd realized that when I first saw you,'' the driver said,
``I wouldn't have stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the unhappy man tell his story a couple of months ago,
it seemed like an apt metaphor for the troubled times confronting
Iran's 180,000 Muslim clerics. Having wrested power from Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1979 and created an intolerant, often
vengeful theocratic state that has ruined Iran's economy, sponsored
terrorist groups abroad and left the country profoundly isolated,
the clerics are now widely unpopular among Iran's 65 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it is not uncommon to hear Iranians whisper the
shah's name with shades of nostalgia, even reverence. ``God bless
the shah!'' they will tell a foreigner, glancing about nervously as
they tour the preserved magnificence inside Neyavaran Palace in
Tehran, just below the field from which the shah boarded a
helicopter on his way into his final exile. This is not to say that
Iranians have forgotten, much less forgiven, the brutality of the
shah's secret police, his modernizer's insensitivity to Iran's
1,350-year embrace of Islam or the corruption he tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it is a measure of how anguished Iranians have become
after nearly a generation under ``the government of God,'' and of
their desperate yearning for change. On Feb. 18, they will have an
opportunity to register their sentiments in a parliamentary
election, the sixth since 1979 but the first in which the
alienation engendered by the mullahs has resolved into a coalition
capable of winning the legislature. Reformers already claim the
Iranian presidency, which Mohammed Khatami won in the 1997 election
with 69 percent of the 29 million votes cast. That success was
repeated in a sweep of municipal elections last February.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, 53, was not always a challenger of the regime's
orthodoxies. Son of a leading ayatollah, and a senior cleric
himself, he was a close aide to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader
of the Islamic revolution. But like Mikhail Gorbachev, the
reform-oriented Soviet leader with whom he is sometimes compared,
his experiences persuaded him that the system could survive only if
it responded to the people's democratic yearnings. To hard-line
clerics, remembering Gorbachev's fate, only oblivion beckons in the
attempt to graft the political ideals of democratic liberalism onto
the ancient beliefs of Islam. But many thousands of mullahs,
alarmed by what might happen if the popular discontent is not
assuaged, have joined Khatami's crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the president, since his election, has had a
difficult two and a half years. His powers under the Islamic
constitution are nominal compared with those of the ``supreme
leader,'' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who inherited the mantle but not
the charisma or religious authority of Khomeini. And Khamenei has
shown less flexibility, in some ways, than Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was an absolute ruler, and approved much of the
cruel repression that accompanied the Islamic takeover, Khomeini
repeatedly warned his fellow clerics not to lose touch with popular
opinion. But under Khamenei, the hierarchy has been archly
selective in ignoring the parts of the Khomeini legacy that might
embarrass them, especially warnings about clerical dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Since he inherited the supreme leader's position in 1989,
Khamenei has rested his authority on a rigid interpretation of a
concept written into the constitution, velayat-i-faqih, the
guardianship of the religious jurist.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the faqih was a cleric learned enough to render
binding interpretations on religious matters. But Khamenei and
conservative clerics have taken the concept as endowing the
clerical hierarchy, through the supreme leader, with the Islamic
equivalent of the divine right of kings. Last week, responding to
reformers who say that the people are sovereign and that the
supreme leader is bound by the constitution and the laws, Khamenei
said the true meaning of velayat-i-faqih is that ``the person in
charge of the Islamic government does not make mistakes and if he
does he will not be the supreme leader from that moment.''

ELECTION TIME IN IRAN: IN ISLAM'S STATE, AN ISLAMIC CRY FOR
CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he arrived at the shop of a specialist in old Islamic
scripts in Tehran, the mullah, about 40, was neatly bearded in the
way of the college-educated Shiite clerics. But he was dressed in a
business suit, not his cleric's attire, and he was flustered.
</P>
<P>
   Late for his appointment, he explained that he had waited in the
street in his white turban, black cloak and collarless white shirt,
and had seen a dozen empty taxis pass. So he returned home and
changed to a suit, and the next taxi picked him up. But the driver,
eyeing his fare's salt-and-pepper beard in the mirror, asked,
``You're a mullah, aren't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well yes, I must confess that I am,'' the mullah said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd realized that when I first saw you,'' the driver said,
``I wouldn't have stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the unhappy man tell his story a couple of months ago,
it seemed like an apt metaphor for the troubled times confronting
Iran's 180,000 Muslim clerics. Having wrested power from Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1979 and created an intolerant, often
vengeful theocratic state that has ruined Iran's economy, sponsored
terrorist groups abroad and left the country profoundly isolated,
the clerics are now widely unpopular among Iran's 65 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it is not uncommon to hear Iranians whisper the
shah's name with shades of nostalgia, even reverence. ``God bless
the shah!'' they will tell a foreigner, glancing about nervously as
they tour the preserved magnificence inside Neyavaran Palace in
Tehran, just below the field from which the shah boarded a
helicopter on his way into his final exile. This is not to say that
Iranians have forgotten, much less forgiven, the brutality of the
shah's secret police, his modernizer's insensitivity to Iran's
1,350-year embrace of Islam or the corruption he tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it is a measure of how anguished Iranians have become
after nearly a generation under ``the government of God,'' and of
their desperate yearning for change. On Feb. 18, they will have an
opportunity to register their sentiments in a parliamentary
election, the sixth since 1979 but the first in which the
alienation engendered by the mullahs has resolved into a coalition
capable of winning the legislature. Reformers already claim the
Iranian presidency, which Mohammed Khatami won in the 1997 election
with 69 percent of the 29 million votes cast. That success was
repeated in a sweep of municipal elections last February.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, 53, was not always a challenger of the regime's
orthodoxies. Son of a leading ayatollah, and a senior cleric
himself, he was a close aide to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader
of the Islamic revolution. But like Mikhail Gorbachev, the
reform-oriented Soviet leader with whom he is sometimes compared,
his experiences persuaded him that the system could survive only if
it responded to the people's democratic yearnings. To hard-line
clerics, remembering Gorbachev's fate, only oblivion beckons in the
attempt to graft the political ideals of democratic liberalism onto
the ancient beliefs of Islam. But many thousands of mullahs,
alarmed by what might happen if the popular discontent is not
assuaged, have joined Khatami's crusade.

   Predictably, the president, since his election, has had a

constitution are nominal compared with those of the ``supreme

the charisma or religious authority of Khomeini. And Khamenei has

   Many scholars specializing in Iran find in the opposing views an
illuminating echo of the arguments that flowed in 17th- and
18th-century Europe, when Western concepts of democracy were forged
on the anvil of the Reformation and the Enlightenment. In England,
when Charles I insisted on his divine right to rule and Oliver
Cromwell declared the sovereign rights of the people, as
represented by Parliament, it took a civil war to settle the
matter, and the king's severed head was part of the price paid for
parliamentary democracy. The ideas born then were central, later,
in America's revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But where Iran scholars find the European and American
experience most instructive is in the theological debate that
underlay the political evolution _ the way in which men like Thomas
Hobbes and John Locke found sanction for their ideas in a
reinterpretation of the Bible. Today, it is tempting for Westerners
to think that Iran could emerge from its bitter experience of the
past 20 years as a secular republic _ a Turkey, perhaps. But most
people who know Iran well say that however the immediate political
struggle comes out, what lies ahead will be an Islamic republic _
albeit, perhaps, a more civil and gentle one than the mullahs have
built so far.
</P>
<P>
   Many Iranians would have it otherwise. But most accept that
political change, to be stable in a country where faith is a
pervasive fact of life, will have to come from a redefinition
within Islam of the relationship between state and religion. It
will not, they say, come from a separation of church and state that
leaves the mullahs as voiceless in temporal matters as they were
under the shah. Pressed, many Iranians will cite Turkey as proof.
However secular its system, it still has had sharp challenges in
recent years from resurgent Islamism.
</P>
<P>
   This, in fact, is the message of Khatami. Although he is the
author of a best-selling book that discusses the merits of Locke,
Hobbes and Montesquieu, he has never disguised that his democratic,
pluralist, tolerant principles would find expression within a body
politic that had Islam at its core. Addressing the throngs who mob
him everywhere, he invariably returns to the Koran and his belief
that the prophet's teachings rested, at base, on the need for
dialogue and consent among the governed.
</P>
<P>
   In the parliamentary election, Khamenei and his allies, having
used their powers to disqualify scores of reformist candidates, may
yet hold the reformers at bay. But whatever the vote's outcome,
Iran's political struggle will still hold the attention of all who
care about the world's 1 billion Muslims. For if Iran, the fount of
modern Islamic militancy, can find a way to reconcile the ancient
beliefs of Islam and its people's yearnings for freedom, the lesson
will not stop at Iran's borders. It can be expected to ripple
outward across the 53 Muslim nations that have been notable
absentees, so far, from the rise of democracy that followed the
collapse of the Berlin Wall.

`DON KOHLEONE' AND GERMANY FACE OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Helmut Kohl has a new nickname: ``Don Kohleone.'' And
no wonder. First the former German chancellor said he had always
regarded ``close personal trust'' as the most important thing in
political life. Then he placed his ``honor'' above the law. Finally
he resorted to ``omerta,'' the Sicilian word for silence, refusing
to reveal the names of people who secretly gave large sums of money
to his Christian Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just Kohl's behavior that has summoned Italy into
the midst of Germany's political crisis. The difficulties of German
Christian Democracy inevitably invite comparison with those of
Italy's Democrazia Cristiana, a party whose utter dominance of
postwar Italian politics was matched only by the unutterable speed
of its disintegration in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities are intriguing. Both parties were founded in
the immediate postwar years with strong American support to
represent the center-right and act as a bulwark against communism.
Italy's Communists were within, the strongest such party in Western
Europe; Germany's Communists were without, across the border in
East Germany. Neither could be allowed to defeat Washington's
efforts to forge a Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties presided over postwar economic miracles,
underwritten by the Marshall Plan, which were intended to ensure
political and social stability. ``No Experiments'' and ``Affluence
for Everybody'' were the famous slogans with which Germany's
Christian Democrats marched to victory after victory. Italy's
Christian Democratic Party, octopuslike, famously dragged every
non-Communist political grouping toward its amorphous heart in
order to make itself the unavoidable epicenter of power.
</P>
<P>
   Then, abruptly, the two parties triumphed in their central
missions. The Cold War was won. Italian communism, long since
westernized, ceased to be a threat and Kohl's party presided over
the disappearance of Germany's communist state and its absorption
into a unified nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reunification was the ultimate raison d'etre of the Christian
Democratic Union,'' said Claus Leggewie, a political analyst. ``So
it is legitimate to ask why the party should have any more reason
for survival after unity than Italian Christian Democracy after the
taming of Italian communism.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Kohl's party has been doing a fair job of trying to
put itself out of business. Article 21 of the German constitution,
to which Kohl swore allegiance, is clear on the subject of
political parties: ``Their internal organization must conform to
democratic principles. They must publicly account for the sources
of their funds.'' But Kohl continues to refuse to identify large
donors to whom he says he promised anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt that the discovery of a system of secret
funding for Kohl's party involving tens of millions of dollars has
shaken Germany, but not to the degree that the wave of scandals
known as ``Tangentopoli'' rocked Italy and led to the downfall of
Italy's Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our historic merit was to keep Italy within Western democracy
and face down the largest Communist party in Europe,'' said Mino
Martinazzoli, a former Christian Democratic defense minister in
Italy and the man who ultimately dissolved the party in 1994. ``But
our merit was also our failing, because once our historic role was
over, it became apparent how absolutely our stranglehold on power
had corrupted us. There could be no political change, and so we
became a party above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   That has not been the case in Germany, where the Christian
Democrats have governed for most of the postwar years, but by no
means all of them. The Social Democrats also governed, notably from
1969 to 1982. Moreover, the corruption thus far uncovered in
Germany is scarcely comparable to the system put in place by
Democrazia Cristiana.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian system involved huge bribes or kickbacks on every
public contract in northern Italy, and the purchase of votes in the
south through the delivery of money to well-placed ``friends,''
some of them with evident ties to the Mafia. In this way,
corruption was raised to a method of government as standard as
tax-collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italian Christian Democracy was not just corrupt in the sense
that corruption was a by-product of power,'' said Patrick McCarthy,
dean of the Johns Hopkins Center for European Studies in Bologna.
``Their corruption was power. They put in place a highly organized
method of corruption that was systemic. I do not see that in
Germany, at least not at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Another basic difference is that the U.S. interest in sustaining
the Italian party once the Cold War was won was limited, whereas
U.S. concern over a possible disintegration of German Christian
Democracy is intense. ``Germany absolutely needs Christian
Democracy,'' said one senior official here.
</P>
<P>
   The party has played an essential role in reining in more
nationalist or extremist right-wing German tendencies, and that
role is by no means exhausted. The rise of Joerg Haider and his
Freedom Party in Austria, offering a simmering brew of
anti-immigrant rhetoric, has illustrated that Europe's combination
of aging populations and high unemployment may offer plenty of
opportunity for rightward drift.
</P>
<P>
   All of Germany's political parties _ including Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats _ are aware of this. The rise
of Gianfranco Fini's post-Fascist party in Italy after the collapse
of Christian Democracy there was one thing; it would be altogether
another in a German guise. It is certain that a great deal of
energy, within Germany and in Washington, will be focused on
ensuring that the party weathers the storm.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, its success will depend on its ability to change
faster than Italian Christian Democracy. A new generation of
leaders is certainly needed, as well as a recognition that
stability is not the only political virtue in a post-Cold War
world. New party laws are needed to bring greater transparency to
financing and ensure that nobody can remain party chairman, as Kohl
did, for a quarter-century. Germany's restive mood may in the end
demand that the office of chancellor _ held by Kohl for 16 years _
also be limited, perhaps to two four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis of German Christian Democracy has become a crisis of
Germany's ability to modernize itself. Few wish to envisage that
modernization without Kohl's party, and so it will almost certainly
survive.

   Each June for at least the last four centuries, farmers in 12
mountain villages in Peru and Bolivia follow a ritual that
Westerners might think odd, if not crazy. Late each night for about
a week, the farmers observe the stars in the Pleiades
constellation, which is low on the horizon to the northeast. If
they appear big and bright, the farmers know to plant their potato
crop at the usual time four months later. But if the stars are dim,
the usual planting will be delayed for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now Western researchers have applied the scientific method to
this seeming madness. Poring over reams of satellite data on cloud
cover and water vapor, Professor Benjamin Orlove, an anthropologist
at the University of California at Davis, and colleagues have
discovered that these star-gazing farmers are accurate long-range
weather forecasters. High wisps of cirrus clouds dim the stars in
El Nino years, which brings reduced rainfall to that part of the
Andes. In such drought conditions, it makes sense to plant potatoes
as late as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Orlove's work, which was reported in January in the British
journal Nature, is just the latest example of indigenous or
traditional knowledge that has been found to have a sound
scientific basis. In agriculture, nutrition, medicine and other
fields, modern research is showing why people maintain their
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Masai of East Africa, who are famous for the kind of
high-fat diet, rich in meat and milk, that would make a
cardiologist swoon. Timothy Johns, a professor at McGill University
in Montreal and director of the Center for Indigenous Peoples'
Nutrition and Environment, has long studied the Masai to determine
how they stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Masai add the roots and barks of certain plants, including a
species of acacia high in antioxidants, Johns said. They also chew
a natural gum, related to myrrh, that helps to break down fats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a magic bullet protecting the Masai against heart
disease,'' he said. ``But there is a benefit from what they are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 study, two Cornell University researchers analyzed the
spices used in 36 countries and found a correlation between average
temperature and cooking with spices like cumin, turmeric, ginger
and chili peppers, all of which have antimicrobial properties. The
hotter the climate, the hotter the food _ in part, at least, to
keep it from spoiling.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the benefits of traditional knowledge are
not so obvious to those outside the culture. In Bali in the 1970s,
the Indonesian government, persuaded by international advocates of
the ``green revolution,'' forced rice farmers adopt new growing
schemes. Among other things, the farmers were made to stop their
centuries-old ritual of meeting in small groups at a series of
water temples set at the forks of rivers, to negotiate seasonal
schedules for flooding their paddies.
</P>
<P>
   The new techniques resulted in disaster. Farmers were pressured
to plant as often as possible. With little coordination of
irrigation, water shortages and pest infestation were the norm.
</P>
<P>
   At about this time, J. Stephen Lansing, an American
anthropologist, began to study the water temples. What he found,
which was supported later by computer modeling, was that the old
system was quite sophisticated and efficient, encouraging
cooperation among thousands of farmers. Water was shared and
controlled through a process involving reciprocal altruism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets more rice and variation in harvest disappears,
so there's no reason to be envious of your neighbors,'' said
Lansing, who now teaches at the University of Arizona. ``It's a
bottom-up system of management that's worked very well.'' The green
revolution, he added, ``was very much top down.'' The traditional
system has been re-established.
</P>
<P>
   Orlove has studied similar traditional resource management
around Lake Titicaca, on the border between Bolivia and Peru. A
distinctive feature of the lake is the reeds growing in its
shallows. The people around the lake use them for rafts and
livestock feed, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a major component of the household economy,'' said
Orlove. The residents replant the reeds, which also serve as a
spawning ground for some of the 22 species of fish that are unique
to the lake.
</P>
<P>
   But indigenous knowledge can be faulty. ``Traditional people
sometimes get things right, and sometimes get them wrong,'' said
Alan Fiske, a psychological anthropologist at the University of
California at Los Angeles. ``Some things people do are bad for
them.'' Other anthropologists have challenged the notion that all
indigenous groups have somehow developed a blissful oneness with
their world.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Fiske noted, is that verifying traditional
knowledge is not easy. The scientific method can be expensive, and
data can be difficult to obtain. Orlove's research on the potato
farmers would have been impossible even 10 years ago, because the
type of satellite data he needed did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a shortage of data, but there's no shortage of
traditional knowledge that awaits possible confirmation by science.
James Lynch, an American scientist who has spent the past two
decades helping Costa Rican farmers, said he has learned from them
the importance of timing. A tree cut down during a new moon, he
said, will quickly be ravaged by the insects, while one felled
several days before a full moon will stay free of termites for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch now follows the practice. ``But I've never seen any
scientific study to back it up,'' he said.

JUNK FOOD PSYCHOLOGY: TRISCUITS AND CHEEZ DOODLES AS WINDOWS INTO
THE SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's junk science, and then there's junk-food science.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for the Super Bowl, not to mention National Snack
Food Month in February, the Snack Food Association and the National
Potato Promotion Board have commissioned a study linking people's
snack preferences with their personality types.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise: People who inhale potato chips aren't necessarily
porcine gluttons but ``ambitious, successful, high achievers.'' And
Cheez Doodle lovers aren't slobs with orange fingers but ``formal,
always proper, conscientious, principled.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Let's have a look at this study. It was conducted by Dr.
Alan Hirsch, a neurologist and psychiatrist who runs the Smell and
Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago. His curriculum
vitae notes that ``he has served as an expert on smell and taste on
CNN, `Good Morning America' and `The Oprah Winfrey Show.'''
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from Hirsch's research follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The paper, ``Snack Food Hedonics and
Personality,'' begins, ``Why do we choose to eat certain
foods?''(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Our food choices, like our choices of clothing, movies,
automobiles, vacation spots and mates and lovers, can provide
insight into our personality and character structure. Through our
food preferences and choices we reveal inner thoughts, feelings,
wishes and desires. It's no exaggeration to say that, in many
respects, the foods we choose provide a window to the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) One way to open that window, Hirsch
maintains, is through hedonics, the field of psychology that
measures feelings: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A food's hedonic value is determined by . . . factors including
the inherent gustatory and olfactory properties, cognitive
perceptions including the perceived nutritional value, associated
conditioned response characteristics, olfactory evoked nostalgia
and craving.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) You say you like some foods and not others?
It's not that simple, the study says: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Pavlovian conditioned response effects also impact the hedonic
nature of the food. Caffeine wakes, alcohol removes inhibitions,
sugar energizes. Alternatively, food aversions also are created if
illness occurs coincident with ingestion. Unconditioned stimuli may
also become associated with the affective view of the food.
Romantic interludes after eating dessert may change the effective
valence of the pumpkin pie. Alternatively, ingestion of chipped
beef prior to a forced 10-mile march in full gear may endow a
negative valence to the chipped beef.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The paper hypothesizes that your food
preferences can be a gustatory Rorschach test: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Since eating or smelling of food may reduce psychologic tension,
craving or the desire for food may then be representative of the
underlying conflict. And longstanding preferences may indicate the
conflicts associated with inherent personality structure. Thus,
food preference could theoretically be used as a projective
personality test.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) So how to gauge the correlation between
snack scarfing and personality? Here's how: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Eight hundred volunteers, 73 percent female, 27 percent male,
with a median age of 45 (range 17-77) underwent a series of
psychological tests including the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
Inventory-II, Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II, Beck
Depression Inventory and the Zung Depression Scale. They were then
queried regarding the hedonic preferences of six different snack
foods: potato chips tortilla chips, pretzels, snack crackers,
cheese curls and meat snacks. . . . Spouses or mates of these
subjects also underwent the same hedonic preference assessments.
After these were obtained, analysis was performed correlating snack
food hedonics and personality types. These characteristics were
then expanded and interpreted for lay person understanding. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)And the results are: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   POTATO CHIPS: Those who love potato chips are ambitious,
successful, high achievers. They enjoy rewards and trimmings of
their success _ both in business and family life. They feel pride
and happiness when their spouse and children are also successful.
They seek nothing less than the best in those around them. Potato
chip lovers are easily frustrated and indignant at life's
inconveniences. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Note: Whether in business, sports or a social situation, expect
to lose if you enter into competition with a potato chip lover;
they are worthy and prepared adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   TORTILLA CHIPS : Tortilla chip lovers aren't satisfied with
getting a grade of A, it must be an A plus. Their concern extends
beyond their own actions, and also to the community at large _ they
are distressed by the inequities and injustices of society. This
concern for how others feel would make them an ideal house guest.
</P>
<P>
   Always prim and proper at social gatherings, the tortilla chip
lover is conservative.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   PRETZELS : Lively and energetic, those who prefer pretzels crave
novelty and easily become bored by the usual routine. They are
excited by the challenge _ whether it be at work, sports or home.
They thrive in the world of abstract concepts and tend to lose
interest in the mundane day-to-day world. There is a tendency to
initiate new projects without having completed the last, and to
overcommit to work or family chores.
</P>
<P>
   Happy in the role as a ``flirt,'' pretzel lovers are comfortable
dressed in an attractive manner. . . . The pretzel lover will be on
top of the latest craze _ having accumulated a herd of ``Beanie
Babies,'' they are ready to conquer the next fad.
</P>
<P>
   Pretzel lovers make decisions based on intuition and emotion. At
times, they are overly trusting, especially in romantic
relationships. One pretzel lover is a welcome addition to any
grouping _ they are ``the life of the party, lively, enthusiastic
and fun to be with!''
</P>
<P>
   SNACK CRACKERS : Contemplative, thoughtful . . . rather than
intuitively oriented, decisions are reasoned and not based on
emotions. Shy and introspective, (snack cracker eaters) avoid
confrontation so as not to hurt the feelings of others. They have
many diverse interests and are involved in a multitude of projects
simultaneously, all competing for their time and attention. They
value their private time and are most creative when allowed to be
alone, free from their daily responsibilities and interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Those who prefer crackers may easily find themselves
romantically involved in an Internet relationship.
</P>
<P>
   CHEESE CURLS: Formal, always proper, conscientious, principled,
the cheese curl lover maintains the moral high ground with . . .
family, work and romantic partners. They have a fine sense of right
and wrong and justly treat those with whom they interact _ the CEO
is treated with the same fairness and concern as the bus boy.
Cheese curl lovers are best described by one adjective _ integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than showing reckless disregard for the future, they plan
ahead, anticipate any possible future catastrophes. Whether it be
Band-Aids or batteries, the cheese curl lover's house is stocked
and ready. Orderly and perfectionists, they are most comfortable
with a neat, uncluttered desk. At work, play, or at home no detail
is left undone.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If it is so spotless you can eat off the kitchen floor,
you are in the domicile of one who craves cheese curls.
</P>
<P>
   MEAT SNACKS: Gregarious, social . . . They are generous to a
fault, and will make extraordinary self-sacrifices to please
others. Those who prefer meat snacks are loyal and true friends who
can always be trusted. However, their overtrusting nature
predisposes them to emotional turmoil, especially when breaking up
with a lover.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Those who prefer meat snacks are prone to, and thus should
be careful to avoid, rebound relationships!
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And the study concludes: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Food hedonics, whether it be snack food, fruit or ice cream, has
potential utility as a projective test for psychiatric illness as
well as personality typing in subjects without pathology. Future
research establishing cross-geographics and cross-cultural validity
of this projective testing is warranted.

   Note: Those who prefer crackers may easily find themselves
romantically involved in an Internet relationship.
</P>
<P>
   CHEESE CURLS: Formal, always proper, conscientious, principled,
the cheese curl lover maintains the moral high ground with . . .
family, work and romantic partners. They have a fine sense of right
and wrong and justly treat those with whom they interact _ the CEO
is treated with the same fairness and concern as the bus boy.
Cheese curl lovers are best described by one adjective _ integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than showing reckless disregard for the future, they plan
ahead, anticipate any possible future catastrophes. Whether it be
Band-Aids or batteries, the cheese curl lover's house is stocked
and ready. Orderly and perfectionists, they are most comfortable
with a neat, uncluttered desk. At work, play, or at home no detail
is left undone.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If it is so spotless you can eat off the kitchen floor,
you are in the domicile of one who craves cheese curls.
</P>
<P>
   MEAT SNACKS: Gregarious, social . . . They are generous to a
fault, and will make extraordinary self-sacrifices to please
others. Those who prefer meat snacks are loyal and true friends who
can always be trusted. However, their overtrusting nature
predisposes them to emotional turmoil, especially when breaking up
with a lover.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Those who prefer meat snacks are prone to, and thus should
be careful to avoid, rebound relationships!
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And the study concludes: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Food hedonics, whether it be snack food, fruit or ice cream, has
potential utility as a projective test for psychiatric illness as
well as personality typing in subjects without pathology. Future
research establishing cross-geographics and cross-cultural validity
of this projective testing is warranted.

VOTING BY THE INTERNET: THE MOUSE STILL HASN'T ROARED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In some parts of Alaska, about the only way to get to a voting
booth in January is by dogsled. So to encourage participation in
its presidential straw poll last Monday, the Alaska Republican
Party tried something different: Internet voting.
</P>
<P>
   By logging on to the Web site of VoteHere.net, a new company
that sells Internet voting software, Republicans in three remote
districts (and in the offices of Alaska's members of Congress in
Washington) could point the mouse at any of six presidential
contenders, then click on a button labeled ``Cast this ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the straw poll was not binding, this was not, as the
company labeled it, the ``first binding Internet election.'' Still,
it does appear to have been the first Internet ballot to be
sanctioned by a major party, and it was a happy debut: while only
35 people voted from their computers, they provided Texas Gov.
George W. Bush with just enough clicks (23) to lift him to a narrow
victory over Steve Forbes (4) in the straw poll as a whole. (The
overall tally was Bush 1,571, Forbes 1,566.)
</P>
<P>
   While Alaska may have been the first, it is not likely to be the
last. A small but growing number of state officials in both
parties, impressed by the sales pitches of start-up companies like
VoteHere.net and Election.com, see electronic voting as a way to
attract new voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole objective is to open voting to people who don't
participate, like the 18-to-34 age group,'' said Mark Fleisher,
chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party, which plans to offer
Internet voting in its March presidential primary, which will be
binding. He added that he hoped the novelty would provide a jolt of
publicity to upstage the Republicans, whose own primary is two
weeks before the Democrats'.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone sees Internet voting as a portal to a more
democratic future. The Voting Integrity Project, a nonprofit civic
group in Virginia, has sued in federal court to block the Arizona
Democrats' plan on behalf of two minority voters, saying it
discriminates against minority voters, who are less likely than
whites to have access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are security problems. The two electronic voting
companies use various kinds of software to protect voters' privacy
and make sure nobody casts more than one ballot. But the California
Internet Voting Task Force, a panel of technology experts,
political scientists and civic leaders convened by Secretary of
State Bill Jones, presented an alarming picture in January in a
report rejecting the notion of allowing voters to cast ballots from
home via the Internet anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The task force said that despite security measures, it would be
all too easy to distribute a ``Trojan horse'' virus, perhaps by
e-mail, to take up residence in voters' home computers. Such a
virus, the panel said, could direct Internet voting software to
take over the keyboard and mouse and place automated votes without
the user's even being aware that the vote had been altered.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Adler, president of VoteHere.net, said such concerns were
overblown, but he acknowledged that extra security measures might
be necessary and that they would involve some work on the voters'
part. ``You may have to sacrifice convenience for security,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers for the Defense Department, which is creating a
system to allow Americans overseas to cast ballots through the
Internet, came to the same conclusion as the California panel.
Glenn Flood, a Pentagon spokesman, said the pilot project,
scheduled to be tested by 250 military personnel in November, would
allow voting only from virus-free machines at military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts dispute a central premise of the Internet-voting
movement: that technology, in and of itself, will attract large
numbers of new voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pent-up demand for `Gee, if I could do this from
home, I would participate in politics,''' said Michael Cornfield, a
political scientist who is director of the Democracy Online Project
at George Washington University. ``We've been there. We've done
this. It does not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Arterton, dean of the Graduate School of Political
Management at George Washington, said that experiments in
``tele-democracy'' in the 1980s, in which people could register
opinions by telephone on issues presented in town hall meetings on
cable television, were disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media was not a cure-all for the problems of democracy,'' he
said. ``The real resistance from citizens is attitudes toward
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And many state election officials are far from sold on Internet
voting. ``We have a couple of software companies that are driving
this process,'' said Thomas Wilkey, executive director of the New
York state Board of Elections. ``I don't think anybody is saying
they're totally against this, but let's take a look before jumping
into this. It's like jumping into the lake without testing the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Practical issues aside, the political obstacles are bound to
remain substantial. Consider the culture clash that took place in
Louisiana last spring, when VoteHere.net persuaded moderate
Republicans to propose Internet voting to bring attention to the
party's 2000 presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The issue became a flashpoint in the longstanding rivalry
between conservatives and moderates. And as the software people
looked on in amazement, the old politics rapidly trumped the new:
conservatives, invoking a series of unorthodox parliamentary
maneuvers, managed to bury the proposal, at least for this election
year.

TUESDAY'S BIG TEST: HOW DEEP IN THE HEART OF TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For decades, it has been an article of faith among
Republicans that no issue is more politically powerful or truer to
their ideology than tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Now that orthodoxy faces one of its strongest challenges since
Ronald Reagan brought the supply-side revolution to the GOP. The
challenger is Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who has audaciously
taken Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to task at the beginning of the
primary season for the big tax cut plan that is the centerpiece of
his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the federal budget surplus swelling, taxes will no doubt
remain an issue to some degree throughout the election. But the
outcome of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday could go a long way
toward determining whether the traditional Republican message about
cutting taxes has lost its potency in an era when voters seem
inclined to use the current prosperity to address expensive
long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   Casting himself as a true believer in tax cuts, Bush has not
flinched. His differences with McCain, he said last week as he
received the endorsement of Jack Kemp, one of the original
supply-siders, pose ``a defining choice for our party.'' Kemp said
McCain was ``turning the party away from Ronald Reagan and back to
Herbert Hoover.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain has continued to attack Bush's plan in
terms redolent of both old-style fiscal conservatism and Democratic
class warfare. He calls the proposed cuts too big, too tilted to
the wealthy, too little focused on debt reduction and blind to the
challenges of shoring up Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during a debate last week whether his approach was too
much like President Clinton's to suit Republican voters, McCain did
not blush, replying that perhaps Clinton's plan ``looks too much
like mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, McCain's appeal in the famously anti-tax precincts of
New Hampshire may derive more from his war hero background and his
blunt-talking approach than from his stand on fiscal policy. But
should he defeat Bush in the first head-to-head matchup between the
two leading Republicans, it will clearly raise questions about the
Texan's reliance on a tax-cutting message to carry him through the
primaries, much less the general election.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's approach, which includes smaller tax cuts than Bush's,
is framed by the combination of current prosperity and long-term
national problems. Few voters seem to be clamoring for tax cuts of
a few hundred or even a few thousand dollars a year now because
most are feeling flush; on Tuesday, as New Hampshire votes, the
nation's current economic expansion will officially become the
longest on record.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, voters seem to have a visceral feeling that
they should be planning now to ensure that the country's finances
are put in order before the inevitable downturn. Support for
reducing the national debt is far stronger than either party had
expected, and poll respondents regularly say their top priorities
are putting Social Security and Medicare on sound footing for the
retirement of the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   These developments have given McCain an opportunity to redefine
what it means to be a conservative in an age of plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's conservative in good times to put money into
Social Security,'' McCain said. ``It's conservative to pay down the
debt. And it's conservative, clearly, to try to save Medicare and
at the same time give these tax breaks to American families.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strategy has set off a heated debate among Republican
strategists and conservative thinkers. Most of them are more
dedicated to tax cuts than ever, especially at a time when the
federal surplus appears to be growing to astonishing heights. Last
week the Congressional Budget Office projected that the surplus
outside the Social Security system could reach $1.9 trillion over
the next decade, nearly twice as much as projected six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   True supply-siders say that tax cuts will not only keep the
economy healthy, but that returning excess revenue to the taxpayers
is the best way to stop the relentless growth of government. They
point out that when the issue is framed as a choice between letting
politicians spend the surplus and letting individuals choose how to
use their own money, tax cuts get strong support in polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to link it to wasteful Washington spending,'' said
Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``That's when it becomes not
only good policy but good politics.''

Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``That's when it becomes not

</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans, even some who consider themselves
supply-siders and support aggressive tax-cutting efforts,
acknowledge that McCain may have tapped into a new politics of
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time of prosperity such as now, the one thing people are
more concerned about than anything else is not rocking the boat,''
said Bruce Bartlett, a former Treasury Department official in the
Reagan and Bush administrations, ``and they are deeply skeptical of
any ideas that seem large because large is seen as risky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rightly or wrongly, people have bought into the idea that big
tax cuts are risky,'' Bartlett said. ``At the same time, people
know instinctively that the good times won't last forever. They
view paying down the debt as putting money in the national piggy
bank and as the way you deal with the problems of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The wild card in the debate could be the surplus. McCain has
already dismissed the estimates as guesses that should not be the
basis for policy-making. And Democrats say the projections of a
$1.9 trillion surplus are a fantasy because they are built on the
unrealistic assumption that Congress will cut spending for the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the numbers give Bush some measure of protection against
charges that his $483 billion, five-year tax cut plan would be
fiscally irresponsible. Even if he loses the New Hampshire primary
on Tuesday, he will almost certainly stick to his message as the
campaign leaves the state (where independents can vote in the
primaries) for more traditional conservative battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the debate on the campaign trail is beginning to
percolate among Republicans in Congress. House Speaker Dennis
Hastert has made eliminating the national debt one of the party's
main goals, even as he has de-emphasized efforts to pass a sweeping
tax cut, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have not failed to recognize reality. With Kemp at
his side, Bob Dole ran for president in 1996 on a tax-cutting
platform and was beaten soundly by Clinton. Clinton has
subsequently blocked Republican tax-cutting efforts in Congress and
tried to make Democrats the party of fiscal discipline.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican analysts are clearly concerned about the
potential for a debilitating split within the party if McCain's
strategy succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a Republican uses the rhetoric of Democratic criticism
against the GOP,'' Luntz said, ``that's when you know you have an
electoral problem.''

view paying down the debt as putting money in the national piggy
bank and as the way you deal with the problems of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The wild card in the debate could be the surplus. McCain has
already dismissed the estimates as guesses that should not be the
basis for policy-making. And Democrats say the projections of a
$1.9 trillion surplus are a fantasy because they are built on the
unrealistic assumption that Congress will cut spending for the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the numbers give Bush some measure of protection against
charges that his $483 billion, five-year tax cut plan would be
fiscally irresponsible. Even if he loses the New Hampshire primary
on Tuesday, he will almost certainly stick to his message as the
campaign leaves the state (where independents can vote in the
primaries) for more traditional conservative battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the debate on the campaign trail is beginning to
percolate among Republicans in Congress. House Speaker Dennis
Hastert has made eliminating the national debt one of the party's
main goals, even as he has de-emphasized efforts to pass a sweeping
tax cut, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have not failed to recognize reality. With Kemp at
his side, Bob Dole ran for president in 1996 on a tax-cutting
platform and was beaten soundly by Clinton. Clinton has
subsequently blocked Republican tax-cutting efforts in Congress and
tried to make Democrats the party of fiscal discipline.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican analysts are clearly concerned about the
potential for a debilitating split within the party if McCain's
strategy succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a Republican uses the rhetoric of Democratic criticism
against the GOP,'' Luntz said, ``that's when you know you have an
electoral problem.''

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Last week, rebel insurgents from Myanmar
stormed a hospital in neighboring Ratchaburi, Thailand, holding
more than 800 staff members and patients prisoner for 22 hours.
Thai security forces then stormed the hospital, killing 10 rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas were part of a fundamentalist Christian
paramilitary group led by 12-year-old Burmese twins, Johnny and
Luther Htoo, neither of whom took part in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, a photo of the impossibly young-looking leaders
began appearing in American newspapers. Long-haired and pretty,
Johnny Htoo peers over his brother's shoulder with a slightly
furrowed brow; Luther, eyes narrowed, holds a cigar to his lips.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, the Htoo boys began surfacing on American
television, notably as a comedy news item on ``The Daily Show,''
starring Jon Stewart.

about it. He's a wild man. I can see the first episode. The parents
are going out and Mom tells the sitter that the kids have to be in
bed by 9 at the latest. Luther runs up saying, ``But Mom, some of
the guerrillas are coming over to plan a raid on Gymboree next
Wednesday.'' So Mom says: ``Well, OK, 11. But no smoking, mister.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Nonsensical reaction to common-sense gun proposal
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of the lesser items in President Clinton's
valedictory agenda, and one many Americans would judge among the
least arguable, but expect an outsized political detonation from
his proposal that handgun owners be licensed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott instantly dismissed
the idea as violative of the Constitution's Second Amendment,
though it would deny no firearm to anyone who may legally buy one
now.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, licensing would bring a new sobriety to personal
decisions about whether to take in firearms. Some of the most
deadly guns have been ones bought impulsively, often during a local
panic over crime stories, by persons ill-prepared for the
responsibility and thoughtless in how and where they maintain the
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   That casualness and negligence are at the root of the
president's appalling observation that the accidental gun death
rate among American kids under 15 is nine times higher than in the
other 25 industrial nations _ combined.
</P>
<P>
   The bother of licensing would cut the number of firearms coming
into play. The process would impress upon buyers the life-or-death
enormity of their decision.
</P>
<P>
   We must be licensed to operate an automobile, which, although
potentially deadly in its misuses, has as its purpose only the
benign objective of getting from point A to point B. To drive
legally, we have to show that we know the traffic laws and can
wheel the machine around with at least rudimentary safety.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we may buy purposely deadly weapons without in any way
reassuring the community we have the slightest idea of how to
handle them properly.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that we have a constitutional right to bear arms and no
constitutional right to be borne by a car is often cited as somehow
clinching, but it is meaningless when licensing would deny no one
access to a lawful firearm.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of firearms proposal the president rightly
likes to characterize as common sense, but brace for a blast of
nonsense against it even so.
</P>
<P>
   Expect, for example, a golden oldie of the guns-first set _ the
claim that it was because German gun owners were licensed and their
firearms registered that Hitler took over Germany. It would happen
here, the hysteria goes.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes _ if, first, we lost a world war, were reamed out by
hyperinflation, had wobbly political institutions and a recent
tradition of autocratic rule, elected a fascist party and then, on
second thought, didn't mind going up against the subverted armed
forces with handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's commentariat generally has it that this proposal
and all the rest in the State of the Union are just so much
election-year issue-mongering, a platform for Al Gore to run on and
the Republican Congress to run from. That's so, but so what?
</P>
<P>
   How odd that in a system set up to manage our common affairs
politically, it is now fashionable to dismiss any proposal, without
reference to its merits, on the grounds that it is political.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When New York state opened the Tappan Zee Bridge in 1955 to span
the Hudson River at its widest point, officials proudly said they
were opening up new frontiers to the suburbs and beyond. The bridge
would pay dividends far beyond its $81 million cost, ``in new
satellite communities, in increased land values and in countless
other less tangible ways,'' said Walter Mahoney, a Republican who
was majority leader of the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This month, when a task force appointed by Gov. George Pataki
called for a $4 billion project to replace the bridge, the language
was strikingly different.
</P>
<P>
   There was no brave talk of new subdivisions or shopping centers.
Instead, the task force cast the bridge replacement almost as a
mass transit project _ a way to contain the suburban sprawl that
the bridge had been built to generate in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   It said the new span should include tracks for a commuter rail
line. And to relieve the rush-hour traffic that often results in
six-mile logjams, the panel called for a new toll-collection system
that would offer discounts to off-peak travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Costly and controversial as it is sure to be, the project may
never get off the ground. But whether it does or not, it has
already signaled a fundamental shift in the way major public works
projects are conceived, promoted and packaged, not just in New York
but all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed, of course, is that sprawl has become a dirty
word. When the dividends trumpeted in the 1950s turned out to have
their own costs (including the heavy traffic that has made the
Tappan Zee Bridge and other roadways obsolete), public officials
and transportation planners had to change their vocabularies.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than proclaim the merits of suburban development and car
travel, as the legendary master builder Robert Moses did in New
York state from the 1920s to the '60s, they are framing new road
projects in cautious, modest terms, often coupled with ideas for
mass transit and relief of traffic congestion. Vice President Al
Gore has made such initiatives a centerpiece of his campaign for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Not so many years ago, it was common wisdom that the only way to
relieve highway congestion was to add new lanes. Now the common
wisdom, supported by several recent studies, is that expanding a
road usually leads to substantial increases in the number of
vehicles on it. ``Adding highway capacity to solve traffic
congestion is like buying larger pants to deal with your weight
problem,'' said Michael Replogle, transportation director of the
advocacy group Environmental Defense, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   So in New Jersey, the state transportation commissioner, James
Weinstein, could go before a business group last week and utter
words that would have been heresy in that car-besotted state just a
few years ago: ``We're past the period where adding lanes is the
solution to traffic congestion, make no mistake about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein added that most of the money in a new $500 million
transportation bond act would go toward mass transit and road
repairs. ``The commissioner feels quite strongly that we cannot
build our way out of congestion,'' said his spokesman, John
Dourgarian. ``The days of new highway construction are over.''
</P>
<P>
   Off-peak discounts have been tried in California and a few other
states, with mixed success. In Maryland, Gov. Parris Glendening has
killed five highway bypass projects, fearful that they would
encourage sprawl, and pledged to double the number of transit
riders by 2020. To get people out of their cars and promote
downtown revitalization, the state has also built 50 miles of
sidewalks in the last two years, said John Freece, an assistant to
the governor. Even the state highway administrator has adopted a
slogan that would cheer anti-sprawl activists: ``Thinking Beyond
the Pavement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tappan Zee Bridge may be something of a special case. It is
severely overcrowded, handling 130,000 vehicles a day, 30 percent
over capacity. (The planners envision an increase from seven lanes
to eight.) And because it is so long _ built at the Hudson's widest
point to escape the 25-mile jurisdiction of the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey _ it is unusually expensive to maintain,
repair and, if necessary, replace.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the debate over the Tappan Zee echoes one in Washington
over the dilapidated Woodrow Wilson Bridge, on the Potomac River.
While there is wide agreement on the need to rebuild or replace the
bridge, a growing chorus of citizens, transportation groups and
government officials argue that a replacement structure should
accommodate as much mass transit and congestion pricing as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk pleases Robert A. Caro, author of ``The Power Broker''
(Alfred A. Knopf, 1974), the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of
Robert Moses that was one of the first works to focus on the toll
of build-at-all-costs highway construction on neighborhoods, the
environment and the overall quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Caro said, a growing number of public officials
have written to tell him the era of Moses is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a really encouraging extent,'' he said, ``I see that
there's a new understanding that it's no good just to go on blindly
building huge projects in the way that Robert Moses did. I don't
think we've come full circle, but I think we've come a long way.''

other less tangible ways,'' said Walter Mahoney, a Republican who
was majority leader of the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This month, when a task force appointed by Gov. George Pataki
called for a $4 billion project to replace the bridge, the language
was strikingly different.
</P>
<P>
   There was no brave talk of new subdivisions or shopping centers.
Instead, the task force cast the bridge replacement almost as a
mass transit project _ a way to contain the suburban sprawl that
the bridge had been built to generate in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   It said the new span should include tracks for a commuter rail
line. And to relieve the rush-hour traffic that often results in
six-mile logjams, the panel called for a new toll-collection system
that would offer discounts to off-peak travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Costly and controversial as it is sure to be, the project may
never get off the ground. But whether it does or not, it has
already signaled a fundamental shift in the way major public works
projects are conceived, promoted and packaged, not just in New York
but all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed, of course, is that sprawl has become a dirty
word. When the dividends trumpeted in the 1950s turned out to have
their own costs (including the heavy traffic that has made the
Tappan Zee Bridge and other roadways obsolete), public officials
and transportation planners had to change their vocabularies.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than proclaim the merits of suburban development and car
travel, as the legendary master builder Robert Moses did in New
York state from the 1920s to the '60s, they are framing new road
projects in cautious, modest terms, often coupled with ideas for
mass transit and relief of traffic congestion. Vice President Al
Gore has made such initiatives a centerpiece of his campaign for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Not so many years ago, it was common wisdom that the only way to
relieve highway congestion was to add new lanes. Now the common
wisdom, supported by several recent studies, is that expanding a
road usually leads to substantial increases in the number of
vehicles on it. ``Adding highway capacity to solve traffic
congestion is like buying larger pants to deal with your weight
problem,'' said Michael Replogle, transportation director of the
advocacy group Environmental Defense, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   So in New Jersey, the state transportation commissioner, James
Weinstein, could go before a business group last week and utter
words that would have been heresy in that car-besotted state just a
few years ago: ``We're past the period where adding lanes is the
solution to traffic congestion, make no mistake about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein added that most of the money in a new $500 million
transportation bond act would go toward mass transit and road
repairs. ``The commissioner feels quite strongly that we cannot
build our way out of congestion,'' said his spokesman, John
Dourgarian. ``The days of new highway construction are over.''
</P>
<P>
   Off-peak discounts have been tried in California and a few other
states, with mixed success. In Maryland, Gov. Parris Glendening has
killed five highway bypass projects, fearful that they would
encourage sprawl, and pledged to double the number of transit
riders by 2020. To get people out of their cars and promote
downtown revitalization, the state has also built 50 miles of
sidewalks in the last two years, said John Freece, an assistant to
the governor. Even the state highway administrator has adopted a
slogan that would cheer anti-sprawl activists: ``Thinking Beyond
the Pavement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tappan Zee Bridge may be something of a special case. It is
severely overcrowded, handling 130,000 vehicles a day, 30 percent
over capacity. (The planners envision an increase from seven lanes
to eight.) And because it is so long _ built at the Hudson's widest
point to escape the 25-mile jurisdiction of the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey _ it is unusually expensive to maintain,
repair and, if necessary, replace.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the debate over the Tappan Zee echoes one in Washington
over the dilapidated Woodrow Wilson Bridge, on the Potomac River.
While there is wide agreement on the need to rebuild or replace the
bridge, a growing chorus of citizens, transportation groups and
government officials argue that a replacement structure should
accommodate as much mass transit and congestion pricing as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk pleases Robert A. Caro, author of ``The Power Broker''
(Alfred A. Knopf, 1974), the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of
Robert Moses that was one of the first works to focus on the toll
of build-at-all-costs highway construction on neighborhoods, the
environment and the overall quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Caro said, a growing number of public officials
have written to tell him the era of Moses is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a really encouraging extent,'' he said, ``I see that
there's a new understanding that it's no good just to go on blindly
building huge projects in the way that Robert Moses did. I don't
think we've come full circle, but I think we've come a long way.''

   Diving Into the Political Mosh Pit &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a week of mosh pit politics.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, eloquent scold against the evils of popular culture,
ignited a culture war of sorts when he literally threw himself into
a mosh pit to the music of Rage Against the Machine, a stunt
orchestrated by the maverick filmmaker Michael Moore. Gary Bauer,
Keyes' rival on the conservative right, upbraided him during the
Republican debate in New Hampshire for demeaning the solemn quest
for high office. (Bauer, meanwhile, did nothing for his own hipness
quotient by mangling the name of the popular band.)
</P>
<P>
   The larger mosh pit was the campaign itself: a week of jousting
as the race got wilder in snowbound New Hampshire. There, a simple
fact confronted those who would be president: Bill Clinton was the
only aspirant since 1952 to be elected without winning the nation's
first true primary.
</P>
<P>
   Racing from the Iowa caucuses, where social conservatism plays
well, to libertarian, tax-averse New Hampshire, the candidates
shifted tactics sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, adopting a risky new strategy that
could tarnish his above-the-fray luster, went on the attack after
Vice President Al Gore drubbed him in Iowa; each is now accusing
the other of resorting to that campaign no-no, negativity. Bradley
accused the vice president of lying and unleashed two surrogate pit
bulls, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Niki Tsongas, the widow of
Sen. Paul Tsongas, to attack Gore for distorting Bradley's record.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Iowa victor, found himself
squeezed harder from both the right (Steve Forbes and Keyes both
gained momentum in Iowa) and the left (Sen. John McCain, who
skipped Iowa to save money for New Hampshire, is seeking to attract
large numbers of independent voters in New Hampshire with his
reform-minded centrist platform).
</P>
<P>
   And the tone of the campaign got nastier for everyone, with the
abortion issue emerging again as the great divide.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, Keyes and Bauer confronted Bush on the issue, pushing
him to take a more conservative stand. Meanwhile, Bradley hit Gore
for being inconsistent in his commitment to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively small numbers of voters in the Iowa caucuses and
the New Hampshire primary are not really representative of the
country as a whole. But the contests are crucial in winnowing the
field (Sen. Orrin Hatch dropped out after winning no delegates in
Iowa, and endorsed Bush) and in helping candidates gather steam for
the decisive primaries in big states like California and New York.

   Freshman Year as Stress Test
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the fast-paced, multimedia society that surrounds
them. Maybe it's the mounting costs of higher education. Or maybe
it's the fact that just getting into college has become more
competitive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   This year's first-year college students are more stressed out
than any in a generation, according to a national survey by
researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles; in the
survey, 30.2 percent said they feel ``frequently overwhelmed by all
I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly twice as many women (38.8 percent) as men (20 percent)
were found to be swimming in stress. Then again, the women reported
spending more time studying and doing volunteer work, while the men
logged more hours watching television and playing videogames.
</P>
<P>
   But just wait _ the survey was conducted during the students'
first days on campuses across the country. Imagine the stress in a
couple of weeks, when final exams start.

   A Hint in the High Court On Campaign Funding
</P>
<P>
   To the many critics of the current system of raising money for
political campaigns, the Supreme Court has been part of the
problem, not the solution. Critics point to the 1976 Buckley vs.
Valeo decision, which upheld federal limits on contributions while
ruling that as an aspect of free speech, campaign expenditures
could not be curbed.
</P>
<P>
   A decision last week indicated that the justices might be
growing increasingly attentive to the criticism and inclined, in
some future case, to address it. The 6-3 ruling itself, upholding
Missouri's $1,000 contribution cap for statewide races, simply
reaffirmed the contribution side of the Buckley vs. Valeo equation,
and in that sense made little new law.
</P>
<P>
   But four justices, in separate opinions, indicated an openness
to considering aspects of Buckley that were not before the court
this time: whether the Constitution really forbids any interference
with the uncontrolled flood of money into politics, whether through
independent expenditures or contributions of unlimited and often
unaccountable soft money.

   A Little Boy Gets To See His Grandmothers
</P>
<P>
   Two grim grandmothers from Cuba bounded from New York to
Washington to Miami and back again in a desperate attempt to bring
their 6-year-old grandson, Elian Gonzalez, home to his father. The
Justice Department, too, wants them to take the boy, who was
rescued last Thanksgiving after his mother drowned at sea while
fleeing Cuba with him.
</P>
<P>
   But Elian's paternal relatives in Little Havana, with the
financial and promotional support of Miami's anti-Castro Cuban
exile community, want permanent custody for themselves, and so far
the courts have allowed them to keep the boy with them.
</P>
<P>
   As Elian's custodians whisk him in luxury cars to the circus and
Disney World and feed him the trinkets of America's consumer
society _ a battery-powered go-cart, a cell phone, gold chains and
Nintendo games _ they may already have captured his heart.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting with him privately Wednesday, one grandmother
said, ``He's changed completely.''

   U.S. Warns Pakistan
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly not a list most nations care to join. But the
United States is warning Pakistan that it may soon join Iran and
Iraq on the State Department's official list of nations that
support terrorism, which could mean new economic sanctions on that
already impoverished nation.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the Pakistani army's support for a terrorist
Kashmiri group blamed for the hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet.
Asked earlier this month by a group of visiting administration
officials to ban the group, Pakistan's new military leader refused.

   New Focus in Terror Probe
</P>
<P>
   The focus of inquiry into the group of Montreal-based men
accused of plotting a terrorist attack in America has shifted from
Algeria to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Though several of the Algerians accused in the plot were once
members of an Algerian militant group that had never before
targeted Americans, investigators have come to believe that the
head of the alleged terrorist cell was a Mauritanian with ties not
to Algeria, but to Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi charged in the
1998 bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   At Washington's request, Senegal arrested the Mauritanian,
Mohambedou Ould Slahi, the alleged head of the Montreal Algerian
cell. The Justice Department sought his extradition to America.

   Barak's Party Is Fined
</P>
<P>
   Israel's state comptroller issued a sharply worded report
accusing the ruling party of violating campaign finance laws during
the election last year in which Ehud Barak was elected prime
minister, and the party was placed under criminal investigation.
The comptroller, Eliezer Goldberg, fined Barak's One Israel Party
$3.2 million but did not implicate the prime minister personally in
the alleged violations.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who said he had advised his associates to operate
legally, said he welcomed the investigation as a way to clear up
ambiguities in the election law.

   A New Inspector for Iraq
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a year of wrangling over how to send arms
inspectors back to Iraq and who would lead them, the U.N. Security
Council named a compromise chief inspector, Hans Blix, the former
director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Blix, a Swede, was pushed by France, which was
looking for a candidate Iraq might be able to work with. The United
States, eager to avoid another prolonged crisis over Iraq, quickly
agreed; Washington's preferred candidate, Rolf Ekeus, had been
blocked in the council by France and Russia.

   President Andres Pastrana of Colombia went to Washington to
campaign for a proposed $1.3 billion in aid, and he opened with a
plea for bipartisanship. He got that right away.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who had pressed for more support for Colombia,
began complaining about the plan outlined by the Clinton
administration. Liberal Democrats liked the plan even less, and
said they would try to link any new aid to the human rights
performance of the Colombian army.
</P>

   Pastrana said he wanted no such conditions. Progress on human
rights would come, he insisted, but not because of pressure from
abroad.

   A New Look at Illnesses In Nuclear Bomb Plants
</P>
<P>
   For years some researchers have claimed that the 600,000 people
who have helped build nuclear bombs are prone to all kinds of
illnesses as a result. But from the time of the Manhattan Project,
the government said it wasn't so. Now the White House and the
Energy Department are preparing a review of years of data and
studies that accepts the idea that there are extra cases of cancer
among that population.
</P>
<P>
   The review, due to be completed in about two months, will not
settle the debate over how many more cancer cases the exposures
caused, and will not say how much radiation is safe. But it is a
marked turnaround in federal policy.

employees, or one-fifth of its worldwide workforce, in the largest
layoff ever for the soft-drink giant.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would take an $800 million charge against
earnings to cover severance and other costs related to the cuts,
and added that it expected its bottlers in several key markets to
buy less concentrate this year, further eroding profits.

   Reeling from a year of falling profits and other problems at
home and abroad, the Coca-Cola Co. said it would cut 6,000
employees, or one-fifth of its worldwide workforce, in the largest
layoff ever for the soft-drink giant.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would take an $800 million charge against
earnings to cover severance and other costs related to the cuts,
and added that it expected its bottlers in several key markets to
buy less concentrate this year, further eroding profits.

BILL CLINTON AND THE HAUNTING OF THE HUSTINGS

<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ After securing first place in the Iowa caucuses
last Monday night, an ebullient Texas Gov. George W. Bush
proclaimed ``the beginning of the end of the Clinton era.'' But
three evenings later there was a resurgent Bill Clinton before the
nation, using his last, and longest, State of the Union address to
frame the 2000 campaign with an expansive, activist agenda designed
to appeal to the great American middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton era will end, as all political moments must, but as
this past week demonstrated, that time has not yet come. In truth,
Clinton's influence pervades this presidential race. He has forced
the main candidates into a delicate balancing act: running against
the president's scandalous persona while hewing closely to the
political center he defined through seven turbulent years in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to what the candidates here are saying.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reaches out to those ``weary of polls and posturing,'' but
his very self-definition as a ``compassionate conservative''
signals that he will fight to keep a safe distance from the
fire-breathing House conservatives, once led by Newt Gingrich, whom
Clinton has soundly defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's chief rival, Sen. John McCain, fervently promises
audiences that ``I will never lie to you,'' but puts forward a plan
for tax cuts and Social Security that Clinton himself might have
written. Asked at the GOP debate last week whether his plan looks
like Clinton's, he could only huff, ``Well, I think President
Clinton's looks too much like mine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, former Sen. Bill Bradley talks of being
as ``straight as I can possibly be'' and then calls for ambitious
domestic programs only to see Clinton steal his thunder Thursday
night by calling for major new initiatives on everything from
health care to education to poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, began his campaign with
pointed comments about the need for character in high office,
explicitly seeking to distance himself from Clinton. But he has
abruptly reversed field and begun boasting about the Clinton-Gore
economic record. Last Thursday, he was once more in his familiar
place nodding as Clinton called on Congress to ``build the more
perfect union of our founders' dreams,''and trying not to smile as
his boss repeatedly heaped praise upon him.
</P>
<P>
   The political gyrations of the candidates only mirror the
ambivalence of the nation. New Hampshire voters, still numbed by
last year's impeachment crisis, sometimes come very close to
begging the new crop of presidential candidates not to behave like
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ever embarrass us,'' Bob Elliott, a 67-year-old retired
teacher, told McCain at a town hall meeting in Salem last week.
``When you go to Washington, you've got to assume the vows of the
priesthood of being a president. Now we don't expect you to be
celibate, but we do expect you to be faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time, the nation embraces Clinton's view of
government. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll taken earlier this month
found that 50 percent of voters wanted to continue Clinton's
policies. Only 10 percent wanted a more liberal approach to
government. And 33 percent wanted more conservative policies. This
is a remarkable rating for a president entering his eighth year,
eclipsing even Ronald Reagan in his final year.
</P>
<P>
   This is a far cry from the ``Clinton fatigue'' political
commentators were talking about just a few weeks ago. Al From, head
of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council and one of the
Democratic strategists who helped Clinton frame his centrist
appeal, said the election is not about searching for the
anti-Clinton at all. Rather, it is about ``who can give us
Clinton's third term?''
</P>
<P>
   For no matter how much he disgraced himself, Clinton does seem
to have made good on his second-term pledge to find the ``vital
American center.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans protest that it was they who forced Clinton to the
center when they won control of Congress in 1994 and pushed him to
agree to a balanced budget and to overhaul welfare.
``Fundamentally, it's been him hijacking our signature issues,''
said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist affiliated with the
McCain campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's accommodations were strategic, blunting the issues
Republicans had long used against the Democrats and shifting the
political debate to health care, education, Social Security and
Medicare _ terrain long favorable to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The president did it again last Thursday night, mapping the
trail for his fellow Democrats as he set forth an agenda that
included gun safety, an increase in the minimum wage and a ``21st
century revolution'' in education.
</P>
<P>
   And in his call for a $350 billion tax cut he once again played
the political cat-burglar, filching the Republicans' idea of
eliminating the so-called marriage penalty, which causes some
married couples to pay more taxes than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   Political strategists differ sharply over which side of Clinton
will dominate the coming election: his personality or his programs.
Steve Duprey, the New Hampshire Republican chairman, insists that
the nation wants Clinton off the stage. ``People up here are very
tired of the Clinton administration,'' he said. ``I think that's
one of Gore's biggest difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-CLINTON-CAMPAIGN-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; NASHUA: biggest difficulties.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, says that the public
is comfortable with Clinton's policies and that Bush will prove
vulnerable because of his call for a sweeping $483 billion tax cut
over five years, which Democrats _ and even McCain _ charge favors
the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Budgets increasingly have become the way of defining political
philosophy,'' Garin said. ``And where Clinton has beat the
Republicans fairly consistently is on the question of priorities.
And a Bush budget reflects a very different philosophy than what
Clinton and the Democrats represent.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, for example, has used issues like paying down the
national debt, balancing the budget and saving Social Security to
steal the mantle of fiscal conservatism from the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night the Republicans often sat poker-faced as
Democrats rose and cheered, while the president set out his program
for the year 2000. Even before the speech, GOP leaders had
denounced Clinton as a profligate spender.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we enacted all the new programs the president has talked
about, we'd spend just about the entire surplus on bigger and more
expensive government,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional Republicans have already fled their own $792
billion tax cut package, which Clinton successfully defeated by
casting as a threat to Social Security and debt reduction. And both
Republican presidential and congressional candidates are being
called on to put forth their own plans for health care reform,
patient rights and education because the president has made the
case for them so effectively with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody recently remarked that while Clinton may be a lame
duck, he's still flapping his wings. So don't be surprised if, come
November, the GOP finds itself scrambling once again in reaction to
a master politician's valedictory agenda.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Lincoln/Washington/King: Just a day off
 &HT;    (For release Feb. 2, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have been quite cognizant of George Washington's birthday,
especially since my wife and I were married on that date. And we
were mindful of Abraham Lincoln's birthday as well, as that is the
date my wife's sister was married.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, we were aware of them because each was a
separate observance of great Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There was Abraham Lincoln's birthday on Feb. 12 and George
Washington's birthday on Feb. 22. I don't recall schools and
businesses being closed down in observance, but at least there was
symbolic liturgy around the dates.
</P>
<P>
   I also can't recall when the change was made, but what we knew
as Lincoln's birthday and Washington's birthday were merged into
something called Presidents Day.
</P>
<P>
   It conveniently is placed on a Monday so that mainly workers in
the public sector, schoolchildren, judges and lawyers get the day
off: a bonus add-on to weekends.
</P>
<P>
   All but lost in the observance is what it all is about. And, at
times, it confuses me. Is Presidents Day an observance of all
presidents? Is it an observance of just Lincoln and Washington? Or
is it just an excuse to take another day off work or school?
</P>
<P>
   I cannot help but note that when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday is observed, it too is designated to be a Monday. This
year, it was Jan. 17. Next year, it will fall on his actual
birthday, Jan. 15, not so much because accuracy is being cultivated
but because it's a Monday. And that goes with Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the King observance different from Presidents Day is
that on King's birthday, people really understand what the day is
about. Speeches are made, parades held. It is a true American
observance for a man who deserves the plaudits.
</P>
<P>
   But what of Washington and Lincoln, all but disappeared in the
justification of a Monday without work? Is there a chance that the
Father of our Country and the Great Emancipator might be remembered
in states, cities and neighborhoods as is Dr. King? And on their
actual birthdays?
</P>
<P>
   About all I can recognize about celebrating our great
forefathers is when department and tire stores create huge Lincoln
or Washington sales on that Monday. Like the Fourth of July, a
solemn holiday is treated as a premier day to shop. (And how soon
before the Fourth moves to the Third or the Fifth, as long as it is
a Monday?)
</P>
<P>
   It would not be past the thinking of the obscure Monday Day Off
Gang to slide the ascribed birthday of Jesus Christ to a Monday as
well. Hey, anything to package a three-day weekend!
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Columbus is credited with arriving at San Salvador
on Oct. 12, 1492. Now, the exact date really doesn't matter, what
does is that it is a Monday. This year, Columbus Day will be
observed on Monday, Oct. 9, or at a time when the admiral still was
floating lost east of the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Day, which began as a May 30 observance, is on May 29
this year. Reason? Correct! It's a Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Day falls this year on Feb. 21, which, of course, is
a Monday. It is now a day without purpose other than a portion of
the population feigning observance but really sitting at home and
watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   The only holiday with a floating date that does not conform to
the Monday mandate is Thanksgiving, which is set by Congress to be
the fourth Thursday in November. This, too, has become a bonus for
people who don't want to work or go to school. The Friday
surrounded by Thanksgiving and Saturday is fast becoming another
day to take off; that one makes for a four-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Subliminally, the aim of moving holidays to Mondays is to create
a four-day work week.
</P>
<P>
   We're up to five proscribed Monday holidays a year; just another
47 to go.

 &HT;    Teacher shortage won't be solved by turning away older
applicants
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDs: The following is designed to run as the first of two
consecutive columns on the same subject or be merged into one op-ed
or perspective section piece by merely deleting the dateline and
lede of the second section. Either piece also could stand alone.
Both are available on the Cox and New York Times wires. Since this
is the hiring season for next fall's crop of teachers, a local
situationer is suggested.
</P>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``This country is facing an extensive teacher
shortage
</P>
<P>
   and will need to hire more than 2 million instructors over the
next 10 years. But the recruitment effort will be wasted unless the
states raise standards for what teachers need to know, commit
themselves to hiring only qualified teachers and revamp schools of
education that are often no more than diploma mills, offering
watered-down courses and marginal preparation.'' _ Editorial, The
New York Times, Sunday, Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I wrote of the plight of my friend Gail, a dedicated
lady who found the schoolhouse locked when she tried to realize her
dream of teaching high school history. After completing her
education (cum laude and post-kids), she has been unable to land a
job in anybody's school system because she has two strikes against
her: a master's degree, and her age.
</P>
<P>
   Gail's advanced degree would cost the school a few more bucks,
and education is not known for putting its money where its mouth
is. And as for age, a 53-year-old is not going to die (or retire on
a pittance) any quicker than a 25-year-old is going to apply for
maternity leave or quit to follow her boyfriend to Myrtle Beach,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the volume of mail from all over the country, Gail
is far from alone in her under-employed state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read with great interest (and understanding) your article in
The Dayton Daily News this morning. I am 49, have a master's and
experience to compound the predicament. I am constantly receiving
substitute positions and accolades, but not a permanent position.
Comments I have received include, 'I don't want any more your age
in my building.' and 'I'm proud
</P>
<P>
   not to honor loyalty and dedication. That's not important in
education.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed,'' she adds, ``when I decided to return to
teaching, went back to school to become current and meet the state
standards, that I would
</P>
<P>
   have difficulty. I won't get pregnant, I have the maturity from
raising my own children, I'm stable in the community, and most
importantly, I know what I want to do with my life. I have even
offered to start at base pay. I truly love teaching, so money is
not my sole objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Ohio reader thanked me for trying to show the public
what she believes really fuels teacher shortages (money and age
bias). ``Our short-sighted superintendent hired a 26-year-old with
no experience as principal at our elementary.''
</P>
<P>
   A 34-year-old subbed for two years but gave up teaching after
watching 23-year-olds finding positions in the same systems where
she had applied.
</P>
<P>
   Another feels lucky to have a job, but watches as colleagues
continue to sub while children of neighboring school
administrators, school board members, or ministers are hired. And
as for minorities in her community, forget it. ``They recruit,
interview, but never hire.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hingham, Mass., a concerned parent admits she has no respect
for public education because budget is their biggest concern. She
suggests Gail go into private tutoring where she could be making up
to $40 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   On an up-note, the principal of a Dayton Catholic high school
admits it's quite a commute from Boston, but he values life
experience as a qualification for teaching, and would welcome
Gail's resume. He even includes his address.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT: Readers are still talking about it.

 &HT;    A dumb way to pick a president
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA, Fla. _ Imagine that someone proposed the following
system for choosing a Florida governor: For the first round, we
should pick some forsaken county out in the Panhandle. A county
with an agricultural economy. A county that's nearly all white. A
county unaffected by most of the economic and growth trends that
worry the rest of the state. A county with big spaces between towns
and really, really bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Then, we should choose a day guaranteed to have the kind of
weather that would make you think twice about walking your dog. On
that day, registered Democrats and Republicans would meet in school
cafeterias and gyms, in churches and libraries, and vote.
</P>
<P>
   We should pick a week night for this exercise in democracy, a
week night when school is in session, just to make sure too many
people with children and jobs won't show up. We should make them
sit in metal folding chairs and listen to speeches from their local
party officers, for whom this is the one big deal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   No quick in and out of the voting booth here. Instead, we'd have
the political equivalent of a couple thousand PTA meetings.
</P>
<P>
   For the second round, we should pick another small, rural, cold,
all-white county for a more standard primary. Again, we would ask
voters to come out during a week when the weather can be relied
upon to be so miserable you'd think twice about walking your dog.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we would hold this in another Panhandle county away from
the social changes and economic pressures that define politics in
the rest of the state. Only after the people of, say, Suwannee and
Okaloosa counties have spoken would anyone get any say about who
becomes governor. Except, of course, the people who pour their
campaign donations into candidates'
</P>
<P>
   Suwannee and Okaloosa county operations.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more.
</P>
<P>
   To make things interesting, we'll add a few more counties of
middling size for the last primaries, but only in one part of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   We would design this process so at no time would the state's
major urban centers vote. South Florida, Orlando and even Volusia
County would have no say. Those voters would be allowed only to
vote for the two candidates left standing when it's all over.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone proposed such a system for selecting a Florida
governor, he or she would be laughed out of the building. Rightly
so. Such a plan would be undemocratic and a bit racist. It would
disenfranchise people who live in cities. It would be convoluted
and just plain dumb.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that's how the major parties pick candidates for president.
We give over the selection of The Leader of the Free World to
rustics in mukluks and coats that look like space suits. In the New
Hampshire primary and Iowa caucuses, people who wear hats with ear
flaps are a major voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, we also put candidates on a diet of fried
chicken and church-basement coffee and send them out into sub-zero
temperatures dressed inappropriately because it wouldn't do to
appear on television dressed to look like the Michelin Man.
</P>
<P>
   I'm surprised people don't die doing that.
</P>
<P>
   The whole experience makes candidates unhealthy, pale and mean.
It gives a nasty edge to the reporting as well. The press guys
don't like being out at the Nowhere Diner in a snow drift taking
pictures of Candidate A promising to keep subsidies moving to corn
farmers and it's reflected in their reports.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say there's anything wrong with New Hampshire and
Iowa. This time of year, I'm sure they are great places to be from.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't deserve their prominence. No state does.
</P>
<P>
   There is no state where people are so wise and representative of
the rest of us that they should have the power to choose the
president for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that no state would ever knowingly reproduce the
presidential primary system for choosing state officials should be
a clue this is a system that makes no sense.

 &HT;    `Two of Us' a poignant tale of two Beatles
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's 1976 _ six years after The Beatles'
painful breakup. Paul McCartney is riding around New York City in a
stretch limo. Suddenly he gets a loopy urge to pay John Lennon an
unexpected visit at his spacious Manhattan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Would the bitter and reclusive Lennon let him in? If so, what
would they talk about? Would they even talk at all? Could the
meeting lead to a Beatles reunion?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that visit never took place. But it does happen in
``Two of Us,'' a purely fictional, yet wonderfully insightful and
intimate look at two larger-than-life rock legends, convincingly
played by Aidan Quinn (McCartney) and Jared Harris (Lennon).
</P>
<P>
   Most TV rock movies are simply glorified excuses to play great
music by hit-making artists. The stories wrapped around those
songs, however, are usually tissue thin. But, as Lauren Zalaznick,
VH1's senior vice president of original programming and
development, notes, ``This movie is all about two souls, arguably
the most famous musicians of our time. It's not an excuse for a
Beatles hit parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, VH1 tried to get the rights to some Beatles songs, but
wasn't successful.
</P>
<P>
   The songs weren't necessary, however. On the surface, ``Two of
Us'' is about a long overdue meeting between two music industry
icons. Look deeper and the film is really about friendship and
loss. You don't have to be a Beatles junkie to identify with that.
</P>
<P>
   First-time writer Mark Stanfield wrote a surprisingly
thoughtful, though at times hokey, script. That the script is
insightful is a surprise since Stanfield is only 35, which means he
was in diapers when The Beatles stormed America in 1964. But
Stanfield managed to capture the essence of the gruff Lennon and
laid-back McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney's in New York to play a string of sold-out concerts at
Madison Square Garden, when he decides to visit his old mate on a
whim. But Lennon, essentially a prisoner in his own home, is
reluctant to see him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you don't mind me surprising you,'' McCartney says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too soon to say,'' replies Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   But before long, both are meditating, smoking pot, drinking tea
and talking about old times. They even venture out to Central Park
_ in disguise _ and sing reggae tunes. But the palpable rift
between the two is about as wide as the Big Apple. Lennon gets in a
lot of snipes about McCartney's ``silly love songs.'' And
McCartney's still angry at Lennon for choosing his wife, Yoko Ono,
over the group. There's also a lot of psycho-babble about Lennon's
rough childhood.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney: ``I see a frightened man who doesn't see how
beautiful he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lennon: ``You're the only thing that keeps me from
disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Quinn and Harris (Richard's son) are fine in two
challenging roles. Harris is particularly effective in turning
Lennon into a delightful study in contrasts. One moment he's crying
about the pain in his life, the next he's berating two fans who
want him to sing ``Yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, ``Two of Us'' almost didn't get made. When VH1's
Zalaznick got the script, she saw its potential. Leon Falk, the
film's executive producer, was equally impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck by how much rung true,'' says Falk. ``It was an
unconventional view of them as real people. They weren't
celebrities to each other, they were just two guys who knew each
other since they were 15.''
</P>
<P>
   But the VH1 suits weren't as impressed. ``It was a risk, in that
it wasn't a traditional movie,'' Zalaznick admits. ``They said, 'We
like it, but it's not right for us.'''
</P>
<P>
   It took Zalaznick over a year to get the green light. It helped
when Quinn, Harris and director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who directed
``Let It Be,'' The Beatles' last film, liked the project. ``Michael
had turned down many other Beatles offers,'' says Falk. ``But he
said, `You guys got this one right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they did.
</P>
<P>
   The show airs Tuesday at 9 p.m. on VH-1.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hey! There's a guy walking down the street
talking to himself! No, wait a second, he has an earpiece and it's
attached to a cell phone. You thought cell phones were annoying
enough as it is, but this new attachment for the phone takes the
cell to newly annoying heights. People claim the new attachment is
designed to avoid radiation, but we know this is yet another
advancement in cell phone vanity. In particular, the Jabra headset
attachment ranks as the most annoying. The headphone fits snugly
into the ear and a wire, holding an inconspicuous plastic
microphone, runs down to the cell phone. Now people who wanted to
look cool talking on their cell phones can look cooler by looking
like they're talking to no one at all.

 &HT;    Memory chips race to catch up to processors
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The advent of lightning-fast microprocessors
running at 700 megahertz and more has put pressure on the rest of
the electronics innards in personal computers to pick up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the pressure is coming down on the companies that
make lots of computer memories, including Korea's Samsung and
Hyundai and Micron Technology of Boise, Idaho. Among them, those
three companies controlled about 60 percent of the $20 billion
memory market last year.
</P>
<P>
   If computer users are going to harness the latest whiz-bang
processing performance, their computers had better have memory
chips that are running lickety split. If memory chips cannot keep
pace, then those fast and expensive new processor chips will be
sitting idle most of the time and not earning their keep.
</P>
<P>
   Memory chip makers have created a series of faster memory
technologies throughout the 1990s. Usually, after a short period of
time, the new standard dominates and all the world's memory makers
shift their production to the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   But this year and next year, things could go differently. Two
competing standards could emerge, and, if they do, then life gets a
little more complicated for the companies that make computers and
for PC buyers as well.
</P>
<P>
   The big driver behind this industry shift is Intel Corp., which
makes most of the computer world's microprocessors, and, because of
that, has become the biggest, richest and most powerful chip
company.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, more than most companies, depends on memory chip
performance getting faster. Without that steady progression, the
improvements Intel makes in processor speeds won't translate to
significant increases in computer performance. And if that happens,
then Intel's incredible profit margins from processor sales are in
jeopardy. Intel would have a hard time commanding big price
premiums for its processor chips if it couldn't show that they make
computers work faster.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is pushing hard for the industry to adopt a new kind of
fast memory, promoted by a small Silicon Valley company called
Rambus Inc. Rambus had designed special circuitry for memory chips
that lets memory chips spit out streams of information more rapidly
than before.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus technology, for example, has been used in memory chips
that go into Nintendo 64 game consoles in order to deliver more
graphics information faster to meet the demands of graphics-hungry
game players.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Memory chip makers must pay Rambus Inc. a royalty _ typically
between 1/2 and 1 percent _ for every Rambus chip they make. And
Rambus chips, because they contain extra circuitry, are larger that
standard chips. That means they are more expensive to make.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those added costs and because of some recent delays
at Intel, memory chip makers haven't been chomping at the bit to
make Rambus memories. Samsung has been the most active Rambus
manufacturer. Because supplies have been limited, analysts say
Rambus chips cost about three times more than conventional memories
right now.
</P>
<P>
   That has slowed their adoption in computers. Dell Computer Corp.
is one of the few big computer makers that makes and promotes
high-end computers with Rambus chips. Dell chief executive Michael
Dell was an early investor in Rambus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the industry is sticking with conventional memory chips
that run at 100 megahertz. That's what Samsung's Austin factory
presently makes. Soon, however, those conventional chips are
expected to speed up to 133 megahertz, resulting in performance
boost of about 10 percent that will show up in some computers.
</P>
<P>
   Even faster versions of conventional chips, employing something
called Double Data Rate technology, are on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   So who wins this battle of technologies? Different analysts have
different ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest Inc.'s Jim Handy says the smart money has to stick
with Intel and the technology that Intel supports. Because Intel is
backing Rambus, Handy believes that Rambus will capture about 15
percent of the memory market this year and more than half the
market next year.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, Handy believes, is simply too powerful a force in the
computer business for memory chip makers to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Mike Feibus of Mercury Research in Scottsdale,
Ariz., isn't so sure. Maybe there will be two high-speed memory
standards, he says, because Intel's main rival in the processor
business, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., doesn't seem interested in
backing the Rambus standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still on the fence about which memory technology is
going to dominate,'' Feibus said last week. ``So far, we haven't
seen much movement toward Rambus.''
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of next year, the question of which technology
will win will probably be settled. In the meantime, there is plenty
of uncertainty in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be one of the most fascinating years ever in
the computer industry,'' Feibus said.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   With football winding down, it's time to once again concentrate
on basketball as our primary sport of choice. Just in time for the
switch is 989 Studios' NBA Shootout 2000 ($50; www.989studios.com).
This Playstation game is a definite improvement over its
predecessor. The newest version has great graphics and rim-rocking
action. Where a lot of the basketball games lack in action (how fun
could running up and down a court shooting and scoring really be?),
Shootout 2000 excels with its Total Control shooting _ each shot is
made on a graphic meter where you measure your shot. There is also
a cool ``create-a-dunk'' feature where you design how you want your
players to crush the ball into the net. If you're looking for
handheld b-ball action, look no further than Nintendo Gameboy's NBA
3 on 3 ($30, www.nintendo.com, for the Gameboy). This is NBA action
in the palm of your hand that plays incredibly well for its smaller
format. In the game, you pick three NBA team players to go up
against another team's. The game has a fun season function that is
automatically continued every time you turn on the game. Also, look
out for those monster jams. This game does a close-up of player
taking the ball to the hole.
</P>
<P>
   You know who Lara Croft, the busty heroine of the ``Tomb
Raider'' games, reminds us of? Roger Moore. Roger Moore made his
entire career off of being James Bond. All he was _ or ever will be
_ is James Bond. As a result, everything he has acted in since
``Live and Let Die'' has been some sort of minute twist on James
Bond. He never changes his character, and that's what's so annoying
about him. It is also the problem with Lara Croft. Tomb Raider: The
Last Revelation ($50; www.eidos.com) is the fourth game in a video
game franchise that has won the hearts of prepubescent boys across
the nation. Unfortunately, the game hasn't changed much since it
was introduced three years ago. This time, Lara is back in Egypt
and accidentally unleashes an evil Egyptian god. She must quash the
god before it's too late. Just like Moore reciting that annoying
line (``Bond, James Bond''), the Tomb Raider game hasn't changed:
she looks the same, she sounds the same and the controls are the
same. The one saving grace is that this game harkens back to the
first ``Tomb Raider.'' It is action-packed and less dependent on
the puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Combining addictive, chesslike game play with atmospheric
settings and an interesting menagerie of monsters, Odium ($40;
www.lith.com; for the PC) doesn't try to break ground in the
turn-based role-playing genre but rather tries to create a game
that's a whole lot of fun. At that goal it succeeds admirably.
Guide a small international team of soldiers into a
post-apocalyptic Russian nightmare where monsters and secrets lurk.
The downside: Amateurish voice acting, thin characters and
plotting, some interface clunkiness and tiresome cinematic scenes
that must be endured between actual game play. The upside: A
well-paced and challenging game that requires careful resource
management and some fairly deep thinking. Bottom line: What could
be higher praise than finding yourself awake at 2 a.m., emotionally
involved in Odium and struggling to find the next secret or defeat
the next set of monsters?
</P>
<P>
   Half-Life, the stunning horror-adventure game that still has us
intrigued two years after its release, has finally gotten the
sequel treatment _ well, sort of. Half-Life: Opposing Force ($40;
www.sierrastudios. com; PC only), the first official add-on to
Half-Life, is likely the most complete expansion pack to a game
we've ever seen. Instead of just adding a few levels or new weapons
to the original game, the folks at Sierra Studios instead unleash a
new adventure that takes the original premise _ escape from the
Black Mesa research lab as scientist Gordon Freeman _ and
flip-flops it. Now you play as one of the marines sent in to
eradicate Freeman. The game runs along the same timeline as the
original Half-Life and explores some of the same locations,
inserting new pieces to the story's plot. Adding to that new
monsters, new weapons and new characters to interact with, Opposing
Force takes the concept of the add-on pack and raises the bar as
far as Half-Life did for PC games. Is it worth what you'd pay for a
brand-new game? For fans of the original, Half-Life is still one of
the best single-player games in existence, and Opposing Force is
more of the same.

 &HT;    DVDs, videotapes always good fit for online shopping
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Online merchants aren't just selling a product, they
are selling convenience. So, many people searching for a DVD or
videotaped movie, even those who live close to well-stocked retail
stores, are buying online.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a person making one more stop on the commute home
from work, the movies arrive at the doorstep. And _ unlike buying a
sweater or a piece of furniture online _ there's no need to worry
if your purchase will look and fit right. A DVD of ``Casablanca''
bought online will be identical to the one you find in the store.
</P>
<P>
   If you are into shopping online, it will come as no surprise
that one of the real leaders in merchandising is Amazon.com. It's
an enormously efficient organization with excellent customer
service. Although some people associate Amazon totally with books,
the strategy of the company has been to be an online merchant of
almost everything that can be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The Amazon.com site at www
</P>
<P>
   .amazon.com has a broad selection of DVDs and videotapes. Prices
are good. In many cases, you'll pay less _ even with shipping _
than typical retail prices. The ability to search for the movie you
want by title, director or actor is pretty standard at most of the
sites reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com does have other features _ not all are exclusive to
Amazon _ that make shopping fun. For one thing, you can view a
list, updated hourly, of the top-selling videos. Even if you're the
sort of person who doesn't like swimming with the stream, it's fun
to see what's hot right now. You can also browse movies by
categories such as comedies, dramas and action.
</P>
<P>
   If you're into DVD, you may prefer a site that specializes in
just that format. That's literally the name of the game at DVD.com
located at www2
</P>
<P>
   .dvdexpress.com/consumer
</P>
<P>
   /movies/. The assortment is excellent and the delivery times _
based on several orders _ are astonishingly short.
</P>
<P>
   One nice feature that DVD.com pushes is the ability to preorder
a DVD. Usually a discounted price is offered for that kind of
order, and if you've been waiting for a specific movie, you can be
sure that you'll be among the first to get it. DVD.com has a handy
list of upcoming releases, and that makes for interesting browsing.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may be reluctant to buy a videotape or DVD, figuring
they'll watch the film once and that will be enough. So a site such
as MovieRent.Com offers that as a possibility. The site at
www.movierent.com
</P>
<P>
   /resources1.htm will be happy to rent the videotape or DVD or
sell it.
</P>
<P>
   This is a nifty site for a lot of reasons. Besides its own
sections within the site, you'll find links to other places on the
Web devoted to movies and DVD.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to discuss DVDs and videotaped movies
without mentioning Blockbuster. Undoubtedly there's a retail outlet
near you. But there's also an outlet on the Web at www
</P>
<P>
   .blockbuster.com.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find a good selection of movies here in both formats. The
prices are on par with those you'd find elsewhere. But one feature
that takes advantage of the Blockbuster retail business is the
ability to buy used videotapes online. The prices are great ...
averaging about $5 each.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you really need to know about a site that doesn't sell
DVDs or videotapes. Instead, it searches the sites that do sell
them and tells you where the bargains are. This truly valuable
service is located at www.moviepriceguide.com.
</P>
<P>
   Since the service is unique and difficult to explain in a few
sentences, go to the page at www.moviepriceguide.com
</P>
<P>
   /aboutus.shtml to read the explanation. It's a free service and
well worth checking out.

 &HT;    Updated Internet Explorer will have major improvements
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the sale of Netscape to America Online, you
probably thought the Internet browser wars were over. Think again.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft may now be the clear leader, but it is readying to
release a new version of its Internet Explorer browser for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Called Internet Explorer 5.0, this version sports a new look, a
faster engine to draw pages and an easier-to-use search feature.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes built-in automated support for those
participating in Internet auctions. The browser's Auction Tracker
feature will keep you posted on how your bid is faring.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Netscape is also readying a new version for
the Mac, but it looks like Explorer is going to be the first to
market, sometime early this year.
</P>
<P>
   As always, both Netscape Navigator and Explorer are free. You
can download the new versions from various sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a close look at some of Explorer's top new features:
</P>
<P>
   What Microsoft seems proudest of, based on the hype in its
promotional material, is something called Tasman. That's the code
name for a new software engine that builds the Web pages you see
within the browser.
</P>
<P>
   Tasman represents a complete rebuild of how Explorer constructs
Web pages. In doing so, Microsoft not only sped up its browser but
added lots of new technologies. For example, Explorer will provide
better support of tables, cascading style sheets and the latest
version of HTML.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, these improvements will work across both platforms.
No longer will a page that works on a PC fail to display on a Mac.
Or so Microsoft claims.
</P>
<P>
   What's received the most media attention in Explorer 5.0 is
Auction Tracker, and it's a pretty cool feature. Basically, once
customized by a user, it will automatically track a bid you've
made. Auction Tracker will alert you if you've been outbid,
enabling you to either drop out or raise your offer.
</P>
<P>
   Auction Tracker is set initially to support 10 of the
most-trafficked auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   While not as publicized, the new Search Assistant will be
appreciated by a lot of users, especially those new to the
Internet. In essence, what it does is reduce Internet searching to
understandable, everyday language.
</P>
<P>
   All the mechanics of searching are hidden from the user. You
tell Search Assistant what you're looking for, say a name, price or
company, and it fires up the appropriate search engine.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in learning more about Explorer 5.0, check
out Microsoft's promotional material at www.microsoft.com
</P>
<P>
   /mac/ie/default.htm. The site also has an interactive demo of
the product.

 &HT;    Connecting to the blind
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's Center for the Visually Impaired is focusing
on using the computer to give employment and independence to blind
citizens who want to work.
</P>
<P>
   In that connection, the center, located in downtown Atlanta,
works on computer skills and communicates with businesses that may
be able to adapt data-processing and other jobs to the skills of
the blind.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the kinds of skills being developed at the center,
which is funded by the state and private agencies such as the
United Way, blind people work at companies like BellSouth Mobility,
Federal Express, Wachovia Bank, Marriott, MARTA and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, if human resources people look beyond the supposed
handicap, they will see dependable employees who are likely to
stick for a long time because they value their opportunity,'' said
Susan Bernardo, the center's adaptive technology coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   For people interested in the center's programs, Bernardo said
the guidelines are few but important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good typing skills, not the hunt-and-peck variety, are very
important,'' said Bernardo. The center has its own typing or
keyboarding classes.
</P>
<P>
   Good typists are then introduced to special computer software
that can translate text to speech, which is the primary means the
blind person uses to process material on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the partially blind, the mouse is put aside in favor
of keystrokes for opening, processing, closing and organizing
files.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sighted people don't even realize it, but nearly everything
done with the mouse can be done from the keyboard,'' Bernardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Paper documents that come to the blind worker can be scanned on
a machine adjacent to the computer and converted quickly to
electronic files, which then can be handled by the worker.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are exceptions, most blind workers can work only
on text files because it is harder for them to process files with
pictures and graphics _ although some programs can help the blind
operator identify pictures though they cannot see them.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, with the help of the staff at the Center for the
Visually Impaired, many of the information or data-processing jobs
in business can be adapted to the software learned by the blind at
the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can adapt the processes, or companies can contract out that
work to others,'' Bernardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Zibula, marketing and public relations assistant at the
center, said there is a challenge in helping businesses understand
the capabilities of the blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sighted person looks at her computer, then closes her eyes
and imagines being blind and shakes her head, certain that the
machine cannot be operated without sight,'' Zibula said. ``But that
is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Blind people, either through experience or training, learn to
memorize better than others the organization of files in the
systems they use. They therefore depend less on random searching
and other common procedures used by sighted workers to find and
organize their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail, which is the most common form of computer
communication, is used a lot to send work and receive work from
blind workers,'' Bernardo said, partly because it is formatted in a
familiar way and can be adapted to many tasks.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a satisfying skill because it opens communication
between the blind person and fellow workers and with family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Zibula, who is blind, carries around a remarkable device, not
much larger than the now-familiar PalmPilot, called a Braille Lite,
which operates on the Braille system to fetch files from computers
and then allows her to read them, process them and store them in
computers as regular text files.
</P>
<P>
   It can store and manage about 2 megabytes of material at once,
about equal to two floppy disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carry this everywhere with me; I'd rather dispose of my
microwave than this machine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While agencies like the Center for the Visually Impaired expand
their daily work to put the blind into the work force, others such
as the Graphics, Visualization &AMP; Usability Center in Georgia Tech's
College of Computer Science work the frontiers to create new ways
for the blind and other people with disabilities to work with new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, advances are being made in translating not only
text but various kinds of graphics into auditory form, which will
further expand the abilities of the blind to work and function.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it would be very helpful to the blind if people would
simply realize that computers allow them to work and carry
responsibility in practically any kind of organization or
company,'' said Zibula.
</P>
<P>
   ``An estimated 75 percent of the blind are either unemployed or
underemployed, but with the computer that record could be
improved.''

 &HT;    Polaroid's new digital line offers variety
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Storing family photos as data and sending them by
e-mail across the country is one of the more enjoyable uses for a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   And digital cameras, one of the most direct ways to capture an
image for storage in the computer, are available at prices
appropriate for the family photographer if you aren't too fussy
about exceptional photo quality.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid, the company that pioneered instant photography, has
jumped into the digital camera market with a line of cameras that
starts with inexpensive models for children and goes up to a
megapixel model for the discriminating photo hobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of digital picture images is measured in pixels,
the colored dots that combine to make up the picture. A megapixel
image is made up of about a million dots.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the range of Polaroid's digital cameras is the
PhotoMAX PDC 640 digital camera that has started showing up in some
local stores. It has a resolution of 640 by 480 pixels, about a
third of a megapixel.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras in that range produce photos that look fine on a
computer screen, but large prints on paper aren't very sharp.
</P>
<P>
   The PhotoMAX PDC 640, though, has a lot of features to recommend
it, including a price of only about $200. Megapixel cameras usually
start at about twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   The 640 functions like a typical point-and-shoot film camera
only it doesn't use film. It has an automatic flash and an
automatic focus feature. It stores up to 96 images on its memory
card. And when its first 2 megabyte SmartMedia card is full, you
can pop in another.
</P>
<P>
   The camera comes packaged with a kit that includes a PhotoMAX
2.0 Image Maker software CD, personal computer and television
cables, an AC adapter and instructions both in written and online
form.

   ATLANTA _ Meet the first real cyborg in the February issue of
Wired magazine. It's a British computer scientist named Kevin
Warwick who has a silicon chip implanted in his arm. The chip
communicates via radio waves with computers in Warwick's lab at the
University of Reading, just west of London. When he enters the lab,
the computers inside know who he is and greet him with a ``hello.''
Warwick and his chip are part of a new but growing field of
computer engineering in which engineers are trying to embed
computing power into people.

 &HT;    One hip rhythm clip
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you can't wait for Sony's Memorystick Walkman
to come out, might I suggest picking up its Music Clip ($300,
www.sony.com) to sate that hankering to rock out on Internet tunes.
The clip comes in silver or black and is about the size of a really
fat pen. The Clip ports directly with Sony's VAIO USB connectors
(or any other PC USB connectors) and comes with the ability to
decode MP3s and ATRAC3s. The device also comes complete with a
built-in 64MB flash memory card _ which will allow up to 120
minutes of music files _ and an onboard equalizing system with
``rock,'' ``pop'' and ``jazz'' presets. Once everything is
downloaded, just plug in your favorite set of headphones and you
have an instant party in your head. The Music Clip is bundled with
OpenMG Jukebox, so you can manage your music files. This program
allows you to download and organize music files as well as record
and store your favorite tunes from your favorite CDs.

 &HT;    Magazine rates best sites for buying or selling homes
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few things are as frustrating as buying something big
and finding out later that you could have had it for less. And
maybe nowhere does buyer's remorse hit harder than when you buy a
home. Realtors charge fees that can be negotiated. Mortgage company
costs can be flexible, and the price of a home can vary, depending
on location and time.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can be a good source of information for all those
things. The February issue of Yahoo Internet Life issues report
cards on the slew of real estate-related Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The critique starts with a thorough look at some of the sites
that aspire to portaldom, grading them for the quality and quantity
of listings, the site's tools, the research capabilities and the
extras.
</P>
<P>
   Realtor.com rated highest, receiving an overall B+ ranking. It
was praised for having ``the mother lode'' of listings, with 1.3
million homes in the database. Features such as saved search
criteria and virtual tours gave it a B for tools. Extras such as
articles, message boards and e-mails when a new listing matches
your search criteria earned Realtor.com a B+.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Network's Home Advisor, homeadvisor.com, received
a B rating. The site was noted for its research features, which
include guides, tips and FAQs that cover each aspect of the
home-buying process. The site was criticized because of its spotty
neighborhood information.
</P>
<P>
   Homes.com was average. The site had more than 700,000 listings,
but the coverage was spotty: Manhattan had 1,400 listings, San
Francisco 49. The research tools won't let users save listings of
favorite homes, but the site sends users e-mail of new listings.
</P>
<P>
   Homeseekers.com and Cyberhomes.com graded poorly. Homeseekers
has an uneven distribution of 680,000 home listings. The
neighborhood information, however, is limited and the site offers
no FAQs, guides or tutorials, often crucial for first-time users.
Cyberhomes' coverage was weak. There were no listings for
Cleveland; Austin, Texas; or San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For people trying to sell their home, owners.com ranked highest.
The site lets sellers list their homes themselves, replacing the
Realtor and saving a fee that could amount to 6 percent or more.
The listing is free, and users can post a photograph of their
house. A link to homepricecheck.com gives users an idea of what
prices other homes in the area are fetching. The basic listing
appears for three months. A ``premium'' placement costs somewhere
between $89 and $139.
</P>
<P>
   Moving.com was rated the best site for people looking to move.
The site includes a database of licensed movers, including local,
long-distance or international outfits. The site includes a link to
the U.S. Postal Service's change-of-address forms.
</P>
<P>
   One site taps into some of the national interest in home
restoration. Improvenet.com rated tops among home-building and
remodeling sites. Users can fill out a form detailing their
project, whether a repair or a home construction, and local
contractors, designers and architects can bid on the work.
</P>
<P>
   The best home-financing site was eloan.com, according to the
magazine. The site asks a few questions, then suggests the type of
loan best-suited for the user's needs _ fixed-rate, adjustable-rate
or a mix. The site searches more than 70 lenders, including Chase,
the Money Store and Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The article also included these rankings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The best site for virtual home tours, homeseekers.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Homefair.com offered the best information about neighborhoods,
including unemployment rates, household incomes, climate
information and student-teacher ratios.
</P>
<P>
   _ The best-rated place to find a real estate agent, should you
decide to go that route, is homegain.com. Users can submit a
profile describing what they want to buy or sell, and homegain.com
sends the information to local agents. Interested agents then send
proposals back to the site, along with their credentials, sales
history and commission rate.

 &HT;    Wine CD-ROM tells more than you may want to know
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I should preface this review of a CD-ROM called Oz
Clarke's Ultimate Wine Guide by saying that I am no student of the
grape, nor much of a consumer of it. Put a glass of it in front of
me and I'll try it. If it doesn't cross my eyeballs I'll be polite
and drink most, or even all, of it, but I'll rarely have a refill.
</P>
<P>
   So when I plugged in this CD from DK, the first thing that
caught my eye on the opening page was a section called ``When to
Drink Wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I'm just drinking it at the wrong time, I thought, an
hour too early or something like that, so I double-clicked there.
What resulted was a page entitled ``When to Drink Wine: a Guide to
Laying Down.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem evident that if you need a guide to lying down,
your problem is not when to drink but when to stop drinking.
Personally I am well-versed in the art of lying down, seldom
missing an opportunity to do so, and was about to depart the page
when I realized my misapprehension. Clarke was talking about the
best time in the life of a wine to drink it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, one thing led to another, and finally to the annual
vintage reports from New South Wales, Australia, where one learns
that in 1999, the Hunter Valley had rain at the wrong times and it
wasn't a memorable year for red varieties (no Brokenwood Graveyard
Shiraz will be produced) and Orange and Mudgee also had a wet
vintage and rot was a big problem.
</P>
<P>
   Well, enough of that. On to Mr. Clarke himself.
</P>
<P>
   He is well represented here by numerous video clips and proves
to be a man much given to lip-smacking, gestures of epicurean
ecstacy and all the other things that seem to be required of a wine
connoisseur. I suppose if you are going to get into wine
appreciation you have to learn to say things like ``buttery spice
wrapped around a warm, mouth-filling center of very ripe sweet
fruit. Powerful, long finish.'' You probably also need to
understand them.
</P>
<P>
   All that aside, this CD seems to be an extremely useful tool for
those who want to learn a lot about wine and its accouterments.
Clarke leaves no stone that I can see unturned. There is a section
on matching wines with food and a long dissertation on the art of
wine tasting (which, stupidly enough, I imagined to involve nothing
more than getting it into your mouth, tasting and and then
swallowing or spitting it out, as warranted).
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who merely wish to avoid embarrassment at
dinner, the Wine Selector is just the ticket. Here you can click on
food match, and by selecting from a list and then from variations,
get very close to the kind of food you intend to serve. You don't
have to be into cordon bleu dishes, either.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you're going to serve chili, and you're enough of a
twit that you want to serve a wine with that. Clarke won't let you
down. Unless you narrow the search further by specifying the
location from which your wine should emanate, you get a selection
of 52 wines, every last one of them two stars out of three. For
instance: Steele Catfish Vineyard Zinfandel, a spicy blockbuster
red, which tastes like brambly fruit with ripe spice flavors, full,
smoothly textured and capable of some age, with a list of its best
years. If you then go to the search screen and enter Steele, you'll
find these wines range from moderately priced to very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more useful to put the price range with the rest of
the information, since you may not want to break the bank on
something with which to wash down chili. Nonetheless, making up a
list of possibilities from the selector, printing them out and
taking them to the store will at least save you a conversation with
some fruity-flavored, full-bodied, long-finished wine peddler.
</P>

 &HT;    Radio reception rotten? Just add an old-fashioned antenna
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I grew up in a world of antennas.
</P>
<P>
   In those ``Leave It to Beaver'' days, each house, no matter how
ramshackle, had shiny tentacles of aluminum on top. We thought them
beautiful. Those antennas were proud proof that Arkadelphia, Ark.,
was connected with the larger world.
</P>
<P>
   As a ham radio operator, I had antennas of my own. There were
tubular aluminum beams that dwarfed the TV antennas and long wire
shortwave antennas that stretched from pecan tree to pecan tree.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what I knew as a kid is outdated now. But what I learned
about antennas still comes in handy.
</P>
<P>
   One co-worker has a mountain home, and reception for AM and FM
broadcasts is dicey. An antenna can solve that problem. While you
may not have an isolated mountain home, there are probably times
when a good antenna can help. In my own house, some of the FM
stations have signals too weak for good reception. And there are
times when I want to listen to a football game being played in
Arkansas and broadcast on an AM station there. Without an antenna,
I would be out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   A technology older than Marconi _ the antenna _ can help you
pull in signals your radio couldn't ordinarily receive. You'll need
a radio that has connectors for an external antenna (almost every
stereo receiver has both AM and FM antenna terminals). But, before
we are done, I'll also tell you a tiny trick that also may help the
reception for a radio without antenna terminals.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with the easiest way to improve your reception for
FM. Simply buy an old-fashioned television rabbit ear antenna and
connect it to the FM antenna terminals. You may need an adapter if
the rabbit ears have a coaxial connector such as the one used for
most modern TVs. But the adapters are easy to find at electronics
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit ears should do the trick unless you live in a really
remote area. If the reception is still marginal, you will need an
outside antenna. Luckily, that's something you can do for yourself,
and it doesn't have to be as elaborate as one of the old-fashioned
television antennas. You can find simple outdoor FM antennas,
including some designed to be hidden under the eaves, at
electronics stores. Also buy coaxial cable _ the people at the
store can recommend the type you need _ to connect the antenna.
</P>
<P>
   For AM signals, an outdoor antenna can make a huge difference.
Your FM antenna won't help. You'll need a separate one. But a less
elaborate antenna _ literally copper wire strung between two trees
_ will do fine. Radio Shack sells a shortwave antenna kit for about
$14 that includes everything you need, including insulators and
lead-in wire. Even though the kit is made for shortwave reception,
it will work fine on the AM broadcast band.
</P>
<P>
   I know that many of you won't go to all that trouble. So here's
a trick from the days when every radio was tuned to ``The Green
Hornet'' or ``The Lone Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have an external antenna and you can't quite pull
in a wavering AM signal, wrap several turns of the AC power cord
around the radio. That forms an antenna of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   And antennas, as any kid in Arkadelphia, Ark., could have told
you, can be very beautiful.

 &HT;    Oh, stick it in your ear!

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hey! There's a guy walking down the street
talking to himself! No, wait a second, he has an earpiece and it's
attached to a cell phone. You thought cell phones were annoying
enough as it is, but this new attachment for the phone takes the
cell to newly annoying heights. People claim the new attachment is
designed to avoid radiation, but we know this is yet another
advancement in cell phone vanity. In particular, the Jabra headset
attachment ranks as the most annoying. The headphone fits snugly
into the ear and a wire, holding an inconspicuous plastic
microphone, runs down to the cell phone. Now people who wanted to
look cool talking on their cell phones can look cooler by looking
like they're talking to no one at all.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   With football winding down, it's time to once again concentrate
on basketball as our primary sport of choice. Just in time for the
switch is 989 Studios' NBA Shootout 2000 ($50; www.989studios.com).
This Playstation game is a definite improvement over its
predecessor. The newest version has great graphics and rim-rocking
action. Where a lot of the basketball games lack in action (how fun
could running up and down a court shooting and scoring really be?),
Shootout 2000 excels with its Total Control shooting _ each shot is
made on a graphic meter where you measure your shot. There is also
a cool ``create-a-dunk'' feature where you design how you want your
players to crush the ball into the net. If you're looking for
handheld b-ball action, look no further than Nintendo Gameboy's NBA
3 on 3 ($30, www.nintendo.com, for the Gameboy). This is NBA action
in the palm of your hand that plays incredibly well for its smaller
format. In the game, you pick three NBA team players to go up
against another team's. The game has a fun season function that is
automatically continued every time you turn on the game. Also, look
out for those monster jams. This game does a close-up of player
taking the ball to the hole.
</P>
<P>
   You know who Lara Croft, the busty heroine of the ``Tomb
Raider'' games, reminds us of? Roger Moore. Roger Moore made his
entire career off of being James Bond. All he was _ or ever will be
_ is James Bond. As a result, everything he has acted in since
``Live and Let Die'' has been some sort of minute twist on James
Bond. He never changes his character, and that's what's so annoying
about him. It is also the problem with Lara Croft. Tomb Raider: The
Last Revelation ($50; www.eidos.com) is the fourth game in a video
game franchise that has won the hearts of prepubescent boys across
the nation. Unfortunately, the game hasn't changed much since it
was introduced three years ago. This time, Lara is back in Egypt
and accidentally unleashes an evil Egyptian god. She must quash the
god before it's too late. Just like Moore reciting that annoying
line (``Bond, James Bond''), the Tomb Raider game hasn't changed:
she looks the same, she sounds the same and the controls are the
same. The one saving grace is that this game harkens back to the
first ``Tomb Raider.'' It is action-packed and less dependent on
the puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Combining addictive, chesslike game play with atmospheric
settings and an interesting menagerie of monsters, Odium ($40;
www.lith.com; for the PC) doesn't try to break ground in the
turn-based role-playing genre but rather tries to create a game
that's a whole lot of fun. At that goal it succeeds admirably.
Guide a small international team of soldiers into a
post-apocalyptic Russian nightmare where monsters and secrets lurk.
The downside: Amateurish voice acting, thin characters and
plotting, some interface clunkiness and tiresome cinematic scenes
that must be endured between actual game play. The upside: A
well-paced and challenging game that requires careful resource
management and some fairly deep thinking. Bottom line: What could
be higher praise than finding yourself awake at 2 a.m., emotionally
involved in Odium and struggling to find the next secret or defeat
the next set of monsters?
</P>
<P>
   Half-Life, the stunning horror-adventure game that still has us
intrigued two years after its release, has finally gotten the
sequel treatment _ well, sort of. Half-Life: Opposing Force ($40;
www.sierrastudios. com; PC only), the first official add-on to
Half-Life, is likely the most complete expansion pack to a game
we've ever seen. Instead of just adding a few levels or new weapons
to the original game, the folks at Sierra Studios instead unleash a
new adventure that takes the original premise _ escape from the
Black Mesa research lab as scientist Gordon Freeman _ and
flip-flops it. Now you play as one of the marines sent in to
eradicate Freeman. The game runs along the same timeline as the
original Half-Life and explores some of the same locations,
inserting new pieces to the story's plot. Adding to that new
monsters, new weapons and new characters to interact with, Opposing
Force takes the concept of the add-on pack and raises the bar as
far as Half-Life did for PC games. Is it worth what you'd pay for a
brand-new game? For fans of the original, Half-Life is still one of
the best single-player games in existence, and Opposing Force is
more of the same.

 &HT;    Snow fails to show in Georgia
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Weather forecasters had predicted a major snowstorm in
the northern half of Georgia over the weekend, when Atlanta played
host to the biggest of all football games: the Super Bowl. Instead,
residents and visitors in town for the game were treated to a slow,
freezing drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there was no repeat of the huge power failures from
last weekend's ice storm, which left about 500,000 Georgians
without electricity, some of them for days. This time there were
scattered outages, but most were repaired quickly. Some of the
outages, though, affected MARTA train service, which many people
were using to get to Super Bowl events downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem this time was icy roads, which caused a
large number of wrecks across North Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   MIDDLE SCHOOLERS LIGHTING UP
</P>
<P>
   About one in every eight middle school students uses some form
of tobacco, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 National Youth Tobacco Survey was conducted from
September to October of this year. It is the first survey to look
at tobacco use by middle schoolers. It asked students whether they
had used tobacco within the past 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that about 9 percent of middle school students
smoked cigarettes. About 6 percent smoked cigars. About 3 percent
used dip or chewing tobacco. About 2 percent used flavored
cigarettes called ``bidis,'' and 2 percent smoked clove cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
Foundation and the American Legacy Foundation, a group dedicated to
reducing tobacco use among young people.

   BURGER KING WILL TRADE `POKE BALLS' FOR FRIES

   If you have any ``Poke Balls,'' the plastic containers that hold
Pokemon toys from Burger King, give them to your parents
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-month-old baby suffocated last week when half of a Poke Ball
covered his mouth and nose. Another baby died in December in the
same type of accident.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 million of the toys were handed out with Burger
King's children's meals last year. Burger King will give you a free
order of french fries if you return a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King said it will start running TV commercials on Tuesday
warning parents about the toys.

 &HT;    Memory chips race to catch up to processors
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The advent of lightning-fast microprocessors
running at 700 megahertz and more has put pressure on the rest of
the electronics innards in personal computers to pick up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the pressure is coming down on the companies that
make lots of computer memories, including Korea's Samsung and
Hyundai and Micron Technology of Boise, Idaho. Among them, those
three companies controlled about 60 percent of the $20 billion
memory market last year.
</P>
<P>
   If computer users are going to harness the latest whiz-bang
processing performance, their computers had better have memory
chips that are running lickety split. If memory chips cannot keep
pace, then those fast and expensive new processor chips will be
sitting idle most of the time and not earning their keep.
</P>
<P>
   Memory chip makers have created a series of faster memory
technologies throughout the 1990s. Usually, after a short period of
time, the new standard dominates and all the world's memory makers
shift their production to the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   But this year and next year, things could go differently. Two
competing standards could emerge, and, if they do, then life gets a
little more complicated for the companies that make computers and
for PC buyers as well.
</P>
<P>
   The big driver behind this industry shift is Intel Corp., which
makes most of the computer world's microprocessors, and, because of
that, has become the biggest, richest and most powerful chip
company.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, more than most companies, depends on memory chip
performance getting faster. Without that steady progression, the
improvements Intel makes in processor speeds won't translate to
significant increases in computer performance. And if that happens,
then Intel's incredible profit margins from processor sales are in
jeopardy. Intel would have a hard time commanding big price
premiums for its processor chips if it couldn't show that they make
computers work faster.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is pushing hard for the industry to adopt a new kind of
fast memory, promoted by a small Silicon Valley company called
Rambus Inc. Rambus had designed special circuitry for memory chips
that lets memory chips spit out streams of information more rapidly
than before.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus technology, for example, has been used in memory chips
that go into Nintendo 64 game consoles in order to deliver more
graphics information faster to meet the demands of graphics-hungry
game players.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Memory chip makers must pay Rambus Inc. a royalty _ typically
between 1/2 and 1 percent _ for every Rambus chip they make. And
Rambus chips, because they contain extra circuitry, are larger that
standard chips. That means they are more expensive to make.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those added costs and because of some recent delays
at Intel, memory chip makers haven't been chomping at the bit to
make Rambus memories. Samsung has been the most active Rambus
manufacturer. Because supplies have been limited, analysts say
Rambus chips cost about three times more than conventional memories
right now.
</P>
<P>
   That has slowed their adoption in computers. Dell Computer Corp.
is one of the few big computer makers that makes and promotes
high-end computers with Rambus chips. Dell chief executive Michael
Dell was an early investor in Rambus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the industry is sticking with conventional memory chips
that run at 100 megahertz. That's what Samsung's Austin factory
presently makes. Soon, however, those conventional chips are
expected to speed up to 133 megahertz, resulting in performance
boost of about 10 percent that will show up in some computers.
</P>
<P>
   Even faster versions of conventional chips, employing something
called Double Data Rate technology, are on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   So who wins this battle of technologies? Different analysts have
different ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest Inc.'s Jim Handy says the smart money has to stick
with Intel and the technology that Intel supports. Because Intel is
backing Rambus, Handy believes that Rambus will capture about 15
percent of the memory market this year and more than half the
market next year.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, Handy believes, is simply too powerful a force in the
computer business for memory chip makers to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Mike Feibus of Mercury Research in Scottsdale,
Ariz., isn't so sure. Maybe there will be two high-speed memory
standards, he says, because Intel's main rival in the processor
business, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., doesn't seem interested in
backing the Rambus standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still on the fence about which memory technology is
going to dominate,'' Feibus said last week. ``So far, we haven't
seen much movement toward Rambus.''
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of next year, the question of which technology
will win will probably be settled. In the meantime, there is plenty
of uncertainty in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be one of the most fascinating years ever in
the computer industry,'' Feibus said.

 &HT;    Polaroid's new digital line offers variety
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Storing family photos as data and sending them by
e-mail across the country is one of the more enjoyable uses for a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   And digital cameras, one of the most direct ways to capture an
image for storage in the computer, are available at prices
appropriate for the family photographer if you aren't too fussy
about exceptional photo quality.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid, the company that pioneered instant photography, has
jumped into the digital camera market with a line of cameras that
starts with inexpensive models for children and goes up to a
megapixel model for the discriminating photo hobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of digital picture images is measured in pixels,
the colored dots that combine to make up the picture. A megapixel
image is made up of about a million dots.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the range of Polaroid's digital cameras is the
PhotoMAX PDC 640 digital camera that has started showing up in some
local stores. It has a resolution of 640 by 480 pixels, about a
third of a megapixel.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras in that range produce photos that look fine on a
computer screen, but large prints on paper aren't very sharp.
</P>
<P>
   The PhotoMAX PDC 640, though, has a lot of features to recommend
it, including a price of only about $200. Megapixel cameras usually
start at about twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   The 640 functions like a typical point-and-shoot film camera

 &HT;    One hip rhythm clip
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you can't wait for Sony's Memorystick Walkman
to come out, might I suggest picking up its Music Clip ($300,
www.sony.com) to sate that hankering to rock out on Internet tunes.
The clip comes in silver or black and is about the size of a really
fat pen. The Clip ports directly with Sony's VAIO USB connectors
(or any other PC USB connectors) and comes with the ability to
decode MP3s and ATRAC3s. The device also comes complete with a
built-in 64MB flash memory card _ which will allow up to 120
minutes of music files _ and an onboard equalizing system with
``rock,'' ``pop'' and ``jazz'' presets. Once everything is
downloaded, just plug in your favorite set of headphones and you
have an instant party in your head. The Music Clip is bundled with
OpenMG Jukebox, so you can manage your music files. This program
allows you to download and organize music files as well as record
and store your favorite tunes from your favorite CDs.

 &HT;    Kids mixed on Elian's fate
 &HT;    By Anne Y. Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We asked sixth- and seventh-graders around Atlanta
what they think should happen to the 6-year-old Cuban boy caught in
an international custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez was found on Thanksgiving 1999 clinging to an
inner tube in water off the Florida coast. His mother and
stepfather drowned while fleeing Cuba by boat.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father still lives in Cuba. His great-aunt and uncle
want him to stay in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cubans risk their lives to make the 90-mile crossing to the
United States because they believe they would be better off in this
country. Cuba has a Communist government. Here are some excerpts of
the kids' opinions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Roe Hunter, 13, Lost Mountain Middle School, Cobb County
</P>
<P>
   ``He was illegally brought in, but I think he should stay. I
don't think he really wants to go back, because Cuba is Communist
and I don't think it's a very good place for a child to grow up in
a Communist situation.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Elizabeth Cogburn, 13, the Schenck School, Fulton County
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he is an illegal immigrant, he should have to go back to
Cuba. I think it would be good for him to have a happier life in
the United States or Cuba and not a long court thing where he's in
between places.''
</P>
<P>
   _ LaKeisha Holmes, 11, Shamrock Middle School, DeKalb County
</P>
<P>
   ``He should go back with his dad. He probably is not old enough
to make any of his own decisions because he's only 6. His dad can
make the decisions for him.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Patrick McGlynn, 12, S.M. Inman Middle School, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think he should go back to Cuba because that's where
his grandparents and his dad are. It makes me feel sorry for him,
because I don't think he knows what's really going on, and I don't
think he knows who he wants to be with.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tori Godfrey, 12, Sweetwater Middle School, Gwinnett County
</P>
<P>
   ``If his mother wanted him to come to America, then he should be
able to. His mother probably wanted him to go to America for a
particular reason, like maybe to have a better education and for
freedom.''

 &HT;    Connecting to the blind
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's Center for the Visually Impaired is focusing
on using the computer to give employment and independence to blind
citizens who want to work.
</P>
<P>
   In that connection, the center, located in downtown Atlanta,
works on computer skills and communicates with businesses that may
be able to adapt data-processing and other jobs to the skills of
the blind.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the kinds of skills being developed at the center,
which is funded by the state and private agencies such as the
United Way, blind people work at companies like BellSouth Mobility,
Federal Express, Wachovia Bank, Marriott, MARTA and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, if human resources people look beyond the supposed
handicap, they will see dependable employees who are likely to
stick for a long time because they value their opportunity,'' said
Susan Bernardo, the center's adaptive technology coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   For people interested in the center's programs, Bernardo said
the guidelines are few but important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good typing skills, not the hunt-and-peck variety, are very
important,'' said Bernardo. The center has its own typing or
keyboarding classes.
</P>
<P>
   Good typists are then introduced to special computer software
that can translate text to speech, which is the primary means the
blind person uses to process material on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the partially blind, the mouse is put aside in favor
of keystrokes for opening, processing, closing and organizing
files.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sighted people don't even realize it, but nearly everything
done with the mouse can be done from the keyboard,'' Bernardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Paper documents that come to the blind worker can be scanned on
a machine adjacent to the computer and converted quickly to
electronic files, which then can be handled by the worker.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are exceptions, most blind workers can work only
on text files because it is harder for them to process files with
pictures and graphics _ although some programs can help the blind
operator identify pictures though they cannot see them.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, with the help of the staff at the Center for the
Visually Impaired, many of the information or data-processing jobs
in business can be adapted to the software learned by the blind at
the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can adapt the processes, or companies can contract out that
work to others,'' Bernardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Zibula, marketing and public relations assistant at the
center, said there is a challenge in helping businesses understand
the capabilities of the blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sighted person looks at her computer, then closes her eyes
and imagines being blind and shakes her head, certain that the
machine cannot be operated without sight,'' Zibula said. ``But that
is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Blind people, either through experience or training, learn to
memorize better than others the organization of files in the
systems they use. They therefore depend less on random searching
and other common procedures used by sighted workers to find and
organize their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail, which is the most common form of computer
communication, is used a lot to send work and receive work from
blind workers,'' Bernardo said, partly because it is formatted in a
familiar way and can be adapted to many tasks.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a satisfying skill because it opens communication
between the blind person and fellow workers and with family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Zibula, who is blind, carries around a remarkable device, not
much larger than the now-familiar PalmPilot, called a Braille Lite,
which operates on the Braille system to fetch files from computers
and then allows her to read them, process them and store them in
computers as regular text files.
</P>
<P>
   It can store and manage about 2 megabytes of material at once,
about equal to two floppy disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carry this everywhere with me; I'd rather dispose of my
microwave than this machine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While agencies like the Center for the Visually Impaired expand
their daily work to put the blind into the work force, others such
as the Graphics, Visualization &AMP; Usability Center in Georgia Tech's
College of Computer Science work the frontiers to create new ways
for the blind and other people with disabilities to work with new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, advances are being made in translating not only
text but various kinds of graphics into auditory form, which will
further expand the abilities of the blind to work and function.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it would be very helpful to the blind if people would
simply realize that computers allow them to work and carry
responsibility in practically any kind of organization or
company,'' said Zibula.
</P>
<P>
   ``An estimated 75 percent of the blind are either unemployed or
underemployed, but with the computer that record could be
improved.''

 &HT;    Magazine rates best sites for buying or selling homes
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few things are as frustrating as buying something big
and finding out later that you could have had it for less. And
maybe nowhere does buyer's remorse hit harder than when you buy a
home. Realtors charge fees that can be negotiated. Mortgage company
costs can be flexible, and the price of a home can vary, depending
on location and time.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can be a good source of information for all those
things. The February issue of Yahoo Internet Life issues report
cards on the slew of real estate-related Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The critique starts with a thorough look at some of the sites
that aspire to portaldom, grading them for the quality and quantity
of listings, the site's tools, the research capabilities and the
extras.
</P>
<P>
   Realtor.com rated highest, receiving an overall B+ ranking. It
was praised for having ``the mother lode'' of listings, with 1.3
million homes in the database. Features such as saved search
criteria and virtual tours gave it a B for tools. Extras such as
articles, message boards and e-mails when a new listing matches
your search criteria earned Realtor.com a B+.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Network's Home Advisor, homeadvisor.com, received
a B rating. The site was noted for its research features, which
include guides, tips and FAQs that cover each aspect of the
home-buying process. The site was criticized because of its spotty
neighborhood information.
</P>
<P>
   Homes.com was average. The site had more than 700,000 listings,
but the coverage was spotty: Manhattan had 1,400 listings, San
Francisco 49. The research tools won't let users save listings of
favorite homes, but the site sends users e-mail of new listings.
</P>
<P>
   Homeseekers.com and Cyberhomes.com graded poorly. Homeseekers
has an uneven distribution of 680,000 home listings. The
neighborhood information, however, is limited and the site offers
no FAQs, guides or tutorials, often crucial for first-time users.
Cyberhomes' coverage was weak. There were no listings for
Cleveland; Austin, Texas; or San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For people trying to sell their home, owners.com ranked highest.
The site lets sellers list their homes themselves, replacing the
Realtor and saving a fee that could amount to 6 percent or more.
The listing is free, and users can post a photograph of their
house. A link to homepricecheck.com gives users an idea of what
prices other homes in the area are fetching. The basic listing
appears for three months. A ``premium'' placement costs somewhere
between $89 and $139.
</P>
<P>
   Moving.com was rated the best site for people looking to move.
The site includes a database of licensed movers, including local,
long-distance or international outfits. The site includes a link to
the U.S. Postal Service's change-of-address forms.
</P>
<P>
   One site taps into some of the national interest in home
restoration. Improvenet.com rated tops among home-building and
remodeling sites. Users can fill out a form detailing their
project, whether a repair or a home construction, and local
contractors, designers and architects can bid on the work.
</P>
<P>
   The best home-financing site was eloan.com, according to the
magazine. The site asks a few questions, then suggests the type of
loan best-suited for the user's needs _ fixed-rate, adjustable-rate
or a mix. The site searches more than 70 lenders, including Chase,
the Money Store and Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The article also included these rankings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The best site for virtual home tours, homeseekers.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Homefair.com offered the best information about neighborhoods,
including unemployment rates, household incomes, climate
information and student-teacher ratios.
</P>
<P>
   _ The best-rated place to find a real estate agent, should you
decide to go that route, is homegain.com. Users can submit a
profile describing what they want to buy or sell, and homegain.com
sends the information to local agents. Interested agents then send
proposals back to the site, along with their credentials, sales
history and commission rate.

 &HT;    Radio reception rotten? Just add an old-fashioned antenna
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I grew up in a world of antennas.
</P>
<P>
   In those ``Leave It to Beaver'' days, each house, no matter how
ramshackle, had shiny tentacles of aluminum on top. We thought them
beautiful. Those antennas were proud proof that Arkadelphia, Ark.,
was connected with the larger world.
</P>
<P>
   As a ham radio operator, I had antennas of my own. There were
tubular aluminum beams that dwarfed the TV antennas and long wire
shortwave antennas that stretched from pecan tree to pecan tree.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what I knew as a kid is outdated now. But what I learned
about antennas still comes in handy.
</P>
<P>
   One co-worker has a mountain home, and reception for AM and FM
broadcasts is dicey. An antenna can solve that problem. While you
may not have an isolated mountain home, there are probably times
when a good antenna can help. In my own house, some of the FM
stations have signals too weak for good reception. And there are
times when I want to listen to a football game being played in
Arkansas and broadcast on an AM station there. Without an antenna,
I would be out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   A technology older than Marconi _ the antenna _ can help you
pull in signals your radio couldn't ordinarily receive. You'll need
a radio that has connectors for an external antenna (almost every
stereo receiver has both AM and FM antenna terminals). But, before
we are done, I'll also tell you a tiny trick that also may help the
reception for a radio without antenna terminals.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with the easiest way to improve your reception for
FM. Simply buy an old-fashioned television rabbit ear antenna and
connect it to the FM antenna terminals. You may need an adapter if
the rabbit ears have a coaxial connector such as the one used for
most modern TVs. But the adapters are easy to find at electronics
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit ears should do the trick unless you live in a really
remote area. If the reception is still marginal, you will need an
outside antenna. Luckily, that's something you can do for yourself,
and it doesn't have to be as elaborate as one of the old-fashioned
television antennas. You can find simple outdoor FM antennas,
including some designed to be hidden under the eaves, at
electronics stores. Also buy coaxial cable _ the people at the
store can recommend the type you need _ to connect the antenna.
</P>
<P>
   For AM signals, an outdoor antenna can make a huge difference.
Your FM antenna won't help. You'll need a separate one. But a less
elaborate antenna _ literally copper wire strung between two trees
_ will do fine. Radio Shack sells a shortwave antenna kit for about
$14 that includes everything you need, including insulators and
lead-in wire. Even though the kit is made for shortwave reception,
it will work fine on the AM broadcast band.
</P>
<P>
   I know that many of you won't go to all that trouble. So here's
a trick from the days when every radio was tuned to ``The Green
Hornet'' or ``The Lone Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have an external antenna and you can't quite pull
in a wavering AM signal, wrap several turns of the AC power cord
around the radio. That forms an antenna of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   And antennas, as any kid in Arkadelphia, Ark., could have told
you, can be very beautiful.

 &HT;    DVDs, videotapes always good fit for online shopping
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Online merchants aren't just selling a product, they
are selling convenience. So, many people searching for a DVD or
videotaped movie, even those who live close to well-stocked retail
stores, are buying online.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a person making one more stop on the commute home
from work, the movies arrive at the doorstep. And _ unlike buying a
sweater or a piece of furniture online _ there's no need to worry
if your purchase will look and fit right. A DVD of ``Casablanca''
bought online will be identical to the one you find in the store.
</P>
<P>
   If you are into shopping online, it will come as no surprise
that one of the real leaders in merchandising is Amazon.com. It's
an enormously efficient organization with excellent customer
service. Although some people associate Amazon totally with books,
the strategy of the company has been to be an online merchant of
almost everything that can be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The Amazon.com site at www
</P>
<P>
   .amazon.com has a broad selection of DVDs and videotapes. Prices
are good. In many cases, you'll pay less _ even with shipping _
than typical retail prices. The ability to search for the movie you
want by title, director or actor is pretty standard at most of the
sites reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com does have other features _ not all are exclusive to
Amazon _ that make shopping fun. For one thing, you can view a
list, updated hourly, of the top-selling videos. Even if you're the
sort of person who doesn't like swimming with the stream, it's fun
to see what's hot right now. You can also browse movies by
categories such as comedies, dramas and action.
</P>
<P>
   If you're into DVD, you may prefer a site that specializes in
just that format. That's literally the name of the game at DVD.com
located at www2
</P>
<P>
   .dvdexpress.com/consumer
</P>
<P>
   /movies/. The assortment is excellent and the delivery times _
based on several orders _ are astonishingly short.
</P>
<P>
   One nice feature that DVD.com pushes is the ability to preorder
a DVD. Usually a discounted price is offered for that kind of
order, and if you've been waiting for a specific movie, you can be
sure that you'll be among the first to get it. DVD.com has a handy
list of upcoming releases, and that makes for interesting browsing.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may be reluctant to buy a videotape or DVD, figuring
they'll watch the film once and that will be enough. So a site such
as MovieRent.Com offers that as a possibility. The site at
www.movierent.com
</P>
<P>
   /resources1.htm will be happy to rent the videotape or DVD or
sell it.
</P>
<P>
   This is a nifty site for a lot of reasons. Besides its own
sections within the site, you'll find links to other places on the
Web devoted to movies and DVD.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to discuss DVDs and videotaped movies
without mentioning Blockbuster. Undoubtedly there's a retail outlet
near you. But there's also an outlet on the Web at www
</P>
<P>
   .blockbuster.com.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find a good selection of movies here in both formats. The
prices are on par with those you'd find elsewhere. But one feature
that takes advantage of the Blockbuster retail business is the
ability to buy used videotapes online. The prices are great ...
averaging about $5 each.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you really need to know about a site that doesn't sell
DVDs or videotapes. Instead, it searches the sites that do sell
them and tells you where the bargains are. This truly valuable
service is located at www.moviepriceguide.com.
</P>
<P>
   Since the service is unique and difficult to explain in a few
sentences, go to the page at www.moviepriceguide.com
</P>
<P>
   /aboutus.shtml to read the explanation. It's a free service and
well worth checking out.

 &HT;    Updated Internet Explorer will have major improvements
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the sale of Netscape to America Online, you
probably thought the Internet browser wars were over. Think again.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft may now be the clear leader, but it is readying to
release a new version of its Internet Explorer browser for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Called Internet Explorer 5.0, this version sports a new look, a
faster engine to draw pages and an easier-to-use search feature.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes built-in automated support for those
participating in Internet auctions. The browser's Auction Tracker
feature will keep you posted on how your bid is faring.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Netscape is also readying a new version for
the Mac, but it looks like Explorer is going to be the first to
market, sometime early this year.
</P>
<P>
   As always, both Netscape Navigator and Explorer are free. You
can download the new versions from various sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a close look at some of Explorer's top new features:
</P>
<P>
   What Microsoft seems proudest of, based on the hype in its
promotional material, is something called Tasman. That's the code
name for a new software engine that builds the Web pages you see
within the browser.
</P>
<P>
   Tasman represents a complete rebuild of how Explorer constructs
Web pages. In doing so, Microsoft not only sped up its browser but
added lots of new technologies. For example, Explorer will provide
better support of tables, cascading style sheets and the latest
version of HTML.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, these improvements will work across both platforms.
No longer will a page that works on a PC fail to display on a Mac.
Or so Microsoft claims.
</P>
<P>
   What's received the most media attention in Explorer 5.0 is
Auction Tracker, and it's a pretty cool feature. Basically, once
customized by a user, it will automatically track a bid you've
made. Auction Tracker will alert you if you've been outbid,
enabling you to either drop out or raise your offer.
</P>
<P>
   Auction Tracker is set initially to support 10 of the
most-trafficked auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   While not as publicized, the new Search Assistant will be
appreciated by a lot of users, especially those new to the
Internet. In essence, what it does is reduce Internet searching to
understandable, everyday language.
</P>
<P>
   All the mechanics of searching are hidden from the user. You
tell Search Assistant what you're looking for, say a name, price or
company, and it fires up the appropriate search engine.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in learning more about Explorer 5.0, check
out Microsoft's promotional material at www.microsoft.com
</P>
<P>
   /mac/ie/default.htm. The site also has an interactive demo of
the product.

 &HT;    Chip got under professor's skin
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Meet the first real cyborg in the February issue of
Wired magazine. It's a British computer scientist named Kevin
Warwick who has a silicon chip implanted in his arm. The chip
communicates via radio waves with computers in Warwick's lab at the
University of Reading, just west of London. When he enters the lab,
the computers inside know who he is and greet him with a ``hello.''
Warwick and his chip are part of a new but growing field of
computer engineering in which engineers are trying to embed
computing power into people.
</P>
<P>
   Learn what it's like behind the scenes in the fast-paced world
of start-up tech and Internet companies in Silicon Valley. In ``The
Monk and the Riddle,'' entrepreneur Randy Komisar confides what
it's like. Published by Harvard Business School Press, the book
retails for $22.50.
</P>

<P>
   Who needs snow and ice to do luge racing if you have a computer?
At least that's the idea behind ``Street Luge Racing,'' a new title
from Head Games. In this game, you ride luge sleds with in-line
skating wheels through the streets of big cities, contending with
oncoming traffic, rain-slicked roads and police cars. ``Street Luge
Racing'' is available only for PCs with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sci-Fi Pinball'' is a cross between a television promotion
video and pinball. It's a pinball game that incorporates screen
shots and video clips of some popular movies and TV shows for
teen-agers. You'll find material from ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,''
``Aliens'' and ``The Fly,'' to name a few. Published by Fox
Interactive, ``Sci-Fi Pinball'' is for both PCs and Macs.

   Do you want inexpensive long-distance telephone service but are
overwhelmed by all the company claims? Then check out a site called
10-10phonerates.com. The site offers a price comparison of all the
different 10-10 numbers advertised on television. You'll also find
articles about the services concerning how to compare them and get
a good deal. The site is www.10-10phonerates.com.

 &HT;    Wine CD-ROM tells more than you may want to know
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I should preface this review of a CD-ROM called Oz
Clarke's Ultimate Wine Guide by saying that I am no student of the
grape, nor much of a consumer of it. Put a glass of it in front of
me and I'll try it. If it doesn't cross my eyeballs I'll be polite
and drink most, or even all, of it, but I'll rarely have a refill.
</P>
<P>
   So when I plugged in this CD from DK, the first thing that
caught my eye on the opening page was a section called ``When to
Drink Wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I'm just drinking it at the wrong time, I thought, an
hour too early or something like that, so I double-clicked there.
What resulted was a page entitled ``When to Drink Wine: a Guide to
Laying Down.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem evident that if you need a guide to lying down,
your problem is not when to drink but when to stop drinking.
Personally I am well-versed in the art of lying down, seldom
missing an opportunity to do so, and was about to depart the page
when I realized my misapprehension. Clarke was talking about the
best time in the life of a wine to drink it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, one thing led to another, and finally to the annual
vintage reports from New South Wales, Australia, where one learns
that in 1999, the Hunter Valley had rain at the wrong times and it
wasn't a memorable year for red varieties (no Brokenwood Graveyard
Shiraz will be produced) and Orange and Mudgee also had a wet
vintage and rot was a big problem.
</P>
<P>
   Well, enough of that. On to Mr. Clarke himself.
</P>
<P>
   He is well represented here by numerous video clips and proves
to be a man much given to lip-smacking, gestures of epicurean
ecstacy and all the other things that seem to be required of a wine
connoisseur. I suppose if you are going to get into wine
appreciation you have to learn to say things like ``buttery spice
wrapped around a warm, mouth-filling center of very ripe sweet
fruit. Powerful, long finish.'' You probably also need to
understand them.
</P>
<P>
   All that aside, this CD seems to be an extremely useful tool for
those who want to learn a lot about wine and its accouterments.
Clarke leaves no stone that I can see unturned. There is a section
on matching wines with food and a long dissertation on the art of
wine tasting (which, stupidly enough, I imagined to involve nothing
more than getting it into your mouth, tasting and and then
swallowing or spitting it out, as warranted).
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who merely wish to avoid embarrassment at
dinner, the Wine Selector is just the ticket. Here you can click on
food match, and by selecting from a list and then from variations,
get very close to the kind of food you intend to serve. You don't
have to be into cordon bleu dishes, either.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you're going to serve chili, and you're enough of a
twit that you want to serve a wine with that. Clarke won't let you
down. Unless you narrow the search further by specifying the
location from which your wine should emanate, you get a selection
of 52 wines, every last one of them two stars out of three. For
instance: Steele Catfish Vineyard Zinfandel, a spicy blockbuster
red, which tastes like brambly fruit with ripe spice flavors, full,
smoothly textured and capable of some age, with a list of its best
years. If you then go to the search screen and enter Steele, you'll
find these wines range from moderately priced to very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more useful to put the price range with the rest of
the information, since you may not want to break the bank on
something with which to wash down chili. Nonetheless, making up a
list of possibilities from the selector, printing them out and
taking them to the store will at least save you a conversation with
some fruity-flavored, full-bodied, long-finished wine peddler.
</P>
<P>
   For ordering information, call (877) 884-1600.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: My fiance and I are planning on getting
married in Cancun, Mexico. Do we need to apply for a marriage
license in Texas in order for the marriage to be valid here? Do we
need to take any special documents to Cancun for the marriage
ceremony to be performed? _Klira R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure you want to do this? Many hotels in Mexico have wedding
coordinators because regulations vary from state to state, city to
city. Coordination does not come cheaply, advises the Mexico
Tourism Office _ $250 minimum. Basic requirements? Certified birth
certificates, blood tests within 15 days of the wedding, a copy of
your tourist cards and, if either party has been married
previously, a certified copy of the divorce decree or the former
spouse's death certificate. Call (800) 44MEXICO (800-446-3942) for
details. It is easier to comply with U.S. laws to legally establish
your married status. How about a civil ceremony here and a
religious one in Mexico?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have heard from several people that boiling water in the
microwave can cause it to blow up. Also that dumping powdered
coffee, sugar, etc., in microwaved water can cause the water to
explode. _John Nemetz
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Superheated water'' can occur when water or any other
liquid is heated in a microwave for more than two minutes. The
liquid does not always come to a visible boil in the microwave, but
it could bubble out of the container when taken out. Best advice?
Do not heat liquids in a narrow-neck container and allow them to
stand in the microwave for 30 to 40 seconds before removing or
adding an ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just bought some English bone china tableware with gold
rims _ not marked ``dishwasher safe.'' The manufacturer says they
can go in the dishwasher provided I use liquid dishwashing
detergent. But a salesperson told me detergent would discolor the
gold, and another said the water jets might chip the rims. Can I
safely wash my dishes in the dishwasher? _S.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Occasionally, you can, considering the manufacturer's advice
(no hard water, I hope). Hand washing is preferred for fine china.
Remove large food particles off all the dishes to prevent
scratching during the wash cycle. In addition to using liquid
detergent, load the dishes carefully and turn off the heated drying
cycle. Cool china before unloading. Q: I wonder how many football
players from the University of Texas have been on a winning Super
Bowl team.
</P>
<P>
   _D. Lunceford
</P>
<P>
   A: Quite a few. Thirty different Longhorns have played on 20
teams in the Super Bowl. Eleven have been on a winning side. Two
have done it twice: Dan Neil of the Denver Broncos in 1998 and 1999
and Terry Orr of the Washington Redskins in 1988 and 1992. The
others? John Elliot, Jim Hudson, Pete Lammons and George Sauer of
the 1969 Jets; Ricky Churchman with the 1982 49ers; Bill Heathcock
and Steve McMichael of the 1986 Bears; Raul Allegre of the 1987
Giants; and Terry Tausch of the 1990 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whenever I buy a suit, I am confused about the wool label:
100 percent wool, 100 percent new wool and wool gabardine. What's
the difference with respect to warmth? _Donna Ehrke
</P>
<P>
   A: Wool gabardine is my pick for year-round wearability in a
suit or trousers. Wool absorbs moisture and keeps a layer of dry
air near the skin. One hundred percent wool garments are made from
all wool, which could include wool derived from another wool
fabric, whereas 100 percent new wool garments contain virgin wool
(never part of any other fabric). Wool gabardine is a weave, a
tightly woven wool twill with a high sheen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our company CEO has decided, in order to save money, to turn
off the hot water in the building. I'm convinced that this is
against some health code, city or OSHA or other. Where can I get an
official publication (that I can mail anonymously) that will
convince him to turn the hot water back on? Also, I can no longer
find Sara Lee Chicken and Broccoli Croissants. Has the company
stopped making them? Do I need to make regular ``stock-up'' trips
to the outlet store? _B.P.
</P>
<P>
   A: Occupational Safety and Health Administration spokesman
Lyndol Miller says, ``OSHA requires employees must be provided with
tepid water'' to wash their hands. Want to report this situation
(anonymously or otherwise)? Contact OSHA at (512) 916-5783. If you
spy any chicken and broccoli croissants, buy 'em. Sara Lee recently
ceased production.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a Maytag Neptune washer and cannot use powder
additives. Do you know of any liquid water softener? I would also
like to know what kind of liquid I can add to my wash to take out
men's underarm odor from shirts and T-shirts. _ J and M
</P>
<P>
   A: Maytag Neptune customer service at (888) 462-9824 says you
can use powdered water softeners _ just cut the recommended amount
in half. As for that underarm odor and stain, try an enzyme
detergent like Biz or scrub the area with a toothbrush dipped in
sudsy ammonia or shampoo to loosen body oils before laundering. Q:
I own a 1995 SUV with 200,000 miles. It runs very well, but the
high mileage makes it impractical as a trade-in. My child will be
ready to drive in three years, and this vehicle would be a
practical, relatively safe vehicle for a teen-ager. Is it practical
to store a vehicle this long? What preparations would be necessary?
_ J. M.
</P>
<P>
   A: The best solution is to drive the car every month or so for
about 10 minutes to get the engine warmed up, advises car repair
czar Ben Schotz at Ben's Workshop. This circulates the fluids. If
you are determined to store it rather than drive it, there are a
few general guidelines, notes Schotz. Remove the battery and change
the engine oil and coolant as well as the brake fluid. Remove the
spark plugs, place an ounce of oil in each cylinder and crank the
motor briefly, then replace the spark plugs. Fill the fuel tank to
prevent condensation and get the weight of the vehicle partly off
the tires to prevent flat-spotting. When you are ready to put the
vehicle back on the road, drain and dispose of the fuel properly
(it's no good after three years). Be prepared to replace the
fluids, the battery and perhaps the tires. Driving it occasionally
is a whole lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is that familiar sounding voice in the McDonald's McRib
commercials local Asleep at the Wheel leader Ray Benson? Also, were
the ladies who sang the Southwest Airlines western swing-type ad
from the Austin area? _ R. Ellis
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it is Ray Benson. Those swing singers? Austin's Ethyl &AMP;
Methyl. Talented Austin musicians have appeared in advertisements:
You must have heard Christine Albert as the voice of Blue Bell and
Jerry Jeff Walker and Delbert McClinton in Thundercloud Subs spots.

you are determined to store it rather than drive it, there are a
few general guidelines, notes Schotz. Remove the battery and change
the engine oil and coolant as well as the brake fluid. Remove the
spark plugs, place an ounce of oil in each cylinder and crank the
motor briefly, then replace the spark plugs. Fill the fuel tank to
prevent condensation and get the weight of the vehicle partly off
the tires to prevent flat-spotting. When you are ready to put the
vehicle back on the road, drain and dispose of the fuel properly
(it's no good after three years). Be prepared to replace the
fluids, the battery and perhaps the tires. Driving it occasionally
is a whole lot easier.

 &HT;    `Two of Us' a poignant tale of two Beatles
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's 1976 _ six years after The Beatles'
painful breakup. Paul McCartney is riding around New York City in a
stretch limo. Suddenly he gets a loopy urge to pay John Lennon an
unexpected visit at his spacious Manhattan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Would the bitter and reclusive Lennon let him in? If so, what
would they talk about? Would they even talk at all? Could the
meeting lead to a Beatles reunion?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that visit never took place. But it does happen in
``Two of Us,'' a purely fictional, yet wonderfully insightful and
intimate look at two larger-than-life rock legends, convincingly
played by Aidan Quinn (McCartney) and Jared Harris (Lennon).
</P>
<P>
   Most TV rock movies are simply glorified excuses to play great
music by hit-making artists. The stories wrapped around those
songs, however, are usually tissue thin. But, as Lauren Zalaznick,
VH1's senior vice president of original programming and
development, notes, ``This movie is all about two souls, arguably
the most famous musicians of our time. It's not an excuse for a
Beatles hit parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, VH1 tried to get the rights to some Beatles songs, but
wasn't successful.
</P>
<P>
   The songs weren't necessary, however. On the surface, ``Two of
Us'' is about a long overdue meeting between two music industry
icons. Look deeper and the film is really about friendship and
loss. You don't have to be a Beatles junkie to identify with that.
</P>
<P>
   First-time writer Mark Stanfield wrote a surprisingly
thoughtful, though at times hokey, script. That the script is
insightful is a surprise since Stanfield is only 35, which means he
was in diapers when The Beatles stormed America in 1964. But
Stanfield managed to capture the essence of the gruff Lennon and
laid-back McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney's in New York to play a string of sold-out concerts at
Madison Square Garden, when he decides to visit his old mate on a
whim. But Lennon, essentially a prisoner in his own home, is
reluctant to see him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you don't mind me surprising you,'' McCartney says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too soon to say,'' replies Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   But before long, both are meditating, smoking pot, drinking tea
and talking about old times. They even venture out to Central Park
_ in disguise _ and sing reggae tunes. But the palpable rift
between the two is about as wide as the Big Apple. Lennon gets in a
lot of snipes about McCartney's ``silly love songs.'' And
McCartney's still angry at Lennon for choosing his wife, Yoko Ono,
over the group. There's also a lot of psycho-babble about Lennon's
rough childhood.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney: ``I see a frightened man who doesn't see how
beautiful he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lennon: ``You're the only thing that keeps me from
disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Quinn and Harris (Richard's son) are fine in two
challenging roles. Harris is particularly effective in turning
Lennon into a delightful study in contrasts. One moment he's crying
about the pain in his life, the next he's berating two fans who
want him to sing ``Yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, ``Two of Us'' almost didn't get made. When VH1's
Zalaznick got the script, she saw its potential. Leon Falk, the
film's executive producer, was equally impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck by how much rung true,'' says Falk. ``It was an
unconventional view of them as real people. They weren't
celebrities to each other, they were just two guys who knew each
other since they were 15.''
</P>
<P>
   But the VH1 suits weren't as impressed. ``It was a risk, in that
it wasn't a traditional movie,'' Zalaznick admits. ``They said, 'We
like it, but it's not right for us.'''
</P>
<P>
   It took Zalaznick over a year to get the green light. It helped
when Quinn, Harris and director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who directed
``Let It Be,'' The Beatles' last film, liked the project. ``Michael
had turned down many other Beatles offers,'' says Falk. ``But he
said, `You guys got this one right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they did.
</P>
<P>
   The show airs Tuesday at 9 p.m. on VH-1.

and not earning their keep. Memory chip makers have created a
series of faster memory technologies throughout the 1990s. Usually,
after a short period of time, the new standard dominates and all
the world's memory makers shift their production to the new
technology. But this year and next year, things could go

   TECH-CHIPMEMORY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ If computer users are going to
harness the latest whiz-bang processing performance, their
computers had better have memory chips that are running lickety
split. If memory chips cannot keep pace, then those fast and
expensive new processor chips will be sitting idle most of the time
and not earning their keep. Memory chip makers have created a
series of faster memory technologies throughout the 1990s. Usually,
after a short period of time, the new standard dominates and all
the world's memory makers shift their production to the new
technology. But this year and next year, things could go
differently. Two competing standards could emerge, and, if they do,
then life gets a little more complicated for the companies that
make computers and for PC buyers as well. (Ladendorf, Austin

   HEALTH-PREVENTION _ People who work in public health know all
too well the pattern of how the public responded when Y2K bugs
didn't materialize. People complained that too much money and time
were spent of Y2K readiness, and it really wasn't a big deal.
That's because it worked. And it's the same with public health
prevention programs. If they work -- no outbreaks of smallpox and
polio, nobody dying because they didn't get a flu shot -- the
public doesn't notice, and it makes it all the harder to get
funding for vital services the next year. (McKenna, Atlanta

   HIV-SPREAD (San Francisco) _ Studies in AIDS-ravaged Africa have
found that people with very low levels of HIV in their blood are
unlikely to infect others - suggesting that drug therapies or
vaccines that suppress the virus could significantly reduce its
spread. The research also gives compelling evidence that
circumcision may be protecting many men from contracting the

   MALES-COLLEGE (Undated) _ High school males are increasingly

the tests than any other group and have fallen behind their female

_ special lists to protect people from unwanted phone sales pitches

   RICH-CUSTODIANS (San Francisco) _ Some San Francisco school

eastern counties that can make or break the 2000 presidential race

   TATTOO-ARTIST (Albany, N.Y.) _ William DeMichele's elegant
studio in a desolate section of Albany is, like his work, on the
fringe _ where there is often more than meets the eye. For more
than a decade, DeMichele has photographed people, mostly women,
with tattoos: Women with purple grapevines across their chests,
women with elaborate underwater scenes of tropical fish across
their backs, women with leopards on their thighs. He now has more

   ICE-BREAKER (Troy, N.Y.) _ After a day on the Coast Guard cutter
Hawser, every member of the eight-person crew is sore. Twelve hours
of breaking up ice will do that. Twelve hours of driving the
64-ton, 400-horsepower ship up onto Hudson River ice until it
cracks, or smashing ``pancake'' ice into smaller pieces. ``This is
nonstop,'' Jim Todd, the officer in charge, said as the boat took
another lurch. ``When we tie up, everybody's dead tired.'' By ALAN
WECHSLER.

   FASHION-FUR (Troy, N.Y.) _ Fur, in the form of coats, jackets,
wraps, accessories, trim and more, has made a comeback, hitting the
runways and closets of many women this winter. Despite controversy,
the popularity of fur is on the rise, with more than 200 designers
employing it in their collections for 1999-2000, as opposed to 45
designers in 1985, according to the Fur Information Council of
America. By KRISTI L. GUSTAFSON.

   TRAVEL-EUROPE (San Francisco) _ Whenever Europe calls me, I call

I know, updating his guidebooks, and filming his popular PBS
series, ``Travels in Europe with Rick Steves.'' His advice this
year: Don't worry about the hordes predicted for this millennium

   FBN-WARNER (Atlanta) _ Dick Vermeil, in a routine burst of
hyperbole, said before the NFC Championship Game that he thought
Kurt Warner could be the next Joe Montana. He was, of course,
crazy. But not nearly as crazy now as he seemed then. Warner is
still three rings light, and he has not yet done nearly enough to
stroll into the Hall of Fame without so much as a nominating
speech. By RAY RATTO.

1918 FLU HIT PHOENIX TWICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In 1918, while American soldiers battled Germany's
Kaiser Wilhelm II overseas, Americans at home were battling an even
deadlier enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In 19 months, World War I took the lives of 116,500 GIs. In one
year, the influenza pandemic killed 500,000 Americans and at least
20 million people worldwide _ more than any other plague, war or
famine in so short a time.
</P>
<P>
   In the close quarters of military camps, flu hit soldiers
especially hard, and they brought it home. The disease felled rich
and poor, young and old, killing 2.5 percent of its victims, more
than twice the proportion in an ordinary flu season.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the scourge had passed early in 1919, America had
lost not only half a million of its citizens but also much of the
optimism brought by turn-of-the-century prosperity. On Nov. 11,
victory over the ``Huns'' was celebrated, but it was tarnished by
the tragedy on the home front. &QL; 
(at)j &QL; 
Higher hopes for Phoenix(at)j &QL; 
As the summer of 1918 waned and state after state fell victim to
influenza, Phoenix hoped to escape the coming plague.
</P>
<P>
   With the Valley's temperate climate and the custom of sleeping
in fresh air with windows open, public health officials predicted
the state could expect only a light case.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Phoenix was one of the few large urban centers to
suffer two waves of influenza.
</P>
<P>
   Between September 1918 and February 1919, Arizona's capital lost
10 percent of its 28,000 population. Despite vaccinations, the
closing of public venues and ordinances requiring citizens to wear
flu masks in public, influenza struck the Valley hard.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful residents snorted carbolic acid, popped laxatives,
refrained from kissing and shied from crowds in the name of
prevention. Traffic heading into the Valley was halted at highway
checkpoints. Only locals or commuters with legitimate business were
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Contraband whiskey was distributed by the Maricopa County
Sheriff's Office in the belief it would ease flu symptoms. Begging
exceptions to local prohibition laws, health officials prescribed
``intoxicating beverages'' for the afflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting events at Phoenix Union High school were suspended. The
proposed Phoenix Symphony delayed formation.
</P>
<P>
   Less hard hit, Tucson smugly suggested the state Legislature
convene there instead of Phoenix and taunted its northern neighbor
with the notion of moving the capital south.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix was not amused. &QL; 
(at)j &QL; 
Valley resident remembers(at)j &QL; 
Ignacio Soto was 7 years old when the flu epidemic struck the
Valley. His Tempe pioneer family lived near what is now Guadalupe
and Alma School roads.
</P>
<P>
   Soto, now 89, remembers ``a lot of people dying,'' though his
own family was spared. He remembers hearing talk of friends falling
ill and his parents attending wake after wake. Sometimes, the
little boy would go along as visitors said the rosary, prayed for
the dead and came home to wait for the next death.
</P>
<P>
   With no mortuary in the area and no hearses in service, families
in Soto's community had to care for their own dead, he says, and
transport them to a cemetery near the buttes.
</P>
<P>
   His best friend then was Marcelo Urbano, whose family lived in a
nearby adobe house with 300 chickens and four pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Urbano was 5 in 1918, but he, too, has vivid memories of the
epidemic. The public was told not to share belongings, to wash
hands frequently or wear gloves and to perform deep breathing
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to open up your lungs,'' says Urbano, 87, who
moved to California in 1932 and now lives in a Saratoga retirement
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the hospitals were full,'' he recalls. ``It started with
local hospitals, and then they had to build.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, St. Joseph's Hospital and the Arizona Deaconesses
Hospital, precursor to Good Samaritan, handled most of the flu
cases. When their rooms and hallways were full, the Phoenix Women's
Club converted its facility into accommodations for 50 patients.
Mesa turned Franklin School into an emergency hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, the University of Arizona's gymnasium became a
makeshift clinic for flu-stricken students. UA suspended classes,
and San Xavier del Bac mission closed to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Miners in Bisbee fell ill. Mexicans and Indians living in
crowded, impoverished conditions were decimated. Victims in
Flagstaff were transported to lower elevations in hopes of
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona prepared for a siege. &QL; 
(at)j &QL; 
The 1st wave(at)j &QL; 
The first wave arrived with a Sept. 25 report in `The Arizona
Republican`: SPANISH INFLUENZA SYMPTOMS FOUND IN PHOENIX BY DOCTOR.
</P>
<P>
   Those symptoms, according to state Superintendent of Public
Health Orville Henry Brown, included fever, chills and a
``running'' nose.
</P>
<P>
   His advice:
</P>
<P>
   Drink 12 glasses of water a day.
</P>
<P>
   Do not allow business cares, war work or family responsibilities
to ``weigh too tiresomely upon the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Eat wisely. The underweight should add more fats and
carbohydrates to their diet.
</P>
<P>
   Bathe regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuate the bowels every 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   At first sign of disease, go to bed and ``get to the best
physician you can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown feared visitors from back East would bring the flu into
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that when eastern friends arrived, residents ``have
them send their clothing to be sunned and pressed, and that they
pay particular attention to the cleansing of the noses and throats,
as it is quite possible that they might be carriers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first victims in the Valley was Miss Gladys Byers,
``an attractive Chicago girl who was a great social favorite
here.'' Miss Byers, frequent house guest of Mr. and Mrs. Donald
Dunbar, died Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Bisbee reported seven cases of la grippe, three showing flu
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   In Douglas, soldiers were forbidden to enter theaters, pool
halls and other public meeting places.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome announced the closing of schools, theaters, churches and
``general suppression of public meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   In Flagstaff, the Red Cross closed its sewing room and canceled
a flag-raising. Northern Arizona Normal School, now Northern
Arizona University, was placed under quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 6, the Maricopa County Medical Society recommended the
closing of all public and private schools, churches, theaters and
pool halls, and that public gatherings be discontinued during ``the
present epidemic of influenza.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the Glendale Board of Health followed suit. The
Rainbow Theater enjoyed a final performance by entertainer George
Cox as the curtain came down on frivolity.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 9, Tucson closed its public facilities.
</P>
<P>
   City by city, the state was shutting down. &QL; 
(at)j &QL; 
The people respond(at)j &QL; 
People did their best to ward off influenza, as new principles of
contagion were applied. The germ theory of infection was just a few
decades old.
</P>
<P>
   In 1918, flu remedies included vaccinations, gargling with hot
saltwater and the wearing of ``pneumonia jackets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Drug Co. in Phoenix recommended a flu-prevention spray
``75 times as effective as Carbolic Acid; 100 times as effective as
Formaldehyde; 3,300 times as effective as Hydrogen Peroxide.''
</P>
<P>
   Central Pharmacy of Phoenix touted a laxative called NR with the
motto, ``NR TO-NIGHT, Tomorrow alright.'' The tablets were said to
keep ``your organs of digestion and elimination active and your
system free from poisonous accumulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The homes of flu victims were ``placarded'' to warn away
visitors. City streets, public venues and drinking fountains were
ordered scrubbed clean.
</P>
<P>
   In Glendale, public eating houses were advised to sterilize
knives, forks, spoons and other utensils.
</P>
<P>
   Stay away from crowds, U.S. Surgeon General Rupert Blue warned,
surmising that influenza ``probably spreads mostly by inhaling some
of the tiny droplets of germ-laden mucus sprayed into the air when
ignorant or careless persons sneeze or cough without using a
handkerchief'' and through the ``filthy habit of spitting on
sidewalks, street cars and other public places.''
</P>
<P>
   In November came the most disturbing warning of all. ``KISSING
IS BARRED,'' a Phoenix headline screamed, and even married couples
were told to avoid intimate contact.
</P>
<P>
   Was life to lose all pleasure? &QL;

The year 1918 was historically significant for America in many
respects.
</P>
<P>
   In February, women's suffrage was again beaten in the U.S.
Senate, and the 19th Amendment would struggle for ratification
until 1920. Arizona, however, had granted women the right to vote
when it became a state in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Woodrow Wilson was working out a charter for the
League of Nations, an international body created to prevent future
wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Champion of the World'' boxer Jess Willard was set to fight
Jack Dempsey.
</P>
<P>
   Automobiles were selling like hot cakes _ the Pierce-Arrow, the
Hupmobile, the Kissel Kar.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Gov. George W.P. Hunt knitted a sweater for a GI
serving in the war.
</P>
<P>
   A Southern Pacific Railroad porter was arrested in Phoenix for
selling a pint of whiskey to a passenger said to be suffering from
the flu. The husband and father of two was fined $200 and spent a
day in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Walton, a 12-year-old Phoenix boy whose father was dead
and whose mother was crippled with rheumatism, became bored when
flu closed his school. Seeking adventure, young Walton burglarized
a home and a lumber yard.
</P>
<P>
   He told arresting officers that ``cheap, wild and woolly
novels'' had proved his undoing.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, health officials around the state took another
step to stem the tide of influenza. When morning dawned Nov. 27,
residents of Phoenix were walking the streets with faces covered in
homemade flu masks.
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving was only a day away. &QL; 
(at)j &QL; 
Face masks required(at)j &QL; 
Hoping to curb the spread of germs, city fathers across the Valley
ordered their people to wear masks in public or risk fines up to
$100. Health officials suggested making them from layers of gauze
or folding a handkerchief diagonally ``to be worn like a
highwayman's mask.''
</P>
<P>
   Most residents complied, though some rigged bizarre
contraptions, from muzzlelike baling wire to dangling jelly jars.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego came up with a poem:
</P>
<P>
   Obey the laws
</P>
<P>
   And wear the gauze.
</P>
<P>
   Protect your jaws
</P>
<P>
   From Septic Paws.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, the ditty went like this:
</P>
<P>
   Owing to the cussed ``flu,''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know who's who,
</P>
<P>
   You will have to ask
</P>
<P>
   ``What is that behind the mask?''
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross volunteers in Tucson worked tirelessly to keep up with
demand for masks, but the city rankled at the ordinance.
Plainclothes police officers walked the streets to spot the
non-compliant before violators could spot them and quickly cover
up.
</P>
<P>
   A fruit stand operator was cited for covering his mouth but not
his nose.
</P>
<P>
   A window washer was arrested after removing his mask to blow on
window panes for drying purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers were stymied as to how they could puff while wearing a
mask.
</P>
<P>
   Only days before Christmas, most cities rescinded the edict,
though masks were still required in sick rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The plague seemed to be waning. And then the second wave
struck. &QL; 
(at)j &QL; 
The 2nd wave(at)j &QL; 
On Jan. 1, 1919, a second bout of influenza hit Phoenix with 101
new cases. Once again, health officials banned public and private
gatherings, closed schools and quarantined the homes of flu
victims.
</P>
<P>
   When the owners of the Strand and Columbia theaters defied the
order and tried to reopen their doors, they were arrested,
convicted and fined.
</P>
<P>
   But though the city relapsed, probably because of the too-hasty
lifting of quarantines, the second incursion was less severe and of
shorter duration. By February, reports of new cases had tapered
off, and life in the Valley and in America began to return to
normal.
</P>
<P>
   The war was over and a new year had begun. Post-war optimism
spread across the nation. As the decade ended, the Twenties were
ready to roar. Women would win the right to vote. The League of
Nations promised world peace.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could stop the United States of America _ until 1929,
when the stock market crashed and the country faced a new crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was the Great Depression infecting America, and it seemed
every bit as deadly as the plague of influenza.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no immunization against poverty. And this plague
would last until the next world war. &QL;

FORGET DOT-COMS _ BEST AD MOMENTS ARE DITKA'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's heartwarming that in what was supposed to be the
dot-com Super Bowl, some of the best commercial moments belonged to
a low-tech lunkhead.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Mike Ditka, former coach _ until his recent firing
_ of the New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ABC charged a record $2.2 million for 30 second ads during the
game between the Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams, and it
seemed as if most of them involved some sort of e-business,
e-commerce or e-money-making outfit.
</P>
<P>
   E-eeew. Most were as confusing as Boomer Esiason's ``analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Ditka will do anything for money, including make a fool
of himself. His best moment came in an ad for Blockbuster Video, in
which he explained, in desperate fashion, the charms of the Julia
Roberts movie `Runaway Bride.` Chick flick? Nonsense, he pleaded _
to a kid selling popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help me out here,'' Ditka whined. ``I can't afford to lose
this job, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka also served as comic relief in a commercial for Charles
Schwab, set at the ``Shady Rest Retirement Home,'' where geezers
such as Charles Barkley, Barry Sanders and Wade Boggs now reside,
knitting and playing shuffleboard.
</P>
<P>
   The ad ended with Barkley sitting on the bottom rung of a bunk
bed. In came new roomie Ditka.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley: ``You got the upper.''
</P>
<P>
   Dot-coms fared less well. Yes, EDS Corp.'s ad about cat herding,
including testimony from cowboys _ or is that catboys (``Herdin'
cats, don't let anybody tell you it's easy'') _ and laugh-out-loud
shots of cats being herded across the plains, was hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   So was Etrade's ad about a man hospitalized because he has
``money coming out the wazoo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Get this man a private room,'' a doctor orders. Just like real
life.
</P>
<P>
   But they were the e-xceptions. Dot-coms may be revolutionizing
the stock market, but they're not setting any commercial standards.
</P>
<P>
   You may remember last year's big dot-com hit _ Monster.com's
black-and-white commercial showing kids talking about their
ambitions: ``I want to claw my way to middle management,'' that
kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   You'll forget its ad this year _ also black and white, with
people reciting from Robert Frost's `The Road Not Taken` as they
walk past a woman on a street corner. Pardon me while I empty my
brain trying to figure out what that has to do with a company that
helps people find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Another Etrade spot flaunted its ineptitude. After a monkey
danced for a few seconds between a couple of yokels, the following
flashed on screen: ``Well, we just wasted 2 million bucks. What are
you doing with your money?''
</P>
<P>
   Not giving it to you, pal, if that's the best you can come up
with.
</P>
<P>
   A Mountain Dew commercial showing a kid on a bike chasing _ and
catching _ a cheetah, then sticking his arm down its throat to
retrieve his soda can, gets points for either good computer effects
or great cheetah wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of effects, a Nuveen Investments ad set in the future
showed a computer-animated Christopher Reeve, who is paralyzed,
walking. Technically impressive, it was meant to be inspiring;
instead, it came off as manipulative, if not a little creepy.
</P>
<P>
   But does anyone get less bang for its buck than Budweiser?
Whether a dog actor recalling running into a van, designated driver
Wayne Gretsky driving a tipsy friend home in a Zamboni or a guy
leaving a black-tie party to deliver a baby Clydesdale _ cheers! _
none of the beermaker's ads scored.
</P>
<P>
   Worst still was the ``whassssssup?'' ad, in which Bud-swilling
imbeciles call each other and say that very word. Swell. Drink Bud
and become a monosyllabic wasteoid.
</P>
<P>
   So. Then. Why. Me. Want. Beer? &QL;

BEATLES BIOPIC ASKS, `WHAT IF?' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine Paul McCartney and John Lennon. Imagine them six years
post-Beatles, separate and estranged. Now imagine Paul, on an
impulse, showing up at New York's Dakota apartment building.
Imagine him knocking on John's door.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the conversation that would take place.
</P>
<P>
   That's the exercise awaiting those who watch ``Two of Us,'' a
wonderful experiment in what-iffery that's sure to do one of two
things if you are a Beatle fanatic _ it'll either trigger rage (the
sacrilege!) or admiration (one more piece of Beatlemania!).
</P>
<P>
   I grew up on the Beatles without becoming a Beatlemaniac, and
exercises like this challenge me, so count me among the admirers. I
like the audacity of it and admire the work and the talent that
went into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always laughing about it at the beginning,'' said
Aidan Quinn, who plays Paul in the movie (Tuesday night, VH1). ``We
were calling it career hari-kari.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you not be daunted by this?'' added Jared Harris,
who plays John. ``We were very nervous and not sure whether we were
making the right choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lindsay-Hogg, whose directorial career includes such
films as Horton Foote's ``Alone, Celebration: The Music of Pete
Townshend and the Who, As Is, Brideshead Revisited`` and a little
ditty called ``Let It Be,'' chose well when he picked these two. He
based his choices on talent and not how closely the two resembled
the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing, because neither actor looks like the person he is
portraying. That liberates the viewer from the distraction of an
impersonation, allowing the focus to be more on what's being said
and done.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, for example, fretted over his looks initially, then went
with a wig and brown contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had dreams of doing a whole bunch, and it became a problem
of logistics and time, and finally I just gave up trying to look
and sound like Paul,'' he said. ``I said just forget it, I'd have
to lose 50 pounds, get liposuction and plastic surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris apparently found the transition easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the look, it was the nose,'' he said. And the tinted
granny glasses helped, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``John had such a strong sartorial sense and image, you just get
in the right clothes and put the glasses on and you're
three-quarters of the way there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There'' is New York City, 1976, six years after the Beatles
have broken up. Paul has found new success with Wings. John is on a
creative timeout. His wife, Yoko Ono, is in California (``buying a
cow'') but ever-present.
</P>
<P>
   Paul is in town to play the Garden and, on a whim, decides to
stop by and give old friend John a buzz. There is initial
nervousness, followed by a slow descent of the walls that separate
them, followed by a daring outing in disguise _ to a park, then a
pub.
</P>
<P>
   There's a moment when they actually sit down at John's grand
piano and sing something. An old bond re-establishes. There is
warmth between the two.
</P>
<P>
   And wariness. The breakup thing. The wives thing. The
who-gets-credit-as-most-important-Beatle thing. The reunion thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us were there and could imagine accurately what went
on, but it is very well researched,'' Quinn said. ``A lot of the
things we said to each other are actual things Paul and John said
in interviews about each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the writer got the spirit of the two men. If their
names were Bob and Phil, I'd still want to do this project because
it was just that compelling a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Writer Mark Stanfield based his work on documented conversations
and a McCartney biography, by Chet Flippo, that recounts several
post-Beatles conversations between Paul and John. These are
squeezed into a second day for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always a good script but a little overwritten,'' said
Harris, who is the son of the actor Richard Harris. ``Mark was in
the Lennon camp, so we spent a week of rehearsal basically
adjusting that balance, in the sense that there isn't any way that
those two people could be anything other than a matched pair of
equals in temperament, talent, ego, strength of personality and
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn _ whose credits include ``In Dreams,`` ``Commandments``
and ``Legends of the Fall`` _ has never been a fan of biopics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've turned down many of them before because they're like
picking the bones,'' he said. ... ``I had to have a moral talk with
myself _ is this OK to do?'' Because the kind of tabloid
sensationalism that feeds into that fame thing ...is something I
would be so upset if I contributed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither actor has met a Beatle, but Quinn sent McCartney a
letter ``meant as an homage of respect and love, and I hope he's
not offended by it and hope it doesn't add to any of the
discomforting, dark side of all that fame stuff. I apologized to
him because I wouldn't know how I would feel if I became megafamous
and 20 years later someone's playing me as a young man. I'd
probably be amused. It's got to be weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Weird? Maybe so. Perhaps even someone as famous as McCartney can
be made uncomfortable by such stuff.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I fell head first into the exercise. The writing
worked for me, and Quinn and Harris had me in a spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of Us`` is a little gem and a nice big notch on the belt
of VH1, a fledgling in the made-for-TV movie biz.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Most humans who have ever lived have known roughly where they
were, day by day, year by year. Not in abstract terms, of course,
but in the terms of experience and familiarity _ by neighborhood,
not map.
</P>
<P>
   For eons, we've known things about ourselves that could be
expressed in a statement like ``I'm standing on the threshing floor
in the village of my birth,'' or even, ``I'm in a part of town I've
never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether we utter it or not, this awareness of ``whereness'' is
part of the meaning of being human. But for centuries, a dedicated
band of mapmakers, navigators, astronomers, inventors and
mathematicians has tried to turn this innate sense of place into a
more precise determination of position that is intelligible to
anyone, not just to locals.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, this is like the difference between knowing you're
coming to the corner where you always turn left on your way to the
grocery store and knowing the names of the streets that cross at
that intersection.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, however, the pursuit of pure position is about
to lead us into a world that not one of us has ever seen. The agent
of change will be GPS _ the Global Positioning System.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, not a single human-made object has ever known
where it was. Even a venerable tool of navigation like a sextant
knows nothing more about its location than does the Mona Lisa or
the pigments of which she is painted. So imagine a world in which
manmade objects know where they are and can communicate that
information to other self-locating, communicating objects too.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds as strange and surprising as the Marauders Map in
the Harry Potter novels for children. The Marauder's Map shows the
position and movement of every animate creature at the school of
wizardry called Hogwarts.
</P>
<P>
   A Marauder's Map of the world would be even stranger. It would
show the position and movement _ even a history of movements _ of
manmade objects as well. This would be an ever-changing map of a
world filled with artifacts busily announcing something significant
about themselves to each other and to anyone else who cared to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   That world is nearly here. In August, a company called SiRF
Technology, based in Santa Clara, Calif., announced that it had
developed an advanced GPS chip no bigger than a postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Kanwar Chadha, one of SiRF's founders, declared, ``Our vision is
to bring location awareness to virtually everything that moves.''
This is a subtle but profound change in the history of GPS
technology _ a change driven by increasing miniaturization and
declining prices for sophisticated circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, consumers have grown used to the sight of
handheld GPS receivers, which have been marketed as individual
positioning devices for anglers, hunters, hikers and cyclists. But
what SiRF and other companies have in mind is conferring upon
objects a communicable sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   One day soon, most GPS devices will not be stand-alone receivers
used by those of us who venture off the beaten path but integral
components of everyday objects.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these objects, especially the big ones, are easy enough
to imagine, because they exist now. Boats and ships of every kind
already incorporate GPS technology, as do some automobiles made by
Toyota, Honda, Lexus and Cadillac. So do the newest farm
implements, like combines that allow farmers to map crop yields in
precise detail.
</P>
<P>
   But some uses of GPS that are not yet widely available will soon
be common in smaller devices. Beginning next October, for instance,
the Federal Communications Commission will require cellular-phone
service providers to be able to identify the location of a
cell-phone caller who dials 911. This means that most cell phones
will likely include a tiny GPS chip. So will beepers and watches
and handheld digital assistants and, who knows, Game Boy Colors and
probably handguns too.
</P>
<P>
   The spreading of a technology like GPS is easy enough to
predict, but it's much harder to foresee what the effect of that
spreading will be. There's always a limit to how far we can see
into the future of the tools we use, especially into a future where
those tools become interlinked.
</P>
<P>
   It's already obvious how useful GPS is in discrete applications:
for surveying and mapmaking, for tracking commercial vehicles, for
maritime and aeronautic navigation, for emergency rescue crews and
archaeologists. But there is simply no telling what it will mean
when, on a planet full of location-aware objects, a way is found to
coordinate all the data they send out.
</P>
<P>
   Awareness may be a metaphor when applied to inanimate objects,
but the potential of that metaphor is entirely literal and, so far,
almost entirely beyond our ken.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, for most of us, there is still a more basic
question to be answered: Where did GPS technology come from and how
does it work?
</P>
<P>
   GPS depends on an array of 27 satellites _ 24 in regular use,
plus spares _ flying some 11,000 miles above Earth. They were put
there by the Department of Defense, which began the NAVSTAR global
Positioning system Program in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   A version of GPS was first tested in 1964 when the Navy deployed
a five-satellite prototype, called Transit, for submarines. It
could take an hour and a half for a Transit satellite to saunter
above the horizon and then another 10 or 15 minutes to fix the
submarine's position.
</P>
<P>
   The current generation of satellites was built by The Boeing
Company and Lockheed Martin, and each one orbits the planet in
about 12 hours, cutting across the equatorial plane at an angle of
roughly 55 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force tracks the satellites from Colorado Springs,
Hawaii and three other islands: Ascension in the South Atlantic,
Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, and Kwajalein in the South
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   These ground stations provide the satellites with navigational
information, which the next generation of satellites will be able
to supply to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary users can track this constellation of satellites with
one of several Web sites or with an appealing public-domain
software program called Home Planet, which can map any satellite
you choose, GPS or not, against a projection of the Earth's
surface. Or you can track the satellites with a GPS receiver.
</P>
<P>
   As technology becomes more sophisticated, it seems as though
freedom gets defined in more basic terms. GPS offers one version of
freedom _ knowing where you are. But it may ultimately threaten a
more basic kind of freedom _ being where you are without anyone
else knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone would like to have a Marauder's Map, but no one wants
to appear on the Marauder's Map without approving it. The value of
cell phones embedded with GPS chips is obvious when it comes to
emergency services. But the fact that cell-phone service providers
are able to track the location of a 911 call means that GPS could
track the location of every other kind of call as well.
</P>
<P>
   Already GPS is being used to monitor the movement of commercial
trucks of every description. This is both a form of insight to the
vehicle owners and a form of intrusion to the drivers, who find
their movements visible to management in a way they never were
before.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the nonaqueous, nonarctic globe is mostly paved, and
people are as thick upon the Earth as mold on month-old bread, a
device has been invented at last that tells you where you are
without having to ask strangers.

<P>
   Most humans who have ever lived have known roughly where they
were, day by day, year by year. Not in abstract terms, of course,
but in the terms of experience and familiarity _ by neighborhood,
not map.
</P>
<P>
   For eons, we've known things about ourselves that could be
expressed in a statement like ``I'm standing on the threshing floor
in the village of my birth,'' or even, ``I'm in a part of town I've
never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether we utter it or not, this awareness of ``whereness'' is
part of the meaning of being human. But for centuries, a dedicated
band of mapmakers, navigators, astronomers, inventors and
mathematicians has tried to turn this innate sense of place into a
more precise determination of position that is intelligible to
anyone, not just to locals.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, this is like the difference between knowing you're
coming to the corner where you always turn left on your way to the
grocery store and knowing the names of the streets that cross at
that intersection.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, however, the pursuit of pure position is about
to lead us into a world that not one of us has ever seen. The agent
of change will be GPS _ the Global Positioning System.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, not a single human-made object has ever known
where it was. Even a venerable tool of navigation like a sextant
knows nothing more about its location than does the Mona Lisa or
the pigments of which she is painted. So imagine a world in which
manmade objects know where they are and can communicate that
information to other self-locating, communicating objects too.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds as strange and surprising as the Marauders Map in
the Harry Potter novels for children. The Marauder's Map shows the
position and movement of every animate creature at the school of
wizardry called Hogwarts.
</P>
<P>
   A Marauder's Map of the world would be even stranger. It would
show the position and movement _ even a history of movements _ of
manmade objects as well. This would be an ever-changing map of a
world filled with artifacts busily announcing something significant
about themselves to each other and to anyone else who cared to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   That world is nearly here. In August, a company called SiRF
Technology, based in Santa Clara, Calif., announced that it had
developed an advanced GPS chip no bigger than a postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Kanwar Chadha, one of SiRF's founders, declared, ``Our vision is
to bring location awareness to virtually everything that moves.''
This is a subtle but profound change in the history of GPS
technology _ a change driven by increasing miniaturization and
declining prices for sophisticated circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, consumers have grown used to the sight of
handheld GPS receivers, which have been marketed as individual
positioning devices for anglers, hunters, hikers and cyclists. But
what SiRF and other companies have in mind is conferring upon
objects a communicable sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   One day soon, most GPS devices will not be stand-alone receivers
used by those of us who venture off the beaten path but integral
components of everyday objects.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these objects, especially the big ones, are easy enough
to imagine, because they exist now. Boats and ships of every kind
already incorporate GPS technology, as do some automobiles made by
Toyota, Honda, Lexus and Cadillac. So do the newest farm
implements, like combines that allow farmers to map crop yields in
precise detail.
</P>
<P>
   But some uses of GPS that are not yet widely available will soon
be common in smaller devices. Beginning next October, for instance,
the Federal Communications Commission will require cellular-phone
service providers to be able to identify the location of a
cell-phone caller who dials 911. This means that most cell phones
will likely include a tiny GPS chip. So will beepers and watches
and handheld digital assistants and, who knows, Game Boy Colors and
probably handguns too.
</P>
<P>
   The spreading of a technology like GPS is easy enough to
predict, but it's much harder to foresee what the effect of that
spreading will be. There's always a limit to how far we can see
into the future of the tools we use, especially into a future where
those tools become interlinked.
</P>
<P>
   It's already obvious how useful GPS is in discrete applications:
for surveying and mapmaking, for tracking commercial vehicles, for
maritime and aeronautic navigation, for emergency rescue crews and
archaeologists. But there is simply no telling what it will mean
when, on a planet full of location-aware objects, a way is found to
coordinate all the data they send out.
</P>
<P>
   Awareness may be a metaphor when applied to inanimate objects,
but the potential of that metaphor is entirely literal and, so far,
almost entirely beyond our ken.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, for most of us, there is still a more basic
question to be answered: Where did GPS technology come from and how
does it work?
</P>
<P>
   GPS depends on an array of 27 satellites _ 24 in regular use,
plus spares _ flying some 11,000 miles above Earth. They were put
there by the Department of Defense, which began the NAVSTAR global
Positioning system Program in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   A version of GPS was first tested in 1964 when the Navy deployed
a five-satellite prototype, called Transit, for submarines. It
could take an hour and a half for a Transit satellite to saunter
above the horizon and then another 10 or 15 minutes to fix the
submarine's position.
</P>
<P>
   The current generation of satellites was built by The Boeing
Company and Lockheed Martin, and each one orbits the planet in
about 12 hours, cutting across the equatorial plane at an angle of
roughly 55 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force tracks the satellites from Colorado Springs,
Hawaii and three other islands: Ascension in the South Atlantic,
Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, and Kwajalein in the South
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   These ground stations provide the satellites with navigational
information, which the next generation of satellites will be able
to supply to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary users can track this constellation of satellites with
one of several Web sites or with an appealing public-domain
software program called Home Planet, which can map any satellite
you choose, GPS or not, against a projection of the Earth's
surface. Or you can track the satellites with a GPS receiver.
</P>
<P>
   As technology becomes more sophisticated, it seems as though
freedom gets defined in more basic terms. GPS offers one version of
freedom _ knowing where you are. But it may ultimately threaten a
more basic kind of freedom _ being where you are without anyone
else knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone would like to have a Marauder's Map, but no one wants
to appear on the Marauder's Map without approving it. The value of
cell phones embedded with GPS chips is obvious when it comes to
emergency services. But the fact that cell-phone service providers
are able to track the location of a 911 call means that GPS could
track the location of every other kind of call as well.
</P>
<P>
   Already GPS is being used to monitor the movement of commercial
trucks of every description. This is both a form of insight to the
vehicle owners and a form of intrusion to the drivers, who find
their movements visible to management in a way they never were
before.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the nonaqueous, nonarctic globe is mostly paved, and
people are as thick upon the Earth as mold on month-old bread, a
device has been invented at last that tells you where you are
without having to ask strangers.

<P>
   If it feels as though a battery in your skull has run out of
juice when you work too hard, that's because it has.
</P>
<P>
   The billions of nerve cells dwelling inside your cranium are a
lot like tiny, rechargeable AAs. In most cases these cells won't
tire enough for you to notice, but with careful observation, you
can catch them napping.
</P>
<P>
   Neurons are reservoirs of electrical charge. When stimulated, a
neuron sends an electrical signal and then needs some time to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   During a resting phase _ which can last 10 seconds and longer _
other active nerve cells continue to fire.
</P>
<P>
   In most instances this neural tradeoff is seamless and your
brain doesn't detect the shift of activity from one neuron to
another. But once in a while too many nerve cells expend too much
energy too quickly and cause perceptual glitches.
</P>
<P>
   We tend to experience glitches as optical illusions.
</P>
<P>
   The following experiments show you how to trick some of your
neurons into recklessly expending most of their energy at once, so
you can detect them when they're in the act of recuperating.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 1 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Drawing of flag with horizontal black and blue lines accompanies
this experiment.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stare at the addition sign in the flag for 30 seconds, and then
look at a blank sheet of paper. While you were staring, a battle
was raging between the neurons in your brain that sense yellow and
blue and the ones that sense turquoise and red.
</P>
<P>
   On the blank sheet, you should see an afterimage of the colors
of the American flag. The suppressed blue and red activity, which
was kept at a minimum as you looked at the flag, now dominates, and
those are the colors you see on the blank sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The interval required for the illusion to vanish corresponds
roughly to the rallying time of the neurons used to see yellow and
turquoise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 2 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Drawing of spoke pattern accompanies this experiment.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look into the center of the spoke pattern for 20 seconds. Now
look at a blank sheet of paper. The negative of the image emerges
from nowhere and shimmers with a circular motion.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Neuroscientists know why a negative afterimage appears _
the pattern simply exhausts nerve cells that sense white spokes.
But they don't yet understand why a static image creates a
perception of motion.
</P>
<P>
   They suspect that, because real motion produces moving
afterimages similar to those seen here, the pattern of the spokes
depletes the class of neurons used to sense movement.
</P>
<P>
   As the image fades from the blank page, your neurons are
approaching their original state.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 3 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Drawing of the predominantly green flag accompanies this
experiment.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stare at the horizontal red bar on the left for 60 seconds. Now
focus on the red square on the right. Notice that the bars above
the red square appear narrower than those below it.
</P>
<P>
   This happens because the upper left pattern exhausts the nerve
cells that sense wide bars, but only in the upper visual field. So
the top bars will look narrower and the bottom bars wider until
your wide-pattern neurons recover.
</P>
<P>
   If these feuding nerve cells have worn you out, remember that
even now your brain is reinvigorating spent nerve cells, fortifying
you for whatever comes next.

<P>
   Most humans who have ever lived have known roughly where they
were, day by day, year by year. Not in abstract terms, of course,
but in the terms of experience and familiarity _ by neighborhood,
not map.
</P>
<P>
   For eons, we've known things about ourselves that could be
expressed in a statement like ``I'm standing on the threshing floor
in the village of my birth,'' or even, ``I'm in a part of town I've
never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether we utter it or not, this awareness of ``whereness'' is
part of the meaning of being human. But for centuries, a dedicated
band of mapmakers, navigators, astronomers, inventors and
mathematicians has tried to turn this innate sense of place into a
more precise determination of position that is intelligible to
anyone, not just to locals.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, this is like the difference between knowing you're
coming to the corner where you always turn left on your way to the
grocery store and knowing the names of the streets that cross at
that intersection.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, however, the pursuit of pure position is about
to lead us into a world that not one of us has ever seen. The agent
of change will be GPS _ the Global Positioning System.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, not a single human-made object has ever known
where it was. Even a venerable tool of navigation like a sextant
knows nothing more about its location than does the Mona Lisa or
the pigments of which she is painted. So imagine a world in which
manmade objects know where they are and can communicate that
information to other self-locating, communicating objects too.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds as strange and surprising as the Marauders Map in
the Harry Potter novels for children. The Marauder's Map shows the
position and movement of every animate creature at the school of
wizardry called Hogwarts.
</P>
<P>
   A Marauder's Map of the world would be even stranger. It would
show the position and movement _ even a history of movements _ of
manmade objects as well. This would be an ever-changing map of a
world filled with artifacts busily announcing something significant
about themselves to each other and to anyone else who cared to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   That world is nearly here. In August, a company called SiRF
Technology, based in Santa Clara, Calif., announced that it had
developed an advanced GPS chip no bigger than a postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Kanwar Chadha, one of SiRF's founders, declared, ``Our vision is
to bring location awareness to virtually everything that moves.''
This is a subtle but profound change in the history of GPS
technology _ a change driven by increasing miniaturization and
declining prices for sophisticated circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, consumers have grown used to the sight of
handheld GPS receivers, which have been marketed as individual
positioning devices for anglers, hunters, hikers and cyclists. But
what SiRF and other companies have in mind is conferring upon
objects a communicable sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   One day soon, most GPS devices will not be stand-alone receivers
used by those of us who venture off the beaten path but integral
components of everyday objects.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these objects, especially the big ones, are easy enough
to imagine, because they exist now. Boats and ships of every kind
already incorporate GPS technology, as do some automobiles made by
Toyota, Honda, Lexus and Cadillac. So do the newest farm
implements, like combines that allow farmers to map crop yields in
precise detail.
</P>
<P>
   But some uses of GPS that are not yet widely available will soon
be common in smaller devices. Beginning next October, for instance,
the Federal Communications Commission will require cellular-phone
service providers to be able to identify the location of a
cell-phone caller who dials 911. This means that most cell phones
will likely include a tiny GPS chip. So will beepers and watches
and handheld digital assistants and, who knows, Game Boy Colors and
probably handguns too.
</P>
<P>
   The spreading of a technology like GPS is easy enough to
predict, but it's much harder to foresee what the effect of that
spreading will be. There's always a limit to how far we can see
into the future of the tools we use, especially into a future where
those tools become interlinked.
</P>
<P>
   It's already obvious how useful GPS is in discrete applications:
for surveying and mapmaking, for tracking commercial vehicles, for
maritime and aeronautic navigation, for emergency rescue crews and
archaeologists. But there is simply no telling what it will mean
when, on a planet full of location-aware objects, a way is found to
coordinate all the data they send out.
</P>
<P>
   Awareness may be a metaphor when applied to inanimate objects,
but the potential of that metaphor is entirely literal and, so far,
almost entirely beyond our ken.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, for most of us, there is still a more basic
question to be answered: Where did GPS technology come from and how
does it work?
</P>
<P>
   GPS depends on an array of 27 satellites _ 24 in regular use,
plus spares _ flying some 11,000 miles above Earth. They were put
there by the Department of Defense, which began the NAVSTAR global
Positioning system Program in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   A version of GPS was first tested in 1964 when the Navy deployed
a five-satellite prototype, called Transit, for submarines. It
could take an hour and a half for a Transit satellite to saunter
above the horizon and then another 10 or 15 minutes to fix the
submarine's position.
</P>
<P>
   The current generation of satellites was built by The Boeing
Company and Lockheed Martin, and each one orbits the planet in
about 12 hours, cutting across the equatorial plane at an angle of
roughly 55 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force tracks the satellites from Colorado Springs,
Hawaii and three other islands: Ascension in the South Atlantic,
Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, and Kwajalein in the South
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   These ground stations provide the satellites with navigational
information, which the next generation of satellites will be able
to supply to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary users can track this constellation of satellites with
one of several Web sites or with an appealing public-domain
software program called Home Planet, which can map any satellite
you choose, GPS or not, against a projection of the Earth's
surface. Or you can track the satellites with a GPS receiver.
</P>
<P>
   As technology becomes more sophisticated, it seems as though
freedom gets defined in more basic terms. GPS offers one version of
freedom _ knowing where you are. But it may ultimately threaten a
more basic kind of freedom _ being where you are without anyone
else knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone would like to have a Marauder's Map, but no one wants
to appear on the Marauder's Map without approving it. The value of
cell phones embedded with GPS chips is obvious when it comes to
emergency services. But the fact that cell-phone service providers
are able to track the location of a 911 call means that GPS could
track the location of every other kind of call as well.
</P>
<P>
   Already GPS is being used to monitor the movement of commercial
trucks of every description. This is both a form of insight to the
vehicle owners and a form of intrusion to the drivers, who find
their movements visible to management in a way they never were
before.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the nonaqueous, nonarctic globe is mostly paved, and
people are as thick upon the Earth as mold on month-old bread, a
device has been invented at last that tells you where you are
without having to ask strangers.

<P>
   If it feels as though a battery in your skull has run out of
juice when you work too hard, that's because it has.
</P>
<P>
   The billions of nerve cells dwelling inside your cranium are a
lot like tiny, rechargeable AAs. In most cases these cells won't
tire enough for you to notice, but with careful observation, you
can catch them napping.
</P>
<P>
   Neurons are reservoirs of electrical charge. When stimulated, a
neuron sends an electrical signal and then needs some time to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   During a resting phase _ which can last 10 seconds and longer _
other active nerve cells continue to fire.
</P>
<P>
   In most instances this neural tradeoff is seamless and your
brain doesn't detect the shift of activity from one neuron to
another. But once in a while too many nerve cells expend too much
energy too quickly and cause perceptual glitches.
</P>
<P>
   We tend to experience glitches as optical illusions.
</P>
<P>
   The following experiments show you how to trick some of your
neurons into recklessly expending most of their energy at once, so
you can detect them when they're in the act of recuperating.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 1 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Drawing of flag with horizontal black and blue lines accompanies
this experiment.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stare at the addition sign in the flag for 30 seconds, and then
look at a blank sheet of paper. While you were staring, a battle
was raging between the neurons in your brain that sense yellow and
blue and the ones that sense turquoise and red.
</P>
<P>
   On the blank sheet, you should see an afterimage of the colors
of the American flag. The suppressed blue and red activity, which
was kept at a minimum as you looked at the flag, now dominates, and
those are the colors you see on the blank sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The interval required for the illusion to vanish corresponds
roughly to the rallying time of the neurons used to see yellow and
turquoise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 2 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Drawing of spoke pattern accompanies this experiment.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look into the center of the spoke pattern for 20 seconds. Now
look at a blank sheet of paper. The negative of the image emerges
from nowhere and shimmers with a circular motion.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Neuroscientists know why a negative afterimage appears _
the pattern simply exhausts nerve cells that sense white spokes.
But they don't yet understand why a static image creates a
perception of motion.
</P>
<P>
   They suspect that, because real motion produces moving
afterimages similar to those seen here, the pattern of the spokes
depletes the class of neurons used to sense movement.
</P>
<P>
   As the image fades from the blank page, your neurons are
approaching their original state.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 3 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Drawing of the predominantly green flag accompanies this
experiment.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stare at the horizontal red bar on the left for 60 seconds. Now
focus on the red square on the right. Notice that the bars above
the red square appear narrower than those below it.
</P>
<P>
   This happens because the upper left pattern exhausts the nerve
cells that sense wide bars, but only in the upper visual field. So
the top bars will look narrower and the bottom bars wider until
your wide-pattern neurons recover.
</P>
<P>
   If these feuding nerve cells have worn you out, remember that
even now your brain is reinvigorating spent nerve cells, fortifying
you for whatever comes next.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ William DeMichele's studio is in a third-story
walkup in a converted Albany warehouse on a desolate stretch of the
Hudson River, across the street from an abandoned building with
shattered windows and thick weeds that almost obscure the sad old
railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   But venture inside and you will see beautifully restored
hardwood floors, classy furniture and startlingly rich photographs.
</P>
<P>
   DeMichele's studio, like his work, is on the fringe, where there
is often more than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, DeMichele has photographed people,
mostly women, with tattoos: Women with purple grapevines across
their chests, women with elaborate underwater scenes of tropical
fish across their backs, women with leopards on their thighs. He
now has more than 80,000 images of beauty that's skin deep.
</P>
<P>
   DeMichele's 1992 book, ``The Illustrated Woman'' is in its third
printing and has been translated into Japanese, and 16 of his
photos make up the largest part of ``Body Art: Marks of Identity,''
an exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History in New York,
which closes in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of there being a body-art exhibit at the American
Museum of Natural History is groundbreaking,'' says DeMichele,
sitting in his spacious studio. ``The fact that the most
prestigious museum in the United States recognizes body art as a
true art form and as a true medium that has been in our culture and
other cultures since the beginning of man really legitimizes
tattooing.''
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming negative stereotypes about tattoos and the people who
collect them has long been one of the photographer's missions.
``I've become one of the ambassadors of tattooing,'' says
DeMichele, who travels around the country and the world covering
tattoo conventions and seeking models for his portraits. ``Tattoo
conventions are not biker-oriented, per se. They really don't
follow the cliche that most people have about tattooing. These are
professional people who can afford professional tattoos.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMichele's pictures focus more on the individual than the
tattoo. ``They are portraits of women with tattoos. They aren't
tattoos on women,'' says DeMichele, adding that he has always been
attracted to both the tattoo artwork itself and the people
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his subjects are photographed nude and unposed. ``I
don't want them to be showing fashion. I want them to be showing
themselves. You can see that mostly in the eyes or how they pose or
how they stand. I let them react to the environment. It's my job to
just capture that moment in time.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMichele, 46, sports several tattoos, three small earrings in
his left ear and a salt-and-pepper beard that makes him look a
little like Martin Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer's wife says DeMichele's rapport with his
subjects contributes greatly to the final image. ``He really has a
gift for bringing out beauty in even the most ordinary women,''
says Cynthia DeMichele, who runs her own graphic design business
near their home in Bethlehem. ``I've seen girls go into his studio
with stooped shoulders and obvious low self-esteem and they emerge
just radiant.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair met a decade ago when Cynthia was designing a CD cover
with one of DeMichele's photographs. They arranged to discuss the
deal over lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up eating lunch and never even talked about the
photo,'' she says. For their first date, DeMichele went to her
apartment and cooked a delicious meal of lobster ravioli. ``He's a
man of many talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia DeMichele says she knew ``little or nothing'' about the
world of tattoos when she met her husband, but after attending her
first convention, she was hooked. ``Here's just a plain white girl
such as myself with an opportunity to meet so many interesting
people,'' says Cynthia, who recently got her first tattoo. ``I
consider it an adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMichele says tattoos have become more acceptable and more
artistic in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the quality of the tattooing has changed. I think the
type of tattoo people get has changed, and the clientele has
changed. It's gotten much younger. Years ago it was primarily just
sailors and laborers. Then in the hippie era and the first women's
movement, women started getting tattoos, but they were much
smaller. It was more of a statement of independence. It didn't take
much, just a little butterfly or flag or peace sign. Then it went
into hiatus a little bit in the '70s, but then in the late '80s and
'90s it became very popular and trendy again because of the rock
stars and athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the same time, a lot of young people started becoming
tattoo artists, the difference being these artists have art
backgrounds. We're talking about college graduates with (master of
fine arts degrees), many in printmaking. Of course they brought
their artwork with them, so they were doing fantastic art pieces.
And the (subjects) were willing to oblige and willing to donate
more of their skin.''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been more people with larger, more visible
tattoos, including ``sleeves,'' which cover the arms to the wrist,
and full, detailed back pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women definitely changed tattooing,'' says DeMichele.
``They changed it from being just a ritual meant to denote
friendship or time or camaraderie to making a visual statement to
beautify the body. Women were showing that they could make a
choice, that they could dedicate themselves to something and show
strength in ways that hadn't been seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what happened was the quality of the tattooing got better,
the quality of the imagery got better. No longer were you seeing
the traditional type of tattoo imagery. You started to see much
more decorative, much more ornate tattoos.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   DeMichele's adventure with all things tattoo began in 1976, when
he saw a poster advertising classes with landscape photographer
Ansel Adams in California. DeMichele headed West, stopping for a
detour in San Francisco on his way.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that he spotted the studio of Lyle Tuttle, who was
famous for tattooing the likes of Janis Joplin and Peter Fonda. ``I
saw the tattoo studio right across the street from the bus station
and I walked in, looked around and picked out a little tiny tattoo.
I was very intimidated that it was the Lyle Tuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Tuttle of DeMichele, ``He's a complete package: good
businessman, good photographer, good promoter.'' The two are now
partners in an on-line tattoo business that offers articles on
tattooing techniques and history, lists tattoo conventions around
the world and yellow pages of tattoo artists, and displays tattoo
designs for sale. Tuttle says his friend is successful at his craft
because of his ``attention to detail. It's more than inborn
patience. It's just professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an ingratiating guy and he's as gregarious as hell,''
says Tuttle, now retired from tattooing and still living in San
Francisco.

   When Ann Fitzgerald, senior researcher for the department of
anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History, began
researching contemporary tattooing for the exhibit, DeMichele's
name came up repeatedly. ``His pictures are very appealing,'' says
Fitzgerald, who worked with DeMichele for a year to create the
exhibit. ``They're very direct. You feel like you've met these
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald says she knew almost nothing about tattooing when she
first approached DeMichele for help. He opened up that world for
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very generous and extremely curious and exploratory,''
she says. ``He's got a real sense of enthusiasm for the way in
which we all experiment with ourselves and our lives.''

&HT;     VETERAN OF EUROPE OFFERS TRAVEL TIPS FOR THE CONTINENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN FLINN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This is the time of year when my thoughts turn
to cafe au laits in sidewalk cafes and scones with clotted cream in
thatched-roof cottages, to spooky gothic cathedrals and
sun-splashed vineyard picnics, to gargoyles and lederhosen and
cobblestones and gelato.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Europe calls me, I call Rick Steves. He spends more
time there than any other traveler I know _ an average of 100 days
a year for the last two decades spent updating his ``Europe Through
the Back Door'' and other guidebooks, and filming his popular PBS
series, ``Travels in Europe with Rick Steves.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently I asked Steves what is in store for travelers headed to
Europe this summer, perhaps for the first time in years. He opened
up his notebook, and here's some of what spilled out:
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about the hordes predicted for this millennium year.
Except for Rome, which expects to be packed with Eastern European
Catholics permitted to travel there for the first Holy Year of
their lifetimes, Europe should be no more crowded than usual. If
anything, hoteliers are nervous that the Continent could resemble
Yogi Berra's classic koan: It's so crowded no one goes there
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Leave your travelers' checks and currency converters at home.
ATMs are now so ubiquitous you can find them in even the smallest
villages. And with the euro trading at almost exactly a dollar, the
days of converting deutsche marks into dollars while the waiter
drums his fingers impatiently on the table are over. (The euro
won't replace local currencies in euro countries for two more
years, but for the purposes of credit card transactions, menus and
price tags in euro countries almost always carry both figures.)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Italy, classic monuments and artworks are finally
available for viewing. In Venice, the scaffolding is off of St.
Mark's, and for the first time in memory the entire front of the
basilica is viewable and looking sumptuous. In Milan, Leonardo's
Last Supper has finally reopened to the public, but with a rigid
reservation system allowing only 25 people to enter every 15
minutes. You must have a reservation to get in (call
011-39-028-942-1146 from the United States). In Assisi, the
Basilica of St. Francis, with its frescoes freshly restored after
suffering earthquake damage, is now ready for visitors. The
Franciscans have opened a huge new subterranean entrance area below
the square in front of the church.
</P>
<P>
   In London, the famous Half-Price Ticket Booth at Leicester
Square is now surrounded by fake ``half-price'' booths that confuse
and cheat tourists. Be warned: The real booth is a free-standing
kiosk actually in the square, not a ticket agency near the tube
station.
</P>
<P>
   In England's Cotswold region, the new Cotswold Link bus service
runs twice daily in both directions between Bath and Stratford,
making up to 13 stops en route, hitting the highlights of the
Cotswolds including Chipping Camden, Stow-on-the-Wold and
Moreton-in-Marsh. You can use this service to day-trip from Bath to
visit one Cotswold town; as transportation through the Cotswolds
(stopping where you like for an overnight); or to day-trip from a
Cotswold town to see Stratford. A Bath-Stratford ticket costs 7
pounds ($12.)
</P>
<P>
   All over Ireland, big modern and inexpensive hotels are driving
bed and breakfasts out of business. Every big Irish city now has a
Jurys Inn offering hundreds of cookie-cutter rooms with unbeatable
prices and no character.
</P>
<P>
   Dublin's Smithfield Village, until recently a rundown industrial
area, is about to become the next Temple Bar. Its Ceol Music Museum
is an interactive Irish music encounter, a high-tech opportunity to
bone up on ``trad'' before heading for the small-town pubs. The
neighboring Old Jameson Distillery is OK, but nowhere near as good
as the Old Bushmills tour in Northern Ireland. The distillery's
chimney now comes with an elevator taking tourists 175 feet high
for the best view in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   The new Oresund bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden is set to
open in July 2000, making the ferry obsolete. This new 10-mile span
will speed train travel and save motorists time (but not money: the
toll is 210 kroner _ $29!)
</P>
<P>
   In Amsterdam, the Rijksmuseum is celebrating 2000 with a year of
special exhibits. Through the tourist season it will host the Glory
of the Golden Age exhibit, amassing an extravaganza of 17th-century
Dutch art. The unfortunate result: too much art, long lines, higher
prices and very likely a complex reservations-only system. Check
before heading to the museum. The Van Gogh museum is newly
renovated, and the new Dutch Resistance Museum gives the best
anywhere look at resistance to the Nazis..
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, you can now climb the stunning new glass dome on the
Reichstag, Germany's new/old Parliament building. Lighted from
within at night, the dome gives Berlin a memorable new night light.
It's free and open daily from 8 a.m. to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Prague Excursion Pass, a rail pass for Eurailers who want to
go to Prague (a non-Eurail country) without hassling with tickets,
is sold by Euraide offices in Munich (011-49-89-593-889;
www.euraide.de) and Berlin ($46 first-class, $31 second-class, $23
for those under 26). You can also get them through Euraide's U.S.
office (phone: 941-480-1555; fax: 941-480-1522) or Steves' Europe
Through the Back Door (425-771-8303).
</P>
<P>
   Portugal has just adopted a direct-dial phone system, joining a
growing list of European countries _ Spain, France, Italy, Norway,
Denmark _ that have dropped area codes. If you have old numbers for
Portugal, replace the initial 0 with a 2 and you'll likely get
through.
</P>
<P>
   In Granada, Spain, lines for the Alhambra are long and only a
certain number of people are admitted per day. You can now reserve
by phone. Call at least two days or as much as a year in advance
(011-34-90-222-4460), pay by credit card (Visa, Mastercharge
accepted; there's a surcharge of around 75 cents) and get a
reference number that allows you to pick up your ticket at any BBV
Bank (a minimum of a day before your visit) or at the main Alhambra
entrance (at least two hours before your visit).
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, visitors continue to marvel at the time-saving
efficiency of the Paris Museum Pass (which allows you to skip all
the lines) and the sneaky secret entrance to the Louvre Museum (off
Rue du Rivoli). With new security tighter, lockers in the train
stations are now available again. The grand Pompidou Gallery of
Modern Art reopened on Jan. 1. Don't miss the impressive new museum
of Jewish History in the Marais. Monet's water lilies are out of
view, as the Orangerie will be closed in 2000.

A PERFECT LANDING FOR MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARYVILLE, Mo. _ The first thing you notice about the new Hangar
Cinema is that it doesn't look like a five-screen movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   What it looks like, in fact, is a small-town airport somehow
transported to 1602 S. Main Street _ a collection of arched Quonset
hut-type metal buildings with big sliding doors (nonfunctional, it
turns out) and topped by a huge windsock.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of these structures _ the three-story one smack dab
in the middle _ is further distinguished by the small passenger
plane that appears to have plowed into its facade about 20 feet
above the sidewalk. The aircraft's tail section sticks out from the
wall, a red running light still blinking in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the cavernous lobby the aeronautical decor continues. The
bare concrete floor has been painted like an airport runway. Trash
cans appear to have been fashioned from old jet fuel barrels.
Dangling from the high ceiling are three colorful hang gliders and
an unfurled yellow parachute. The walls are decorated with junked
airplane parts: smashed doors, twisted propellers, a pilot's seat
stripped down to its metal frame, beat-up instrument panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a theater design that was both functional
and cost-effective,'' explained Hangar owner Tad Gordon, WHO.
``Your basic airplane hangar was perfect. This theater is built
from the same materials the Air Force uses for hangars. It's even
used for housing on the South Pole.''
</P>
<P>
   The early career of the New Jersey-reared Gordon, 46, centered
on his own Wall Street brokerage firm and running a commercial hog
operation. He'd never been in the movie exhibition business before
founding Countryside Cinema a few years ago in Princeton, Mo.,
where he lives with his wife and three children.
</P>
<P>
   The five-screen Hangar, his first theater, opened in November in
Maryville, a town about 40 miles north of St. Joseph with a
full-time population of nearly 12,000 and 6,000 students attending
Northwest Missouri State University.
</P>
<P>
   The Hangar has been such a success, Gordon claims, that it will
be operating in the black in only six months. If that's true, it
represents a rate of return virtually unheard of in the movie
theater business.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things hugely lacking in small towns is
entertainment,'' said Gordon, who moved to Princeton, about 70
miles east of Maryville, more than a decade ago as the co-founder
of Premium Standard Farms, a hog processing operation. ``It drove
me nuts that I had to go all the way to Kansas City to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   His answer is the Hangar, the first of what he foresees as a
chain of state-of-the-art movie houses designed specifically for
small-town America.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane-themed decor is only the frosting on the cake.
Consider these innovations:
</P>
<P>
   - A full-service Italian restaurant in the lobby seats 55; it's
open for lunch and remains in operation as late as necessary to
keep the patrons happy.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking pre-processed microwaved portions served on
Styrofoam with plastic utensils. Made-from-scratch dishes are
served on real plates with real silverware. The menu ranges from
appetizers to such entrees as pizza, lasagna and fettuccine ($6.95
to $9.95), sandwiches and desserts like cannoli and tiramisu. The
restaurant also serves wine and beer.
</P>
<P>
   (This reporter and a photographer dined at the Hangar's
restaurant and found the food and service to be the equal of most
stand-alone Italian eateries.)
</P>
<P>
   And there's more.
</P>
<P>
   - The Hangar's most unusual feature may be its ``dinner
theater,'' a 100-seat movie theater where patrons sit at tables and
order Italian meals _ or your regular concession-stand fare _ via
white telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Typically patrons arrive an hour or so before the movie starts
in order to dine, but they also can order a meal any time during
the show.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday night Pat and John Schieber of Maryville
settled into their seats, dug into their ravioli and ziti, and
while awaiting for the start of Oliver Stone's ``Any Given Sunday''
explained that the Hangar had completely changed their
entertainment habits.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Scheiber described Maryville's longtime movie house _ a
decades-old facility divided into two auditoriums _ as ``smelly and
musty with uncomfortable seats. No class, no appeal. We used to
drive to St. Joe to see movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hangar, though, got a rave review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maryville has needed a place like this for ages,'' she said.
``My two oldest boys are grown now, but they say they would have
killed to have had this when they were young. One reason kids in
small towns get into trouble is that they're bored. There's nothing
to do. This place is great.''
</P>
<P>
   - In fact, Gordon sees the Hangar as not just a movie theater
but also a community center. A game room in the lobby features two
pool tables, an air hockey game, several video games and a
large-screen TV that plays music videos. There are even two free
phones so that youngsters can make local calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a high school hangout. You don't have to see a
movie to come here to eat or play pool,'' Gordon said. And, he
emphasized, the Hangar is yet to witness any teen-age incidents or
alcohol-related disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any more problem with that than your average
Pizza Hut does,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the dinner theater is equipped with large-screen video
projection. Chiefs games and Northwest Missouri State away games
play to big crowds; the facility also can be adapted for business
and community meetings.
</P>
<P>
   - Even in the more prosaic area of simple moviegoing, the Hangar
reaches for a state-of-the-art experience.
</P>
<P>
   Because each of the complex's five auditoriums occupies its own
hangar, ``in effect, each auditorium is in a separate building,''
Gordon said. ``So there's no sound bleed. You don't hear `Top Gun'
coming through the wall when you're trying to watch a quiet love
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Each auditorium has stadium seating _ virtually unknown in
smaller markets. Plus, there's 30 feet of floor space between the
screen and the front row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every seat,'' manager Richard Groves says, ``has a perfect
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Seating capacity in the individual houses ranges from 150 to
249.
</P>
<P>
   - The gently arched ceilings of the hangar structures provided
an unexpected bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for the floor, there's hardly a flat surface in this
place,'' Gordon said. ``Turns out that's what gives us such great
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, once treated with sound-absorbing material, the curved
surfaces became an acoustical dream.
</P>
<P>
   The Hangar offers nearly perfect digital sound, according to
Larry Jacobs, whose Lenexa-based LJ Technologies Inc., installs
theater sound and projection systems throughout the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound absorption up those side walls, along the ceiling
and down again along the back is almost complete,'' said Jacobs,
who last year won a technical Oscar for his part in developing a
system to analyze movie theater projection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most theaters just have laid-in ceiling tiles. But the Hangar
has minimum reflection, virtually no sound anomalies, no sound
clutter. It's as good as anything I've encountered.''
</P>
<P>
   - There's more. Each of the Hangar's five auditoriums is
equipped with four TV monitors mounted on the side walls. Before
the movie this closed-circuit system shows advertising, the
theater's screening schedule, previews of upcoming movies and
public service announcements. It can display sporting events pulled
off satellites or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local ads pay for the whole thing,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is working on a campaign to spread the word about his new
movie palace. Although the Hangar is drawing audiences from a
100-mile radius _ including Iowans who travel across the state line
20 miles north of Maryville (this reporter spotted several Iowa
plates in the parking lot) _ locals have been without a first-class
movie theater for so long that many have fallen out of the
film-going habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out here it's strictly `show me,' '' Gordon said. ``Word of
mouth. Advertising doesn't work. You don't try something new until
someone comes up to you and says: `I was there. It was neat.' Then
you go see for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of his effort centers on developing the Hangar's mascot,
the fictional Bob the bush pilot. Bob's a hard-luck sort of guy
whose planes always crash. The aircraft parts scattered around the
theater supposedly are the result of Bob's past mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is developing a lobby display that traces Bob's history.
The idea is to suck customers into the fun of this local mythology.
</P>
<P>
   As the majority owner of the Hangar, Gordon is looking to expand
the concept, although he plans to steer clear of big cities and
competition from major chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conveniently, there are lots of small college towns in the
Midwest,'' he said. ``Maryville was just one of 10 regional sites
we considered. We'll perfect the concept here, then go looking for
new locations.''

GROUP REKINDLES INTEREST IN KC OPTOMETRIST'S UNORTHODOX METHODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN UHLENHUTH  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Were you a patient?
</P>
<P>
   If you were a patient of Joseph J. Kennebeck, an optometrist
practicing in Kansas City from the 1930s to the 1970s, and if you
can provide details about his treatment technique, call Joseph
Miele in New Jersey at (732) 671-5550. He is gathering information
from former patients in an attempt to piece together Kennebeck's
methodology.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. Kennebeck may have been onto something.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1930s to the 1970s, Kennebeck practiced optometry in
Kansas City, but his methods were different from those used by most
optometrists then or now. He believed he could improve vision or at
least prevent further losses by putting patients through a regimen
of eye exercises and teaching them a different way of reading.
</P>
<P>
   Kennebeck died in 1977, but not before putting his thoughts into
a book titled Why Eyeglasses Are Harmful for Children and Young
People.
</P>
<P>
   Theories similar to Kennebeck's have come in and out of vogue
over the years. And now a group of optometrists from across the
country is seeking former patients and colleagues who could shed
light on the sort of unorthodox work done by Kennebeck.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Miele is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole group of people who are interested in the kind
of things Kennebeck was trying to do,'' said Miele, who practices
optometry in Middletown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas being explored, he said, are similar to the ones
Kennebeck used decades ago in his practice downtown and, later, on
the Country Club Plaza and in Brookside.
</P>
<P>
   Kennebeck's daughter, Sister Rose Joseph Kennebeck, is with the
Benedictine order in Nauvoo, Ill. She worked in her father's office
a couple of summers in the 1940s and remembers patients ``from all
over the United States'' who would come for treatment of
nearsightedness, farsightedness and crossed eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is fuzzy on the particulars of his approach, she
thinks he usually began by lobbying his patients to give up their
glasses. She says her father had boxes and boxes filled with
discarded spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   His theory, as she recalls, was that he could strengthen eyes by
forcing them to focus without glasses. She remembers seeing 30
persons at a time seated in the office with various lenses over
their eyes. They would then look either out the window at a distant
landmark or at a book nearby, depending on their vision problem.
Some patients looked through glass lenses of varying strengths, and
others peered through tiny pinholes poked in metal lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Carney, a retired Kansas City priest, sought out
Kennebeck's therapy in the early 1950s. Carney's glasses were a
nuisance during the baseball and basketball games he played while a
student at Conception Seminary in northern Missouri. He had heard
that Kennebeck favored jettisoning spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   Although two other optometrists had told Carney he needed
glasses, he got rid of them at Kennebeck's urging _ flung them out
the car window as he was driving over the Missouri River, in fact,
on his way back from Kennebeck's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't wear glasses for 20 years,'' he said. ``I was 41 when
I got glasses again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennebeck convinced Carney that his sore, watery eyes were the
result of poor reading habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would stare at the lines and never blink my eyes,'' Carney
said. ``My eyes never relaxed, and got sore. Watering was a
reaction to soreness. He said, `You have to blink more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Brookside resident Don McDonald Sr., a nephew of Kennebeck, has
seen letters from former patients testifying to how much their
sight improved with Kennebeck's unorthodox treatments.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald remembers that the optometrist refused to ever wear
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Kennebeck definitely was an outsider in his profession. He spoke
to a group of optometrists at Columbia University about his
technique early on, but he never gained a following, according to
his daughter. He then kept his theories to himself, recalls Louis
Bono, a retired optometrist who grew up as a neighbor of
Kennebeck's in Brookside.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bono didn't embrace Kennebeck's approach, he recalls
that patients reported success. Men rejected by the Air Force
because of vision problems often sought out Kennebeck's services.
And Bono says many of them improved their vision enough to be
accepted as pilots in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could bring them perhaps from 20-30 to 20-20'' by teaching
them tactics to make sense of blurry images, according to Bono.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Kennebeck's approach was the premise that some vision
problems are caused at least in part by the way people use their
eyes. Refractive disorders _ nearsightedness and farsightedness _
occur when light rays, which are bent or refracted by the lens and
the cornea, meet either in front of or behind the retina, causing
blurry vision. The distance is too long, from front to back, in the
case of nearsightedness (also known as myopia), and too short in
the case of farsightedness (hyperopia).
</P>
<P>
   The role of reading and other ``near work'' in the development
of myopia ``is a topic of great debate in the research community,''
said Karla Zadnik, an associate professor at the Ohio State
University College of Optometry. ``It's an ongoing debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennebeck believed that children should not wear glasses at
least until the age of 10 or so, when eye growth mostly ceases.
</P>
<P>
   Studies involving different animal species have established that
eye growth during childhood is affected by environmental factors _
specifically, the clarity of the images eyes are exposed to. An eye
exposed to a fuzzy image will grow in such a way as to compensate,
to some degree, for the vision impairment, according to Michael
Oberdorfer, a grants administrator for the National Eye Institute
in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is financing a study of 450 nearsighted
children to determine whether early eye strain exacerbates myopia,
Zadnik said. The study also might show whether the strain that
results from ``near work'' contributes to myopia.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the children are being fitted with standard single-lens
glasses and half with progressive bifocals to minimize the strain
of reading and other close work. In the next three years the
researchers will compare the two groups' myopia. The results might
suggest that early eye strain promotes nearsightedness, which would
reinforce Kennebeck's belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talking about retarding the future development of
myopia,'' not regaining vision that's already been lost, Zadnik
said. She characterized Kennebeck's claims as ``pretty dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   David Guyton, too, is circumspect about Kennebeck's apparent
belief that he could prevent or in some cases correct certain
visual problems. Guyton is a professor of ophthalmology and
director of the Krieger Children's Eye Center at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors who treat vision problems acknowledge that glasses,
``especially for close work, can make your nearsightedness worse,''
Guyton said. ``That we know pretty well. The way to keep it from
getting worse is not to push glasses on people.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the problem of how people with refractive errors
will compensate for whatever visual problems they have, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kennebeck's theory that children and young adults, at
least, could exercise their way to improved vision, Guyton said:
``There are certain exercises for eyes that are misaligned that can
make them better. There's not much that can be done in the way of
exercises to change refractive errors that we know of. There's been
a fringe element of people out there all this time who have claimed
there are ways to do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of treatment is looked at by most ophthalmologists
and optometrists as a type of quackery. And yet, there are certain
things that these `quacks' have done that do work. You can't say
everything is wrong. Some of the things they are doing have merit,
and some don't. Separating them out is a bag of worms.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When women go bad, they rarely follow the path of Pheng
Siriboury.
</P>
<P>
   Siriboury is charged with using a gun and taking several people
hostage while attempting to rob an Olathe bank on New Year's Eve.
Her next court appearance is set for Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about that incident _ not the confrontation, not the
setting, not the gun, was typical of how women run afoul of the
law. Females tend to commit crimes in ways and for reasons distinct
from males.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, an increasing number of girls are being detained and
being sent to juvenile treatment centers, and more women are being
arrested and charged with domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Women account for a growing proportion of Missouri's prison
inmates. In 1980 women were 3 percent of the prison population of
5,014. Now they make up almost 8 percent of the population of about
26,300.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this alarming rise, women continue to cause a relatively
small percentage of the crimes in the United States. Women on
average accounted for 14 percent of the violent offenders between
1993 and 1997, according to figures released in December by the
U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1989 and 1998, arrests of women and girls increased by
27.5 percent. Although the numbers in most major violent crime
categories dropped or remained pretty stable, aggravated and simple
assaults by women increased dramatically _ by 67 percent and 98
percent, respectively. Offenses by women against family members
increased by 130 percent. And drug-related arrests of women also
have increased substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests of female minors increased by 50 percent between 1989
and 1998, also fueled in large part by disproportionate spikes in
aggravated and simple assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Total arrests of male minors, though about three times as high
as arrests of girls, increased by only 16.5 percent during that
period.
</P>
<P>
   Meda Chesney-Lind isn't ready to conclude that women and girls
are getting rougher and tougher. She suspects that greater numbers
of women arrested in domestic disputes or girls detained for simple
assaults may reflect a changed attitude on the part of police,
schools and society in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us suspect that the push that the women's movement
initiated to encourage mandatory arrest in domestic violence has
been a source of this,'' said Chesney-Lind, a professor of women's
studies at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, and author of
several books about females who break the law.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Hanna, a Vermont law professor who for three years
prosecuted people for domestic violence in Baltimore, said she also
thinks women are being prosecuted more frequently in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   She cites two reasons. One is decreased social tolerance for
aggressive women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police are more willing to arrest women'' and in a domestic
dispute will sometimes arrest both parties if they aren't sure whom
to blame, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, according to Hanna, ``Women are more likely to strike
back and to use violence in a relationship. The stereotypical big
bad husband with a wife cowering in the corner is less and less
likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Domestic violence charges aren't reserved for spouses or
partners. Chesney-Lind, who has studied police reports about
domestic disputes, said they are sometimes leveled against
daughters who can't be arrested for, say, leaving home or hanging
out with the ``wrong'' boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds for assault charges are sometimes quite thin.
Chesney-Lind cited one case in which a girl was charged with
assault for throwing cookies at her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the walls of home, many girls who commit crimes do so
within the context of a street gang, according to Hanna, who has
researched girl gangs and violent girls.
</P>
<P>
   The growing numbers have provoked opposing interpretations. Some
thinkers ascribe it to what Hanna calls a ``decline in chivalry.''
Translated, that means a decreased willingness to overlook violent
behavior among girls.
</P>
<P>
   Chesney-Lind points to ``zero tolerance'' policies at schools,
which can result in adolescents being referred to law authorities
for offenses that would have gone unreported in an earlier time.
</P>
<P>
   Another camp think girls have, in fact, become more aggressive
and willing to break laws _ ``one of the unintended consequences of
liberation,'' Hanna said.
</P>
<P>
   Females tend to target other females when they commit crimes,
and simple assaults are one of the most prevalent crimes committed
by women and girls.
</P>
<P>
   Much female violence is ``gossip gone lethal. It's interpersonal
issues that spill over into a violent area,'' Chesney-Lind said.
</P>
<P>
   She characterizes their crimes as ``expressionist,'' or ``an
extension of women's more normal kinds of relationships with each
other. There can be a lot of high drama around women's
relationships with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Men's crimes tend to be what she calls ``instrumental. It's
using violence to get at some other goal,'' often money or power or
status.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna suspects that much adolescent female violence stems from
competition for men, a contest that is waged in more ``socially
acceptable'' ways among most women.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that's so fascinating to discover is that
many of these girls are competing for high-status males. It's like
the head of the cheering squad wants to go out with captain of the
football team. It's girls competing for the most high-status
males.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna quoted a theory formulated by Anne Campbell, an
evolutionary psychologist from England: ``Female violence is more
likely to arise when there are fewer good men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's absolutely right,'' Hanna said.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding sexual competition, Hanna contends, is what she
believes to be a current ``cultural norm that says `aggressiveness
is sexy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna sees signs of a social embrace of female aggressiveness in
certain pop cultural and entertainment figures such as the Disney
movie character Mulan, some members of the Spice Girls music group
and Xena, Warrior Princess.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Levin, a professor of sociology and criminology and
director of the Brudnick Center on Violence at Northeastern
University in Boston, disagrees: He thinks aggressiveness has lost
some appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he concurs with Hanna that girls have grown more
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``And sadly enough, I think women have used men as a role model.
Teen-aged girls are more likely to get involved in violence than
they used to, but they haven't caught up with their male
counterparts. Women's violent behavior is where men's was in the
'60s and '70s. Women are still using their fists, pulling hair and
occasionally pulling a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of women recently charged with battery sought legal
counsel from Scott Gyllenborg, a criminal defender in Olathe. His
take on it: that police ``are becoming more sensitive to the fact
that all along, women have had their share of domestic violence. If
the idea is to arrest and prosecute to instill respect for the law,
it has to work both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   He definitely thinks more women are being arrested. What's less
clear to him is whether they've grown more criminally aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Also among Gyllenborg's recent caseload are two women charged
with criminal damage to property _ two professional, middle-class
mothers who were accused of expanding their usual suburban
chauffeuring duties to include aiding and abetting.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each case, completely independently, somebody (ticked) off
the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl involved took umbrage at another girl who ``dissed''
her boyfriend. The boy involved in the other case was angry about
being confronted by a friend's parents about drinking in their
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd go home and tell the folks about it,'' Gyllenborg said.
``The moms, in each case, offered to take them back to the house
and damage some property.''
</P>
<P>
   There were fathers in both households.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was what was kind of weird about the whole thing,''
Gyllenborg said. ``I'm not sure the fathers even knew anything had
happened.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   He's trying not to talk with food in his mouth, but Roman
Polanski is brimming with ideas and can't quite contain himself.
After all, a little grilled Porcini salad should never get in the
way of a discussion about sex _ particularly for Polanski.
</P>
<P>
   But before he can get his words out, he's interrupted. He
doesn't seem to mind. She's blond, built and gorgeous. And, yes,
she's young.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing here?'' she says as her mother stands
beside her, clearly in awe of her daughter's famous acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is Rome. He manages to stand up, sandwiched between his
chair and the table. There's a moment of awkward silence before the
young lady's mother points out that Francesca has to get some sleep
because she's been up since dawn posing for a calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, it was nice seeing you again,'' Polanski says politely,
still clutching his napkin.
</P>
<P>
   After a sip of wine, he admits that he can't quite remember how
he knows Francesca.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know so many of these young girls,'' he says, seemingly
oblivious to the irony hanging in the air.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, at 66, Polanski has mastered the art of ignoring
the obvious. He's certainly no fool: He knows exactly what comes to
people's minds the instant his name is mentioned. That's why he
loathes interviews and occasionally interrogates journalists before
agreeing to a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My story has been told many times,'' he'll say. ``I'm tired of
talking about it. I think I'll pass.''
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that after nearly 30 years as Hollywood's
best-known pariah, he is anything but blase about his image. In
fact, he's still angry about it.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm autumn evening in Rome, Polanski settles down for
dinner, a bottle of Chianti and a surprisingly candid conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly he's here to promote an upcoming project, ``The Ninth
Gate,'' which stars Johnny Depp as a book broker in search of
manuscripts that unlock the mysteries of Satan. This is Polanski's
25th movie, but he believes he has yet to make his masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made a film that makes me truly proud from the
beginning to the end,'' he says. Perhaps that's why the filmmaker
doesn't try too hard to sell his new project. Instead, the
discussion quickly turns to sex, a subject Polanski feels he knows
very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great sex enthusiast,'' he says. ``But not kinky sex.
Doing it with two girls, yes, that's fine. But not with a chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously though, people don't realize how important a part
sex plays in human life,'' he goes on. ``Everybody thinks about it.
In fact, I think between the ages of 17 and 40 men just think about
sex more and more. Now, I actually think about it much less,
because I have a family. And plus, at my age, your glands function
differently. Shame.''
</P>
<P>
   He feels sorry for people unfortunate enough to have entered
their sexual prime within the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex used to be fun,'' he says. ``You could vent your
frustrations without taking risks. The period in which I went
through my manhood was the freest period sexually in the history of
human beings. It was between the pill and AIDS. Sure, there was
syphilis, but there was also Penicillin. Now, you have to screw
around parading in a condom.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski is proud of his sexual education, which he received in
Hollywood during the 1970s _ alongside such pals as Jack Nicholson
and Warren Beatty. When the director first visited L.A. in 1963, he
was already a star. His low-budget Polish film, ``Knife in the
Water,'' the story of a married couple playing perverse games with
a hitchhiker, had already received an Oscar nomination; three years
later, he managed to persuade Catherine Deneuve to appear in
``Repulsion'' wearing only an ultra-sheer nightgown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roman was fast-moving and fast-talking,'' remembers his
longtime friend Anjelica Huston. ``He was arrogant in the way
Nureyev was. There was this Eastern Bloc flair. He wore silk shirts
from Turnbull and Asser unbuttoned to his stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposite sex was always attracted to him,'' says
``Chinatown'' producer Robert Evans. ``He was a magnet wherever he
went.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Polanski made ``The Fearless Vampire Killers'' _ his
first English-language film _ with Sharon Tate, whom he married the
same year in Los Angeles. The couple rented a house on Cielo Drive,
where, in 1969, not long after the release of ``Rosemary's Baby,''
four disciples of Charles Manson broke in and murdered Tate and her
unborn child, along with three houseguests.
</P>
<P>
   Polanski, who was away on business in London, returned to Los
Angeles the following day, to face allegations in the press that
his onscreen flirtations with the occult were to blame for his
wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media is responsible for most of my trouble,'' he says.
``The occult bores me. I just think it's a good subject for a
movie. But the media perpetuates this. I've been sick of it for
years, but I guess you get used to living with your sickness.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to ``Tess,'' ``Chinatown'' and ``Death and the
Maiden'' as evidence that not all of his films are obsessed with
sex or the occult.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm a real weirdo,'' he says. ``They see me
through the prism of a few of my films and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. There was also that little incident in 1977,
involving a 13-year-old girl, Quaaludes and Nicholson's Jacuzzi on
Mulholland Drive. What began as a Vogue photo shoot ended with a
sexual encounter between Polanski and his young model.
</P>
<P>
   This is the one topic Polanski is definitely tired of discussing
_ and reading about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pisses me off, actually,'' he says. ``Enough. But what can
I do about it? It's hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski tried to set the record straight in his 1984
autobiography, denying that he forced himself on the girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no doubt about (her) experience and lack of
inhibition,'' he writes. ``She wasn't unresponsive.''
</P>
<P>
   After he was arrested and charged with six crimes, ranging from
rape to ``perversion,'' his lawyers arranged a plea bargain,
leaving him guilty of only the least serious charge, unlawful
sexual intercourse. He underwent a psychiatric evaluation while
serving 42 days in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his release, he expected to be sentenced with a fine or
probation, but when he heard that the judge had something else in
mind, he decided to skip town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unfortunate situation, and the judge was part of
it,'' he says now. ``He was holding press conferences and just
catering to the media. That's why I left. I went to prison and that
was supposed to be it. All parties had agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 he made a settlement with the girl and the civil suit
was dropped. While he feels he has paid his debt, Polanski is still
considered a fugitive by authorities in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Today, despite everything, Polanski has no problem admitting he
still likes younger women. He has been married to actress
Emmanuelle Seigner, who is 32 years his junior, for 10 years. They
live on Paris' avenue Montaigne with their two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked younger women,'' he says. ``I think it has
something to do with an image I had of a woman when I was young.
Maybe my mother? Maybe the first love of my life? But why should I
try to figure that out? That's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski's honesty about his sexuality would undoubtedly seem
out of place in America today. He doesn't understand all of the
fuss over Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most men in important positions in America have these types of
affairs,'' he says. ``It's so chaste. What, they never had a
blowjob? Come on. Who cares?''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, Polanski gets distracted. He is fixated on the
guitarist working his way around the restaurant's outdoor patio.
When the man _ collecting lire in an old hat _ finally arrives in
front of the director, he is quickly shooed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always give money to beggars and singers, but he gets on my
nerves, this guy,'' Polanski says. ``He produces sounds that are
unpleasant and insists on being rewarded for it. How arrogant!''
</P>
<P>
   He turns in his chair to see how much money the man is taking
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was a child, I could never ignore people like that,''
he says. ``I think I identify with them _ any beggar, really. I
remember walking with my mother when I was a little boy and there
was a beggar with a beard always sitting in the same place. Once,
he vomited all over and I remember how moved I was. It didn't occur
to me that he was drunk; I just felt so sorry for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The memory is one of only a handful of images Polanski has of
his mother, Bula. He grew up in a barbed-wired ghetto in wartime
Cracow.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, when he was 8, she was taken to Auschwitz, never to
return. He spent the next several years slipping through chain-link
fences in search of food for his family before he escaped on his
own, finally settling in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Holocaust has more influence on my life now than I
thought it would,'' he says. ``I think the character of a man is
made when he is a very young child. The whole mind is formed
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his traumatic childhood, Polanski never wanted to
have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea terrified me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust is still so real to him, in fact, that when Steven
Speilberg approached him to direct ``Schindler's List,'' he
declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I could do a good movie there,'' Polanski says.
``I was too close. It was very difficult to watch. The places and
even the people looked the way I remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski, who has been observing Hollywood as an outsider for
the last 30 years, has grown deeply critical of the American
moviemaking machine. He's particularly offended by the huge
salaries actors are commanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly can't imagine how a person with this type of salary
can keep his sanity and sense of proportion,'' he says. ``Some have
the brains to realize it is just money, but others _ most _ start
to think they're special in all other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski offers a case in point: John Travolta. The two were
supposed to work together three years ago on a film called ``The
Double.'' Travolta was reportedly unhappy with the script and
demanded changes, ultimately requesting that Polanski be taken off
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started reading, and right away he got offended by my
directing him,'' he says. ``There is an enormous ego there. He's
probably never been directed before. Most actors enjoy it. I've
worked with bigger stars than him: Harrison Ford, Jack Nicholson,
John Huston.'' (Travolta declined to comment for this story.)
</P>
<P>
   Polanski doesn't consider himself difficult to work with, as
long as those around him are professional. That hasn't always been
the case. On ``Rosemary's Baby,'' he recalls another big battle _
not with his star, Mia Farrow, but with her husband, Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was too macho,'' Polanski says. ``I think he harmed her
career a lot in that period.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrow was supposed to act alongside Sinatra in ``The
Detective,'' which was going into production while she was still at
work on ``Rosemary's Baby.'' According to Polanski, Sinatra ordered
her to begin working on his own film, but she refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he sent a lawyer over with divorce papers,'' Polanski says.
``That's an assh---'s behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   He's surprised that Farrow hasn't worked more in the time since
their collaboration. He's not shocked, however, at the level of
fame achieved by his old friend Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Polanski suddenly bursts out laughing. ``I taught Jack how to
ski,'' he says. ``This was many years ago in Gstaad. The first time
I took him up the mountain, he thought I was trying to kill him. He
just kept falling, but he was indestructible. And then one day I
lost him on the mountain and he came back to the chalet at 10
o'clock in the evening, completely ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could see more of him,'' Polanski adds with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   Huston, because of her long relationship with Nicholson, has
observed the two men together many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roman is one of the few people who really makes Jack think,''
she says. ``Spiritually, they are in sync with each other. They
share a common genius and also a deep sorrow _ several deep
sorrows.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski misses just a few things about L.A. ``Like Nat &AMP; Al's
Deli,'' he says. ``They have great pastrami. Los Angeles is ugly as
hell, but there is one beautiful view, at night, from the hills. I
miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Polanski ever tempted to fly back to LAX and see what happens
when he walks through Immigration?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were not condemned to the media exposure, I would
probably go back to get it over with, at least for peace of mind,''
he says. ``But I don't think I could really cope with what it
entails. It would be a circus all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   With the plates cleared away and most of the other diners long
gone, Polanski decides that perhaps he's said enough. He is anxious
to get some sleep, and he wants to call his wife in Paris before it
gets too late. But when he's asked about his regrets in life, he
can't refuse a few parting words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've always regretted that I was not in the house on
Cielo Drive the night Sharon Tate was murdered,'' he says. ``I've
always thought a teeny bit that maybe I could have prevented it.''
</P>
<P>
   After it's pointed out that he would most likely have been
killed as well, Polanski empties his glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' he says. ``But at least I wouldn't have the feeling
that I still have. I wouldn't still be wondering.''

   He's trying not to talk with food in his mouth, but Roman
Polanski is brimming with ideas and can't quite contain himself.

doesn't seem to mind. She's blond, built and gorgeous. And, yes,
she's young.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing here?'' she says as her mother stands
beside her, clearly in awe of her daughter's famous acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is Rome. He manages to stand up, sandwiched between his
chair and the table. There's a moment of awkward silence before the
young lady's mother points out that Francesca has to get some sleep
because she's been up since dawn posing for a calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, it was nice seeing you again,'' Polanski says politely,
still clutching his napkin.
</P>
<P>
   After a sip of wine, he admits that he can't quite remember how
he knows Francesca.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know so many of these young girls,'' he says, seemingly
oblivious to the irony hanging in the air.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, at 66, Polanski has mastered the art of ignoring
the obvious. He's certainly no fool: He knows exactly what comes to
people's minds the instant his name is mentioned. That's why he
loathes interviews and occasionally interrogates journalists before
agreeing to a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My story has been told many times,'' he'll say. ``I'm tired of
talking about it. I think I'll pass.''
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that after nearly 30 years as Hollywood's
best-known pariah, he is anything but blase about his image. In
fact, he's still angry about it.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm autumn evening in Rome, Polanski settles down for
dinner, a bottle of Chianti and a surprisingly candid conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly he's here to promote an upcoming project, ``The Ninth
Gate,'' which stars Johnny Depp as a book broker in search of
manuscripts that unlock the mysteries of Satan. This is Polanski's
25th movie, but he believes he has yet to make his masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made a film that makes me truly proud from the
beginning to the end,'' he says. Perhaps that's why the filmmaker
doesn't try too hard to sell his new project. Instead, the
discussion quickly turns to sex, a subject Polanski feels he knows
very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great sex enthusiast,'' he says. ``But not kinky sex.
Doing it with two girls, yes, that's fine. But not with a chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously though, people don't realize how important a part
sex plays in human life,'' he goes on. ``Everybody thinks about it.
In fact, I think between the ages of 17 and 40 men just think about
sex more and more. Now, I actually think about it much less,
because I have a family. And plus, at my age, your glands function
differently. Shame.''
</P>
<P>
   He feels sorry for people unfortunate enough to have entered
their sexual prime within the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex used to be fun,'' he says. ``You could vent your
frustrations without taking risks. The period in which I went
through my manhood was the freest period sexually in the history of
human beings. It was between the pill and AIDS. Sure, there was
syphilis, but there was also Penicillin. Now, you have to screw
around parading in a condom.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski is proud of his sexual education, which he received in
Hollywood during the 1970s _ alongside such pals as Jack Nicholson
and Warren Beatty. When the director first visited L.A. in 1963, he
was already a star. His low-budget Polish film, ``Knife in the
Water,'' the story of a married couple playing perverse games with
a hitchhiker, had already received an Oscar nomination; three years
later, he managed to persuade Catherine Deneuve to appear in
``Repulsion'' wearing only an ultra-sheer nightgown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roman was fast-moving and fast-talking,'' remembers his
longtime friend Anjelica Huston. ``He was arrogant in the way
Nureyev was. There was this Eastern Bloc flair. He wore silk shirts
from Turnbull and Asser unbuttoned to his stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposite sex was always attracted to him,'' says
``Chinatown'' producer Robert Evans. ``He was a magnet wherever he
went.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Polanski made ``The Fearless Vampire Killers'' _ his
first English-language film _ with Sharon Tate, whom he married the
same year in Los Angeles. The couple rented a house on Cielo Drive,
where, in 1969, not long after the release of ``Rosemary's Baby,''
four disciples of Charles Manson broke in and murdered Tate and her
unborn child, along with three houseguests.
</P>
<P>
   Polanski, who was away on business in London, returned to Los
Angeles the following day, to face allegations in the press that
his onscreen flirtations with the occult were to blame for his
wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media is responsible for most of my trouble,'' he says.
``The occult bores me. I just think it's a good subject for a
movie. But the media perpetuates this. I've been sick of it for
years, but I guess you get used to living with your sickness.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to ``Tess,'' ``Chinatown'' and ``Death and the
Maiden'' as evidence that not all of his films are obsessed with
sex or the occult.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm a real weirdo,'' he says. ``They see me
through the prism of a few of my films and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. There was also that little incident in 1977,
involving a 13-year-old girl, Quaaludes and Nicholson's Jacuzzi on
Mulholland Drive. What began as a Vogue photo shoot ended with a
sexual encounter between Polanski and his young model.
</P>
<P>
   This is the one topic Polanski is definitely tired of discussing
_ and reading about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pisses me off, actually,'' he says. ``Enough. But what can
I do about it? It's hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski tried to set the record straight in his 1984
autobiography, denying that he forced himself on the girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no doubt about (her) experience and lack of
inhibition,'' he writes. ``She wasn't unresponsive.''
</P>
<P>
   After he was arrested and charged with six crimes, ranging from
rape to ``perversion,'' his lawyers arranged a plea bargain,
leaving him guilty of only the least serious charge, unlawful
sexual intercourse. He underwent a psychiatric evaluation while
serving 42 days in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his release, he expected to be sentenced with a fine or
probation, but when he heard that the judge had something else in
mind, he decided to skip town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unfortunate situation, and the judge was part of
it,'' he says now. ``He was holding press conferences and just
catering to the media. That's why I left. I went to prison and that
was supposed to be it. All parties had agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 he made a settlement with the girl and the civil suit
was dropped. While he feels he has paid his debt, Polanski is still
considered a fugitive by authorities in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Today, despite everything, Polanski has no problem admitting he
still likes younger women. He has been married to actress
Emmanuelle Seigner, who is 32 years his junior, for 10 years. They
live on Paris' avenue Montaigne with their two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked younger women,'' he says. ``I think it has
something to do with an image I had of a woman when I was young.
Maybe my mother? Maybe the first love of my life? But why should I
try to figure that out? That's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski's honesty about his sexuality would undoubtedly seem
out of place in America today. He doesn't understand all of the
fuss over Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most men in important positions in America have these types of
affairs,'' he says. ``It's so chaste. What, they never had a
blowjob? Come on. Who cares?''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, Polanski gets distracted. He is fixated on the
guitarist working his way around the restaurant's outdoor patio.
When the man _ collecting lire in an old hat _ finally arrives in
front of the director, he is quickly shooed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always give money to beggars and singers, but he gets on my
nerves, this guy,'' Polanski says. ``He produces sounds that are
unpleasant and insists on being rewarded for it. How arrogant!''
</P>
<P>
   He turns in his chair to see how much money the man is taking
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was a child, I could never ignore people like that,''
he says. ``I think I identify with them _ any beggar, really. I
remember walking with my mother when I was a little boy and there
was a beggar with a beard always sitting in the same place. Once,
he vomited all over and I remember how moved I was. It didn't occur
to me that he was drunk; I just felt so sorry for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The memory is one of only a handful of images Polanski has of
his mother, Bula. He grew up in a barbed-wired ghetto in wartime
Cracow.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, when he was 8, she was taken to Auschwitz, never to
return. He spent the next several years slipping through chain-link
fences in search of food for his family before he escaped on his
own, finally settling in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Holocaust has more influence on my life now than I
thought it would,'' he says. ``I think the character of a man is
made when he is a very young child. The whole mind is formed
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his traumatic childhood, Polanski never wanted to
have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea terrified me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust is still so real to him, in fact, that when Steven
Speilberg approached him to direct ``Schindler's List,'' he
declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I could do a good movie there,'' Polanski says.
``I was too close. It was very difficult to watch. The places and
even the people looked the way I remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski, who has been observing Hollywood as an outsider for
the last 30 years, has grown deeply critical of the American
moviemaking machine. He's particularly offended by the huge
salaries actors are commanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly can't imagine how a person with this type of salary
can keep his sanity and sense of proportion,'' he says. ``Some have
the brains to realize it is just money, but others _ most _ start
to think they're special in all other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski offers a case in point: John Travolta. The two were
supposed to work together three years ago on a film called ``The
Double.'' Travolta was reportedly unhappy with the script and
demanded changes, ultimately requesting that Polanski be taken off
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started reading, and right away he got offended by my
directing him,'' he says. ``There is an enormous ego there. He's
probably never been directed before. Most actors enjoy it. I've
worked with bigger stars than him: Harrison Ford, Jack Nicholson,
John Huston.'' (Travolta declined to comment for this story.)
</P>
<P>
   Polanski doesn't consider himself difficult to work with, as
long as those around him are professional. That hasn't always been
the case. On ``Rosemary's Baby,'' he recalls another big battle _
not with his star, Mia Farrow, but with her husband, Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was too macho,'' Polanski says. ``I think he harmed her
career a lot in that period.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrow was supposed to act alongside Sinatra in ``The
Detective,'' which was going into production while she was still at
work on ``Rosemary's Baby.'' According to Polanski, Sinatra ordered
her to begin working on his own film, but she refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he sent a lawyer over with divorce papers,'' Polanski says.
``That's an assh---'s behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   He's surprised that Farrow hasn't worked more in the time since
their collaboration. He's not shocked, however, at the level of
fame achieved by his old friend Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Polanski suddenly bursts out laughing. ``I taught Jack how to
ski,'' he says. ``This was many years ago in Gstaad. The first time
I took him up the mountain, he thought I was trying to kill him. He
just kept falling, but he was indestructible. And then one day I
lost him on the mountain and he came back to the chalet at 10
o'clock in the evening, completely ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could see more of him,'' Polanski adds with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   Huston, because of her long relationship with Nicholson, has
observed the two men together many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roman is one of the few people who really makes Jack think,''
she says. ``Spiritually, they are in sync with each other. They
share a common genius and also a deep sorrow _ several deep
sorrows.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski misses just a few things about L.A. ``Like Nat &AMP; Al's
Deli,'' he says. ``They have great pastrami. Los Angeles is ugly as
hell, but there is one beautiful view, at night, from the hills. I
miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Polanski ever tempted to fly back to LAX and see what happens
when he walks through Immigration?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were not condemned to the media exposure, I would
probably go back to get it over with, at least for peace of mind,''
he says. ``But I don't think I could really cope with what it
entails. It would be a circus all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   With the plates cleared away and most of the other diners long
gone, Polanski decides that perhaps he's said enough. He is anxious
to get some sleep, and he wants to call his wife in Paris before it
gets too late. But when he's asked about his regrets in life, he
can't refuse a few parting words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've always regretted that I was not in the house on
Cielo Drive the night Sharon Tate was murdered,'' he says. ``I've
always thought a teeny bit that maybe I could have prevented it.''
</P>
<P>
   After it's pointed out that he would most likely have been
killed as well, Polanski empties his glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' he says. ``But at least I wouldn't have the feeling
that I still have. I wouldn't still be wondering.''

MIKE MCCURRY REMAINS WASHINGTON'S GREAT UNTOUCHABLE

<P>
   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week an Internet startup no one had ever heard of with a
business model that it won't discuss named former presidential
press secretary Mike McCurry to its advisory board. This made
headlines in The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and The Los Angeles
Times, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for stock options, McCurry will serve as a part-time
adviser to Grassroots.com, a political portal that will launch in
February (John Sununu, Tony Blankley and Robert Shrum are also
advisers to Grassroots.com, which says with sublime vagueness that
it plans to ``increase civic participation'' as a
``political-action destination.'').
</P>
<P>
   McCurry left the White House more than a year ago and has kept a
low profile since. Why does Washington remain fascinated with him?
</P>
<P>
   The obvious reason for McCurry's celebrity is that he appeared
on television so much. He started the practice of televising the
daily White House press briefing -- putting him on C-SPAN and CNN
almost every day -- and he was the Clinton administration's only
public face during the Monica Lewinsky annus horriblis.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly McCurry still entrances Washington because he is the
city's great untouchable -- liked by all, admired by all, barely
scarred by a scandal that destroyed everyone else it crashed into.
</P>
<P>
   His untouchability is peculiar, because McCurry is a disaster
magnet. His first D.C. employer was Sen. Harrison ``Pete''
Williams, D-N.J., who was convicted of bribery and conspiracy in
the Abscam scandal.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry subsequently served as spokesman for the 1984 John Glenn
presidential campaign, the 1988 Bruce Babbitt presidential
campaign, the 1988 Lloyd Bentsen vice-presidential campaign and the
1992 Bob Kerrey presidential campaign -- four woeful efforts. (''I
have worked for a long line of losers,'' McCurry once joked.)
</P>
<P>
   McCurry then served as mouthpiece for highly unmemorable
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and was presidential press
secretary during the tawdriest White House scandal in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   This does not sound like the resume of a successful man. Yet
McCurry has been considered a stand-up guy and a wonderful press
secretary. He has survived 20 years in D.C. politics without making
an enemy, a wonderful and terrible achievement. (His post-White
House buckraking of speeches and corporate PR includes appearances
with Marlin Fitzwater, commentaries with Tony Blankley, and a PR
partnership with Susan Molinari.)
</P>
<P>
   McCurry has skated through D.C. because he possesses two gifts:
a first-class temperament and an exceptional understanding of
loyalty. As press secretary, McCurry was political enough to
explain a presidential position -- even an untenable one -- with
eloquence and a straight face; honest (and cynical) enough to wink
at reporters and whisper his real views to them later; ironic
enough to joke about it all on the press plane a month afterward.
</P>
<P>
   This satisfied all his constituencies: It pushed the president's
policies, informed the public, and made reporters feel like pals
and co-conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry's winking style would have infuriated the true
Clintonistas, but his loyalty inoculated him. He never abandoned
Williams during Abscam, though he was offered better jobs during
that scandal. He did not quit during Flytrap, though he had been
planning to leave for months.
</P>
<P>
   Since he resigned from the White House in October 1998,
reporters and politicos have been waiting for the other shoe to
drop. Dick Morris, George Stephanopoulos and David Gergen dished
lavishly once they quit the Clinton fold. But McCurry has kept his
mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his departure he said a few impolitic things in a BBC
interview. (He admitted to ``grave doubts'' about Clinton's fitness
for office and said that Clinton was ``exasperatingly stupid in his
private life.'') That made headlines and ``spooked'' him, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has abandoned candor, cracking only the mildest
of Lewinsky jokes. He has not written a tell-all book (as press
secretaries often do), and he has shied away from opining about the
president on television or in print.
</P>
<P>
   But McCurry always coupled loyalty to his boss with loyalty to
the institution of Washington. As Clinton's mouthpiece, McCurry was
partisan and sarcastic, manipulated reporters into softening
stories, and bullied those who crossed him. He berated reporters
self-righteously. (Once he claimed that the Clinton White House had
higher standards of accuracy than the press did, which got a good
laugh.)
</P>
<P>
   Even so, McCurry remained hugely popular among his press corps
because he was one of them. Pols come and go, but press secretaries
and reporters are forever. On the day of his first White House
briefing, McCurry says, he was nervous until he looked out at the
assembled press, and ``I realized that I knew three-quarters of
them, and I had known them for years.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry helped reporters do their job, and they adored him for
it. He explained complicated policies, spoke calmly during crises,
and dug for inside information -- a notable contrast to the
ignorant Dee Dee Myers or the secretive Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
   All press secretaries mislead reporters, but McCurry did it less
than most. He never forgot that politics was -- if not a game -- at
least a pleasure. He began one briefing with a paper bag over his
head, playing an anonymous source. He dived into a pool fully
clothed to win a bet. He told jokes on the sly at the president's
expense.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry's loyalty has never interfered with his self-interest.
During Flytrap, he did not ask the president about Monica. He did
not want to know, because he did not want to lie about it. He saw
the scandal as the lawyers' responsibility and ``did not want to
dig the hole deeper,'' he says. His briefings were grotesque -- he
would brush off dozens of questions while attacking the president's
accusers.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not cost him. He guarded the president and preserved
his own virginity. The press was peeved that he stonewalled them,
but they assumed that his silences meant he knew Clinton was lying.
(The wink triumphs again.) He gained a (not undeserved) reputation
as the only honest man in a White House of liars. It was a magical
bit of image polishing. McCurry, one of Clinton's chief enablers,
turned himself into Clinton's victim.
</P>
<P>
   There is a cost to being McCurry. The blessing of ironic
detachment is that it separates you from the fervent believers who
populate politics. McCurry has never been, and never wants to be,
one of the inner-circle obsessives who will do anything --
including lie, cheat, and steal -- to help their boss. He is too
normal and decent for that.
</P>
<P>
   But it also kept McCurry out of the center of power. He was, as
he says, ``the hired help'' -- never the boss. McCurry has spent 20
years measuring his words and speaking those words for someone
else. That's a lot of sublimation.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Internet politics may be a safe haven for him. Most
folks at politics dot-coms are gaga about the Web's populist
possibilities: How can we make citizens' voices heard?
</P>
<P>
   That's not McCurry's interest. He sees it from the other
direction: How can we make government heard -- and understood --
Washington is a maze of data and reports and laws, all of them
inaccessible and incomprehensible to citizens.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry hopes to use the Web to deliver them to Americans in
comprehensible, useful packages -- information without spin. The
measure of McCurry will be whether, after 20 years of spinning, he
can still tell the difference.

MOSCOW'S HANDPICKED CHECHEN LEADER TREADS A FINE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Malik Saidullayev's plush office in central Moscow is a
world away from the bombed-out wasteland that his native Chechnya
has become.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of his family and paintings of horses adorn the
walls, along with Russian and Chechen flags. Dressed in a dark blue
suit, Saidullayev, 35, settled onto a soft leather sofa last week
as he sipped a cup of tea and explained why he was about to leave
his luxurious surroundings for his war-torn homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow-based millionaire businessman turned self-styled
peacemaker is the latest in a long line of Chechens the Kremlin has
turned to in its attempts to rein in the separatist region. It does
not deter him that he has no clout with the rebels, and that even
his sponsors in Moscow have their doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Saidullayev, who had never expressed public interest in his
homeland until the Russians called on him, flew to the capital,
Grozny, to try to jump-start peace talks _ talks that the rebels
scorn and that the Kremlin has not officially sanctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Known in Moscow as a ``pro-Russia Chechen,'' Saidullayev has
amassed a small empire that includes a popular lottery business,
restaurants, and car dealerships. In October, the Kremlin plucked
him out of obscurity to head its handpicked government-in-exile for
the breakaway republic. Since then, he has been trying to start
peace talks between Moscow and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Chechnya's independence or non-independence is not the
main issue. I have one goal, and that is to end the war,''
Saidullayev said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are tired of war and brutality, and most of the
rebel commanders are tired of fighting,'' he added. ``Chechnya is a
small nation. We can't continue fighting forever. The republic
needs to develop so people can live normally.''
</P>
<P>
   Saidullayev has toured Chechnya and has promised to provide
money to repair destroyed schools and hospitals. He has also
delivered food and supplies to the swelling ranks of refugees
fleeing the four-month-old war.
</P>
<P>
   As a pro-Russia Chechen, Saidullayev has had to walk a fine line
to wield any influence in the separatist republic, as
independence-minded Chechens viewed him with suspicion. And in his
efforts to win the Chechens over, he managed to alienate the
Russians when he publicly accused Russian troops of atrocities
against civilians and of corruption in their administration of
refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Saidullayev announced that he was holding peace
talks in Moscow with a group of rebel commanders who had traveled
there. The Kremlin acknowledged that they had arrived, but little
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nobody among the rebel commanders who can negotiate
with the federal government,'' the Kremlin's official spokesman on
Chechya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, told reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen leaders have been equally dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not support it at all,'' said Ilyas Akhmadov, who acts
as Chechnya's foreign minister, during a visit to Boston. ``One
needs to know, in a Chechen environment, just who Malik Saidullayev
really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Akhmadov said he suspected that the Kremlin had blackmailed
Saidullayev, telling him to ``either close your business or head
the Chechen government-in-exile.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharip Yusupov, a Moscow-based spokesman for the Chechen rebels,
called Saidullayev ``the hand of Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Saidullayev brushed off such accusations, saying his only agenda
is to help Chechnya's civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pro-Russian,'' he said. ``I don't reject this label. But
I am only pro-Russian to the extent that I think it can help my
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts in Moscow say the Kremlin had hoped to use
Saidullayev for their own purposes, but he has proved to be too
uncontrollable. In December, he angered officials in Moscow when he
helped expose a massacre of at least 41 civilians in his hometown,
Alkhan-Yurt, a village about 10 miles from Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Since, the Kremlin has seemed to distance itself from
Saidullayev, and has turned its attention to another pro-Moscow
Chechen, Bislan Gantamirov, a former mayor of Grozny who was loyal
to Russia in the 1994-96 war.
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov, who had been serving a prison sentence for
embezzlement, was pardoned last month by then-president Boris
Yeltsin and has begun forming pro-Russian militias in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saidullayev is clearly trying to play both sides,'' said Tom
de Waal, a London-based specialist on the region who co-authored a
book on the 1994-96 war. ``In exposing the Alkhan-Yurt massacre he
was trying to set himself up as a credible force inside Chechnya.
Whether or not this is realistic is another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest the Kremlin may be using Saidullayev to feel out
the rebels' desire to negotiate an end to the war, while publicly
distancing themselves from his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Iskandarian, a Moscow-based specialist on the Caucasus
region, said the military situation in Chechnya is ``very bad for
Russia,'' and acting President Vladimir V. Putin ``needs to find a
way out'' of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can lie on television as much as they please, saying they
took this or that territory and show Russian flags being raised on
buildings, but sooner or later there needs to be some results,''
Iskandarian said. ``At the same time, Putin cannot appear to be
backing down or negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   But Saidullayev, he noted, has virtually no power base in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has long struggled to find a Chechen leader who would be
accepted by the republic's population but still be loyal to the
Kremlin. During the 1994-96 war, authorities in Moscow supported a
series of anti-independence Chechens before they finally settled on
Doku Zavgayev, the republic's Soviet-era ruler. Zavgayev, however,
wielded no real power and was ridiculed for rarely leaving Grozny's
heavily fortified airport. He fled Chechnya after Russian troops
withdrew in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The government that Saidullayev nominally heads is centered in
the so-called Chechen State Council, a pro-Moscow parliament
elected in June 1996. At the time, Russian forces controlled about
half the republic, including Grozny, and the vote was held in the
occupied territory only.
</P>
<P>
   Both Zavgayev's administration and the legislature were
disbanded when Russian troops withdrew in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The breakaway region held its own presidential elections in
January 1997, which were monitored by international observers.
Aslan Maskhadov won the vote in a landslide. In May of that year,
Yeltsin signed a peace treaty with Maskhadov, saying the deal
``puts a stop to 400 years'' of conflict between Moscow and
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But since Russian troops entered the republic in September, the
Kremlin has refused to negotiate with Maskhadov, saying he is
illegitimate and does not control the situation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Putin revived the State Council in October, calling it the
``only legitimate authority'' in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Saidullayev is about to find out whether he meant it.

&HT;     NO LONGER A BOONDOCKS, CALIFORNIA'S `INLAND EMPIRE' IS A HAVEN
FOR MODERATES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY

<P>
   RIVERSIDE, Calif. _ The political and economic fissure that runs
through California begins just south of here, where the Toyota
Camrys and Hyundais slip through the Marsscape rocks on Highway 91,
and into the shiny office parks in Orange County for a day's work
and back again.
</P>
<P>
   The 300,000 workers who make this daily commute return with a
paycheck and a traffic migraine. Riverside and San Bernardino
counties are the ubiquitous rent-to-own bedroom communities to the
richer stucco-and-tile cities on the coast, where the jobs pay
better and the politics are less textured.
</P>
<P>
   For politicians aiming at a statewide election victory, the easy
lure are the 20 western counties of California _ wealthier, easier
to define. But the second California _ the 38 eastern counties that
can make or break the 2000 presidential race _ is harder to
encapsulate.
</P>
<P>
   Riverside is at the heart of this new landscape for inland
California.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a low-wage, blue-collar microstate, a backstage engine
supplying products and manufacturing support for the high-profile
dot-coms and techies in coastal cities. In Riverside and San
Bernardino counties, sprawling warehouse businesses are filling
with workers who have grown increasingly tired of the two- to
three-hour commutes to Los Angeles and Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Riverside and San Bernardino counties _ dubbed the Inland Empire
_ recently have become the new voter-mining operation for
politicians who really know California. Mostly conservative voters
here are crucial to candidates because they are so independent.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, showed he understood the state's
changing political landscape in his successful 1998 gubernatorial
bid, a lesson he hopes to hand to Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic presidential favorite. But analysts say few presidential
candidates have begun to recognize the importance of Californian's
growing inland area.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco and Los Angeles _ liberal and overwhelmingly
Democratic _ are predictable. Riverside, one of the fastest growing
counties in the country, is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always voted Democratic, every single time,'' said John
Hall Jr., 49, who moved to Moreno Valley in 1993 from Santa Monica,
about the time housing prices started pushing more people inland.
``But I think it's time for a change. I've even discussed it with
my parents, and my father thinks I should vote Democratic because
the unions brought us through the Depression. But then again, he
was born in 1920.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall sat outside the Mission Inn, Riverside's famed
Spanish-baroque hotel and central meeting place, where Ronald and
Nancy Reagan spent their honeymoon. A financial adviser, Hall said
he wanted to support a party that would further change the
country's welfare system, which he finds too liberal, too
permissive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really kind of tired of the two parties,'' he said. ``I'm
really looking for someone to shake it up. I respect Al Gore a lot
for distancing himself from (President) Clinton. That impressed me.
But I have been thinking about registering Republican. I have
seriously been considering (George W.) Bush. I've been looking at
him.'
</P>
<P>
   Riverside County elected state Sen. Ray Haynes, a conservative
who once declared, ``I don't want a homosexual representing me in
Congress.'' The former Republican Assembly leader, Rod Pacheco,
also is from Riverside. The county went for Democrat Bill Clinton
for president in 1992 and Bob Dole, the Republican, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Brown, a Democrat, won a record 18th term in 1996 _
and the seat stayed Democratic in November when state Sen. Joe Baca
was elected to fill the rest of the term for Brown, who died last.
And the county voted for Davis over conservative Republican Dan
Lungren in the 1998 gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Party loyalty just isn't what it used to be,'' said David
Lara-Telles, chairman of the Riverside County Democratic Party and
a resident of Moreno Valley, one of the fastest-growing areas in
the Inland Empire. ``People here are much more willing to jump
between Democrat and Republican, even on the same ballot.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Riverside's development the past two decades is a familiar
story. Families looking for cheaper housing fled Los Angeles and
Orange County in the 1980s. When the recession hit in the early
1990s, the cash-poor families found their homes worth less than
they paid, and their commute sometimes stretching two or three
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Now, these former commuters are beginning to stay home, making
tires and tortilla chips, furniture and fixtures. The Inland Empire
is the only place in the state that added jobs every year in the
1990s, even during the tough recession early in the decade. Since
1990, Riverside has gained 200,000 jobs, compared with 165,000 in
Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians still think this is an area with 300,000 to
400,000 people in the boondocks with cows,'' said John Husing, a
principal with Economics &AMP; Politics Inc., a consulting firm.
``There are in fact 3.1 million people and $60 billion in personal
income in the area. Eighteen states are smaller than we are. ...
Politically, what you see is a fundamental misunderstanding in
leadership circles about the growth paradigm in this state. Simply,
they haven't gotten a clue about what's going on in places like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   A decidedly middle-class Riverside County has a household income
of about $40,200 a year compared with $53,600 in Orange County,
based on joint tax returns compiled by the state Department of
Finance. Riverside ranks 28th of 58 counties in income. Orange
County ranks seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Once dominated by Roosevelt Democrats, Riverside County has
become one of the top five Republican strongholds in the state
based on party registration _ with 47 percent registered in the GOP
and 37 percent Democratic. The 1999 Empire Annual Survey found that
31 percent of voters considered themselves ``middle of the road,''
with 17 percent ``somewhat liberal'' and 22 percent ``somewhat
conservative.'' The survey is produced by Max Neiman, a professor
at the University of California at Riverside who specializes in
Inland Empire demographics, and his associates.
</P>
<P>
   The Inland Empire residents tend in general to vote for
``Republicrats,' moderate politicians who can merge the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more of a Republican than I am a Democrat,'' said
Riverside County Supervisor Tom Mullen, a registered Democrat,
echoing a fairly consistent theme. ``I've wanted to switch several
times, and then someone on the right will open their mouth, and I
don't. But at the same time, I'm not a socialist. I'm as conflicted
as the voters are.''
</P>
<P>
   Neiman's survey found these same contradictions. Although party
registration in Riverside County is mostly Republican, voters were
less likely to identify with the Republican Party when surveyed.
When asked to ``best describe`` their party affiliation, 40 percent
said Democratic, and only 37 percent said Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Voters here are also far more interested in quality-of-life
issues _ like traffic and schools _ than they are about the
emotional, divisive issues such as abortion and the death penalty,
for example. Few presidential candidates have caught on to this
theme _ most can't break free of the old talking points.
</P>
<P>
   No political team knows the Inland Empire's shifting nature
better than Davis and his senior adviser, Garry South. More than
two years ago, when Davis was being written out of the political
calculus in California, South was pulling reporters aside over
coffee, trying to convince them Davis could win. He divided the
state straight down the middle, and the numbers didn't lie _
moderate voters in Riverside and the inland areas loved
straight-down-the-middle Davis in election after election.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after Davis' landslide victory in the 1998 election, South
is sharing his knowledge with Gore as he tries to capture the
state. Davis tailored his message for different parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the inland areas are so conservative, my view is you
have to approach them much differently,'' South said. ``You have to
establish your bona fides in inland California as someone who is
fiscally responsible, who is good on public safety issues, who is
not some left-wing coastal nut, before they will listen to anything
else you have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have the benefit of the doubt in the inland areas,
South said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drag on Gore is going to be his record on the
environment,'' South said, ``particularly his book. We worked with
them pretty intensively on what our playbook was, and how to
replicate it. ... I think you'll see their inland campaign is the
same as ours was, because frankly the factors are the same.''

NEBRASKANS NOT PAYING MUCH ATTENTION TO CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ Never mind New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The people who live and vote in Omaha were indifferent to the
Iowa caucuses, and that state is only a river away. As far as they
are concerned, Tuesday's presidential primary might as well be
taking place in another country.
</P>
<P>
   It's too much campaigning too soon, they said. November is too
far away. The economy is too strong to worry now. Regardless who
wins, the candidates cannot be trusted anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their reasons, and everyone apologized before offering
them, one Omahan after another expressed little interest, if not
downright disgust, with presidential politics this election season.
Not yet turned on or already turned off, they said they regarded
the Iowa caucuses as a circus, the New Hampshire primaries as a
nominating process gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   As Richard Shugrue, a law professor at Creighton University, put
it, ``I'm a political junkie, but I'm very unusual. I like this
stuff. On the other hand, I work with highly educated people and,
frankly, they don't give a damn, to quote Rhett Butler.''
</P>
<P>
   That puts these Midwesterners, often stereoptyped for their
good-naturedness, in the middle of America in more ways than one.
Polls show that the vast majority of Americans are not paying close
attention to the campaign, or any attention at all.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest nationwide survey by the Vanishing Voter Project
at Harvard University's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press,
Politics and Public Policy, for instance, 76 percent of the
respondents indicated they are not following the campaign. A mere 6
percent said they are following it closely. Even at the much-touted
Iowa caucuses last week, only 11 percent of the eligible voters
turned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The subject comes up in class, it's in the news, but it's just
not part of my life,'' said Nathan Von Ahsen, a 19-year-old health
administration and policy major who will be eligible to vote in his
first presidential election come November. ``I've got enough to
worry about with my mid-terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, scores of interviews in the largest city in the state
that established Arbor Day and feeds the country with its corn and
cattle, revealed residents who can no longer relate to the grinding
road to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling around Omaha's spotless Old Market, lined with ethnic
restaurants, antique shops and art galleries, few shoppers could
name each of the seven remaining presidential hopefuls. At a
bookstore in a well-to-do neighborhood, many of the customers who
had stopped in for coffee wondered aloud what Washington had to do
with their own lives as college students or computer technicians.
At a discount retailer, bargain hunters sounded tired of the entire
process, saying it is out of their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be deeply engaged in politics, but I just don't
believe the candidates anymore,'' said Delores Smith, 38, an
undecided voter who works in daycare. ``They never stick to what
they say, so why should I give them my time and attention?''
</P>
<P>
   Added Paula Elgert, a 27-year-old special education teacher
whose firstborn is due in April, ``It's like'' the news media are
``inundating us with information. Whenever an issue comes up, they
just overdo it. I am paying a little attention, but it's too early
to do any more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Early, of course, is relative in Nebraska, whose own primry is
not until May and where the presidential contenders are not
expected anytime soon. By then, the nominations will very likely to
wrapped up, a reality that has only further alienated Omahans. The
693,900 or so people who live in the metropolitan area, 89.1
percent of them white, feel ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national emphasis is on Iowa, New Hampshire, South
Carolina; nobody talks about Nebraska,'' said City Councilman Cliff
Herd. ``It's over by the time they get around to us. For us, that
makes tuning in difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But political observers and participants, as well as potential
voters, also agreed that Omaha's apathy is a result of more than
location. People have been moving away from political involvement
for at least a decade, with voter turnout as certain to decline
every four years as candidates are likely to tromp through the snow
in New Hampshire. In 2000, however, other factors have compounded
the ennui, both in Nebraska and across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, despite the media's emphasis on a heated race, the
Iowa caucuses appeared to many to be a foregone conclusion, with
Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush triumphing
as expected. Many Omahans said they did not anticipate any
surprises in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made it less fun,'' said Terry Begley, 37, a computer
technology coordinator in Omaha who considers himself politically
active.
</P>
<P>
   Neither staunchly Democratic nor staunchly Republican, Omahans
also said they were dismayed by the raw partisanship of Washington,
regardless of issue. The hearings to impeach President Clinton, and
the salacious headlines that preceded them, were even more
upsetting to residents who consider themselves upright citizens. As
a result, they are now afraid to listen, said James B. Johnson,
director of the political science department at the University of
Nebraska in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last year has been so upsetting and distracting that
people are not paying attention for fear of finding out what they
don't want to know,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   That, in part, would explain why Colin Caspers, a 27-year-old
former Marine from tiny-town South Dakota who is now majoring in
aviation at Creighton, described himself as detached from the
presidential election. Caspers, like many Omahans, said big money
has co-opted the political process, rendering his vote all but
inconsequential. Why pay attention to what he can't influence, he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American family is shut out,'' Caspers said. ``Who
can afford a $1,000-a-plate dinner to get their vote heard. . . .
Politics is something out of our grasp. It's for people who make
$80,000 or more, not the litle guy, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ongoing economic prosperity, with more
millionaires than ever and three billionaires in Omaha alone,
according to Forbes magazine, has convinced many voters that the
upcoming election is unimportant. Instead, the emphasis appears to
have shifted from making a difference to making more money while
they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much pressure to success, to have money, that
people don't have time to focus on the primaries,'' said Shelly
Shwidelson, a 51-year-old homemaker who has worked on local
campaigns. ``Especially with younger people, they're feeling the
pressure from TV, from their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every Omahan, of course, is ignoring the presidential
primaries. In fact, the people who are paying attention sounded
even more dismayed over voter indifference than the indifferent
voters sounded about the electoral process. No matter how well they
are doing financially, no matter how hard it is at times to tell
the candidates apart, they emphasized the importance of their
individual involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is so good that people don't realize that what
goes up goes down,'' said Debra Riveland, 44, who worked in sales
and marketing but is currently unemployed. ``A lot of people think,
`Everything's OK with me so I'm not going to bother, I'm not
interested.' Well, I'm interested in the whole picture.''

BEING BILL BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
With the New Hampshire primary two days away, Globe Focus writer
Scot Lehigh offers some advice to Democrat Bill Bradley on how to
keep it a contest worth watching. 
 
To: Bill Bradley 
From: An observer 
Re: Values of this game 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let me be blunt, Senator. Your heart problem has been killing
your campaign. No, no, not the atrial fibrillation. Specialists say
that ailment shouldn't prevent you from being president. What I'm
talking about here is political heart: your willingness to let
yourself be beaten by Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Your more aggressive performance in Wednesday's debate and your
tougher talk in the last few days have helped some. That new
feistiness seems to have halted your slide in New Hampshire. Still,
if you're to survive there Tuesday and soldier on to the
all-important March 7 primaries, you've got to do better yet.
You're supposed to be a tough, smart competitor, the Rhodes Scholar
who made it in the National Basketball Association, but so far
you've comported yourself with a priggish political naivete.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why your chances are slipping like a bald tire on black
ice. Iowa has started Gore on the path to the nomination, and if he
beats you again this week, you're in deep kimchi, as John McCain
likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about it, fulsome gentility aside, Al Gore is a
political Mack the Knife, and he's out to win.
</P>
<P>
   Here's your problem, Bill. As a former basketball player, you're
waiting for the referee to foul him out. Forget it. It's not going
to happen. The reason is simple: The health insurance issue that
Gore has used to eviscerate you is so complicated most reporters
don't understand it, so they can't referee.
</P>
<P>
   That means you're on your own. And, frankly, unsavory as it is,
maybe that's the way it should be. Presidential politics is a
Darwinian struggle, a test of toughness.
</P>
<P>
   One top-level Democratic strategist believes you have ``lost
sight of the difference between vigorously defending ideas and
negative campaigning.'' You may have thought you were being
high-minded by ignoring Gore's attacks, but in politics you don't
win points by playing Gandhi. Instead, you raise doubts.
</P>
<P>
   As Democratic consultant Mary Anne Marsh puts it, if you ``won't
fight back against Al Gore, how can people trust (you) to fight for
them in the White House?''
</P>
<P>
   She's right, too, Senator. Even your own team has been wondering
about that for much of this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretly, what he really wants is for people to recognize he's
the best qualified and appoint him president,'' one despairing
adviser said of you last week.
</P>
<P>
   When you came to the Globe late last year, you were asked if you
had ``a Dukakis problem,'' that is, an unwillingness to defend
yourself aggressively and effectively against an opponent's attack.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, you brushed the question off, insisting you knew
how to throw elbows. But others have wondered as well. One
well-placed source reports that when Dukakis was asked recently why
he wasn't supporting you, he replied: ``I can't. He's too much like
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, as far as counterpunching goes, you've made Dukakis
look like Evander Holyfield. For the most part, what response
you've offered has been listless, understated, and undisciplined.
As for enlisting Niki Tsongas and Bob Kerrey to make your case,
that won't do. Mrs. Tsongas is a smart, savvy woman, but few
remember, or care about, the way Bill Clinton diced up her late
husband in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Kerrey do the job for you. You've got to fight your own
battles, Senator. Fortunately for you _ and for Democratic voters
who have come to expect a spririted primary _ there's a way. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Expert testimony &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, face some basic facts: oleaginous as Gore may sometimes
seem, to date he's been a clearer, sharper, tougher, more focused
debater and campaigner. That's why he's been able to turn your own
health insurance plan against you.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you refute Gore's claims that your signature proposal
would force us back into deficits, drive the economy into
recession, undermine Medicare, and hurt those who now depend on
Medicaid?
</P>
<P>
   By pointing to authoritative third-party experts. There you
missed a big opportunity Wednesday night, for on that very morning,
the Congressional Budget Office offered you a tailor-made answer,
but you failed to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   The CBO said the non-Social Security surplus could balloon to
$1.9 trillion over the next decade. To realize that full amount,
Congress would have to adhere to strict spending discipline, to be
sure. But even assuming much more liberal spending, CBO estimates a
minimum cushion of $840 billion, and more than double that if
Congress adopts a middle ground on spending.
</P>
<P>
   Your health care program, independent specialists say, should
cost about $85 billion a year, or $850 billion over 10 years. That
means the cash is there to pay for it, which should obliterate one
of Gore's central points of attack.
</P>
<P>
   It's a point you need to drive home again and again if you want
to keep your campaign alive.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, Senator, is that when it comes to explaining
your plans, you're talking over the heads of most voters. This is a
rough-and-tumble political campaign, not a graduate seminar in
public policy. Which means you should stop with the policy wonkery
and start talking symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Your proposal has already won the policy equivalent of the Good
Housekeeping seal of approval. The nonprofit, nonpartisan Consumers
Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, analyzed both your
plan and Gore's and judged yours superior on almost all counts.
Further, the group scolded Gore for irresponsibly raising fears
that your proposal would leave Medicaid patients ``out in the
cold.''
</P>
<P>
   That happened several months ago, Senator _ and yet, for reasons
even some of your own advisers cannot fathom, you have not
mentioned it in either your TV ads or your debates with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   You should. And to nick a line from pulp novelist Jacqueline
Susann, Senator, once is not enough. You've got to repeat the
message again and again. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tell voters why it matters &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In campaign strategy sessions with aides, one way you reject
caution's centrist counsel and justify your bolder stands on guns
and race and health insurance is by saying, ``If it doesn't make a
difference, why not Gore?''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly right. And yet you have let Gore so blur the
differences that most voters _ and, yes, most reporters _ believe
there is no real difference between you on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lou DiNatale, director of the University of Massachusetts poll,
has it right. He says that by trying to not ``go negative,'' you
have failed to make your own case.
</P>
<P>
   If you are smart, you will outline the true differences with
Gore in a way that cuts through his strategic attempt to muddy the
matter and make you both seem the same.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you have to explain why your health insurance plan
would cover 23 million more of those currently uninsured than would
Gore's more incremental approach. You also need to explain why your
call for registration of all handguns does much more than Gore's
call for new buyers of handguns to register. It's worth pointing
out that the difference is licensing the 70 million handguns
already out there.
</P>
<P>
   As for attacking Gore, though the newly kindled fire your belly
is laudable, attacking him on the general issue of trust isn't
likely to work. Expedient Gore may be, but Nixon he's not.
</P>
<P>
   The better issue is electability, given the tarnish of the
Clinton-Gore scandals. From his Buddhist Temple fund-raising to his
infamous ``no controlling legal authority'' press conference to the
special-interest dollars swirling into his campaign coffers and the
insider world of lobbyists he inhabits, it's a real weakness of the
vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   But only if you exploit it. So far, you've let him off easy. You
may not want to bring it up, but the Republicans surely will in the
fall. Everyone knows that. Which is why, says one presidential
campaign veteran, you should start telling voters what Daniel
Patrick Moynihan did when he endorsed you: The problem with Gore is
that ``he can't be elected president.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, start running some offense, and put him on the
defensive for a change. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lose the 'tude &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But to do any of this, you've got to change your mindset,
Senator. To be frank, your philosopher's act has gotten a bit too
precious for many voters. Your storied ``sense of self,'' your
insistence that you are a different kind of politician, running a
different kind of campaign, has mutated into what comes across as
sanctimonious self-indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd rather be an unsullied martyr than a sinning winner,
apply for sainthood. God knows, that's a whole different kind of
election. But if you're unwilling to dirty your hands, get out of
this race, because presidential politics isn't your vocation.
</P>
<P>
   Need a role model? Look at McCain. He, too, is trying to run a
positive campaign, but when George W. Bush recycled his father's
tinny trick from 1988 by claiming McCain would raise taxes, McCain
slammed him back so hard, so fast, and so effectively that Bush was
left looking silly. And no one thinks the worse of McCain for doing
so.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, those are the values this particular game
rewards. You may not want people calling you just another
politician, Senator, but keep campaigning the way you have been,
and one thing is certain: Whatever else people end up calling you,
it won't be Mr. President.

<P>
   (Geoff Kabaservice is a lecturer in American history at Yale and
is working on a biography of Kingman Brewster Jr.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By GEOFF KABASERVICE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The papers of the late Kingman Brewster Jr., who was president
of Yale in the '60s and '70s, include a letter from one E. Alden
Dunham III, a former director of admissions at Princeton. Dunham
argued that Ivy League universities were overemphasizing the
importance of SAT scores.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dunham wrote, consider a recent Princeton graduate
named Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a guy who graduated Magna Cum Laude in history, the
greatest basketball player in the Ivy Colleges, Rhodes Scholar,
probably a governor of Missouri someday -- and all with a 485
verbal SAT!''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the thinking presidential candidate, scored a 485
verbal on his SAT? That's lower than George W. Bush, the allegedly
slow-witted presidential candidate. As reported recently in The New
Yorker, Bush got an SAT verbal score of 566.
</P>
<P>
   So what conclusions should we draw? The important conclusions
aren't about whether Bradley is really smart or Bush is really
dumb. They're about ways in which these two are actually similar.
Above all, both of them are beneficiaries of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   A 566 verbal would not have gotten you into the Yale Class of
1968, especially with mediocre prep-school grades, if you weren't
also the son and grandson, for good measure, of a Yale alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise a 485 verbal wouldn't get you into the Princeton Class
of 1965, if you weren't also a star basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bradley applied to college in the early '60s,
selective schools such as Princeton and Yale viewed themselves as
intellectual training grounds, not the clubby enclaves of previous
times. In this new era, a score below 500 on either the verbal or
math section of the SAT normally meant rejection.
</P>
<P>
   A 1960 New Yorker article described the case of an
African-American applicant to Yale who was valedictorian and
president of his high-school class and a stellar athlete to boot.
His application was rejected because his 488 SAT average ``would
certainly be the lowest in the entire Yale class.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cutoff point was more flexible for top athletes, for
alumni ``legacies,'' and, starting in the late '60s, for blacks and
other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to the following non-multiple-choice question for
Bradley and Bush: If you got into an Ivy League college for reasons
other than ``qualifications'' narrowly defined as grades and test
scores, what is so terrible about bending the same rules on behalf
of African-Americans?
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would probably have an easier time with this question
than Bush, because as a Democrat he is not required to believe that
``reverse discrimination'' is necessarily a terrible thing, and
because athletic talent can plausibly be seen as a legitimate
aspect of ``merit,'' while choosing a father who went to Yale
cannot. But both examples undercut the argument against affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   The examples of Bradley and Bush also illustrate the fallacy of
taking the SAT as a measure of intelligence or much of anything
else, let alone of qualification to be president of the United
States. This is not because Bradley scored worse than Bush, but
because both have led successful lives and are patently better
qualified for the presidency than many citizens with higher scores.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any analysis of individual SAT results must be taken
with a grain of salt. Bradley and Bush sat for the test in the days
before score-raising courses like Kaplan and Princeton Review. The
SAT has been ``recentered'' in recent years, boosting overall
scores by up to a hundred points.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, knowing he would be offered athletic scholarships at
dozens of non-Ivy schools, may not have taken the test seriously.
And in any case, Bush and Bradley actually scored quite respectably
when considered apart from the lofty standards of Ivy Leaguers.
Both were probably in the top third of all test-takers and would
have been in the top quarter (at least) if the SAT had been
administered to all high-school seniors.
</P>
<P>
   All the SAT even purports to measure is likely first-year
college grades. Indeed, the test admirably predicted the freshman
year academic difficulties of both Bradley and Bush. While Bush
remained mired in a ``Gentleman's C'' groove for the duration of
his undergraduate years, Bradley was able to pull himself out of
his first-year struggles by dint of hard effort and went on to an
honors degree and a Rhodes scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from their undergraduate careers alone, you might well
argue that the examples of Bradley and Bush illustrate a subtler
point about affirmative action than mere thumbs-up or thumbs-down.
That is, affirmative action is more likely to succeed when it takes
into account personal qualities like drive and motivation, which
may not be captured on the SAT. Affirmative action is likely to
fail when it is merely a special preference bestowed on those who
have the right parents, whether ``right'' means educational
pedigree or skin color.
</P>
<P>
   Even four decades later, Bradley's appeal as a presidential
candidate -- contrary to some of his own campaign slogans -- is not
that he was ever the epitome of effortless cerebral and athletic
superiority but that he has made the most of his talents. No test,
whether it takes the form of the SAT or a pop quiz on foreign
affairs, is conclusive proof of a person's potential. Scores alone
cannot be the sole basis for making decisions about college
admissions, hiring decisions, or presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action (even for athletes and preppies) sometimes
has a place in this land of second chances, where anyone can grow
up to be president. Bill Bradley and George W. Bush ought to know.

SKEPTICAL VOTERS QUIZ CANDIDATES ON GETTING PLANS PASSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speaking to a group of senior citizens in West Des Moines, Iowa,
Bill Bradley was explaining his push for universal health care and
sweeping campaign finance reform when one listener rose with a
simple question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire your program and hope it works out,'' the man said.
``But what do you think the chances are that if you're elected,
Congress will pass those bills?''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, publisher Steve Forbes had just finished explaining
to a group of workers the wonders of his 17 percent flat tax, when
one of them raised his hand with a similar query.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you've now been elected, all the elections are over,
there's now a Democratic Congress,'' the worker said. ``What are
the things you're going to do to implement your flat tax? How are
you going to get it through?''
</P>
<P>
   For both Bradley and Forbes, the questions were not unfamiliar.
Along the campaign trail, both men have faced frequent skepticism _
even among voters who support their goals _ that they could achieve
their goals if elected.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a Democrat, and Forbes, a Republican, have virtually
nothing in common. But they do share campaign platforms built
around proposals that are unusually ambitious and specific. And
they both face questions about whether those plans could survive a
journey through any Congress, regardless of its party makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's chief goal is a new system of federal health care
subsidies for all Americans, estimated to cost $65 billion a year.
As the former New Jersey senator notes, that would entail revamping
an industry that comprises about one-seventh of the US economy.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, meanwhile, is seeking a flat tax that would total $684
billion over five years. As Forbes likes to note, that would mean
doing battle with the 67,000 tax lobbyists he hopes to put out of
work.
</P>
<P>
   While polls show that universal health care is more popular _
and perhaps more attainable _ than a flat tax, both men say voters
are looking for bold change, not the more incremental approaches of
rivals such as Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But day after day on the campaign trail, in interviews and
through questions posed to the candidates themselves, voters have
expressed reservations about whether these policy dreams can come
true.
</P>
<P>
   Take Nashua warehouse worker George Lavoie, 29. ``Everyone says
they're going to cut taxes, do this and that, do the flat tax.''
Lavoie said during a visit by Forbes to his workplace Tuesday.
``You've got to look at them all and decide which one is
realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   To Lavoie, Forbes' 17 percent flat tax plan is not. ``It's hard
for me to really believe,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Voters like Lavoie may be reacting to recent history in
Washington, where neither party has achieved many sweeping
legislative goals in recent years. Republicans have pushed
multi-billion-dollar tax cuts since winning control of Congress in
1994, but have had to settle for piecemeal reductions. Bill Clinton
campaigned on a huge middle-class tax cut in 1992, but abandoned it
soon after taking office and learning of bigger-than-expected
budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Most memorably, Clinton's 1993 effort to pass universal health
insurance was pummeled by both Democrats and Republicans as well as
a huge lobbying effort by the health care industry. (Clinton's
humbling experience, at the hands of a Democratic Congress, also
showed that the makeup of the House and Senate is no sure predictor
of legislative success.)
</P>
<P>
   The memory of Clinton's battle seemed to trouble a voter who
spoke to Bradley in Ottumwa, Iowa, recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a very good health care plan,'' the man told Bradley.
``But I'm worried that once it hits Congress, the special interests
are going to nitpick it apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Forbes, as it turns out, also share a similar
response to such concerns. Both men argue that they have presented
detailed proposals, leaving no uncertainty among voters about what
they intend to do. Each man says that, if elected, he would assume
a mandate from the public that opponents would defy at their own
political peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `How can you get it done?' '' Forbes said in
Nashua last week. ``First, we get a mandate from the people. Then
they can't say people didn't know what they were voting for . . .
I've laid it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Using strikingly similar rhetoric, Bradley also says his
election would make his health plan difficult to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are leading on a big issue, you have to have the
credibility to lay something out there that is specific enough to
say, `This is the direction we're going,' '' Bradley said in Iowa
recently. ``If I win by a sizable margin, I believe I have a
mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   While some voters may remain unconvinced, Forbes insists that
the electorate can still force major change in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan said the best educator on Capitol Hill is not
sweet reason,'' Forbes tells his audiences. ``The best educator is
the heat from an aroused and informed public.''

&HT;     NEW YORK LOOKS TO JOIN OTHER STATES IN LIMITING TELEMARKETERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JAY JOCHNOWITZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y., _ Should privacy come at a price for consumers who
don't want to be bothered by telemarketers? That's a question
officials are expected to debate as New York looks to join a
growing number of states with ``do not call'' registries _ special
lists to protect people from unwanted phone sales pitches
throughout their days and nights.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, seven states have such lists. Most companies
that do telemarketing in those states _ regardless of where their
headquarters are _ must obtain the no-call lists and avoid
contacting people on them. Groups like charities or political
opinion pollsters are usually exempted.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties can be stiff, ranging from $2,000 in Georgia to
$25,000 in Oregon for each call.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Eliot Spitzer wants such a system in New York,
too. So does Assemblyman Jeffrey Klein, D-Bronx. Their ideas have
one fundamental difference: Spitzer suggests the service should be
free for consumers; Klein's bill proposes a $5 annual fee.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's plan follows the lead of most states. Shelly Andrews,
Klein's counsel, said the fee is matter of political practicality:
``It's easier to pass through the state legislature if it's not
going to cost the state anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Georgia, on whose system the bill was based,
reported few complaints about the charge, she noted. Georgia
residents pay $10 to register and $5 a year to renew.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bennett, vice president of Computer Business Services, a
Georgia company that compiles no-call lists for several states,
said people seem to consider the fees a bargain to avoid ``the
dinnertime nuisance.'' Some were so eager they paid 10 years in
advance. And most of the roughly 20 other states studying the idea
are considering consumer fees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hottest piece of legislation in the country today,''
said Bennett. ``More citizens are demanding some kind of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The fees haven't stopped 3,000 people from signing up for
Alabama's program even before it begins July 1, said Thomas
Whatley, chief of staff and general counsel of the state's Public
Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees. Tennessee and Kentucky don't have a
consumer fee; instead, they charge telemarketers much higher fees
than other states _ $400 to $500 a year compared with $10 to $120
in other areas. Spitzer's proposal would allow the Public Service
Commission to charge companies, but not consumers on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Givens, director of the nonprofit Privacy Rights
Clearinghouse, said it is not fair for government to make people
pay extra to protect their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't have to pay for that,'' she said. ``You're the
one who's being annoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Without such a list in place, the only significant legal
protection consumers have now is a federal law requiring
telemarketers to maintain their own do-not-call lists. But
individuals must ask every firm that calls and keep track. And,
Bennett noted, there are more than 30,000 telemarketing firms
making 18 million calls a day.
</P>
<P>
   A less official option is to register with the Direct Marketing
Association, a trade group. Under the association's rules, members
must respect its do-not-call list, which totals about 3 million
names and is free to join, according to spokesman Stephen
Altobelli.
</P>
<P>
   DMA's membership, however, is small compared with the industry _
about 4,600 members, which include not only telemarketers but
catalog, Internet and direct mail companies, Altobelli said.

   Passages - cruising to the Hubbard glacier in Alaska
</P>
<P>
   By Eric Noland, Travel Editor
</P>
<P>
   YAKUTAT BAY, Alaska -- Hubbard Glacier was deep in the throes of
geologic reconfiguration, and it was putting on quite a show.
</P>
<P>
   The glacier looked like a wedding cake that had been left out on
the patio overnight: cracked, crumbling, tinted blue, streaked with
gray. On this particular September morning, it was calving --
shedding great chunks of ice in spectacular, thunderous slides.
</P>
<P>
   Picture the sand-castle bluffs above Malibu, but fashioned
entirely in porous granules of ice (and about as stable). Every few
minutes, there would be an ominous cracking sound, like a tall pine
chopped nearly through, then a loud report as a portion of the icy
wall gave way and tumbled into the gray-green water below. The bay
was littered with ice fragments, some as big as Toyotas.
</P>
<P>
   And this incredible spectacle of natural forces went on and on
and on. The glacier, 92 miles long and more than six miles across,
is the largest in North America and is one of Alaska's most active.
</P>
<P>
   It is the featured attraction of Holland America's Glacier
Discovery Cruise, a seven-night excursion from Vancouver, British
Columbia, to Seward, Alaska, that is offered several times between
May and September. On this day, many passengers huddled on deck to
observe the show, bundled against the 40-degree chill, biting wind
and steady, miserable rain.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone. To get out of the weather for a moment, I
ducked through the first door I found, and wound up in the gym.
There, a 30ish woman was hurrying to nowhere on a treadmill. Though
the room featured a sweep of windows, her machine was turned away
from them, and she was gazing catatonically at CNN on an overhead
TV.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that a realization struck -- or was at least
confirmed: The 1,250 or so passengers who book Inside Passage
cruises do so for radically varied purposes.
</P>
<P>
   When we left Vancouver on a glistening Sunday afternoon, for
example, the skyline was glorious as we steamed under the Lion's
Gate Bridge, but I spotted one gentleman who had already
commandeered a stool at the Dolphin Bar, his back to the scene.
Walking by a stateroom whose door was open, I saw a woman watching
a tape of an Ed Asner TV show. And in the gym, yes, that same woman
was working out on that same treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise ships, even those navigating the unsettled, unspoiled
splendor of coastal British Columbia and Alaska, have learned to be
many things to many people. This one, the MS Ryndam, offered a
casino, a spa, a movie theater, two pools (including one with a
retractable sunroof), nightly showroom entertainment that ranged
from a magician to stand-up comics to a piano-playing devotee of
Liberace to a Barry Manilow musical, no fewer than six bars and, of
course, the opportunity to eat virtually non-stop -- a
cruise-industry requisite, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Activities? Consider just this one hour stretch (2:30 to 3:30
p.m.) on our first full day out: art auction, perfume seminar,
European skin care (win a facial!), dance class, Vietnam symposium,
cruise crafts with cruise staff, matwork demonstration, jewelry
seminar, afternoon tea, Snowball Cash Bingo with Jazzy Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   Those intrigued by the discovery aspect could find much more,
though. For many of us, this meant glaciers and fjords, the rugged
islands of Canada's West Coast, visits to frontier towns that cling
to ledges where forest meets sea, native culture, wildlife and
starry nights.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the lavish behemoth that is the cruise ship seems
dreadfully out of place for these wild environs, but this is
actually one of the best ways to see and experience this region.
</P>
<P>
   There is no coastal highway through here. In fact, many of the
towns along the Inside Passage are little more than isolated
outposts, reached only by helicopter, airplane ... or boat. Even
Alaska's capital, Juneau, has no roads in, no roads out.
</P>
<P>
   Holland America offers other seven-night itineraries along this
coast, including northbound and southbound cruises, plus a loop
trip that begins and ends in Vancouver. Many visit Glacier Bay.
</P>
<P>
   One noteworthy aspect of my cruise was the line's accommodation
of passengers with special physical needs. This trip -- late
summer, after kids had returned to school -- was particularly
popular with the elderly, some of whom required wheelchairs, canes
or walkers. One of the passengers was a blind woman with a guide
dog. Elevators, broad walkways and hand rails enabled them to get
around readily.
</P>
<P>
   Many didn't want to brave slippery decks and icy winds on deck,
but that didn't mean they missed anything.
</P>
<P>
   On the visit to Hubbard Glacier, many of the older passengers
gathered behind the picture windows of the Lido Deck, in
climate-controlled comfort. Capt. Fred Eversen turned the ship
parallel to the glacier and used the ship's side thrusters to
slowly creep toward it. Then he backed off, turned the ship around
and glided toward the glacier from the other side, so that those
seated on the opposite side of the ship wouldn't have to move.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the visit, and at other significant sites, on-board
naturalist Carol Zada provided a running commentary over the ship's
loudspeaker system. Along a stretch of coastline popular with bald
eagles, she alerted us to look for spots of white (the heads)
against the green of the pines, and indeed many eagles were visible
even without the aid of binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   At most of the port calls -- the Alaska towns of Ketchikan,
Juneau, Sitka and Valdez -- passengers found numerous opportunities
for shore excursions, some of which can be booked in advance
through the cruise line. As soon as the ship docked, people would
hurry off to board a float plane or helicopter for a closer view of
fjords or a glacier, board a bus to see native totems or climb onto
a boat for a wildlife tour.
</P>
<P>
   One of the latter excursions plied the waters of Sitka Sound,
and yielded up-close sightings of sea otters, humpback whales, bald
eagles in flight, harbor seals and sea lions.
</P>
<P>
   For those who didn't want to be herded onto tours, the ports
were also fun for simple on-foot exploration. This was particularly
true in Ketchikan, which features a native-run salmon fishery, an
excellent little museum and the town's former red-light district
now a collection of tourist shops and eateries which still teeters
on stilts above a roaring creek in delightfully ramshackle fashion.
</P>
<P>
   During stops along the shore, it was intriguing to note the
number of passengers who scurried back aboard ship at lunch time
rather than sample a restaurant or open-air fish fry in town. Some
of this could probably be attributed to simple economics -- people
had already paid for the food being served on board.
</P>
<P>
   But another factor might be the comfortable, insular environment
the ship represented. Cabin and dining room stewards seemed to
learn names readily. And the food was plentiful and targeted to a
wide variety of tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly at dinner, most cruise lines like to believe they
are offering four-star cuisine. Don't believe it. The fare is good,
but certainly not exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   Logistics probably have a lot to do with that. Dinner is served
in two seatings, with the entire room getting each course at about
the same time. That means, for example, the kitchen must prepare
and deliver some 600 entrees simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   These are hotel-banquet conditions, and soon it seemed advisable
to steer away from beef and pork (which are best served right off
the grill) and stick with the fresh-fish items, which were
consistently good.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a discussion with food and beverage manager Brian McNeill
revealed why: Because salmon and halibut are so abundant in these
waters, the line buys locally caught fish along the way to
supplement the stores put on in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best dining of this trip occurred in one of the most
casual settings. At lunchtime one day, the cooks set up charcoal
grills poolside and wheeled out beautiful trays of fresh,
bright-red salmon filets. The grilled fish that was served a short
while later was divine.
</P>
<P>
   The ship became a comfortable retreat for other reasons, too, in
that it was easy to get acquainted with other passengers and even
crew.
</P>
<P>
   Seating at dinner is assigned, usually in tables of eight or so,
and the setting invites conversation. On one of the two formal
evenings (don't worry, a sport coat and tie is acceptable), the
dynamic was altered slightly by the presence of one of the ship's
officers, second engineer Gerry MacMillan of Glasgow, Scotland.
Afterward, he and I repaired to the Crow's Nest Bar directly above
the bridge, where he regaled me with tales of home while
introducing me to Macallan single-malt Scotch.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin, dining room and bar stewards also seemed to warm to
the passengers readily. One evening, some of them urged our table
group to attend their show. The event turned out to be one of the
entertainment highlights of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The ship operates with an intriguingly multinational division of
labor: Dutch and British officers; Indonesian cabin and dining-room
stewards; Filipino kitchen, front-desk and beverage staff. All but
the officers hire on for 12-month tours, after which they return
home for a minimum two-month hiatus before rejoining the ship.
</P>
<P>
   As you might imagine, homesickness can run high. One way it's
mitigated is through variety shows presented for passengers. On our
cruise, the curtain wasn't lifted on the Filipino Crew Show until
almost 11:30 p.m. (when all the various service tasks were
completed), but it was a terrific presentation of singing, dancing,
stories of homeland legends and even stand-up comedy.
</P>
<P>
   There were more men than women crew on the ship, so some dances
-- notably the Rice Dance -- forced some of the men to perform,
hilariously, in drag. At the conclusion, it was particularly moving
when the participants, so far from home and on such extended exiles
in order to provide for their families, sang national songs and
anthems with palpable emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Their duties on the ship keep them so busy that they must
rehearse their show between 2 and 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Life on this cruise got progressively more relaxed. The Ryndam
runs on diesel-electric propulsion, chief officer Mark Verschoor
explained one evening -- five small engines run at high speed,
driving a generator that powers electric motors; the motors turn
the propellers. This reduces the noise and vibration that
accompanies conventional propulsion (one large engine turning
slowly and driving a propeller). The ship is also equipped with an
extensive stabilizing system to smooth out the bumpiness of the
ride in rough seas.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, the ride was so gentle that a tube of lip
balm, left on a night stand overnight, wouldn't have budged at all
by morning. The ride was also conducive to napping beneath a wool
blanket on a padded teakwood lounger on the broad Lower Promenade
Deck.
</P>
<P>
   On this cruise, however, this sense of serenity was abruptly
dashed one afternoon south of Juneau when the Ryndam's
automatic-steering system malfunctioned and threw the ship into a
sharp left turn. The ship, steaming along at close to top speed at
the time, listed heavily, which caused glass doors to break and
some public rooms to be swamped with water from the swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an epidemic of rattled nerves, a dozen passengers
were treated for injuries, and one women bruised ribs so badly that
she required hospitalization the next day in Juneau.
</P>
<P>
   For the passengers, the incident was a reminder that this was a
craft under power, not simply a lush resort hotel, after all. It
was easy to forget sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   The reality was reinforced a couple of nights later when we left
the shelter of the Inside Passage's maze of islands and began to
rock across miles of open, stormy waters in the Gulf of Alaska en
route to Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Queasy expressions were commonplace. Sickness bags were placed
in dispensers in public areas. And attendance at dinner that night
was about half normal. Chef Rolando Salazar said the next day that
room-service activity had been brisk through the evening, with many
requests for soup, hot tea, soft drinks, sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh air also seemed to help, even though the weather was not
particularly hospitable.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Sky Deck had become my favored late-night retreat
during this cruise. It was a welcome respite from the clamor of the
casino, the bustle of people lining up at the buffet (again?) for
the Dutch Chocolate Extravaganza, or the assault of a young woman
in go-go boots belting out Karen Carpenter songs in the Vermeer
Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   A channel on the stateroom TV continually displayed the ship's
position and route, and with the aid of something as simple as an
Auto Club map, it was easy to identify islands, waterways and towns
that threw off faint light in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Few other passengers seemed inflicted with the same curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   One evening, that uppermost deck was all but deserted. There
were only a few of us to count six lighthouses flashing at various
points to mark the perils off Prince Rupert, British Columbia; to
see a boat pull alongside the stern, illuminate all of its deck
lights and tie up briefly at this oceanbound beast in order to
collect the Canadian pilot who had guided us from Vancouver; to
gaze at the Milky Way's broad, brilliant canopy overhead; to marvel
at the North Star, holding forth up ahead like a Chevy headlight on
high beam.
</P>
<P>
   Now this felt like an Alaskan passage. This was a discovery
cruise.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   ITINERARIES: Holland America offers numerous seven-night Inside
Passage cruises. The sailings begin the first week of May and
conclude in late September. Some cruises are one-way trips (both
northbound and southbound) between Vancouver, British Columbia, and
Seward, Alaska. Others are loop trips that originate and end in
Vancouver. Costs range upward from about $1,200 per person, double
occupancy, and include meals (alcohol extra).
</P>
<P>
   PACKING LIST:
</P>
<P>
   --A necessity for every passenger is a pair of binoculars. If a
standard pair is too bulky, consider picking up compact opera
glasses. When searching for bald eagles or harbor seals, or even
when checking out a tiny settlement along the shore, you'll find
them indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   --Summer weather in Alaska can be subject to dramatic swings, so
another critical item is a sturdy, rain-resistant parka; consider
Gore-Tex, which packs well. Get one with a hood -- an umbrella
won't serve you particularly well when the wind is blowing across
the deck.
</P>
<P>
   --Maps of British Columbia and Alaska -- the Auto Club ones are
fairly detailed -- will help you keep track of your surroundings as
you proceed along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   --The ship has coin laundries, and you might want to wash a few
items on the trip, so it's advisable to bring along a plastic
container of detergent and a roll of quarters.
</P>

MORE POLITICS ON TV? NO THANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans have never been less interested in campaigns and
elections. The more they see and hear of political candidates, the
more their interest wanes. And yet some people are convinced that
Americans would be better off if only there were (ital) more
(unital) politics on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is a perennial: Make broadcasters give politicians more
face time. Browbeat them into creating new opportunities for
candidates to get on the air. After all, the argument runs, the
airwaves are public property, so TV executives have a duty to serve
the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   In The Washington Post last week, Paul Taylor _ a former Post
reporter who heads the Alliance for Better Campaigns _ complained
that of the 18 pre-New Hampshire debates the presidential
candidates have taken part in, only two were aired on a national
network, and neither was shown in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind you,'' he wrote, ``the national networks have been
willing to deploy their `A' list of anchors'' to moderate debates.
``But air time? Get serious. And so our presidential campaign has
been downsized to a niche event ... suitable for cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the time spent on the networks' p.m. news shows to
cover the presidential race is only half what it was at this point
four years ago. And at the state level, Taylor claims, political
coverage has dried up: TV stations in California's largest cities,
he writes, ``devoted less than half of 1 percent of their news
coverage to the governor's race'' in the fall of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His solution? Five minutes nightly of ``candidate discourse''
during the month leading up to an election, a proposal made by a
federal advisory panel called the Gore Commission in 1998. Taylor
says this could be voluntary, but he and many others have also
urged Washington to require free air time for candidates.
Broadcasters should ``remind themselves,'' he remarks, ``that they
are obliged, as a condition of the tens of billions of dollars
worth of licenses they receive from us for free, to serve the
public interest.'' Note the implied threat.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has plenty of company. A letter calling on TV executives
to adopt the five-minutes-a-night rule was signed by more than 90
big shots, from the president of Harvard to the president of the
AFL-CIO. ``These segments could take a variety of forms,'' the
letter suggested, ``including interviews, issue statements, or
mini-debates.'' Once again there was a hint that if broadcasters
don't yield willingly, they may be made to do so unwillingly:
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadcasters have been given licenses valued at tens of
billions of dollars, free of charge, to operate the public
airwaves. In return, you have pledged to serve the public
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   (Query: Why should the airwaves be public _ i.e., government _
property in the first place? he usual answer is: because the
spectrum of broadcast frequencies is limited. But what (ital) isn't
(unital) limited? There is only a fixed supply of land _ should all
real estate be the government's, too? We take it for granted that
land should be bought and sold on the open market, with the state's
role restricted to recording the transaction. Why shouldn't
frequencies be bought and sold in exactly the same way?)
</P>
<P>
   The notion that Americans are starving for more exposure to
politics is cockeyed. The debates didn't air on the three broadcast
networks? So what? They aired on C-SPAN, on CNN, on MSNBC, and on
Fox, not to mention local cable outlets like New England Cable News
and local broadcast stations like WHO in Iowa and WMUR in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   There is an (ital) ocean (unital) of political media out there.
Millions of Americans who like their public affairs unfiltered
watch C-SPAN, listen to C-SPAN Radio, and tune into local access
channels that cover town hall. Tens of millions of other
politics-watchers find their way to CNN, MSNBC, and Fox, or to the
endless array of Web sites that offer political news, analysis, and
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Every presidential campaign is available at the click of a
mouse; so is every member of Congress, every governor, and nearly
every challenger. From poll results to position papers, from the
latest political ads to the latest political jokes, a citizen with
an interest in politics can find it al on the Internet. True, not
everyone has gone digital, but everyone soon will. And the Internet
has not yet repealed newspapers, magazines, and political journals
of every flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Fussing over the lack of live candidate jaw-jaw on network TV is
so 1980s. Pre-cable, pre-Internet, pre-all-news channels, Taylor's
lament might have made sense. But why should we care now if
over-the-air broadcasters cut back on political coverage? Broadcast
is a steadily-shrinking slice of an ever-expanding media pie. The
reason it devotes more attention to weather and sports than to
candidate forums is simple: That's what most viewers want.
Political programming gets lousy ratings. Why should TV stations be
browbeaten into airing what its customers won't watch? Because Paul
Taylor or the Gore Commission deem it in the ``public interest?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a fallacy that TV broadcasters, because they are licensed
by the government, have an obligation to serve the public. The
government would never presume to tell newspaper editors how much
space to devote to election coverage. It has no business dictating
to TV stations either. Let Americans with a yen for politics turn
to C-SPAN or www.PoliticalInsider.com. Let those with a yen for
``Wheel of Fortune'' turn to NBC.

SHOSTAKOVICH'S WORK TRANSCENDED THE BOUNDARIES OF IDEOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
SHOSTAKOVICH 
A Life 
By Laurel E. Fay. Oxford University Press. 458 pp. Illustrated.
$35. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dmitriy Shostakovich was a quiet and private man, but his
musical genius made him an international celebrity in a troubled
time. Bruno Walter introduced the First Symphony of the 22-year-old
composer to Berlin in 1928, and the piece went around the world _
Shostakovich was the last composer whose symphonies, some of them
anyway, immediately entered the standard repertory. He became the
most famous artist of the Soviet era because his work could travel
without translation.
</P>
<P>
   Shostakovich became an emblem both inside the Soviet Union and
outside, but he never could exercise much control over what the
emblem meant to others, or how changing power structures would
manipulate it. At points in his career he was laden with official
duties and honors _ he won the Stalin Prize five times. At other
times he was dismissed from his teaching posts, denounced in public
debate as a ``formalist'' who had lost touch with the aspirations
of the people. After the sexual frankness of his opera ``Lady
Macbeth of the Mtsensk District'' offended Stalin himself in 1936,
Shostakovich had good reason to fear for his life. Yet within a few
years, in America, Shostakovich would appear in his fireman's
helmet on the cover of Time magazine after he had finished his
once-famous symphony about the siege of Leningrad.
</P>
<P>
   Shostakovich's work was excessively praised for reasons having
nothing to do with music, excessively reviled for the very same
reasons. Shostakovich lived in a difficult place during complicated
times; he had to chart a careful course. He was capable of
subversive daring throughout his long career; he set songs from
Jewish folk poetry at a time when it was dangerous for him to do
so, and built a symphony around Yevgeny Yevtushenko's poem
``Babi-Yar,'' which contains a powerful denunciation of
anti-Semitism. But he also turned out works that toed the party
line, and because he was an artist, some of his ``politically
correct'' pieces couldn't help being musically distinguished. And
then the wheels of history turned, and those works have been
treated just as dismissively as the subversive ones were before.
</P>
<P>
   The controversies swirling around Shostakovich during his
lifetime did not abate after his death. No one seems to know how
committed a communist he was; he was certainly not reluctant to
receive honors and perks. He officially joined the Communist Party
only in 1960, by which time he presumably didn't have to; one story
goes that he did so under the influence of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testimony,'' his posthumously published memoir (as told to
Solomon Volkov, and published first in English in 1979), presented
an alternate portrait of the composer; it was cut to the fashion of
a different political climate. The book has never been
satisfactorily authenticated, though a stout volume has now been
devoted to defending it. ``Testimony'' presented Shostakovich as an
inner emigre, the composer of music that did not mean what people
thought and said it did at the time, or even what Shostakovich
himself may have said it meant. The finale of the Fifth Symphony
changed from a picture of jubilation and triumph into an ironic
depiction of jubilation forced under the lash. It is a paradox that
the music of Shostakovich speaks quite directly to us, but it isn't
always easy to make out what it is saying.
</P>
<P>
   Until the appearance of Laurel E. Fay's careful new biography,
it has been almost impossible to get at a reliable set of facts
about Shostakovich _ even an accurate chronology of his works with
correct dates for important premieres and performances has proved
elusive. With laudable persistence Fay has spent years checking and
cross-checking every known ``fact'' about Shostakovich, and
correcting countless errors that have persisted even in the most
careful reference books and scholarly studies. Her text runs to 287
pages; her notes, work-list, glossary of names, and select
bibliography take up another 133.
</P>
<P>
   She tells Shostakovich's life straightforwardly, making very few
attempts to heighten the drama of any incident. Many commentators,
for example, assert that the Pravda editorial denouncing ``Lady
Macbeth of the Mtsensk District'' was written by Stalin himself, as
if this were an established fact; Fay doesn't even mention this
possibility as a rumor. Her purposefully plain, dry style admits no
coloring, which in the case of this particular subject is an
important advantage. She pursues no agenda, political or otherwise,
except to make Shostakovich's artistic accomplishments her first
priority. She is interested only in what he did and in where and
when he did it, and in anything else that can be definitely
established about his life.
</P>
<P>
   There are all kinds of significant details here that are
otherwise hard to come by. Shostakovich was a skillful pianist, for
example, and wrote some great music for his own instrument. Fay
sheds light on Shostakovich's career as a performer (he was a
Soviet candidate in the 1927 Chopin Competition in Warsaw, along
with Grigoriy Ginzburg, Lev Oborin, and others). It doesn't come as
a surprise to learn that Shostakovich once had to play the
Tchaikovsky Concerto on ``a vile tinkling upright'' with a
provincial orchestra in an outdoor arena, but it is interesting to
learn what parts of the standard repertory he was drawn to in his
own concerts _ at 15, he played Beethoven's ``Hammerklavier''
Sonata at the Leningrad Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   If Fay couldn't find out all she wanted to about a matter, she
simply admits her failure. Only two paragraphs, for example, treat
Shostakovich's second marriage, which lasted from 1956-1959.
``Little is known about (Margarita) Kainova. Although Shostakovich
tried to introduce her into his circle of friends and family, no
one seems to have understood or approved of the match. . . .
Margarita was never able to win the support of the children or the
domestic staff. After three years of marriage, in the summer of
1959, Shostakovich terminated the relationship _ designating his
son as intermediary to effect the break _ and divorced her,
settling her into an apartment with a monthly stipend.'' After that
Kainova disappears from the chronicle, though Fay includes an
interesting photograph of her with Shostakovich in Paris in 1958 _
it is one of the two images in the entire collection in which
Shostakovich appears relaxed and at ease (in the other, he is
attending a soccer game, a favorite pastime).
</P>
<P>
   Fay's sources were period newspapers, concert programs and
reviews, personnel files, transcripts, letters and diaries, and she
approached memoirs by others with scrupulous caution. The
autobiography of the great soprano Galina Vishnevskaya does not
record that she ``flubbed up badly'' twice during the Moscow
premiere of the Fourteenth Symphony, and that Shostakovich much
preferred her alternate; Fay has established this.
</P>
<P>
   Some pertinent and touching details do come from memoirs. The
composer Galina Ustvolskaya, for example, attended the premiere of
one of Shostakovich's party-line pieces in 1949, ``The Song of the
Forests.'' She recalls that after the performance ``Shostakovich
returned to his room in the Hotel Europe and began to sob, burying
his head in a pillow. He sought consolation in vodka.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the most enthralling passages come from the vast
correspondence of Shostakovich, which has become available only in
piecemeal fashion. Here, for example, is a letter to the young
composer Edison Denisov, who had written to complain about the
injustices he had faced and how slowly his career was advancing.
``A few words about your grievances. I advise you to envy Mozart,
Beethoven, Tchaikovsky. To envy Koval, Muravlyov, and so on, really
and truly isn't worth it, no matter how successful these failures
sometimes may be. . . . P.S. I repeat: envy of Mozart will lead you
forward. Envy of talentless losers will take you backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Fay is becomingly modest about her accomplishment in this
volume. ``Shostakovich scholarship is in its infancy. Most of the
composer's personal legacy remains in private hands. His own
archival repository contains but a small fraction of the evidence
that will eventually contribute to a fully nuanced assessment of
the man and his career.'' The rest of us can nevertheless be
grateful for her humble and Herculean efforts, thanks to which
Shostakovich can no longer be discussed in terms of black or white;
her work has begun to make it possible to focus on the lasting
inner life of the music and to think of the music's creator in
fuller human terms.

simply can't go at him substantively, I will leave you not an inch
of room, without coming straight at me. As my ally, Dick Gephardt,
put it when he ran for president back in '88, it's my fight, too.
</P>
<P>
   The president's speech also stepped all over Bradley's oddly
petty decision to make the windup of his New Hampshire campaign
mostly about the alleged hurts he has suffered during an extremely
mild (by historical standards) dust-up with Gore in which he has
given as much as he's gotten. Not by accident, the contrast this
weekend is between a vision of the recent past and the long-term
future and a Bradley campaign that is too much about Bradley and
too little about the voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's astonishing speech was no less a challenge
to his vice president. It's fine to say that budget surpluses of
undreamed dimensions make it possible to fund preschool for every
kid via block grants to the states or to extend the life of
Medicare without penny-pinching cutbacks for another 25 years. But
Clinton's vision of a completed social contract _ you will search
in vain for a more comprehensive blueprint from any modern
progressive president _ demands that Gore raise his sights as well.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken months of struggle _ the classic vice president's
challenge _ to get out from the boss's shadow, to achieve a
separation made even more essential by this president's unique
baggage. But that shadow just got a lot longer.
</P>
<P>
   Along all 89 minutes of the way, Clinton also shined a bright
light on the battle among conservatives to succeed him as he put
down his challenge to do far more with unprecedented prosperity's
fiscal rewards than simply fix the roof while the sun is shining
(to borrow Bradley's concept).
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush took the easy way out in his quick hit about the
evils of big government making imperative the return of the
non-Social Security surplus in the form of income tax cuts. But the
congressional response organized by Bush's backers in Congress
sounded more like John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In her economic policy comments that were part of the televised
reply, Senator Susan Collins of Maine gave only a vague endorsement
of ``tax relief for American families,'' reflecting the decision
not to proceed down last year's profligate, pointless road. And the
priorities Collins did stress _ protecting Social Security
(co-responder Bill Frist of Tennessee added Medicare), paying off
the national debt, and targeting tax reduction for small businesses
and ending inheritance levies _ are McCain's conservative
priorities, not the conservative pork that Bush advocates, which
would concentrate roughly 90 percent of the tax-cut dollars on the
wealthiest 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It's no crime, however, to concentrate on Tuesday's pivotal
primary, because Clinton himself did, in intimate connection with
his veep's effort.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's silly debate about campaign tactics, a top Gore
adviser told me that his separation from the president _ as a
person seeking the office on his own, then as an angry friend
intolerant of Clinton's personal irresponsibility _ was a necessary
precursor to an eventual reunion on national and foreign policy
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The clue that this was coming has been around for weeks, as the
Gore battleship slowly turned its guns on the economy, that great
uniter of Democrats, as the Iowa caucuses demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   The task was made much easier rhetorically by a Bradley slip-up
down the stretch in Iowa. He had the troubled farm economy in mind,
but by asking a version of the old Ronald Reagan question to Iowans
_ Are you better off then you were seven years ago? _ he created a
huge opening that Gore rushed through. He used the line in nearly
every appearance down the stretch and used it to begin his closing
comments at the debate here.
</P>
<P>
   The president came next, and what he did went miles beyond the
five specific references to Gore that I counted in the State of the
Union, along with the special notice of Tipper Gore's work to
transform mental health policy.
</P>
<P>
   One clue was the late addition to Clinton's text on gun control
advocating (as has Gore) the registration and licensing of the
owners of all new handguns. Bradley's proposal to go at the tens of
millions already in circulation is by definition wasted, unworkable
effort.
</P>
<P>
   An even better clue was the explicit endorsement (following
Senator Kennedy's) of Gore's health care position, building toward
universal coverage on the strong foundation of existing efforts
under Medicaid, the new children's insurance program, and Clinton's
idea to allow people to buy into Medicare at age 55.
</P>
<P>
   Then the clincher: ``The lesson of our history, and the lesson
of the last seven years, is that great goals are reached step by
step, always building on our progress, always gaining ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and Gore represent a party remarkably united on
policy in Congress and around the country, given its fractious
past.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is free to argue that nearly everybody else in the
parade is out of step. I read the polls same as everybody, but I've
seen New Hampshire turn on a dime before.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bradley has chosen to concentrate on the slights he
says he has suffered when the political going got tough. The
basketball player who once grabbed and held for a living is now
whining as a tactic when he gets the inevitable elbow in return.
</P>

GUINNESS'S GOSSIP MORE APPEALING THAN GRIPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
A POSITIVELY FINAL APPEARANCE 
By Alec Guinness 
Viking, 256 pp., $24.95  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Alec Guinness is as close to a chameleon as an actor can
get, as this perhaps unnecessary diary attests.
</P>
<P>
   The title suggests why the book seems a bit much. He published
his autobiography in 1986, then a later diary in 1995. Now comes
this surprisingly crotchety diary, written between 1996 and 1998.
He says this is definitely his ``swan song.'' So whatever happened
to the adage that a performer should leave the audience wanting
more?
</P>
<P>
   Guinness is at his best telling backstage/inside stories. He's
less attractive as a grumpy old man. He gives us a taste of both
here. He gets points for being literate and literary, qualities not
associated with most actors, although, with words like
``valetudinarianism'' and ``numbustious,'' he may go a tad too far.
And he's not too highbrow to avoid the lamentable cliche
``chattering classes.''
</P>
<P>
   The best anecdotes are the catty ones. Richard Burton and
Elizabeth Taylor are staying at the same Paris hotel as Marlene
Dietrich. Dietrich overhears the couple complaining about fans
``swarming around the front door.'' Dietrich advises them: ``My
dear Richard, my dear Elizabeth, if you want to escape the crowds,
don't stay in the same hotel as me.'' In a more unsettling
anecdote, Guinness admonishes a 12-year-old boy who'd seen ``Star
Wars'' 100 times never to see it again. Stars complaining about
their fans aren't the martyrs they think they are.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's his thoughts on Sir John Gielgud. Immersed in his
role as ``King Lear'' in World War II-ravaged London, Gielgud is
unable to fathom why audiences are ``falling off.'' Writes
Guinness: ``John's grasp of public events was always rather
tenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   The author evokes a scene in a Piccadilly restaurant where
actors wait for first-night reviews in the early-morning editions
of the newspapers. The papers are distributed and read. There are
moans, yelps of delight, scoffing laughs. ``They've spelt my name
wrong!'' ``Well, you're lucky to be mentioned.'' ``I don't think
poor old Jack will consider himself lucky to be mentioned _ miscast
and in two minds about what to say next.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the churlish Guinness, railing at and about the
nonagenarian in an adjacent hotel room whose radio is too loud.
Perhaps Guinness, at 86, sees himself at that age but doesn't want
to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   Most appalling is the actor's merriment upon learning of the
Duke of Wellington's response to a question about the most inane
remark he'd ever heard. During the Peninsular War, Wellington heard
a Portuguese general address his troops before a battle with the
words: ``Remember, men, you are Portuguese!'' Guinness finds it
necessary to protest that he's not racist and that on two visits to
Portugal he's found the people ``kind, helpful and even jolly.''
Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as unfortunate is the author's resentment at being listed
in the newspapers as the third-highest-paid British actor during a
year. But we've already read that Guinness and his wife live quite
well and comfortably with their cats in the countryside, reading,
going to the theater, and traveling. He's plainly not suffering.
</P>
<P>
   His carefully crafted ruminations on the late Diana, princess of
Wales, and Prime Minister Tony Blair and the British establishment
are not earthshaking, and his visits to doctors and hospitals seem
curiously anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   He's much better off sticking to discussions of the acting trade
and its vicissitudes. Here, in an exchange he has with Gielgud, the
two aging actors, although lifelong friends, are still not above
trying to upstage one another.
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud kindly gives Guinness a huge, richly bound Italian
edition of ``Hamlet'' with colored illustrations by Henry Moore.
``I was going to leave it to you in my will,'' says Gielgud, ``but
as I seem to be still going strong, you may as well have it now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would you like me to leave it to in my will?'' asks
Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rather hoped you might leave it to Paul Scofield,'' Gielgud
says. ``That would be killing two birds with one stone. He's a lot
younger than you.''
</P>

BERLIN OFFICIALS, US AMBASSADOR SQUABBLE OVER EMBASSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The US embassy on Pariser Platz was deserted in 1941,
bombed by the Allies during World War II, and torn down by the
Communists in 1957 to make way for what would become the Berlin
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   The wall has since been torn down, too. But getting the embassy
back up in what many regard as its rightful place has proved more
difficult because of a dispute between the State Department and
Berlin officials that sheds light on strains between the US and
Germany a decade after the Cold War ended.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say the new embassy needs a minimum of a 100-foot
security perimeter to guard against terrorist attack. Berlin
officials say that would force the closing of two streets and cause
traffic chaos around the nearby Brandenburg Gate, the actual and
symbolic heart of the city that has just resumed its role as the
capital of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the $150 million embassy was supposed to start
last year, but unless the dispute is resolved soon, a new site will
have to be found and relations between Washington and Berlin could
sour considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are clinging stubbornly to symbolism. The Americans
want to return to the spot they had to clear out of in 1941, after
Adolf Hitler had declared war on the United States. The Germans
have invested mightily in rebuilding the area around Brandenburg
Gate, which they hold as a symbol of a reunified Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Some attribute the inability to resolve the dispute to
personality conflicts, particularly between US Ambassador John
Kornblum and Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen. Others, however, see
the dispute as evidence of a Germany more confident of its place in
the world and less willing to accept the demands of the United
States. After 55 years of American influence, a more assertive
Germany wants to wean itself from its old benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   If not a cold war, the dispute is certainly a big chill. The
spat has been, at times, public and tawdry, with each side accusing
the other of name-calling and arm-twisting.
</P>
<P>
   In October, at the opening of the 1,000th McDonald's franchise
in Germany, Diepgen sarcastically suggested that Kornblum build a
McDonald's on the Pariser Platz instead of an embassy. Kornblum was
furious.
</P>
<P>
   But Germans have accused Kornblum, who has worked as a diplomat
in Germany for much of the last 30 years, of acting less than
diplomatic by belittling Germany and dressing down journalists who
have suggested the Americans are acting like the occupying force
they were a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The German press has fanned the flames. Der Spiegel, an
influential German magazine, accused Kornblum of ``putting a strain
on German-American relations because of his stubborn and rude
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Bolling, a commentator and former spokesman for the former
chancellor Helmut Schmidt, wrote a column titled ``The times have
changed, Mr. Ambassador,'' about how Germans would not be dictated
to and accused Kornblum of arrogance. Bolling said Kornblum
reprimanded him when they bumped into each other at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the opening in November of a new center here to
foster American-German cultural and academic exchanges, Kornblum
said Germany had progressed but that ``it will be a probably fairly
long process before Germany finds the right tone and the right
feeling for exerting what is after all a very strong role in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   His critics called the remarks patronizing. Even some who are
critical of Diepgen suggest that Kornblum, who was appointed
ambassador in 1998, is a product of the old school, in which
German-American relations were framed in the narrow margins of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has proved embarrassing to both governments and to
those who regard the American-German relationship as one of the
most important and mutually beneficial in the world.
</P>
<P>
   As Catherine Kelleher, director of the Aspen Institute, a
Berlin-based think tank, put it, ``It's gotten out of hand. We need
some statesmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   The German chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, has offered to mediate
the dispute, but as of Friday negotiations were continuing between
city officials and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   US diplomats, meanwhile, continue to work out of the nearby
former US Embassy to East Germany and other offices in western
Berlin. The old embassy is an eyesore, surrounded by barbed wire
and German antiterrorist police, the street blocked off.
</P>
<P>
   Security was always going to be a problem at the new site. But
it became a bigger problem after August 1998, when terrorist
attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania left some 200 people
dead and led to a review of security at US embassies worldwide. A
panel headed by former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Admiral
William Crowe concluded that $14 billion should be spent on
improving security at embassies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, the former US ambassador in London, was so disturbed by
what he saw as the vulnerability of the US Embassy planned for
Pariser Platz that he asked Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
to consider a new site. Sources familiar with those discussions
said that Kornblum made an impassioned plea about the symbolic
importance of the site. Albright relented but insisted that the
traffic had to be pushed back 100 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin officials, however, said that would ruin the traffic flow
around Brandenburg Gate. The Reichstag, which reopened last year as
home to the Bundestag, Germany's parliament, is nearby, as are the
offices of many German government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The British and French embassies are already under construction
at their former sites near Brandenburg Gate, and the Russian
Embassy is still down the street, reinforcing the American
government's determination.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Dennis Wolf, a US Embassy spokesman, said the
100-foot buffer zone was a worldwide directive but suggested that
compromises are being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Ambassador Kornblum said, we are on the right path. There
seems to be forward movement, although there are a number of
outstanding issues. We still need to have negotiations on the
details of an agreement before a decision can be reached,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Berliners seem torn. Edith Kasch, 67, a retired
secretary, remembers eating food dropped by American planes during
the Berlin Airlift, when the Soviets tried unsuccessfully to
blockade West Berlin. She is not troubled by more than 50,000
American soldiers remaining on Germany soil. She believes Germany
still owes a debt to the United States. ``A disgrace,'' she calls
the ongoing dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Hermann Vogel, a 30-year-old librarian from eastern Berlin,
holds a different view. He said the American rebuilding of Germany
and use of it as a front line in the Cold War was more about
America's interest than Germany's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans need to treat Germany with more respect, as an
equal, not as a colony,'' he said. ``Times have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   James Cooney, executive director the Weatherhead Center for
International Affairs at Harvard University, pointed to Germany's
role as a leader in the European Union and its armed forces
returning to combat in Kosovo for the first time since World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the generation over 40 is tired of the occupying powers.
They appreciate what was done, but they want to move on,'' said
Cooney.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim Krause, deputy director of the German Society for
Foreign Affairs, a Berlin-based think tank, said the room for
compromise is limited, because Pariser Platz is relatively small
and is next to the city's Holocaust memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they'll have to have two embassies,'' he said. ``There
has to be a pragmatic solution. Too much is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the dispute is resolved soon, it will take at least
three years to build the new embassy, and probably longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the real tragedy,'' says Kelleher. ``In the new Berlin,
there will be no new US Embassy for years. . . . This has got to
get worked out.''

DOLLAR BILLS SERVE PRIMARY FUNCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ And so, the winner in the sweepstakes for the
greatest campaign fund-raising effort of this election year is . .
. the state of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Without Tuesday's primary, always the first in the nation, this
small state _ under snow for months of the year, gripped in
bone-chilling cold for more months of the year _ would be an
afterthought in the political world, a Delaware with mountains, a
South Dakota with a seashore. But because of the outsized
importance of this faraway corner of the country with a peculiar
character _ it's so frugal that until recently fish and game
officials sold the roadkill they scraped off the highways _
candidates, campaigns, and correspondents flock here every four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Take away the primary and you take away $175 million of spending
_ and eliminate 1,525 jobs. A study prepared by the Library and
Archives of New Hampshire Political Traditions says that for every
dollar of direct primary spending, an additional $1.72 is generated
inside the state because of the sales, earnings, and purchases of
businesses and households. That explains the poll findings showing
that more than half of New Hampshire's residents consider the
primary very or extremely important to the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   It sure is important to media outlets. A study prepared for the
same Traditions organization found that the campaigns pump $7
million into broadcast political advertising alone, and though the
station does not disclose ad revenues, it's clear that the largest
beneficiary by far is Manchester's WMUR, the only statewide network
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   The primary also accounts for $24 million in restaurant and
hotel spending, which is why the regulars who wander into the
Merrimack Restaurant in Manchester for eggplant Parmesan or stuffed
shells are finding it pretty crowded these days _ and why the
old-timers who linger over the coffee at the Littleton Diner a
whisper west of the Presidential Range sometimes find themselves
surrounded by George W. Bush, Steve Forbes, and Al Gore. These
diners won't see so many patrons until . . . well, until four years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this money is a quick dime and a slow dollar,'' says US
Representative Charlie Bass, a Peterborough Republican. ``You can't
live on what you make only in election years.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary candidates may talk taxes in the Granite State, but
what they really do is spend _ and it doesn't hurt that two of
them, Bush and Forbes, aren't bound by federal spending
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a snowless winter with lousy skiing, it makes for a good
cash crop,'' says Thomas D. Rath, a former state attorney general.
As primary day nears, no doughnut or finger sandwich is safe. The
rental-car agencies are straining to get vehicles, and, because a
lot of the outsiders and flatlanders don't know the difference
between Crawford Notch and Pinkham Notch, there's a run on those
with satellite directional devices.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, with a state economy of $7 billion, New Hampshire
could survive without the primary. Just not as well.

KENNEDY'S SUPPORT MAKES HIM SOLID PARTNER IN GORE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; One of Al Gore's key political assets in his run for the White
House is his endorsement by US Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who has appeared with Vice President Gore in Iowa and
New Hampshire, is contributing more than his physical presence and
eloquent rhetoric to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   By standing with Gore, Kennedy is sending a message to Democrats
that the candidate's issues are his issues, and that they represent
the heart and soul of the Democratic Party. Those issues include
affordable health insurance, education, Social Security, and an
increased minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Kennedy's support of these and other such issues
less than a decade ago prompted conservatives to dismiss them as
``liberal.'' Even Kennedy himself might have been considered too
liberal in those days to be an asset to a Democratic hopeful
seeking to gain the political center. But times have changed,
especially for Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, as well as Bill Bradley, is pushing the need to put more
money into public education, a traditionally liberal issue that is
now also embraced by some moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, Kennedy's support for Gore is sending the
message to Democrats that Gore's approach is right, while Bradley's
health care plan is not as well thought out.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and now Gore have adopted the Kennedy-led
proposal for a patients' bill of rights, which includes the right
to sue a health maintenance organization. The idea, which has
liberal roots, has become so popular that even conservative
Republicans acknowledge it is possible to pass a bill of rights law
that includes suits against HMOs. The only difference between the
Democratic and Republican versions may be on who can be sued and
for how much.
</P>
<P>
   Saving Social Security has been an issue strongly embraced by
Kennedy and other Democrats in Congress, and has become a rallying
cry for Gore as well as Clinton in the past year. And while keeping
Social Security solvent appears to be a big concern among many
Americans, Republicans seemed to have jumped on the bandwagon too
late to wrest that issue from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these Democratic issues, of course, have also been
embraced by Bradley. But Kennedy's support of him gives Gore extra
credibility, which may help to explain his surge in the New
Hampshire polls.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's role may be even more important to Gore after the
national conventions this summer, from which Gore and Texas
Governor George W. Bush are expected to emerge as their parties'
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   If, for instance, Kennedy pursues raising the minimum wage in
Congress during the Gore-Bush campaign, it could become a thorny
issue for Bush, particularly if his Republican backers oppose an
increase, which is likely to be popular with voters. And if Kennedy
continues, as he will, to push for the patients' bill of rights in
the Senate, strong GOP opposition could again make things difficult
for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Another bill, which would provide prescription drug benefits to
senior citizens, is also likely to be championed by Kennedy. Again,
if Republicans in Congress who back Bush's candidacy strongly
oppose a bill that senior citizens need, that can only help Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy will also be conducting his own bid for reelection this
year. But he appears to be even stronger now than when he defeated
Mitt Romney six years ago. Even some of his Republican critics
agree that Kennedy has enhanced his image since then.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Plymouth County District Attorney Michael Sullivan
may stick with his plan to challenge Kennedy after the New
Hampshire primary, giving Kennedy a GOP opponent. Another person
who has said he will run against Kennedy is Phil Hyde of
Somerville, an independent and a perennial candidate for local and
congressional seats.
</P>
<P>
   While the GOP's support might make Sullivan a stronger candidate
than Hyde, the question is whether he has the name recognition, the
finances, and the political skills to even rate consideration as a
serious contender.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Globe article, Sullivan said, ``While the economy
appears very strong, unemployment is way down, and wages are way
up, people are asking, `Are we headed in the right direction?' ''
If Sullivan decides that we are headed in the wrong direction with
these pluses, then his campaign may be in trouble even before it
begins.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, polls suggest that most Americans believe the nation
is going in the right direction. Other polls show that Gore is
headed in the right direction, with one poll last week showing him
only 3 points behind Bush in a general election matchup. Kennedy's
popularity also says he is going in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   And if the economy continues to go in the right direction, Gore
_ with Kennedy's help _ may be giving Bush more than a run for all
of the GOP front-runner's money.

CUBAN SMUGGLERS PROFIT FROM 1994 CHANGES IN US POLICY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MIAMI _ When he set out from Cuba, little Elian Gonzalez was one
of 14 people crammed into a 17-foot aluminum skiff. The ``life
preserver'' that saved him was one of three overinflated truck
inner tubes that had been crudely lashed to the boat in an
unsuccessful plan to keep it afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Elian drifted some 30 miles before he was discovered off Fort
Lauderdale, wearing only a gray sweatshirt and his underwear. He
was suffering from shock and hypothermia, and a rash covered his
body. Two other survivors came ashore in Miami. They told
investigators that they had paid $2,000 each to make the perilous
journey to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the political furor and the family histrionics now
enveloping Elian, the 6-year-old boy's odyssey is primarily a
smuggler's tale, one of thousands that have played out across the
Florida Straits since a 1994 agreement fundamentally changed how
many Cubans come to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that some of these people were paying money to be
taken to the United States,'' said Steve Quinones, special agent in
charge of the US Border Patrol's antismuggling unit, which
investigated the case. ``There are clear indicators that there was
some level of organization here.''
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of how the journey was organized cut through some
of the mythology that has surrounded the case, particularly with
regard to Lazaro Munero, the 24-year-old boyfriend of Elian's
mother, Elizabet Brotons. Cuban-American exiles fighting to keep
the boy in Miami have portrayed Munero as a loving, heartsick
stepfather who returned to Cuba to retrieve Elizabet and Elian and
ferry them to a better life.
</P>
<P>
   Although that may be true, investigators have concluded that
Munero organized the trip as a profit-making venture, turning his
modest boat with a 50-horsepower motor into paid transport for
people desperate to reach the United States. The boat was so
unsteady that when it ran into mechanical trouble shortly after
leaving Cuba and was forced to return to shore, Arianne Horta, one
of the three passengers to survive the crossing, nervously dropped
off her 5-year-old daughter and resumed the trip on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That boat was probably doomed before it ever left Cuba,'' said
Lieutenant Ronald A. LaBrec, a spokesman for the Coast Guard in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the human toll _ seven bodies have been found and four
others, including those of Munero and Brotons, are still missing _
authorities were hardly surprised by what they called the
carelessness and callousness with which the trip was organized.
Since a 1994 shift in US policy in favor of Cuban migrants, South
Florida has seen an explosion of unscrupulous entrepreneurs who are
willing to smuggle Cubans to the United States for as much as
$10,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in smuggling has to do with the nature of the
agreement, which stipulates that Cubans intercepted at sea, with
few exceptions, must be returned to Cuba. Before, nearly all Cuban
migrants were eligible for asylum under the Cuban Adjustment Act of
1966, a law that seemed to encourage periodic spasms of mass
migration.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent ``rafter crisis,'' the Coast Guard picked up
37,139 Cuban migrants in 1994. Knowing that they merely needed to
reach US authorities, the migrants ``would use anything they could
find,'' said Jose Basulto, who heads a group of volunteer pilots
known as ``Brothers to the Rescue.'' Basulto recalled seeing people
floating on styrofoam containers, inner tubes, even a ``raft''
whose hull was carved from the top of a bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast Guard now is acting as Cuba's border patrol'' to
prevent people from leaving, said Basulto.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the year after the agreement, the Coast Guard
intercepted just 625 Cuban migrants, most of whom were returned to
Cuba. The figures have remained relatively low, but immigration
authorities recently have become alarmed by some of the unforeseen
effects of a ``wet foot, dry foot'' policy that seems to reward
Cubans with residency if they can somehow manage to reach US soil.
</P>
<P>
   The policy creates a market for the smugglers, who often use
high-powered cigarette boats, infrared night goggles, and
sophisticated global positioning systems that allow them to assess
their longitude and latitude at any time. It also seems to ratchet
up the desperation of migrants once land is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tendency they have is that they get more aggressive
because they know they're so close,'' said Petty Officer William
Weaver. ``That's a fact, that's not personal opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver should know. Last September, his 41-foot utility boat
stopped a sailboat filled with Cuban migrants about 500 yards from
shore. When Weaver tried to cut the boat's sail to prevent it from
advancing, one of the migrants tried to hack Weaver's arm with a
rusted machete. The boat eventually capsized and the migrants were
taken into custody about 100 yards from shore.
</P>
<P>
   The list of violent incidents involving Cubans at sea is
growing. Last August, a man chewed the inside of his mouth until it
bled, then pretended to cough up blood so the Coast Guard would
take him to the United States for medical attention. He was
returned to Cuba. In July, a man doused himself and his boat with
gasoline, then threatened to light himself on fire. The Coast Guard
crew sprayed him with fire-resistant foam and took him into
custody.
</P>
<P>
   That same week, a Cuban man slit his wrists with a torn soda can
and smeared blood all over himself and a female companion before he
was subdued. The Coast Guard crew was forced to install plastic
fencing on deck to prevent the migrants from jumping overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know if they touch land they're pretty much here,'' said
LaBrec, the Coast Guard spokesman. ``They'll do anything to touch
land. They've held babies out over the side of the boat and tell
us, `Don't come any closer or we'll drop the baby.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the Elian Gonzalez case appears to involve a
similar combination of desperation and greed. The idea for the trip
apparently originated with Munero, who first came to Miami in June
1998. He returned to Cuba sometime last year, although it is
unclear why. Cuban American exiles have said that Munero went back
to get Brotons and Elian. But Verne Eastwood, the lead investigator
for the Border Patrol, said he was told by family members that
Munero's original intention was to return to see another woman to
whom he was still married.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Brotons met Munero and moved in with him. At
the same time, Munero began working on the boat with his father,
and he quietly sent word of his plans throughout Cardenas, a port
city on Cuba's northern coast. ``It appeared that both the father
and the son were working jointly as far as the preparations for the
trip were concerned,'' said Eastwood. ``The survivors said they
paid them $2,000 each to board the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   By today's smuggling standards, the operation was small-time,
and therefore infinitely more risky, authorities said. Munero tried
to cram the boat with as many people as possible. The boat
apparently was not equipped with life vests. The three inner tubes
were brought along not as safety precautions, but to balance the
overcrowded craft. Two of the inner tubes were positioned on either
side of the boat, and one was positioned in front.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they believe the boat was two-thirds of the
way to its destination when, during a storm, the motor gave out and
the boat began to take on water and capsized. The passengers then
climbed onto the 14- to 16-inch diameter inner tubes and cast off.
</P>
<P>
   A fisherman pulled Elian from the water about three miles
offshore. A woman whose body was found a mile away might have been
tethered to the same inner tube, authorities said. Petty officer
Travis Kane, one of the first Coast Guard officers to treat Elian,
said, ``He knew for a fact that his mom had died. When I talked to
him, all he said was his mom was gone. He said he asked her for a
bottle and she never answered him. That was the first thing he told
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Baena, a Spanish-speaking seaman for the Coast Guard, tried
to keep Elian conscious by asking him questions like what his
favorite color was. ``He didn't recall how many days he had been in
the water,'' said Baena. ``He just knew that his mom was dead. He
didn't even remember how long the trip was.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian drifted in and out of consciousness. After initial
treatment for shock and hypothermia, he was rushed to shore for
additional medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began his life at the epicenter of an international
political crisis. Had he been picked up earlier, or had he not been
ill when authorities reached him, his life would have been
dramatically different. Coast Guard procedure is to hold all Cuban
migrants until an Immigration and Naturalization Service officer
can interview them. In nearly all cases, the migrants are then sent
back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was no reason to bring him to shore for medical
reasons, he would have been kept on a cutter,'' said LaBrec. ``Then
the INS would have done their thing and they would have decided
what to do with him.''

JUDITH LIGHT BATTLED HER FEARS IN `WIT' ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a stormy day two weeks ago in Los Angeles, six women who had
worked together on the original production of ``Wit'' got together
to hold a vigil. Three thousand miles away in a New York hospital,
their friend, the play's director, Derek Anson Jones, was dying of
AIDS. It was raining when the call came; the ocean and the sky were
painted the same dull gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was near the end, we walked out to the end of the
pier,'' recalls actress Kathleen Chalfant. ``The air was soft and
gray, and it was like walking into some dark gray cocoon and saying
`goodbye.' It was important that we were together.''
</P>
<P>
   The LA production of ``Wit'' opened the next night, with a
tribute to Jones. In New York, the actors asked the audience for a
moment of silence. The touring production, which stars Judith Light
and opens a three-week run at the Wilbur Theatre on Tuesday, will
also be dedicated to the late director.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while a play comes along that bonds people
together in extraordinary ways. ``Wit'' is one of those plays.
Written by Jones's childhood friend Margaret Edson, this play about
a terminally ill poetry professor has had a profound effect on the
company members, both on and off the stage. The play, they say,
isn't a tearful lecture about how to die; it's a dry-eyed lesson
about how to live _ with simplicity and kindness. Chalfant, a
theater veteran who is repeating her original performance in Los
Angeles, absorbed that lesson firsthand; she learned that her
brother was dying when she was doing the role at New Haven's Long
Wharf Theatre. ``The play taught me how to look after him,'' she
recalls. ``There was an odd kind of synergy between my life and the
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Another actress, Frances West, opted to postpone a round of
chemotherapy to play the role two years ago at Shakespeare and
Company. ``I am an actress, and I have cancer, and I am playing a
woman who has cancer,'' she said at the time. ``But just because
you have this disease, it doesn't mean your life ends.'' Like all
the other women who have portrayed Dr. Vivian Bearing, West shaved
her head for the part, and she also overcame her anxiety about a
brief nude scene that revealed the scars of two mastectomies. It
was her last role onstage; she died in November. ``Frances was
unafraid, and she wanted to fly in the face of her death,'' recalls
Shakespeare and Company artistic director Tina Packer. ``It was a
real act of bravery, and I have to tell you, I don't know that I
could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The play required a different sort of risk for Light, a Soap
Opera Hall of Fame honoree who is best known as the blonde in the
sitcom ``Who's the Boss.'' Classically trained, she hadn't been
onstage in 22 years and had been afraid to try other theater
auditions before she replaced Chalfant off-Broadway. ``I wasn't
challenging myself. I wasn't putting my feet up against the fire,''
she says. ``To me, this play isn't about ovarian cancer; it's about
realizing you can change the way you live _ that is an option. And
to me, that is a profound piece of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one involved in the production had a deeper
understanding of the play's lessons than Jones, who didn't tell
anyone that he was ill until about six months ago. ``It was his way
of being selfless,'' says Light. ``The play was really his mission
and his voice and his way to tell people what was important to him.
And the beauty of it is that he succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   A personal mission
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both the play and the production have garnered a slew of
awards, including the Pulitzer Prize. But there was a time it
seemed as if the script wouldn't make it any further than the
bottom of Jones's backpack. Edson, an Atlanta kindergarten teacher,
wrote the play in 1991; she says the story of Vivian Bearing, a
John Donne scholar, just appeared fully formed in her head. She
staged the first reading at her mother's dining-room table in
Washington, D.C., casting her high school buddy (and prom date)
Jones in the role of Bearing. ``Derek was a secretary at Blue Cross
at the time, so he wasn't the obvious choice for director,'' says
Edson.
</P>
<P>
   Several years passed. The play was produced quietly at the South
Coast Repertory Theatre in Costa Mesa, Calif., but then nothing
happened. Meanwhile, Jones graduated from the Yale University
School of Drama, and the play became his personal mission. He sent
it out to scores of regional theaters, receiving enough rejection
slips to carpet a decent-sized room. But in 1996, he assisted
director Doug Hughes on a production of ``Henry V,'' which featured
Chalfant as the queen of France. (In theater circles, the actress
is known for her stirring performance in ``Angels in America.'')
Jones gave the script to both of them, and Hughes promised to
produce it if he ever ran a theater, which seemed unlikely at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, Hughes opened his inaugural season at the
Long Wharf with ``Wit,'' starring Chalfant and directed by Jones.
The production was a huge hit, but when the team tried to move it
to New York, the only place that would take it was MCC Theater, a
tiny off-off-Broadway venue. Again, the production was a runaway
success, but Hughes still couldn't find a producer willing to move
the play to Broadway. ``They said, `Nobody wants to see a play
about cancer,' '' Hughes recalls. The production ended up
off-Broadway at the small Union Square Theater, where it has played
more than 450 performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every point in the life of the project, the conventional
wisdom said, `Stop. Enough,' '' says Hughes. ``The whole experience
has been an exercise in trusting one's instincts and mustering the
courage to overcome obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone involved agrees that the play would not have gotten
produced at all had it not been for the tenacity of Jones. ``He
attacked this play in a fierce, rigorous, unsentimental way,''
recalls Chalfant, ``and looking back on it now, that's
extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the character of Vivian Bearing would bristle at the
slightest soupcon of sentiment. The expert in metaphysical poetry
could analyze a verse down to the final breath without deigning to
embrace the emotion at its core; she's all head and no heart. In
Chalfant's estimation, ``She's mean as a snake.'' In Frances West's
view, ``She's a tough, courageous bird, this woman.'' The professor
harangues her students and won't suffer fools. And she certainly
doesn't gloss over the gory details of her own predicament: ``It is
not my intention to give away the plot,'' she announces at the
outset, ``but I think I die at the end.'' Even as she undergoes
eight months of an experimental treatment and deteriorates
physically, she still wrestles with the proper punctuation of
Donne's ``Death, Be Not Proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Donne's meditations on mortality are of little use when one
comes face to face with the real thing. Yet this is a woman who
doesn't have the telephone number to her own emotions. ``She's
dying of ovarian cancer, which is the cancer of the life-giving
organs, the nurturing organs,'' notes Light. ``This is a woman who
has given birth to nothing. She has not nurtured. She has not taken
anyone into the enfoldment of her body or her arms or her breast.
Symbolically, that's very powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is an unspoken solidarity among the women of ``Wit,''
who share the experience of walking around bald in an
image-obsessed society. ``Being bald has been extremely freeing,''
says Light, who doesn't wear a wig in public. ``I don't have
cancer, but it's my attempt to let people know that at some level I
know what they might be going through. I can't understand it
completely _ that would be arrogant _ but I know what it's like
when people stare at me and think, `Oh that poor woman, she must be
so ill.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, the play will be performed at dozens of
regional theaters nationwide, as well as at venues in other
countries. ``I'm just charmed by the idea of this legion of
50-something-year-old bald women walking around the world,'' says
Chalfant. ``We have this bond which in one way is superficial and
in another way is not. Women's hair has such a symbolic power, it
is as though we have made a sacrifice to some odd religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you want to call it, that spiritual experience has been
life-changing for everyone involved, thanks in no small part to the
influence of Jones. In the end, there's a certain poetic beauty to
his passing. In a 1998 interview, he said that the play wasn't
about cancer, but about taking stock of life. ``Being smart is not
the most important thing, being successful is not the most
important thing,'' he said. The most important thing, he said, is
quite simple, really. The professor puts it this way: ``Now is not
the time for for verbal swordplay, for unlikely flights of
imagination and wildly shifting perspectives, for metaphysical
conceit, for wit. . . . Now is a time for simplicity. Now is a time
for, dare I say it, kindness.''

`BOWFINGER' SILLY SLAPSTICK; `DON'T LOOK BACK' IS TOPS

<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Bowfinger'' (DVD) _ Last year, this Eddie
Murphy-Steve Martin Hollywood parody was released around the same
time as Albert Brooks's ``The Muse.'' ``Bowfinger'' is a silly
slapstick patchwork with some moderately amusing moments, but it
did great at the box office, while Brooks's more sophisticated take
on the movie business faltered. No accounting for taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't Look Back'' (DVD) _ D. A. Pennebaker made documentaries
on musicians before the genre was transformed into marketing fluff
by MTV and others. In 1965, Pennebaker followed the squirrelly Bob
Dylan on his tour of England. If you've only seen a scratchy 16mm
version, check out the remastered DVD. The sound is first rate, and
the disc includes a few extra songs and a great version of ``It's
All Over Now, Baby Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Search of Kundun With Martin Scorsese'' _ The title doesn't
exactly scream for attention, but this is a well-done documentary
and should fascinate anyone who's interested in Scorsese's work,
his fascination with Tibet, or the Dalai Lama. The latter gets
considerable screen time and is as quietly persuasive as you might
imagine _ but for movie fans, the behind-the-scenes footage of
Scorsese at work may be the reason to rent the tape.

A DIFFERENT KIND OF COMPULSIVE COLLECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Cornelia Parker lives in Shoreditch, a part of East
London with a market where ``every Sunday thieves bring all their
wares to sell,'' she says cheerfully. She's a regular there. A
compulsive scavenger and shopper, she used to have her own stall in
the somewhat tonier Portobello Road Market _ until she decided to
use all the junk she amasses in her art.
</P>
<P>
   Which strategy has brought her considerable success _ more in
Britain than in the United States. That's a situation Boston's
Institute of Contemporary Art remedies with ``Cornelia Parker,''
the 43-year-old artist's biggest presentation in this country to
date, on view from Wednesday through April 9. The show is organized
by ICA curator Jessica Morgan, also an Englishwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Scooping up stuff in a flea market is one of Parker's least
adventurous means of acquiring materials for her art. For a series
that might well have been dubbed ``Great Tarnishes of History,''
she polished metal icons including Henry VIII's armor and Davy
Crockett's fork, exhibiting the results as art.
</P>
<P>
   For her ``Room for Margins'' she borrowed the canvas linings and
excess margins removed from the Tate Gallery's J. M. W. Turner
paintings during conservation in the 1950s and '60s, and exhibited
them on their own. The dark, ragged scraps, originally consigned to
the unseen backs of the paintings and then hidden away in
conservation lab drawers, took on independent life. Like her fellow
British sculptor, Rachel Whiteread, who makes casts of the
undersides of chairs or the insides of vacant rooms, Parker likes
to give presence to the overlooked. And like yet another
distinguished British sculptor, Tony Cragg, she revels in
collecting and arranging what others consider junk.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Thirty Pieces of Silver,'' for instance, she collected
battered old plates, beakers, butter dishes and other metal
tableware, had it all steamrollered to flatness, and arranged it on
wires suspended from the ceiling, so it hovered and shimmered with
air currents and changing light. Visually magical, ``Thirty Pieces
of Silver'' carries at least two opposite meanings. It alludes to
the pathetic, even ridiculous, uselessness of all this squashed
metal _ and to the 30 pieces of silver Judas was paid to betray
Christ. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Growing up in Cheshire &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 8 or 9,'' Parker recalls, ``I put coins on the
railway track to see them get smashed.'' It wasn't that she was
flush with funds. But she grew up in a remote part of Cheshire, in
England's unfashionable North, and ``there wasn't anything to do
with money up there in the middle of nowhere,'' she says. ``Also, I
was terrified of trains. I put the coins on the tracks to confront
my fears and get over them.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker was raised on what she calls ``a small holding, too small
to call a `farm,' part of a huge estate owned by the queen. My
father came from generations of farmers. We did everything by hand:
scything hay, tying up tomato plants. I was always working with my
hands and doing repetitious things. Growing food is so ephemeral;
it's there and then it's gone, and then you start again.'' She
compares tying up tomato plants with tying up her sculpture,
elements of which tend to hang from wires, suspended in midair.
``It's got to be redone for every show, like growing crops every
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspending her work, rather than placing it on pedestal or
plinth, takes the pompousness out of sculpture and gives it
ambiguity. Those hanging curtains of white chalk or charred wood
seem to be holding their breath, deciding where to go next. The
same goes for Parker's photograms of illustrious feathers: one from
Freud's couch; one from one of the ravens resident at the Tower of
London; a pigeon feather from Benjamin Franklin's London house; a
feather that climbed Everest in a down jacket. ``Feathers have this
mythic, Icarus quality, which I like,'' she says. ``You can't tell
if they're going up or down.''
</P>
<P>
   Feathers are a gentle material. Violence is also an important
component in Parker's art. She's had an abandoned building blown up
so she could recompose the remains, reused wood from a building
burned by arsonists, used various materials to test the sharpness
of the guillotine that beheaded Marie Antoinette, and thrown things
off the White Cliffs of Dover _ including the words of the
dictionary definition of ``gravity,'' cast in lead.
</P>
<P>
   She's also fascinated by fame. ``I'm attracted to structures
like the Empire State Building and people like Freud and Einstein,
whom everybody knows. We use them to measure the world, to describe
it.'' &QL; 
Regional schooling &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parker didn't attend one of the chic London art schools. ``I'm a
country girl, and I went to regional schools,'' she says, to
Wolverhampton Polytechnic and Reading University, where she made
abstract sculpture from scraps of wire or plastic. Nominated in
1997 for the Turner Prize, Britain's most prestigious contemporary
art award, Parker was looking forward to being the first
Wolverhampton grad ever to win. (She didn't.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a slightly maverick position in the art world,'' she
says, ``being a bit older than the Young British Artist
generation.'' Her work has, however, been bought by the collector
who coined the term ``Young British Artist'' _ the controversial
Charles Saatchi. She has mixed feelings about him. ``He's done some
good things for British art, but also some damaging ones,'' she
says, ``by buying up whole shows, keeping all the work without
showing it, and then selling it off.'' Parker's work, meanwhile, is
sold through London's Frith Street Gallery. ``ARTnews'' recently
reported that prices for her photograms and large-scale sculptures
range from $16,000 to $56,000. She has a large public in Britain:
Her 1998 show in London's Serpentine Gallery, a lovely space in the
middle of Kensington Gardens, drew 46,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   She's become sufficiently successful that, after years of
renting in the East End, she's recently been able to buy a rather
derelict building there, in a section she describes as ``not quite
Tribeca yet, although Rachel Whiteread has just bought a synagogue
down the road to use as a studio. This used to be a Jewish area;
now it's Bangladeshi. In Victorian times, the neighborhood was
deliberately razed, because it was so crime-ridden.''
</P>
<P>
   On the top of her low-rise she's refurbished a handsome flat
with a skylight. Her studio is downstairs. ``But I don't use it
much,'' she says. ``I'm more an out-and-about kind of person. I
tend to make big works on site. And fear of the studio comes from a
childhood spent outside. I get claustrophobic.''
</P>
<P>
   `I used to focus on large, site-specific pieces that didn't
exist afterward,'' she says. ``Now I also make quieter, more
reflective works.'' The tarnish pieces fall into the latter
category, as do those stained by a piece of meteor she cherishes.
Tarnish is how a piece of metal meets the world; Parker removes
that intersection, creating, in the process, something like a
trace-bearing Shroud of Turin.
</P>
<P>
   She had a residency at London's Science Museum last year, which
gave her access to the Royal Mint and to the air base where crashes
are researched: She saw the Lockerbie plane still being picked
over. ``Artists,'' she says, ``are barred from certain places.
Scientists aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   While she'd previously been using recognizable objects, at the
Science Museum she produced a series of photomicrographs _ extreme
close-ups whose subjects you can't guess. ``They remind me of those
photo puzzles in the newspapers when I was a child, which asked:
`What is this object?' '' Her objects range from a blackboard
covered with Einstein's equations to the handle of the Chancellor's
Budget Bag; blown up, they all look like crusty moonscapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often get ideas for my activities from the non-art people I
meet,'' she says, ``like the Customs officials who told me about
people who starch their clothes with cocaine to smuggle it into the
country. That gave me the idea for starching sheets with chalk from
the White Cliffs of Dover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Asking authority figures to help me is slightly subversive,
and it takes some nerve,'' she says. Her growing gutsiness all goes
back to that childhood episode of putting those coins on the
railroad track.
</P>
<P>
   She gets bolder every year. On the subject of the leftover
Turner scraps now housed in the conservation department of the
Tate, for instance, ``I've gotten really cheeky. I've asked about
having them relocated to the modern collections.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Asking the Daughters of the Republic of Texas if I could
polish Davy Crockett's fork was really scary,'' she says. ``I was
testing my own mettle,'' she notes, ``more than the metal of the
fork.''

COMING HOME TO LANDSCAPES ACROSS AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN W. WINKS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Places are primary documents of the American character. The best
detective fiction testifies to this thought, rooting crimes and
criminals in recognizable environments. Such books are as far from
fantasy and science fiction as one can get. Living abroad this
year, I find no need for Big Macs, a Dunkin' Donut, or intelligible
wiring, but every now and then I need to come home to the American
landscape _ its long reaches, its flats and curves, its hills and
dusty towns. I need to revisit places I believe I know.
</P>
<P>
   No one is better at the literary equivalent of a road movie than
Thomas Perry, and ``Blood Money'' (Random House, $24.95) shows
perfectly all his many strengths and his few weaknesses. Perry once
taught literature at the University of California; then he wrote
one, and another, novel about a professional hit man who knew how
to disappear. For his sixth book, he brought all his talents
together _ an ability to make the reader feel ``right there,'' on
the streetcorner watching, in the back seat of the car listening; a
powerful sense of plot; an ear for how many different people speak;
an eye for the turn in the road, not this one but the next one _
and created Jane Whitefield. She is a Native American who has been
a professional ``vanisher,'' a person who helps people disappear
when they must, from wife-beating husbands, from Mafia goons, from
the kind of hit man Perry once wrote of. ``Blood Money'' is the
fifth Jane Whitefield book, and for two-thirds of its length it is
better than any of the other four, and then for the last third
perhaps a little less good than any of them. It is still a
terrific, pell-mell book, as Jane tries to help a young and at
times foolish girl and a wise old man escape from entire teams of
Mafia pursuers. The detail on how to create a new identity and how
to bury an old one is consistently intriguing and fresh; upper New
York State, Florida, Oregon, California, Ohio, and much in between
are wonderfully described; and if the breathless finish is just a
tad unconvincing, the book is a terrifying ride almost to the end.
</P>
<P>
   David Housewright, whose work I have not read before, is also
very good with place and voice, and in ``Dearly Departed'' (Norton,
$23.95) he sends his Minneapolis-based private eye, Holland Taylor,
into small-town Wisconsin to search for a woman who has
disappeared, leaving behind a tape for her lawyer that begins, ``If
you are listening to this now, it is because I am dead.''
Housewright follows the usual formula _ we watch the investigator
search _ where Perry reverses it, making us watch the pursued
looking over their shoulders. Read together, the two books tell us
much about identity and how easily its surface attributes can be
constructed in America. Native Americans figure in Housewright's
plot too, though in quite a different way.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Slickrock'' (St. Martin's, $22.95), Laura Crum writes a
low-key story of Gail McCarthy, veterinarian, who sets out into the
Sierra Nevada Mountains of California on a solitary pack trip.
There is much about horses, and horse sense, and what can go wrong
while on the trail, with some observations about human
relationships woven in.
</P>
<P>
   Les Standiford also takes us into the high valleys, this time in
the Grand Tetons of Wyoming, in ``Black Mountain'' (Putnam,
$23.95). A presidential candidate who wants to look like an
environmentalist, along with his wife and entourage of mostly city
types, is taken by air to the back of beyond for a river float. The
plane that is to come back for them explodes on takeoff, and the
group must face trekking out. The reader knows from the first page
that there are forces out there in the wilderness determined that
they will not survive. Standiford does a fine job with these
ingredients, effectively reworking the tradition of the ``and then
there were none'' plot (indeed, referring to ``Ten Little Indians''
midway through).
</P>
<P>
   Still, all those rural scenes, those mountain passes, those
one-light towns, do make one long for the bright lights of the
city, and for such a longing, the best cure is an Ed McBain 87th
Precinct book. ``The Last Dance'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) is the
50th installment in this series, and though the title, and a hint
here and there, might suggest that McBain is about done _ having
written 90 books, 20 of them as Evan Hunter, since 1952 _ I hope
the hints are misleading, for he is as good as ever. Here the 87th
Precinct team investigates a suicide that (surprise!) soon proves
to have been murder and, in the patented McBain way, produces a
near-surprise in the last pages. This is Isola, for which read New
York City, perfectly spoken.

   Bears, otters and a raptor rehab await you
</P>
<P>
   By Eric Noland, Travel Editor
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're inclined to climb aboard a tour bus, boat or
helicopter, or just wander aimlessly through a settlement on the
edge of the American wildnerness, shore excursions on Alaska
cruises offer myriad possibilities for passengers itching to
stretch their legs -- or widen their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   On a Holland America cruise last September, the ship's port
calls yielded plenty of delights.
</P>
<P>
   --Ketchikan
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the hardscrabble communities along Alaska's
southeastern coastal stretch, Ketchikan has eked out a living with
the help of a series of enterprises through history: the Juneau
gold rush, salmon fishing and canning, the Klondike gold rush,
timber harvest ... and the cruise-industry green rush.
</P>
<P>
   A visitors information center is positioned just a few steps
from the gangway, and on my visit it was manned by no fewer than a
dozen guides, hawking a smorgasbord of tours: totem park, fishing,
flightseeing, kayaking, trolley, city, helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my ship tablemates raved about a trip to nearby Misty
Fjords National Monument (it was supposed to be by float plane;
poor visibility forced the tour operator to switch to a boat).
</P>
<P>
   Ketchikan has plenty of attractions for foot travelers, too.
Most head straight for Creek Street, once the town's notorious
red-light district now a cluster of souvenir stores clinging to the
upslope of Ketchikan Creek. It flourished from 1903 clear into the
'50s, and at its peak during World War II, 33 houses of
prostitution operated here.
</P>
<P>
   During Prohibition, bootleggers moored their boats amid the
stilts of the establishments and delivered their hootch through
trap doors in the floor.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this touristy village is a red funicular
</P>
<P>
   it's free that climbs the steep mountain to the Westmark Cape
Fox Lodge. There, you'll get a great view of the town and your
cruise ship docked below, but if you want a photograph, don't shoot
through the smudged windows of the lodge. Head out the front door,
circle to the right and scramble down a slope to the wide gravel
ledge behind the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, seek out the staircase that descends to Park Avenue,
then turn right for the easy walk to the Deer Mountain Tribal
Hatchery (admission $6.95). The non-profit operation, run by three
area tribes, exists to enhance the natural fishery, which is under
threat from such factors as pollution and overfishing by Pacific
Rim nations, according to guide Aaron Burton.
</P>
<P>
   The facility is also a sanctuary for bald eagles. There were two
grounded birds there last fall -- a male who required a wing
amputation after being shot at by a hunter and a female who
couldn't fully extend a wing after flying into a power line.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Ketchikan should include a stop at the Tongass
Historical Museum (629 Dock St., not far from Creek Street;
admission is only $2). It is tiny and unassuming but has some real
treasures in it, including a fascinating array of old
black-and-white photos from the town's frontier past.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pictures, from 1909, showed three cigar-smoking young
men posing next to their Christmas tree in a one-room cabin. The
tree was decorated with no exaggeration beer bottles, coffee cups,
hardtack biscuits, kitchen utensils and fish.
</P>
<P>
   --Juneau
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a state capital, the hub of government for a region of
more than 656,000 square miles, that is not reachable by car. This
is Juneau, an isolated community along Alaska's coast, hemmed in by
ice fields and islands.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to achieve an overview of the city, the
cruise dock and Gastineau Channel is to hop aboard the Mount
Roberts Tramway -- only 4 years old for the steep climb to a
precipitious overlook (cost is about $20 for adults, $11 for
children 12 and under).
</P>
<P>
   At the top are nature trails, a theater showing a film on native
culture, a gift shop and dining facilities. If you're feeling
ambitious, ask for directions to the trail that winds through lush
forest on a descent back to town. Make plenty of noise if you
choose this route, though; these woods are thick with bears.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular nature excursions from Juneau is a
helicopter ride to nearby glaciers. The crafts will land on the ice
field and let you walk around (costs range from about $125 to $200
per pers duration of tour). Undertake this trip advisedly, though.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, a sightseeing helicopter crashed on Herbert Glacier,
killing the pilot and all six cruise-ship tourists on board. In A
tourists and a pilot walked away from a small-plane crash landing
on Mendenhall Glacier. In September, just days before my visit, a
sightseeing helicopter crash-landed on Herbert Glacier and two
rescue helicopters were forced down by poor visibility. Five
tourists, including a 72-year-old man from Irvine, had to spend a
night camped on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   --Sitka
</P>
<P>
   A journey up the Inside Passage probably wouldn't be complete
without at least some glimpses of marine wildlife, and 50,000-ton
cruise ships are not particularly well-suited to provide them.
</P>
<P>
   In Sitka, a three-hour excursion booked with Sea Otter &AMP;
Wildlife Quest yielded quite a bounty. (The tour, booked through
Holland pricey at $104 about twice what counterparts charge in
Hawaii.)
</P>
<P>
   The tour boat, a 65-foot, double-deck catamaran, picked up
cruise passengers at the ship, which moors in the harbor because
Sitka's dock can only accommodate small craft.
</P>
<P>
   As we putted around the many islands of Sitka Sound, we got a
close-up look at about a dozen humpback whales, diving for shrimp
and other delicacies in their summer visit to Alaska. We spotted
harbor seals lounging on rocks -- they possess a remarkable
capacity for blending in with the bird-dung stains. We saw sea
otters, including one that floated on its back near the boat,
prying open a Gaper clam as big as a salad plate.
</P>
<P>
   There were also Steller sea lions, bald eagles -- both nesting
and in full flight -- and cormorants diving deeply for fish.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of binoculars was provided at every seat. The upstairs
deck was partially covered for rain protection and warmth. And the
open area of the upper deck was interlaced with aluminum railings,
which w boat rocked in the swells of the sound.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's tourist-dependent coastal communities don't miss a
trick: Upon completion of the tour, we were dropped at Sitka's dock
r returned to the ship. So even if you were planning on going
ashore in a launch, make sure you take your land-tour items with
you on the wildlife boat.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1800s, Russia established a settlement here,
proceeding to battle the local Tlingits to a standoff but utterly
routi population. Remnants of the Russian presence remain, notably
the onion domes of St. Michael's Cathedral. The original Russian
Orthodox church was claimed by a fire; this is a faithful copy,
built in the also Russian dance performances (check with your
cruise line in advance to see if your port call will coincide with
a show).
</P>
<P>
   For exposure to the other faction in the conflict, follow
Lincoln Street to Sitka National Historic Park, where the Tlingits'
struggle with the Russians is documented and totems dot a wooded
walking path.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular stop is the Alaska Raptor Rehabilitation Center,
on Sawmill Creek Road, where injured eagles, hawks, falcons and
owls are cared for.

   There are still remnants of Russia's presence in Alaska in the
1800s. At Sitka, the restored St. Michael's Cathedral is topped
with onion domes. The Russians waged a bitter conflict with the
local Tlingits.
</P>
<P>
   (TRVL AKcruise 11)

   Creek Street is popular with visitors to Ketchikan. The former

LIVESEY'S EVIL WEARS FAMILIAR FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE MISSING WORLD 
By Margot Livesey. Knopf. 
327 pp. $23. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the finest fear-practitioners from Poe to Hitchcock, the
Scottish-born writer Margot Livesey knows that the creepiest
moments of life generally insert themselves into an ordinary day:
The sun is shining in what appears to be a relatively benign
universe, then something wicked walks in wearing penny loafers and
a crooked grin. This conceit governed Livesey's acclaimed 1996
novel, ``Criminals,'' and it hovers throughout ``The Missing
World,'' which manages to be delicate and terrifying at once.
</P>
<P>
   For what if the world as we thought we knew it turns out to be a
fraud? The internal laws of our own life stories _ our narratives
built from memory and experience _ are the banisters to which we
all cling. Certainly Hazel Ransome's wintry afternoon seemed
unspectacular enough, until a car speeding through snowy North
London knocked her over in a pedestrian crossing. Hours later,
she's carried to hospital suffering from seizures and on her way to
a coma, with her estranged boyfriend, Jonathan Littleton, hovering
by her side. Hazel's parents rush to her bed, as does her best
friend, Maud, with Jonathan doing his part to orchestrate her
rehabilitation. But as Hazel makes her way out of a neurological
fog, the medical mystery surrounding her condition is matched by
the hauntingly missing synapses of her past. Who are these people
standing around her, this gentle, aging couple who seem so
concerned? ``Jonathan,'' she whispers upon waking, reaching out for
the man who loves her _ or is she uttering something far darker, a
warning from a yesterday she can't retrieve?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Missing World'' is a modern-day ``Rebecca,'' a
psychological suspense story handled with acumen and a riveting
sense of timing, but the real dazzle of the novel lies in its
structure. We learn the necessary facts about Hazel and Jonathan
from neutral sources: Jonathan's initial transfer of information to
medical personnel, say, or his advice to her parents about her
fragility, or conversations with his boss at the insurance company
where he works as a claims adjuster. We know that Hazel is a 30ish
freelance journalist; that she and Jonathan _ who've been living
together for four years _ had been quarreling before the accident,
and that Hazel had recently taken a sublet across town. We know
Maud adores her and that her parents think Jonathan, with his
buttoned-down ways, has been a good influence. What we don't know
are the same things Hazel doesn't know, which include most of the
emotional nuances and truths of the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Enter, stage right and loudly, Charlotte Granger, an unemployed
actress and irredeemable screw-up who happens to be the sister of
one of Hazel's nurses. Slightly further afield, at least
geographically, is Freddie Adams, a black American who has found
peaceful anonymity from a troubled past by living a downscale life
abroad. Having fled a brilliant career in Silicon Valley along with
some bad memories, Freddie found his talents best served by
carrying stretchers at Lourdes _ this is a man whose heart is great
but amorphous, and who thus needs desperately to exist in relation
to others' needs. Six degrees of separation are the outer edges of
coincidence in this novel; everybody's paths cross mischievously
and often, so it's only a matter of synchronicity before Freddie
winds up repairing Jonathan's roof and Charlotte winds up reading
to Hazel, who is recuperating at home. Or home is what Jonathan has
called it, at any rate: Spotting Hazel's amnesia as his golden
second chance, Jonathan has gone about reconstructing her immediate
past with the skills of an architect _ one who specializes, it
should be added, in castles in the air.
</P>
<P>
   For Jonathan is demonic, or at least capable of being so, and we
discover this with the same growing dread as does his invalid
prisoner. Livesey titrates revelations about her characters with
ominous control; she also uses a prismatic point of view to
wonderful effect. We meet, for instance, the woman who lives next
door to Jonathan, a Mrs. Craig _ who seems dowdy and agreeable and
a bit of a pest. Then Freddie befriends her, and we realize that
Mrs. Craig is a very cool lady who's been in her ashram-like house
meditating; she's also no slouch when it comes to looking out for
Hazel. It was through Jonathan's eyes that we were imagining the
woman; Livesey, with formidable subtlety, is able to pull off this
kind of chameleon shift without an artifice in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, these are not merely one-act characters: Charlotte,
who spends most of her waking days trying to avoid the messes she
wrought the day before, even emerges as something of a reluctant
heroine when the stars are in the right position. (Driving this
point home is the tantalizingly enigmatic Mr. Early, a set designer
and Charlotte's old teacher, who acts as traffic cop for the
novel's entire cast.) So while Jonathan has given Hazel what he
perceives as ``the illusion of choice,'' Livesey's people seem to
trip and stumble their way toward the light _ wanting to be good a
lot of the time, realizing too late that fine intentions are often
only an arrow shot in the air. ``You can't change back,'' Hazel
remembers shouting at Jonathan during a row; the news in this
novel, both good and bad, is that you can.
</P>
<P>
   There are disappointments in ``The Missing World,'' most of them
because Livesey has set her hurdles enviably high. One female
betrayal in particular, which I won't give away, seems
ill-conceived. Jonathan's original sin couldn't possibly live up to
our projections about his horrid possibilities. And a few too many
metaphors _ which, like the characters, roam about charged with
happenstance _ converge somewhat blatantly at the end to make their
point. But like the Greeks who discovered the mnemonic link between
spatial reality and information retrieval, Livesey has built here
an imaginary palace that serves well as an ode to memory. And she
has made me as fond of Charlotte and Freddie _ endlessly tripping
over curbs or their own feet _ as I am frightened of Jonathan
Littleton. Perhaps most remarkable, she has opened the door to a
stranger's knock and looked into the face of meanness _ a hapless
guy who's a bit short of breath, who looks just like someone
everybody knows.

!!!! ``Mr. Death'' Errol Morris takes on execution technology and
Holocaust denial in the person of Fred Leuchter Jr., a self-taught
``execution technologist'' from Malden whose profitable career as a
death-house fixer-upper crashed when he went to bat in court for a
Canadian Holocaust denier. As with all of Morris's films, the word
documentary doesn't adequately describe this one. It's as much a
fascinatingly reverberant meditation on self-delusion. (PG-13) 
 
!! ``Eye of the Beholder'' Potentially interesting but ultimately
failed psychological thriller that can't pull its ambitious _ and
ambitiously photographed _ plot strands together. Ewan McGregor and
Ashley Judd star, he as an unhinged British high-tech security
voyeur, she as a murderess he feels obliged to protect, whether
she's his long-lost daughter (as he imagines) or not. (R) 
 
!!! ``Isn't She Great'' The life and times of ``Valley of the
Dolls'' novelist Jacqueline Susann and her huckster husband, Irving
Mansfield _ belted out warmly, knowingly, gleamingly, and
entertainingly (as biopic fairy tales go) by Bette Midler and
Nathan Lane. Savvy troupers both, they affectionately genuflect to
the rambunctious bygone world of Broadway as they zoom from wannabe
status to shagadelic high life. (R)

MARC ANTHONY FINDS A BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The firestorm of Latin pop is cooling off, as red-hot trends
invariably do. Enrique Iglesias is slipping down the charts. So is
Jennifer Lopez. Ricky Martin is nowhere to be found _ neither on
the radio nor gracing the magazine covers that were so recently
plastered with his 1,000-watt smile. The media, and the fans, are
looking elsewhere for the next big thing.
</P>
<P>
   And Marc Anthony is quietly, possibly even unwittingly, making
his move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weird moment,'' says Anthony, on the phone from his
apartment in New York City. ``I Need to Know,'' the first single
from Anthony's self-titled English-language debut, is No. 9 on the
Billboard Hot 100 after 21 weeks on the charts, nestled comfortably
between Top 10 regulars Celine Dion and Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A worldwide salsa star for the past eight years but a newcomer
to the pop mainstream, Anthony is ambivalent about the so-called
Latin craze in music. ``No one should be seen by their ethnic
background first,'' says Anthony, who is gracious to a fault, but
willing to speak his mind. ``I feel too caught in that. People
think it's calculated. So many people are getting it so wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the great irony of the last, incredible year in Latin pop
that Anthony, 30, got lost in the shuffle. Maybe it's dumb luck and
bad timing; Anthony's album was delayed by his participation in a
film project (Martin Scorsese's ``Bringing Out the Dead'') and
legal haggling with his former record company. Maybe it's fate:
Anthony's been trailing in Ricky Martin's wake since they were
teenagers. Martin became a phenom in the Puerto Rican bubblegum
group Menudo; Anthony wrote songs and sang backup for them. Last
February, both were Spanish-language successes with forthcoming
English releases. Martin was invited to sing on the Grammys and
gave a vivacious performance that anointed him crown prince of the
Latin explosion; Anthony won a Grammy during the prebroadcast
segment.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a beefcake in black leather with twitchy hips is an
easier pitch than a skinny guy in glasses who falls to his knees in
a fever of song. But even on an album saturated with overblown
power ballads, Anthony's got the ardent soul of a salsa singer and
the voice of an angel. Note for note, phrase for itchy, liquid
phrase, Marc Anthony's sheer musicality reduces Ricky Martin, by
comparison, to a well-buffed marionette. &QL; 
 &QL; 
No rivalry &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anthony swears he bears no animosity. ``There is no competition
at all,'' he says. ``Ricky or Jennifer (whom Anthony used to date)
could be No. 1 for the rest of their lives. It won't make me any
less proud of who I've become.''
</P>
<P>
   As well it shouldn't. Anthony is the youngest of eight children
born to Puerto Rican immigrants; his father, a composer and
musician, hosted regular jam sessions that eventually grew to
revolve around his young son's formidable singing. In 1992 Anthony
``jumped into salsa'' and has since released three stellar albums
in that genre. Lots of people saw him as the one shining light in
the short-lived production of Paul Simon's 1998 musical ``The
Capeman.'' Simon, who handpicked Anthony to play the title role,
has compared him to Sinatra. The admiration is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was in Harvard for three years, working under
him,'' says Anthony, who grew up in Spanish Harlem. ``To be
welcomed wholeheartedly into his world, . . . how lucky I have
been. All I can say is I set out to learn.'' Of the show's quick
demise, Anthony only remarks, ``I can't say disappointment in the
same sentence with `Capeman.' '' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anthony has been doubly blessed with mentors, and he seems
genuinely humbled by the talented people he has had the good
fortune to cross paths with. At 15, he went on tour as water boy
with the legendary Panamanian musician and actor Ruben Blades, and
the relationship blossomed into a lifelong friendship. ``Ruben has
taught me so much _ as a musician, yes, but also as a man, as a
human being. He showed me by example.'' Serendipitously, Blades was
cast in the adult role of Anthony's ``Capeman'' character, Salvador
Agron. ``It was poetic,'' Anthony says.
</P>
<P>
   Blades was the one who encouraged Anthony to make the leap into
the Anglo market _ a move supported by Sony Music chairman Tommy
Mottola, who signed the singer to a bilingual multirecord deal
worth more than $30 million. ``You know, this is music that I would
buy,'' Anthony says of the mainstream, heavily MOR style on his
English-language album. ``I grew up listening to Air Supply and
Gloria Gaynor. It's my music. Had I had more African influences,
I'm sure it would have shown up,'' Anthony says, a discreet barb
aimed at those who've criticized him for not including more Latin
flavors on the album. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ethnic advantage &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's no denying that Anthony's ethnic heritage has been
an advantage in the current Latin-pop boom. ``It disturbs me to
even think about it, that I might have been accepted because I'm
Latin and not by the merit of my music,'' Anthony insists. ``I'm
glad that Latinos in general feel like this might be their chance
to express themselves, but I beg them not to do it because it's a
chic thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, as passionate in his opinions as in his singing, is
extraordinarily proud of his pop album. He bristles at how many
have misunderstood him, and his music. ``I'm Puerto Rican, but
(itals)I'm from New York(unitals),'' Anthony pronounces in clear,
measured tones. ``I've done so many interviews where people say,
`Wow, you speak English so well!' They ask `What do you think of
American women?' That is disturbing, to feel like an outsider in
your backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost in the same breath, Anthony describes himself as
``extremely fulfilled.'' He spends as much time as he can with his
5-year-old daughter from a relationship that's ended, and recently
announced his engagement to former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres,
whom he met in San Juan last winter. Last month Anthony released
``Desde un Principio / From the Beginning,'' a compilation of salsa
tracks from his first three albums, to excellent reviews. He has
finally achieved, he says, a great sense of musical and personal
balance. ``I'm doing pop and I'm doing salsa. I can do both. I am
both. And it's like a great weight has been lifted off my
shoulders.''

SURVIVING THE URGE TO CALL HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emma Bovary sighs. She weeps. Rodolphe, the love of her life,
has deserted her. She must have him or die.
</P>
<P>
   What's this?
</P>
<P>
   A book has arrived in the post. ``Don't Call That Man! A
Survival Guide to Letting Go.''
</P>
<P>
   Emma doesn't recall requesting this book. Yet the author's oddly
euphonious name, Rhonda Findling, resonates. Did she perhaps write
any of those forbidden romantic novels Emma devoured so many years
ago at her convent school?
</P>
<P>
   Emma has time to kill. She opens the book and reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheila, an attractive 27-year-old computer programmer, sat in
her apartment staring at the telephone. She yearned to call Tony, a
handsome life insurance agent she had been dating for the past six
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh Sheila, I know your pain, thinks Emma, I, too, yearn to call
the man I love, even though the telephone won't be invented for
another 40 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   Emma reads on and learns that Sheila's heart sank when Tony said
he didn't ``see himself'' marrying her.
</P>
<P>
   Cruel Tony! Cruel Rodolphe!
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Sheila felt alone and desperate. She wanted to be with
Tony on any terms. . . she couldn't bear the thought of life
without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Emma feels faint and throws herself onto a nearby divan.
However, just prior to falling into a serious swoon, she picks up
the book again and turns to another chapter. After answering a
series of probing questions posed by the author, Emma comes to
realize that she has turned to Rodolphe, a classic ``ambivalent
man'' type, because she is the victim of inadequate fathering.
</P>
<P>
   I am a victim, says Emma to herself. I have always suspected as
much. She reads on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there is a loss, you have to feel the pain of the
loss,'' Rhonda Findling advises.
</P>
<P>
   Emma learns that she must get in touch with her grief and give
herself permission to experience her pain. She howls and weeps and
rolls on the Turkish carpet and beats her tiny fists against the
cold, hard plaster walls.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour or so of refusing to deny her pain, Emma feels
much better. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   Emma turns once again to the book and reads about the crucial
importance of having a network of understanding friends. She
decides to start a ``Don't Call That Man!'' support group for
literary figures in similar straits. Anna Karenina is the first to
join. Tess Durbeyfield comes around, and brings Scarlett O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hester Prynne wanted to be here but she couldn't get a
sitter,'' Tess tells Emma.
</P>
<P>
   Together they work through the ``Don't Call That Man!'' 10-step
program. Step nine, they all agree, is the most difficult. It
requires each of them to keep an hour-by-hour diary describing any
urges they may have to call their former lovers and how they manage
to resist calling. They all agree that the total lack of telephones
makes not calling a lot easier than it might be otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Emma and Anna, Tess and Scarlett consider Findling's suggestions
for self-nurturing. This is a very important part of the healing
process, Findling writes. Go to Paris. Get your hair done. Go
shopping. Go to concerts. Go off your diet and eat desserts all day
long. Go to the movies. They decide to do it all, even go to the
movies, as soon as someone invents them.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Emma has an idea. ``Let's get a literary agent and
write no-holds-barred, tell-all memoirs for big money,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And so they do, and they live happily ever after.

bracing for a second setback at the hands of Vice President Al
Gore, looks to later primaries to rescue his faltering campaign. By

<P>
   `ONE HUNDRED, TWO HUNDRED MILLION ...' On the topic of the
upcoming census, two projections are meaningful, writes columnist
Raoul Lowery Contreras. One is that the number of seniors will
increase significantly _ from the present 34.6 million to 82
million in 2050. The Census Bureau also projects that the number of
immigrants will increase to 53.8 million in 2050, from 26 million
today. The combination of immigrants and young Hispanics will be of
huge value to an America with a median age of 40. In other words,
the work force will be made up mostly of Hispanics and immigrants.
Blacks, Asians and non-Hispanic whites will be minority segments of
the work force, Contreras writes.
</P>
<P>
   FORGOTTEN FAMILY VALUES. ``In a better world, this titanic
battle over the fate of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez would have ended
long ago,'' writes columnist Juan Gonzalez. ``There is no contest
in this custody battle. Grandmothers ... are the central figures of
every Latino family. They ... care for the youngest children when
their parents go off to work, pamper them with affection while the
parents stumble through life and provide them solace and comfort
when the parents separate, divorce or die,'' he adds. In this
commentary, Gonzalez denounces the actions of Elian's U.S.
relatives and discusses why he feels Elian should be sent back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   40 ACRES AND A MULE PLUS INTEREST. ``It's the year 2000 and we
are still discussing the same thing we did in 1865 _ reparations
for African-Americans,'' writes columnist Akilah Monifa. It's not
that the discussion has been constant for the past 135 years. On
the contrary, we spend most of our time refusing to discuss the
issue. Since 1989, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich) has introduced a
bill every legislative session to establish a commission to examine
slavery and its lingering effects on African-Americans and
contemporary U.S. society. The organization, comprised of
historians, legal scholars, genealogists, economists and lawmakers,
would start the conversation over reparations by asking a few key
questions: (1) Should the U.S. government issue a formal apology
for sanctioning slavery? and (2) Is a debt owed to the descendants
of slaves who helped build this country without compensation? In
this commentary, Monifa explains why such a commission should be
instituted.

   WHAT'S AT STAKE IN CALIFORNIA'S ANTI-GAY PROP. 22. Fourteen
words in Proposition 22 could change state law, triggering a
national backlash against gay civil rights: ``Only marriage between
a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.'' With
public opinion holding steady; campaign war chests overflowing; and
politicians, celebrities and interest groups lining up to oppose
it, Prop. 22 has become the major gay civil-rights battleground of
the primary season, writes columnist Chuck Colbert. If it passes,
what's at stake? Recent gains in gay civil rights, including
lesbian and gay parenting and adoption rights, domestic-partnership
registrations, health-insurance benefits and anti-discrimination
laws.

   SPOTLIGHT ON ... OSCAR DE LA RENTA. What is Oscar de la Renta's
favorite book? What does he like most about his job? What is his
most recent accomplishment? What does he feel is the most pressing
issue that Hispanic-Americans face? These are just a few of the
questions we asked this international clothing designer in this
original entertainment feature from New America News Service.

   The breakdown ...
</P>
<P>
   `ONE HUNDRED, TWO HUNDRED MILLION ...' On the topic of the
upcoming census, two projections are meaningful, writes columnist
Raoul Lowery Contreras. One is that the number of seniors will
increase significantly _ from the present 34.6 million to 82
million in 2050. The Census Bureau also projects that the number of
immigrants will increase to 53.8 million in 2050, from 26 million
today. The combination of immigrants and young Hispanics will be of
huge value to an America with a median age of 40. In other words,
the work force will be made up mostly of Hispanics and immigrants.
Blacks, Asians and non-Hispanic whites will be minority segments of
the work force, Contreras writes.
</P>
<P>
   FORGOTTEN FAMILY VALUES. ``In a better world, this titanic
battle over the fate of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez would have ended
long ago,'' writes columnist Juan Gonzalez. ``There is no contest
in this custody battle. Grandmothers ... are the central figures of
every Latino family. They ... care for the youngest children when
their parents go off to work, pamper them with affection while the
parents stumble through life and provide them solace and comfort
when the parents separate, divorce or die,'' he adds. In this
commentary, Gonzalez denounces the actions of Elian's U.S.
relatives and discusses why he feels Elian should be sent back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   40 ACRES AND A MULE PLUS INTEREST. ``It's the year 2000 and we
are still discussing the same thing we did in 1865 _ reparations
for African-Americans,'' writes columnist Akilah Monifa. It's not
that the discussion has been constant for the past 135 years. On
the contrary, we spend most of our time refusing to discuss the
issue. Since 1989, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich) has introduced a
bill every legislative session to establish a commission to examine
slavery and its lingering effects on African-Americans and
contemporary U.S. society. The organization, comprised of
historians, legal scholars, genealogists, economists and lawmakers,
would start the conversation over reparations by asking a few key
questions: (1) Should the U.S. government issue a formal apology
for sanctioning slavery? and (2) Is a debt owed to the descendants
of slaves who helped build this country without compensation? In

   The breakdown ...
</P>
<P>
   `ONE HUNDRED, TWO HUNDRED MILLION ...' On the topic of the
upcoming census, two projections are meaningful, writes columnist
Raoul Lowery Contreras. One is that the number of seniors will
increase significantly _ from the present 34.6 million to 82
million in 2050. The Census Bureau also projects that the number of
immigrants will increase to 53.8 million in 2050, from 26 million
today. The combination of immigrants and young Hispanics will be of
huge value to an America with a median age of 40. In other words,
the work force will be made up mostly of Hispanics and immigrants.
Blacks, Asians and non-Hispanic whites will be minority segments of
the work force, Contreras writes.

   FORGOTTEN FAMILY VALUES. ``In a better world, this titanic
battle over the fate of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez would have ended
long ago,'' writes columnist Juan Gonzalez. ``There is no contest
in this custody battle. Grandmothers ... are the central figures of
every Latino family. They ... care for the youngest children when
their parents go off to work, pamper them with affection while the
parents stumble through life and provide them solace and comfort
when the parents separate, divorce or die,'' he adds. In this
commentary, Gonzalez denounces the actions of Elian's U.S.
relatives and discusses why he feels Elian should be sent back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   40 ACRES AND A MULE PLUS INTEREST. ``It's the year 2000 and we
are still discussing the same thing we did in 1865 _ reparations
for African-Americans,'' writes columnist Akilah Monifa. It's not
that the discussion has been constant for the past 135 years. On
the contrary, we spend most of our time refusing to discuss the
issue. Since 1989, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich) has introduced a
bill every legislative session to establish a commission to examine
slavery and its lingering effects on African-Americans and
contemporary U.S. society. The organization, comprised of
historians, legal scholars, genealogists, economists and lawmakers,
would start the conversation over reparations by asking a few key
questions: (1) Should the U.S. government issue a formal apology
for sanctioning slavery? and (2) Is a debt owed to the descendants
of slaves who helped build this country without compensation? In
this commentary, Monifa explains why such a commission should be
instituted.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S AT STAKE IN CALIFORNIA'S ANTI-GAY PROP. 22. Fourteen
words in Proposition 22 could change state law, triggering a
national backlash against gay civil rights: ``Only marriage between
a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.'' With
public opinion holding steady; campaign war chests overflowing; and
politicians, celebrities and interest groups lining up to oppose
it, Prop. 22 has become the major gay civil-rights battleground of
the primary season, writes columnist Chuck Colbert. If it passes,
what's at stake? Recent gains in gay civil rights, including
lesbian and gay parenting and adoption rights, domestic-partnership
registrations, health-insurance benefits and anti-discrimination
laws.

   SPOTLIGHT ON ... OSCAR DE LA RENTA. What is Oscar de la Renta's
favorite book? What does he like most about his job? What is his
most recent accomplishment? What does he feel is the most pressing
issue that Hispanic-Americans face? These are just a few of the
questions we asked this international clothing designer in this
original entertainment feature from New America News Service.

   &UR; KURT WARNER AS THE NEXT JOE MONTANA?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By RAY RATTO &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C.2000 San Francisco Examiner &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dick Vermeil, in a routine burst of hyperbole, said
before the NFC Championship Game that he thought Kurt Warner could
be the next Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   He was, of course, crazy. But not nearly as crazy now as he
seemed then.
</P>
<P>
   Warner is still three rings light, and he has not yet done
nearly enough to stroll into the Hall of Fame without so much as a
nominating speech. If you want to play the odds, figure that
Warner, the stock boy, the Iowa Barnstormer, the Amsterdam Admiral,
will never be the next Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Deny at your peril, though, the fact that he took a pretty
healthy stride toward the unreachable goal Sunday in Super Bowl
XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   His sensational performance against the Tennessee Titans Sunday,
and especially his winning touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce in St.
Louis' 23-16 victory, advances Vermeil's suggestion from idiotic to
merely highly implausible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,`` Warner said, his MVP Trophy already
stowed away for the flight back to St. Louis. ``But I know I always
had faith in Dick, because from Day One, when he gave me the
chance, I mean, I believed in him. Their belief in me was
tremendous. Having never played in a regular-season NFL game, and
handing the job over to me, that takes a lot of courage. They saw
something in me, I guess, that I could bring them to this level.``
</P>
<P>
   That's not entirely true, of course. They saw him as the backup
to Trent Green, and if truth be told, they didn't even see Green
leading them to the Super Bowl this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Warner provided all the setup with a brilliant regular
season that culminated in being named league MVP, and he trumped
all of it with Sunday's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Warner completed 24 of 45 throws for a Super Bowl-record 414
yards against the Titans, but the numbers aren't as eye-popping as
the fact that he did it without any discernible Rams running game,
or for that matter, any interest in developing one. He used his
passing game to set up more of his passing game, and when it looked
as though he had finally run out of a passing game, he gave America
one more glimpse of what could be in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   He had led the Rams up and down the Georgia Dome asphalt much of
the day, building a seemingly safe 16-0 lead, but the offense was
stopped cold midway through the third quarter, and Tennessee
rallied to tie the game on Al Del Greco's 43-yard field goal with
2:12 to play. The MVP Trophy was slipping away to Titans QB Steve
McNair, and as an added sidelight, so was the football game.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, though, is all about risk, and he was determined to stop
the Titans from holding the momentum they had just acquired. He
determined that, even from his own 27-yard line and with barely two
minutes left, the instrument of all the Rams' deliverance would be
Isaac Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd called a play earlier and they had told me Isaac could
beat (cornerback Denard Walker),`` Warner said. ``We knew we needed
a big play.``
</P>
<P>
   Bruce never said anything to Warner. ``When I talk in the
huddle, bad things seem to happen, so I keep quiet and let the
other guys do the talking.``
</P>
<P>
   He just ran his route, running an up and then cutting inside
Walker to make the catch on a slightly underthrown ball. He burst
past him and the other Tennessee defenders and sprinted freely the
final few yards to finish the 73-yard catch-and-run that won the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just saying we had two minutes left,`` Warner said of
the discussion in the huddle. ``We'd been moving the ball up and
down the field all day long, and there was no reason we couldn't do
it for two more minutes and put us in field-goal range.``
</P>
<P>
   To the Rams' great fortune, the field goal became moot in about
12 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In finishing one of the exemplary single seasons in NFL history
in such grand fashion, Warner now dares comparisons without meaning
to. He is not Montana yet, and is careful to make sure that you
know he doesn't think that way even now. Mathematically, he is only
25 percent of the way there, and Super Bowls get tougher after
you've had one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vermeil, the man everyone thought was crazy just for
returning to the NFL, is having an extra last laugh today. Kurt
Warner isn't there yet, but he also isn't done. The possibilities
are fascinating.

   INDEPENDENTS _ NEW HAMPSHIRE _ New Hampshire independents,
famous for making up their minds the week before the primary, cast
ballots today. With the polls narrowing for weeks, who knows if
they'll go for Gov. George W. Bush, whose camp admits he could
lose, or U.S. Sen. John McCain, who has been courting the
Independents? We talk with New Hampshire voters and gauge their
mood right down to the wire. (Heath, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   BAXTER-COLUMN _ Independents comprise about 37 percent of New
Hampshire's electorate, and an even larger share of its political
lore. But are they really the persnickity old New Englanders of
political stereotype, who vote regularly and steer their own
course? On closer inspection, it turns out the majority of New
Hampshire's independents are younger people who moved here recently
and don't care much about politics. The independents of legend do
exist, but overall New Hampshire's electorate may not be so unique.

   TAIWAN-CHIPS (Hsinchu, Taiwan) _ The assembly lines at Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing were running full tilt after midnight
last Sept. 21, when the floor suddenly began to rumble. A massive
earthquake had struck central Taiwan 60 miles south of here. But
the quake did little structural damage to the factories. The main
problem was the lack of electricity, which left Taiwan's largest
chip-maker becalmed at a time when worldwide demand for its
semiconductors was running at a fever pitch. For Morris Chang, the
founder and chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor, the solution was
obvious: he placed a call to Taiwan's prime minister, Vincent Siew,
to request that power be restored to Hsinchu as soon as possible.
Within three days the lights starting coming back on, and less than
10 days later, Taiwan Semiconductor's factories were humming at 95
percent of capacity. It is Chang's happy quandary to be caught in
one of the chip industry's periodic booms. After slumping for three
years in the late-1990s, demand for semiconductors rebounded in the
second half of 1999. That is due both to the end of the Asian
economic crisis and to the proliferation of new digital devices,
ranging from set-top boxes and video games to electronic organizers
and cellular phones. By Mark Landler.

   &UR; CIRCUMSCISION MAY PROTECT AGAINST HIV &LR;  &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Studies in AIDS-ravaged Africa have found that
people with very low levels of HIV in their blood are unlikely to
infect others _ suggesting that drug therapies or vaccines that
suppress the virus could significantly reduce its spread.
</P>
<P>
   The research also gives compelling evidence that circumcision
may be protecting many men from contracting the disease.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, surveys in the United States show that the
introduction of powerful AIDS drugs has made people less concerned
about HIV and, in some cases, led them to act more recklessly.
</P>
<P>
   The studies, presented here Sunday at the seventh Conference on
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, pointed up both the
promise and the pitfalls of antiretroviral therapy in the next
stage of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS has changed. It's not the same disease anymore,`` said
Kevin De Cock, former director of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention's division of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Surveillance
and Epidemiology. ``With the advent of highly active antiretroviral
therapy, it makes sense to focus on the infected population much
more in our prevention efforts.``
</P>
<P>
   The two African studies in Uganda and Zambia examined how
heterosexual couples infect one another. Although given counseling
and condoms, most continued to practice unsafe sex, and a large
percentage of people in each group became infected from their
partners.
</P>
<P>
   People whose partners had fewer than 1,500 copies of the virus
in their blood (according to standard measures) escaped infection.
As the volume of virus rose to as high as 50,000 copies, infection
rates rose dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Because expensive AIDS drugs are generally not available in
Africa, the differences in virus levels occurred naturally. It
remains to be shown conclusively that drug-induced reduction of
virus in the blood has the same effect, although many researchers
believe that it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our data provides a lot of hope,`` said Thomas Quinn of Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore, who led the Ugandan study.
</P>
<P>
   Besides antiretrovirals, the virus also may be suppressed by
vaccines, which would be cheaper and easier to administer in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   While low levels of virus in the blood usually mean the virus
also is low in semen, the correlation is not perfect. Michelle
Roland of UC-San Francisco said she knows of at least one woman who
was infected after unsafe sex with her partner, who was thought to
have an undetectable amount of virus in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Although antiretroviral drugs are notoriously difficult to take
and have many side effects, their existence already has led many
people in high-risk groups to drop their guard against HIV,
according to a new CDC survey.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll of 1,976 HIV-negative people in seven states, the
agency found that 31 percent said they were less concerned about
the disease, and 17 percent were less careful about drug and sexual
practices because of the therapies. The survey polled nearly equal
numbers of heterosexuals recruited from sexually transmitted
disease clinics, injection drug-users and gay men.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC's Stan Lehman, who presented the study, acknowledged
that it makes sense for people to be less worried about HIV because
of the drugs, but he remained concerned about behaviors. The survey
also found that among gay men, those less concerned about HIV were
having more unprotected receptive anal sex, the riskiest sexual
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another possible protection against HIV is getting
more attention among HIV researchers at the conference:
circumcision.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ugandan study of 415 couples, Quinn and his colleagues
found that none of the 50 men who were circumcised picked up the
virus no matter how much virus their partners had in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn called the finding highly provocative and said it has been
backed by other recent research that has yet to be published.
</P>
<P>
   ``In at least the high-risk individuals, circumcision could be
associated with a 40 percent reduction in transmission,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   The finding could partially account for why the disease has
spread so rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa, where circumcision rates
are low. It also could help explain why studies of female-to-male
transmission of HIV in the United States find that it is less
frequent here, where circumcision is common.
</P>
<P>
   The African studies found that men and women were equally likely
to transmit the virus to their heterosexual partners.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC's De Cock said he was skeptical of earlier data that
suggested circumcision helped protect against infection, but now he
has changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said the effect is biologically plausible because the
foreskin that is removed in circumcision is very soft and prone to
tiny lacerations that could allow the virus to enter the
bloodstream more easily.

<P>
   TAIWAN-CHIPS (Hsinchu, Taiwan) _ The assembly lines at Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing were running full tilt after midnight
last Sept. 21, when the floor suddenly began to rumble. A massive
earthquake had struck central Taiwan 60 miles south of here. But
the quake did little structural damage to the factories. The main
problem was the lack of electricity, which left Taiwan's largest
chip-maker becalmed at a time when worldwide demand for its
semiconductors was running at a fever pitch. For Morris Chang, the
founder and chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor, the solution was
obvious: he placed a call to Taiwan's prime minister, Vincent Siew,
to request that power be restored to Hsinchu as soon as possible.
Within three days the lights starting coming back on, and less than
10 days later, Taiwan Semiconductor's factories were humming at 95
percent of capacity. It is Chang's happy quandary to be caught in
one of the chip industry's periodic booms. After slumping for three
years in the late-1990s, demand for semiconductors rebounded in the
second half of 1999. That is due both to the end of the Asian
economic crisis and to the proliferation of new digital devices,
ranging from set-top boxes and video games to electronic organizers
and cellular phones. By Mark Landler.

<P>
   AUSTIN, TEXAS _ On the last Sunday in January, millions of
Americans anxiously gather around their television sets. Surrounded
by beer and snacks, including an estimated 8 million pounds (3.6
million kg) of guacamole, they watch a football game whose winner
is usually obvious by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Super Bowl audience has expanded beyond
America's borders, and 800 million people across the world will
watch this year's championship between the St. Louis Rams and the
Tennessee Titans, two teams short both on football tradition and
worldwide (not to mention national) appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping that at least the commercials are entertaining.
Yet if this year's Super Bowl contenders are not household names,
the National Football League (NFL) would not want it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the NFL has structured its business to create parity
among all 31 teams in the league, and this season came closest to
achieving that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Once-dismal teams from smaller cities made the play-offs,
whereas the league's powerhouses (such as the San Francisco 49ers
and the Dallas Cowboys) all had lackluster seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In most sports, teams from rich media markets have the edge over
those from backwaters. But in American football, teams share the
television revenues, worth $17.6 billion over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries are capped, new players are drafted so as to help the
worst teams, and ticket revenues are split 60:40 between home and
away teams, letting small teams share the big gates of the large
teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the Green Bay Packers, the team in the smallest
media market, had a better record than the New York Giants, a team
in the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Other sports are different. In major-league baseball, each team
negotiates its own local television contract. Owners in the larger
cities have huge broadcast and cable deals and have funnelled the
revenues into the team's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   All eight teams in last year's baseball play-offs ranked in the
top ten in terms of payroll. For the 2000 season, the Los Angeles
Dodgers will pay two players a combined $29 million, more than the
entire payrolls of seven other major-league teams.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting on Jan. 19, baseball owners voted to give the
league commissioner, Bud Selig, greater powers to restore the sport
to balance. Selig can now redistribute baseball's revenues from the
Internet to poorer clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Some see this as a step toward a revenue-sharing scheme like the
NFL's _ though that would need the nod of such skeptical ``big
market'' owners as Ted Turner and George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Is the NFL right?
</P>
<P>
   A more balanced league lowers ratings in the short run. The Rams
and Titans, this year's Super Bowl teams, play in the country's
21st and 30th largest television markets, which no doubt worries
advertisers who paid on average $2.2 million for a 30-second Super
Bowl slot.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Scully, who wrote a book called ``The Market Structure of
Sports'' (University of Chicago Press), points out that taxing
winners and compensating losers reduces the incentive to win. But
it does not eliminate it.
</P>
<P>
   Teams have other sources of revenue, such as promotion.
Moreover, revenue sharing also tends to create evenly matched
competitors, which may in the long run boost the popularity of the
sport. By helping to keep football teams in profit, the NFL
buttresses a national fan base.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Fort, an economist at Washington State University, thinks
the NFL's evenhandedness is hard to value, yet it may prove the
league's most important asset should other American sports continue
to face battles between the haves and the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   A franchise for a new football team in Houston was recently sold
for a record $700 million. This must reassure owners that dividing
the pie equally can still leave an enormous piece for each of them.
</P>
<P>
   As Art Modell, the owner of the Baltimore Ravens, once said of
the then 28 football-team owners: ``We're 28 Republicans, who all
vote socialist.'' &QL;

watch this year's championship between the St. Louis Rams and the
Tennessee Titans, two teams short both on football tradition and
worldwide (not to mention national) appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping that at least the commercials are entertaining.
Yet if this year's Super Bowl contenders are not household names,
the National Football League (NFL) would not want it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the NFL has structured its business to create parity
among all 31 teams in the league, and this season came closest to
achieving that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Once-dismal teams from smaller cities made the play-offs,
whereas the league's powerhouses (such as the San Francisco 49ers
and the Dallas Cowboys) all had lackluster seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In most sports, teams from rich media markets have the edge over
those from backwaters. But in American football, teams share the
television revenues, worth $17.6 billion over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries are capped, new players are drafted so as to help the
worst teams, and ticket revenues are split 60:40 between home and
away teams, letting small teams share the big gates of the large
teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the Green Bay Packers, the team in the smallest
media market, had a better record than the New York Giants, a team
in the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Other sports are different. In major-league baseball, each team
negotiates its own local television contract. Owners in the larger
cities have huge broadcast and cable deals and have funnelled the
revenues into the team's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   All eight teams in last year's baseball play-offs ranked in the
top ten in terms of payroll. For the 2000 season, the Los Angeles
Dodgers will pay two players a combined $29 million, more than the
entire payrolls of seven other major-league teams.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting on Jan. 19, baseball owners voted to give the
league commissioner, Bud Selig, greater powers to restore the sport
to balance. Selig can now redistribute baseball's revenues from the
Internet to poorer clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Some see this as a step toward a revenue-sharing scheme like the
NFL's _ though that would need the nod of such skeptical ``big
market'' owners as Ted Turner and George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Is the NFL right?
</P>
<P>
   A more balanced league lowers ratings in the short run. The Rams
and Titans, this year's Super Bowl teams, play in the country's
21st and 30th largest television markets, which no doubt worries
advertisers who paid on average $2.2 million for a 30-second Super
Bowl slot.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Scully, who wrote a book called ``The Market Structure of
Sports'' (University of Chicago Press), points out that taxing
winners and compensating losers reduces the incentive to win. But
it does not eliminate it.
</P>
<P>
   Teams have other sources of revenue, such as promotion.
Moreover, revenue sharing also tends to create evenly matched
competitors, which may in the long run boost the popularity of the
sport. By helping to keep football teams in profit, the NFL
buttresses a national fan base.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Fort, an economist at Washington State University, thinks
the NFL's evenhandedness is hard to value, yet it may prove the
league's most important asset should other American sports continue
to face battles between the haves and the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   A franchise for a new football team in Houston was recently sold
for a record $700 million. This must reassure owners that dividing
the pie equally can still leave an enormous piece for each of them.
</P>
<P>
   As Art Modell, the owner of the Baltimore Ravens, once said of
the then 28 football-team owners: ``We're 28 Republicans, who all
vote socialist.'' &QL;

&HT;     SCHOOL CUSTODIANS DOUBLE WAGES WITH OVERTIME PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some San Francisco school custodians have
doubled their salaries through overtime pay, earning more than top
administrators and 100 percent more than most teachers, an analysis
of school payroll records shows.
</P>
<P>
   The custodians frequently bill for more than 40 hours a week and
have signed off on each other's overtime pay, the records show.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond McQuoid, a former custodian who monitors school alarm
systems, earned $55,000 in overtime in the 1998-99 fiscal year,
making him the 14th-highest paid employee in the district with
income of more than $100,000. Former custodian Willie Green, who
also monitors school alarm systems, earned $43,000 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Custodians David Kwok and Ronny Lee increased their paychecks by
$45,000 and $30,000, respectively. The custodians and security
workers earn between $36,000 and $46,000 a year in regular pay.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis of the overtime records for the San Francisco
Unified School District shows that each of the four employees
logged more than 1,100 hours of overtime last year, with Kwok
earning an average of 72 hours of overtime each week for a month.
Of the school district's top 25 overtime earners, 14 work in
custodial services, either cleaning schools or handling security.
</P>
<P>
   Operating at a site across town from the school district
headquarters, custodial services charged nearly $300,000 in
overtime, $100,000 more than any other department.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, the overtime was charged when custodians and security
workers responded to school alarms at night and on weekends. Union
rules guarantee them a minimum of four hours of overtime pay when
they respond to an alarm after normal work hours. If they responded
to four alarms staggered throughout a Saturday, they could earn up
to 16 hours of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The overtime was paid at the same time the cash-strapped school
district was forced to cut $20 million from its budget, eliminating
elementary arts and an academic period for middle school and
halving its classes for gifted students. It also was handed out at
a time when teachers received a 5 percent raise, boosting a
starting teacher's salary to $31,172. After 24 years in the
district, teachers can earn $56,000, roughly the same amount that
one custodian earned in overtime alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd expect the superintendent to look into this, hold her
staff accountable and come up with a recommendation as to how to
better handle overtime,'' said Board of Education member Juanita
Owens. ``How do you put in that many hours when there are only so
many hours in the day? It's a serious question.''
</P>
<P>
   Board Vice President Frank Chong said he was ``deeply troubled''
by the overtime numbers but needs to carefully study the data
before passing judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure the priority of services goes into the
classroom,'' Chong said. ``This doesn't appear to be the case here.
If we go through this with a fine-tooth comb and determine that
there is runaway overtime, we need to put a stop to it
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The records, analyzed by the San Francisco Examiner, include the
overtime of every employee in San Francisco Unified, the
fifth-largest district in California. Although several departments,
notably facilities planning, accounting, school assignment and
budget management, logged significant overtime, custodial services
consistently racked up extensive overtime hours, the records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of that overtime is for security,'' said Martin
Escalante, whose 270 full-time custodial employees are responsible
for everything from school landscaping and window-washing to
security.
</P>
<P>
   The four men who reported more than 1,100 hours each of overtime
_ McQuoid, Green, Kwok and Lee _ rotate weekend security shifts,
with two on call two weekends per month, Escalante said. When an
alarm goes off at a school, the employee on call generally goes to
the school site to assess the situation, he said. Or the employee
may be called over the weekend by someone at a school who needs,
for example, bathrooms unlocked because of an athletic event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised by these numbers. I know they're up there.
There are documents to verify everything they're signing up for,''
said Escalante, who earns $80,000 per year as head of the
custodians.

<P>
   It feels inappropriate to use the phrase that is normal for such
moments during other election campaigns: ``they're off.''
</P>
<P>
   America's election campaigns seem never to have a proper
beginning, moving as they do from preparatory committees to
non-declarations to further fund-raising and on, at last, to
declarations.
</P>
<P>
   All this amid votes by what, to outsiders, seem bizarrely small
and unrepresentative groups of people, starting with the ``straw
poll'' in Iowa last August and, well, starting again with the Iowa
``caucuses'' this week, in which fewer than 180,000 people turned
out to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as is traditional, this small oddity in one of America's
least-populated states has carried the proud badge of being the
beginning of the campaign proper.
</P>
<P>
   And, though New Hampshire's vote next week will offer more solid
evidence of how the battle is proceeding, the results in Iowa do
offer that most crucial of assets _ or liabilities _ in a campaign,
namely a psychological advantage _ or disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   On that measure, however, the Iowa vote was a tad dispiriting.
Clear victories, and thus psychological advantages, were won by the
candidates who, for as much as two years, have always been the
nominees-presumptive, namely Al Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there were even signs after the vote that Gore and Bush
felt it was already time to train most of their fire on each other,
rather than on their Democratic and Republican rivals respectively.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling may change, amid the snows of New England. The hope
must be that it will. For the most interesting, and potentially
healthiest, battles are those between the nominees-presumptive and
their closest rivals, not between Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   An early defeat of Bill Bradley by Gore, and of John McCain by
Bush, would stifle at birth a debate that in any case has been
painfully stunted by the compression of the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, this would be a debate that put some of the big issues
of American public policy squarely in front of the public. One
would be health care, notably how to improve the care available to
America's 40 million uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, knowing the trouble President Bill Clinton got into on the
issue, would sooner play this down. The great advantage of
Bradley's prominence so far in the campaign has been to force
health care back on to the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, three issues stand to suffer if Bush
runs swiftly to victory. One is foreign policy, on which Bush
prefers vagueness while McCain speaks out in a more forthright way.
</P>
<P>
   Another is campaign finance, McCain's trademark issue, but one
the well-padded Bush (like Gore) would rather not examine too
closely.
</P>
<P>
   The third, and most prominent, is tax. The danger here is that
Bush may win too easily with an irresponsible policy _ and then get
stuck with it during the fight against Gore in the summer and
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   All Republicans seem to feel obliged to promise to cut taxes,
even though, with the economy steaming ahead, lower taxes are the
last thing America needs (unless they are financed by big cuts in
spending).
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tax plan is at least more responsible than Bush's. The
Republican front-runner has not, it seems, learned the lesson of
the 1986 Gramm-Rudman tax reform (which Senator Bradley supported):
that to simplify the tax code, eliminating loopholes and
distortions, is a higher and more valuable goal than mere cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Why not debate that in New Hampshire? &QL;

that to simplify the tax code, eliminating loopholes and
distortions, is a higher and more valuable goal than mere cuts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It feels inappropriate to use the phrase that is normal for such
moments during other election campaigns: ``they're off.''
</P>
<P>
   America's election campaigns seem never to have a proper
beginning, moving as they do from preparatory committees to
non-declarations to further fund-raising and on, at last, to
declarations.
</P>
<P>
   All this amid votes by what, to outsiders, seem bizarrely small
and unrepresentative groups of people, starting with the ``straw
poll'' in Iowa last August and, well, starting again with the Iowa
``caucuses'' this week, in which fewer than 180,000 people turned
out to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as is traditional, this small oddity in one of America's
least-populated states has carried the proud badge of being the
beginning of the campaign proper.
</P>
<P>
   And, though New Hampshire's vote next week will offer more solid
evidence of how the battle is proceeding, the results in Iowa do
offer that most crucial of assets _ or liabilities _ in a campaign,
namely a psychological advantage _ or disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   On that measure, however, the Iowa vote was a tad dispiriting.
Clear victories, and thus psychological advantages, were won by the
candidates who, for as much as two years, have always been the
nominees-presumptive, namely Al Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there were even signs after the vote that Gore and Bush
felt it was already time to train most of their fire on each other,
rather than on their Democratic and Republican rivals respectively.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling may change, amid the snows of New England. The hope
must be that it will. For the most interesting, and potentially
healthiest, battles are those between the nominees-presumptive and
their closest rivals, not between Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   An early defeat of Bill Bradley by Gore, and of John McCain by
Bush, would stifle at birth a debate that in any case has been
painfully stunted by the compression of the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, this would be a debate that put some of the big issues
of American public policy squarely in front of the public. One
would be health care, notably how to improve the care available to
America's 40 million uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, knowing the trouble President Bill Clinton got into on the
issue, would sooner play this down. The great advantage of
Bradley's prominence so far in the campaign has been to force
health care back on to the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, three issues stand to suffer if Bush
runs swiftly to victory. One is foreign policy, on which Bush
prefers vagueness while McCain speaks out in a more forthright way.
</P>
<P>
   Another is campaign finance, McCain's trademark issue, but one
the well-padded Bush (like Gore) would rather not examine too
closely.
</P>
<P>
   The third, and most prominent, is tax. The danger here is that
Bush may win too easily with an irresponsible policy _ and then get
stuck with it during the fight against Gore in the summer and
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   All Republicans seem to feel obliged to promise to cut taxes,
even though, with the economy steaming ahead, lower taxes are the
last thing America needs (unless they are financed by big cuts in
spending).
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tax plan is at least more responsible than Bush's. The
Republican front-runner has not, it seems, learned the lesson of
the 1986 Gramm-Rudman tax reform (which Senator Bradley supported):
that to simplify the tax code, eliminating loopholes and
distortions, is a higher and more valuable goal than mere cuts.

<P>
   For a few chaotic hours last weekend, Ecuador was gripped by the
kind of tragi-comic political drama that was commonplace in Latin
America a generation ago, but that many hoped lay in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Indian farmers joined a nationalist army colonel to seize the
Congress, proclaim a ``junta of national salvation,'' and force the
overthrow of Jamil Mahuad, the country's elected president.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces' commander at first joined the coup, but,
pressed by the United States, restored civilian government by
handing the presidency to Gustavo Noboa, the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   All's well that ends well? No.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, bloodshed was averted, and democratic appearances
have been preserved. Mahuad, decent but weak, was deeply unpopular.
Ecuadoreans' living standards have been devastated by disasters,
natural and financial.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to stabilize the economy were not helped by the IMF,
which first encouraged Ecuador to default on some of its debt, then
dallied over coming to its aid.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad's final, desperate, decision to junk Ecuador's sad sucre
and adopt the dollar infuriated the Indian protesters. But none of
that remotely justified his overthrow.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Ecuador has seen the first successful Latin American
military coup since Haiti's in 1991. It sets an ugly precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa, who has pledged to push ahead with dollarization, may for
a while fare better. But the armed forces are now clearly the
arbiters of Ecuador's political life.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they began to assume that role in 1997, when they
consented to the dismissal of another elected president, Abdala
Bucaram, though he had at least been (hastily) impeached by
Congress, for ``mental incapacity'' and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Ecuador's politics have long resembled a tropical
opera buffa. The country's deep regional cleavages exacerbate the
fragmentation of its party system, denying its presidents reliable
legislative majorities, and blocking all efforts at economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
   But Ecuador's coup comes on top of other recent setbacks to
Latin American democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, an autocratic president, Alberto Fujimori, is seeking a
third term, though all but his own lackeys hold this to be
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, once a coup leader and now an elected
president (admired by Ecuador's seditious colonel), has aroused
fears of dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   And Colombia's democratic government has turned to the United
States for massive military aid in an effort to control leftist
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits have started to write obituaries for Latin American
democracy. That is mistaken. Worrying as these setbacks are, they
need to be put in perspective. The authoritarian threat is largely
confined to the much-troubled Andean countries (and Paraguay).
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a contrary trend is at work. It involves the
strengthening of such democratic institutions as legislatures and
local government, at the expense of all-powerful presidents,
capable of decreeing market-opening reform from above.
</P>
<P>
   That may worry some investors, but it is encouraging a more
consensual kind of politics.
</P>
<P>
   To take two recent examples, in both Argentina and Mexico
governments lacking legislative majorities have approved austere
and responsible budgets with the support of some of their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries in the region, a military coup remains almost
unthinkable. Even so, Ecuador offers a warning.
</P>
<P>
   The severe recession that struck South America last year has
damaged, though not destroyed, the enthusiasm for both economic
reform and democratic government.
</P>
<P>
   That should not come as a surprise: only the naive ever thought
democracy would effortlessly flourish in countries that are still
mostly poor and unequal. The good news is that it is not about to
wither. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Take the bosses of the world's 1,000 largest companies,
accounting for four-fifths of world industrial output, and 33
national leaders, including the president of the United States.
Assemble them in a secluded Swiss ski resort, and then surround
them with gun-toting police.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that the annual meeting of the World Economic
Forum in Davos this week has become, to some, a sign that there is
a global economic conspiracy perpetrated by the white men in dark
suits who run the world's multinational corporations?
</P>
<P>
   Many people _ and not just the folk with ponytails and placards
who disrupted last December's meeting of the World Trade
Organization in Seattle _ now think of multinationals as more
powerful than nation states, and see them as bent on destroying
livelihoods, the environment, left-wing political opposition and
anything else that stands in the way of their profits.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is new. Three decades ago, multinationals were
already widely denounced as big, irresponsible, monopolistic
monsters.
</P>
<P>
   But they then went through a period of being sneered at as
yesterday's clumsy conglomerates, before being lauded in the 1990s
(including by Third-World leaders in Davos) as the bringers of
foreign capital, technology and know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now the hostility has returned. One explanation is the sheer
speed at which multinationals have recently expanded abroad. This
has made them the most visible aspect of globalization, buying some
local firms and driving others out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Even to rich, well-run countries, their sheer size can seem
threatening. Thus the Irish sometimes fret about the fact that
foreign firms account for almost half of their country's employment
and two-thirds of its output; and Australians point nervously to
the fact that the ten biggest industrial multinationals each has
annual sales larger than their government's tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Such clout needs to be used with care, if it is not to be seen
as a threat to national sovereignty and democratic accountability.
</P>
<P>
   For example, countries may feel that their freedom to set taxes
as they wish is threatened by the ability of multinationals to
shift profits, or operations, from one country to another.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, too, a multinational does something stupid.
Nike, Shell, Enron, Monsanto, McDonald's: each has recently made
errors of judgment that united opposition at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And multinationals face strong incentives to behave badly. Thus
those in the natural-resource and mining business often cozy up to
whichever regime is in power, however nasty, in order to protect
their investment.
</P>
<P>
   Those making consumer goods frequently flit to whichever country
offers the best deal on labor costs at the moment. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (500-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What most companies fear more than resentment abroad, though, is
the protest at home. Typically, they still employ two-thirds of
their work force and produce more than two-thirds of their output
in their home country which, in the case of 85 percent of
multinationals, is one of the wealthy members of the OECD.
</P>
<P>
   Here, they have been the easy targets of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), which understand perfectly well the value to
themselves, in prestige and membership, of running a campaign which
succeeds in humbling a mighty corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, NGOs have been able to harness both the
discontent of those who believe globalization destroys jobs, and
the ill-focused unhappiness felt by the children of the prosperous
baby-boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Just as John Kenneth Galbraith warned their parents that the
world would soon be run by huge, unaccountable corporations, so
this new generation seizes on the similar fears expressed in books
such as Naomi Klein's ``No Logo.''
</P>
<P>
   To the well-meaning, honorable folk who generally run
multinationals, all this is a travesty. They listen: even the World
Economic Forum has invited representatives of 15 NGOs to put their
case.
</P>
<P>
   They try: they set guidelines for dealing with environmental
safety and sexual harassment in countries where no such words exist
in the local tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Their corporate morality is a great deal better than that of the
average government: most would kick out a chairman who behaved like
Bill Clinton or Helmut Kohl. They are at least as accountable (to
their shareholders and the law) and a good deal more transparent
than the average NGO.
</P>
<P>
   Individual firms are as capable of doing harm as is any other
entity. But as a class the multinationals have a good story to
tell.
</P>
<P>
   In the rich world, according to OECD research, foreign firms pay
better than domestic ones and create new jobs faster. That is even
more true in poorer countries: in Turkey, for example, wages paid
by foreign firms are 124 percent above average and their work
forces have been expanding by 11.5 percent a year, compared with
0.6 percent in local firms.
</P>
<P>
   Big foreign firms are also the principal conduit for new
technologies, as is clear from the fact that 70 percent of all
international royalties on technology involve payments between
parent firms and their foreign affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   As for the environment, most research suggests that standards
tend to converge upwards, not downwards. In other words, the NGOs,
also as a class, often get their way.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigners need big business as a tic-bird needs a
wildebeest. By alighting on big companies, they can often force
through changes that would be hard to achieve through the political
process alone.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Take the bosses of the world's 1,000 largest companies,
accounting for four-fifths of world industrial output, and 33
national leaders, including the president of the United States.
Assemble them in a secluded Swiss ski resort, and then surround
them with gun-toting police.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that the annual meeting of the World Economic
Forum in Davos this week has become, to some, a sign that there is
a global economic conspiracy perpetrated by the white men in dark
suits who run the world's multinational corporations?
</P>
<P>
   Many people _ and not just the folk with ponytails and placards
who disrupted last December's meeting of the World Trade
Organization in Seattle _ now think of multinationals as more
powerful than nation states, and see them as bent on destroying
livelihoods, the environment, left-wing political opposition and
anything else that stands in the way of their profits.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is new. Three decades ago, multinationals were
already widely denounced as big, irresponsible, monopolistic
monsters.
</P>
<P>
   But they then went through a period of being sneered at as
yesterday's clumsy conglomerates, before being lauded in the 1990s
(including by Third-World leaders in Davos) as the bringers of
foreign capital, technology and know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now the hostility has returned. One explanation is the sheer
speed at which multinationals have recently expanded abroad. This
has made them the most visible aspect of globalization, buying some
local firms and driving others out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Even to rich, well-run countries, their sheer size can seem
threatening. Thus the Irish sometimes fret about the fact that
foreign firms account for almost half of their country's employment
and two-thirds of its output; and Australians point nervously to
the fact that the ten biggest industrial multinationals each has
annual sales larger than their government's tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Such clout needs to be used with care, if it is not to be seen
as a threat to national sovereignty and democratic accountability.
</P>
<P>
   For example, countries may feel that their freedom to set taxes
as they wish is threatened by the ability of multinationals to
shift profits, or operations, from one country to another.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, too, a multinational does something stupid.
Nike, Shell, Enron, Monsanto, McDonald's: each has recently made
errors of judgment that united opposition at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And multinationals face strong incentives to behave badly. Thus
those in the natural-resource and mining business often cozy up to
whichever regime is in power, however nasty, in order to protect
their investment.
</P>
<P>
   Those making consumer goods frequently flit to whichever country
offers the best deal on labor costs at the moment. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (500-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What most companies fear more than resentment abroad, though, is
the protest at home. Typically, they still employ two-thirds of
their work force and produce more than two-thirds of their output
in their home country which, in the case of 85 percent of
multinationals, is one of the wealthy members of the OECD.
</P>
<P>
   Here, they have been the easy targets of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), which understand perfectly well the value to
themselves, in prestige and membership, of running a campaign which
succeeds in humbling a mighty corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, NGOs have been able to harness both the
discontent of those who believe globalization destroys jobs, and
the ill-focused unhappiness felt by the children of the prosperous
baby-boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Just as John Kenneth Galbraith warned their parents that the
world would soon be run by huge, unaccountable corporations, so
this new generation seizes on the similar fears expressed in books
such as Naomi Klein's ``No Logo.''
</P>
<P>
   To the well-meaning, honorable folk who generally run
multinationals, all this is a travesty. They listen: even the World
Economic Forum has invited representatives of 15 NGOs to put their
case.
</P>
<P>
   They try: they set guidelines for dealing with environmental
safety and sexual harassment in countries where no such words exist
in the local tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Their corporate morality is a great deal better than that of the
average government: most would kick out a chairman who behaved like
Bill Clinton or Helmut Kohl. They are at least as accountable (to
their shareholders and the law) and a good deal more transparent
than the average NGO.
</P>
<P>
   Individual firms are as capable of doing harm as is any other
entity. But as a class the multinationals have a good story to
tell.
</P>
<P>
   In the rich world, according to OECD research, foreign firms pay
better than domestic ones and create new jobs faster. That is even
more true in poorer countries: in Turkey, for example, wages paid
by foreign firms are 124 percent above average and their work
forces have been expanding by 11.5 percent a year, compared with
0.6 percent in local firms.
</P>
<P>
   Big foreign firms are also the principal conduit for new
technologies, as is clear from the fact that 70 percent of all
international royalties on technology involve payments between
parent firms and their foreign affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   As for the environment, most research suggests that standards
tend to converge upwards, not downwards. In other words, the NGOs,
also as a class, often get their way.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigners need big business as a tic-bird needs a
wildebeest. By alighting on big companies, they can often force
through changes that would be hard to achieve through the political
process alone.
</P>
<P>
   They can claim a seat at international negotiations, even though
they represent nobody but their members. They can even influence
what happens in distant countries: it is easier to change things in
Nigeria by boycotting Shell than by lobbying the Nigerian
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
   These days the surprises in American politics all seem to come
from the right.
</P>
<P>
   It was surprising enough that the animatronic Steve Forbes
should have garnered 30 percent of the vote in Iowa. It is even
more surprising that the next name on the list, ahead of two of the
country's most distinguished senators, was that of a black man who
has never held elective office.
</P>
<P>
   After all, publishing-billionaire Forbes has been carpet-bombing
the state with dollar bills since 1996. Alan Keyes, a member of
that rarest of breeds, hard-rightists of color, has nothing to
offer but himself.
</P>
<P>
   A fortnight ago nobody would have predicted the Keyes boom. But
since then 4,000 volunteers have signed up with his campaign and
ululating crowds have started to appear wherever he speaks.
</P>
<P>
   This is unlikely to stop with Iowa. In a straw poll at the
Southern Republican Leadership Conference on Jan. 22, Keyes came
second to George Bush for the presidency (albeit by a modest 8
percent of the vote to a thumping 79 percent) and second to
Elizabeth Dole for the vice-presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby poll on Jan. 25 showed Keyes in a statistical draw with
Forbes for third place in New Hampshire. Which is all very
peculiar, given that Keyes makes an even odder politician than the
blink-free billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is merely gauche when it comes to dealing with the press.
Keyes is ferocious.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him some trite question about his favorite dessert (apple
pie with a crumbly crust, for the record) and he is likely to
accuse you of moral and intellectual bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Praise him for his silver tongue and he is likely to accuse you
of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes can even be tough on his supporters. During a recent rally
he ordered his fans to stop applauding. ``I've seen it all
before,'' he thundered. ``People stand up and applaud for things
and say they believe them. And then they go out and they cast their
vote in ways calculated to do God knows what.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes is a man of contradictions: a Roman Catholic who draws
much of his support from evangelicals; an opponent of multilateral
institutions who puts great store on being called ambassador, a
title he earned while working at UNESCO; and a conservative who
plays the race card with even more enthusiasm than Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the presidential debates he addressed George W. as
``Massa Bush'' to ridicule his timidity on taxes. When a chat-show
host praised him for his eloquence he likened the compliment to
saying, ``Oh, he dances real well.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he shy when it comes to direct action. Four years ago a
television network in Atlanta made the mistake of restricting a
televised Republican debate to the four leading candidates. The
ambassador, who was then making his first bid for the presidency,
set up a campsite outside the studio and stormed it repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassment of seeing the country's only black
presidential candidate carted off to prison in handcuffs so
traumatized the networks that they are never likely to make the
same mistake again.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, Keyes is an intellectual in a party that is
profoundly suspicious of any ideas that do not lead to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that he has a PhD in political theory from
Harvard University (where, incidentally, he shared a room with a
conservative pundit, Bill Kristol). It is also that he cares so
visibly about ideas. &QL;

<P>
   These days the surprises in American politics all seem to come
from the right.
</P>
<P>
   It was surprising enough that the animatronic Steve Forbes
should have garnered 30 percent of the vote in Iowa. It is even
more surprising that the next name on the list, ahead of two of the
country's most distinguished senators, was that of a black man who
has never held elective office.
</P>
<P>
   After all, publishing-billionaire Forbes has been carpet-bombing
the state with dollar bills since 1996. Alan Keyes, a member of
that rarest of breeds, hard-rightists of color, has nothing to
offer but himself.
</P>
<P>
   A fortnight ago nobody would have predicted the Keyes boom. But
since then 4,000 volunteers have signed up with his campaign and
ululating crowds have started to appear wherever he speaks.
</P>
<P>
   This is unlikely to stop with Iowa. In a straw poll at the
Southern Republican Leadership Conference on Jan. 22, Keyes came
second to George Bush for the presidency (albeit by a modest 8
percent of the vote to a thumping 79 percent) and second to
Elizabeth Dole for the vice-presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby poll on Jan. 25 showed Keyes in a statistical draw with
Forbes for third place in New Hampshire. Which is all very
peculiar, given that Keyes makes an even odder politician than the
blink-free billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is merely gauche when it comes to dealing with the press.
Keyes is ferocious.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him some trite question about his favorite dessert (apple
pie with a crumbly crust, for the record) and he is likely to
accuse you of moral and intellectual bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Praise him for his silver tongue and he is likely to accuse you
of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes can even be tough on his supporters. During a recent rally
he ordered his fans to stop applauding. ``I've seen it all
before,'' he thundered. ``People stand up and applaud for things
and say they believe them. And then they go out and they cast their
vote in ways calculated to do God knows what.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes is a man of contradictions: a Roman Catholic who draws
much of his support from evangelicals; an opponent of multilateral
institutions who puts great store on being called ambassador, a
title he earned while working at UNESCO; and a conservative who
plays the race card with even more enthusiasm than Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the presidential debates he addressed George W. as
``Massa Bush'' to ridicule his timidity on taxes. When a chat-show
host praised him for his eloquence he likened the compliment to
saying, ``Oh, he dances real well.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he shy when it comes to direct action. Four years ago a
television network in Atlanta made the mistake of restricting a
televised Republican debate to the four leading candidates. The
ambassador, who was then making his first bid for the presidency,
set up a campsite outside the studio and stormed it repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassment of seeing the country's only black
presidential candidate carted off to prison in handcuffs so
traumatized the networks that they are never likely to make the
same mistake again.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, Keyes is an intellectual in a party that is
profoundly suspicious of any ideas that do not lead to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that he has a PhD in political theory from
Harvard University (where, incidentally, he shared a room with a
conservative pundit, Bill Kristol). It is also that he cares so
visibly about ideas. &QL;

   DELHI _ Investors seeking opportunities in developing countries
count a large healthy population as a plus. If they specialize in
testing drugs and other medical therapies, the lure may be a lot of
the not-so-healthy.
</P>
<P>
   India has such people in industrial quantities, and
contract-research organizations (CROs), which undertake clinical
trials and other services for pharmaceutical companies, are
beginning to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Their activities are one of the odder ways in which India is
making more of a mark in services than it ever has in the export of
manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
   Quintiles Transnational, a big CRO based in North Carolina, is
one pioneer. Its Indian joint venture began three years ago and now
has a staff of 40 and a score of customers, mainly American and
European pharmaceutical and biotech firms.
</P>
<P>
   Covance, a CRO from New Jersey, has started clinical trials in
India and may expand its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Indian companies have also spotted an opportunity. Nicholas
Piramal, a pharmaceutical company in Mumbai, recently hired a chief

   DELHI _ Investors seeking opportunities in developing countries
count a large healthy population as a plus. If they specialize in
testing drugs and other medical therapies, the lure may be a lot of
the not-so-healthy.
</P>
<P>
   India has such people in industrial quantities, and
contract-research organizations (CROs), which undertake clinical
trials and other services for pharmaceutical companies, are
beginning to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Their activities are one of the odder ways in which India is
making more of a mark in services than it ever has in the export of
manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
   Quintiles Transnational, a big CRO based in North Carolina, is
one pioneer. Its Indian joint venture began three years ago and now
has a staff of 40 and a score of customers, mainly American and
European pharmaceutical and biotech firms.
</P>
<P>
   Covance, a CRO from New Jersey, has started clinical trials in
India and may expand its operations.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In mid-January, the venerable auctioneers at Sotheby's added
``dot.com'' to its name and seemed to give a signal to the art
world that even its most exclusive members might have to shake off
their clubby airs and join the egalitarian Internet bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This world has been too intimidating and rarefied,'' said
Sotheby's president, Diana ``DeDe'' Brooks, who has been personally
steering the firm's online venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our site to be a friendly place to the potentially
millions of people who've never bought art before.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing art to the online masses is nothing new. But the way
that Sotheby's is doing it raises doubts about whether the
255-year-old firm with the most famous name in the business can
remain on its pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, its dot.com strategy has been about as clear as
Galle glass.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' site _ sothebys.com _ is not the firm's first;
sothebys.amazon.com was launched last November, via the famous
online bookseller's ``portal.''
</P>
<P>
   This existing site offers downmarket collectibles for a broad
audience _ it has, for example, a ``special sale for lovers'' for
Valentine's Day _ while sothebys.com is designed to offer pricier
fine-art pieces for the more discerning collector.
</P>
<P>
   Its star item at the moment is a copy of the first edition of
the American Declaration of Independence, which is on offer for $4
million-6 million.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken Sotheby's a year and more than $40 million to get
to this fork in the road. In January 1999 the firm announced plans
to develop a Web site with enough fanfare to give the company's
share price a sharp (if premature) boost from the so-called ``net''
effect.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman said then that ``only distinguished art
professionals will be selling objects on this site.'' But now the
firm has decided to open the flood gates.
</P>
<P>
   It has signed up 4,700 ``Internet associates,'' a motley
collection of dealers who can offer their goods for sale via the
Sotheby's sites but who (as Sotheby's makes crystal clear) remain
fully responsible for the authenticity of anything that they offer.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ``distinguished art professionals'' corralled into
the scheme at an early stage by Brooks herself are less than
overjoyed at finding themselves forced into company that they might
not want anywhere near the well-polished portals of their high-rent
galleries.
</P>
<P>
   There are persistent worries about the quality and authenticity
of online art, and of the people selling it. The inaugural auction
on Nart.com, a rival online auction house, was disturbed by
concerns that a star Picasso drawing might be a forgery. In the
end, it was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's sites too are having their start-up problems. Some
customers of sothebys.amazon.com have had to wait over six weeks to
receive their goods.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January when John Fiebach, a financial trader in
Philadelphia, finally received the antique American picture frame
that he had bought at an online auction in late November, it was
broken and had obvious glue spots where someone had tried to fix
it.
</P>
<P>
   For the top end of the art market, there remains considerable
skepticism about the principle of online dealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What galleries are selling is elitism,'' says William Bartman,
director of the Art Resources Transfer gallery in New York. ``It's
a very, very private club intended not to let people in, and if it
gets too big, collectors won't want to be a part of it any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Some galleries are not letting the online masses get a shot at
their best art works because ``placing'' a work in an important
collection is critical to developing an artist's reputation (and
market value).
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Eskenazi, one of London's leading oriental art dealers,
still feels that ``what we sell is something that needs to be
looked at and discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was one of Sotheby's first Internet associates, he
has not yet offered anything for sale online. But he does concede
that the online art market ``could be a snowball. It all depends
what happens in the United States.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike May, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, a technology
consulting firm, predicts that the market will grow, but only
slowly because ``everyone in this category is selling twice:
they're spending money to convince customers of the concept of
buying art online, and then they have to convince them to buy the
art here, at their site.''
</P>
<P>
   At the lower end of the market, Sotheby's main problem is the
formidable competition that it faces. Existing sites have already
proved that people are prepared to spend thousands of dollars on
objects that they've never seen in three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Customers like the online capacity to compare prices (almost for
the first time ever) and, by and large, they find the sites'
logistics are working well. Return rates reported so far are, on
average, less than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new sites are also reaching parts that other art can't. For
some sites, up to 90 percent of their sales are going to first-time
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Many new customers are finding the anonymity of online buying
attractive. It allows them to request a 10-foot painting to match
their coral couch without being made to feel like a philistine. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The existing sites seeking to sell art can be divided into
three: those selling mass-produced prints and posters (art.com and
worldprints.com, for example); sites that circumvent dealers and
galleries by representing artists directly (paintingsdirect.com,
nextmonet.com); and sites that put the existing art world online _
both galleries (such as onview.com, to be launched in February, and
eartgroup.com) and auctions (eBay.com and gavelnet.com).
</P>
<P>
   This last group, which presents Sotheby's with its main
competition, is changing the shape of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Antique shops and galleries, if not actually closing down, are
increasingly being left empty by their owners. They are choosing to
stay at home in order to carry on their business around the clock
via their laptops, modems and (predominantly) eBay.com. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EBay is the big threat to Sotheby's at the lower end of the
market. It has a clever system whereby buyers give sellers points
for service, and this ``feedback'' is posted on the site, giving
vendors a strong incentive to play fair.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's is trying to claw its way into this market by
demanding that its Internet associates sign a three-year contract
declaring that they will not sell goods in excess of $300 anywhere
online other than via Sotheby's own sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than tying dealers in, however, this questionable
restraint of trade is merely encouraging them to cheat on their
contract and seek ways around it. &QL;

that which it commands offline, dealers are reluctant to give up
their other online opportunities. For some of them, online business
is considerable.
</P>
<P>
   One London antique dealer, for example, now does 90 percent of
its business online (from a standing start less than a year ago).
Almost all of it is with customers in the United States, customers
who would never have popped into the dealer's shop.  &LR;  &QL;

   At the top end of the market, Sotheby's competition continues to
come from its traditional rival, Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   The ``other'' London auction house, echoing with French accents
since being taken over by a French businessman, Francois Pinault,
first decided not to go online and then changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now it says that it plans to launch a site this spring, and
Edward Dolman, its recently appointed chief executive, has
confirmed that it intends to concentrate on ``the top end of the
market'' _ meaning that it will eschew Valentine's Day specials.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, though, Christie's is differentiating itself by
promising to authenticate all its site's offerings itself. &QL;

power to overturn the old order of things completely, and very

   Sotheby's has been at the heart of the art market for a very
long time. Going, going...? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In mid-January, the venerable auctioneers at Sotheby's added
``dot.com'' to its name and seemed to give a signal to the art
world that even its most exclusive members might have to shake off
their clubby airs and join the egalitarian Internet bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This world has been too intimidating and rarefied,'' said
Sotheby's president, Diana ``DeDe'' Brooks, who has been personally
steering the firm's online venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our site to be a friendly place to the potentially
millions of people who've never bought art before.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing art to the online masses is nothing new. But the way
that Sotheby's is doing it raises doubts about whether the
255-year-old firm with the most famous name in the business can
remain on its pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, its dot.com strategy has been about as clear as
Galle glass.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' site _ sothebys.com _ is not the firm's first;
sothebys.amazon.com was launched last November, via the famous
online bookseller's ``portal.''
</P>
<P>
   This existing site offers downmarket collectibles for a broad
audience _ it has, for example, a ``special sale for lovers'' for
Valentine's Day _ while sothebys.com is designed to offer pricier
fine-art pieces for the more discerning collector.
</P>
<P>
   Its star item at the moment is a copy of the first edition of
the American Declaration of Independence, which is on offer for $4
million-6 million.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken Sotheby's a year and more than $40 million to get
to this fork in the road. In January 1999 the firm announced plans
to develop a Web site with enough fanfare to give the company's
share price a sharp (if premature) boost from the so-called ``net''
effect.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman said then that ``only distinguished art
professionals will be selling objects on this site.'' But now the
firm has decided to open the flood gates.
</P>
<P>
   It has signed up 4,700 ``Internet associates,'' a motley
collection of dealers who can offer their goods for sale via the
Sotheby's sites but who (as Sotheby's makes crystal clear) remain
fully responsible for the authenticity of anything that they offer.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ``distinguished art professionals'' corralled into
the scheme at an early stage by Brooks herself are less than
overjoyed at finding themselves forced into company that they might
not want anywhere near the well-polished portals of their high-rent
galleries.
</P>
<P>
   There are persistent worries about the quality and authenticity
of online art, and of the people selling it. The inaugural auction
on Nart.com, a rival online auction house, was disturbed by
concerns that a star Picasso drawing might be a forgery. In the
end, it was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's sites too are having their start-up problems. Some
customers of sothebys.amazon.com have had to wait over six weeks to
receive their goods.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January when John Fiebach, a financial trader in
Philadelphia, finally received the antique American picture frame
that he had bought at an online auction in late November, it was
broken and had obvious glue spots where someone had tried to fix
it.
</P>
<P>
   For the top end of the art market, there remains considerable
skepticism about the principle of online dealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What galleries are selling is elitism,'' says William Bartman,
director of the Art Resources Transfer gallery in New York. ``It's
a very, very private club intended not to let people in, and if it
gets too big, collectors won't want to be a part of it any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Some galleries are not letting the online masses get a shot at
their best art works because ``placing'' a work in an important
collection is critical to developing an artist's reputation (and
market value).
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Eskenazi, one of London's leading oriental art dealers,
still feels that ``what we sell is something that needs to be
looked at and discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was one of Sotheby's first Internet associates, he
has not yet offered anything for sale online. But he does concede
that the online art market ``could be a snowball. It all depends
what happens in the United States.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike May, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, a technology
consulting firm, predicts that the market will grow, but only
slowly because ``everyone in this category is selling twice:
they're spending money to convince customers of the concept of
buying art online, and then they have to convince them to buy the
art here, at their site.''
</P>
<P>
   At the lower end of the market, Sotheby's main problem is the
formidable competition that it faces. Existing sites have already
proved that people are prepared to spend thousands of dollars on
objects that they've never seen in three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Customers like the online capacity to compare prices (almost for
the first time ever) and, by and large, they find the sites'
logistics are working well. Return rates reported so far are, on
average, less than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new sites are also reaching parts that other art can't. For
some sites, up to 90 percent of their sales are going to first-time
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Many new customers are finding the anonymity of online buying
attractive. It allows them to request a 10-foot painting to match
their coral couch without being made to feel like a philistine. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The existing sites seeking to sell art can be divided into
three: those selling mass-produced prints and posters (art.com and
worldprints.com, for example); sites that circumvent dealers and
galleries by representing artists directly (paintingsdirect.com,
nextmonet.com); and sites that put the existing art world online _
both galleries (such as onview.com, to be launched in February, and
eartgroup.com) and auctions (eBay.com and gavelnet.com).
</P>
<P>
   This last group, which presents Sotheby's with its main
competition, is changing the shape of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Antique shops and galleries, if not actually closing down, are
increasingly being left empty by their owners. They are choosing to
stay at home in order to carry on their business around the clock
via their laptops, modems and (predominantly) eBay.com. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EBay is the big threat to Sotheby's at the lower end of the
market. It has a clever system whereby buyers give sellers points
for service, and this ``feedback'' is posted on the site, giving
vendors a strong incentive to play fair.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's is trying to claw its way into this market by
demanding that its Internet associates sign a three-year contract
declaring that they will not sell goods in excess of $300 anywhere
online other than via Sotheby's own sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than tying dealers in, however, this questionable
restraint of trade is merely encouraging them to cheat on their
contract and seek ways around it. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Feb. 1:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MARS-LANDER (Undated) _ Developments in the search for radio
signals from the long-lost Mars Polar Lander. By William J. Broad.
(800 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-ESTROGEN (San Francisco) _ Estrogen has strongly
protected against infection with the simian form of the AIDS virus
in experiments in monkeys, offering hope that hormone might be used
to do the same in women, researchers reported in an AIDS meeting in
San Francisco. By Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GREENBERG-LANGUAGE (Undated) _ Many linguists are reluctant
to tie the root of languages back to a single mother tongue,
largely because languages change so rapidly and any traces of a
single tongues were lost eons ago. But one linguist, Joseph H.
Greenberg of Stanford University, he has classified most of the
world's languages into just a handful of major groups. Though it
remains unclear how these super-families may be related to each
other, he has identified words and concepts that seem common to
them all and could be echoes of a mother tongue. By Nicholas Wade.
(2200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GALILEO-EUROPA (Undated) _ When the durability and longevity
of spacecraft have counted most, on long voyages to the outer
planets of the Sun, fortune has smiled on American space
scientists. In the tradition of hardihood, the Galileo spacecraft
has defied engineering's actuarial tables, completing more than
four years of orbiting Jupiter and taking in the sights of its four
major moons. In an especially close encounter with the moon Europa
last month, the spacecraft picked up the most compelling evidence
so far of an electrically conducting material in Europa's
subsurface, like an ocean of salty water. By John Noble Wilford.
(1875 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BREAST-HORMONES (Undated) _ Millions of middle age women now
are weighing hormone replacement therapy in light of possible
increased risks of breast cancer, women's most feared disease. But
the therapy also brings protection against many other diseases. The
bottom line: each woman's individual risks must be assessed, but
most women are likely to find benefits in the therapy: Over all,
studies have shown, women who have used hormone replacement therapy
tend to live longer than women who do not. By Jane E. Brody. (1725
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OPTICAL-BLACK-HOLE (Undated) _ Astronomers believe that
nothing, not even light, can escape after it has been captured by a
black hole in space and goes, so to speak, down the cosmic drain.
Two physicists in Sweden have now theorized that the same effects
may be produced in laboratories: light could be gobbled up by
swirling gases and fluids that look suspiciously like water going
down an ordinary drain. Called an optical black hole, this
laboratory creation would rely on the recent discovery that in
certain substances, light can be slowed from its usual 186,000
miles a second to a pace well below a highway speed limit. By James
Glanz. (725 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FIRE-CHEATGRASS (Reno, Nev.) _ The federal government is
spending millions of dollars in a desperate effort to reverse an
accelerating cycle of fire and weed invasion in Nevada. Fire and
cheatgrass _ a fire-loving invasive annual grass from central
Eurasia _ are locked in a deadly dance that is steadily turning the
sagebrush steppes of the Great Basin desert into a weedy wasteland.
By Jon Christensen. (1580 words)
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PHYSICS-REALITY (Undated) _ It comes as unwelcome news to
some physicists that just as their field is enjoying unparalleled
success, its relationship to reality is being questioned with a
pointedness not seen for decades. Logically, reality would begin
with elementary particles and the interactions that bind them to
build the universe that our instruments measure, our eyes see and
our hands touch. Physics, with its ambition of understanding these
building blocks at the most basic level, therefore becomes a prime
target for doubt. By James Glanz. (1235 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on how
horses cool their brains, plant oxidation and a meteor over the
Yukon. By Henry Fountain. (680 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DEPRESSION (Undated) _ While some forms of depressions are
clearly a result of genetic vulnerability and brain abnormality,
others may have their roots in evolutionary history, a prominent
psychiatrist argues. In some cases, depression may help a person
disengage from what has proved a hopeless effort; in other cases,
it may protect the person from jumping ship too rashly, perhaps
landing in even less hospitable seas. By Erica Goode. (1425 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MEMORY-LOSS (Undated) _ As the huge baby boomer generation
ages _ and the blank stare of a blank memory becomes a not-so-funny
fact of more daily lives _ researchers are increasingly attempting
to discover if memory loss is inevitable with age. At the moment,
it is still thought to be generally true that older people remember
less well than younger people. By Linda Carroll. (1600 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: Well, folks, the
year 2000 is here and the bad news is that Americans failed to
achieve many of the health goals established by the surgeon general
in 1979 in an ambitious report called Healthy People 2000. The good
news is that we are being given a second chance, as outlined in
Healthy People 2010 issued last week by Dr. David Satcher, the
surgeon general. By Jane E. Brody. (1150 words).
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILD-HEALTH (Undated) _ A major survey of children's health
care finds they aren't going to the dentist and use of Medicaid is
high. By Julie Flaherty.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health:
</P>
<P>
   _ Children who show a propensity for extreme aggression at young
ages often have low levels of a hormone produced by the body at
times of fear or stress, researchers have found. Although the
findings may appear counterintuitive, scientists at the University
of Chicago Medical Center believe they may mean that some violent
people may simply experience less fear than normal people, leading
to unchecked aggressiveness. (380 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Problems in childhood that lead to other diseases and
conditions may also be a factor in developing Alzheimer's, some
research suggests. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Scientists may be no closer to explaining why incidents of
asthma have been escalating in the united States over the past
decades, but a new study confirms that a number of common indoor
materials are making the situation worse. (280 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mentally ill patients who suffer heart attacks tend to receive
fewer invasive treatments than others. (200 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A British medical journal reports that Monday is the most
popular day for Scots to die from heart attacks, And researchers
believe increased drinking over the weekend may play a role. (175
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science question answered: Will it ever be
possible to synthesize blood the way way insulin is made? By C.
Claiborne Ray. (300 words)

BISHOP SPONG GETS A CHANCE TO LISTEN, FOR A CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``Every time Bishop Spong opens his mouth,'' remarked an
Episcopal priest friend shortly after the bishop's last book
appeared, ``a dozen people call and threaten to quit the church.''
 &HT;    This week, my friend can breathe a little easier. On Saturday,
after 25 years as the Episcopal bishop of Newark, N.J., the
always-controversial John Shelby Spong retired.
 &HT;    Unlike most Episcopalians, who are generally a genial lot, Spong
is the churchman every one loves to hate.
 &HT;    Over the years, he has attacked traditional Christian doctrine
and morality. His publications include: ``Living in Sin? A Bishop
Rethinks Human Sexuality,'' ``Rescuing the Bible from
Fundamentalism,'' ``Resurrection: Myth or Reality?,'' ``Born of a
Woman: A Bishop Rethinks the Virgin Birth,'' and ``Why Christianity
Must Change or Die.''
 &HT;    He has championed women's ordination, same-sex unions and the
ordination of gay and lesbian persons. Throughout, he has become
the nation's most well known -- and notorious -- religious
provocateur.
 &HT;    The bishop's enemies equate him with theological liberalism and
cite him as prime example of its bankruptcy. It is no surprise that
conservative Christians hate him. He has attacked every belief they
cherish and, in their mind, pushed one denomination over the brink
of heresy.
 &HT;    How could any person, in the paid employ of a Christian church,
so gleefully assail its creeds, scriptures and ethics?
 &HT;    But for all his blustering, Spong is neither a true liberal nor
a true theologian. Instead, his new autobiography, ``Here I
Stand,'' proves him a rather illiberal theological popularizer.
 &HT;    Whether the bishop recognizes it or not, his stances have often
harmed those who agree with him on the issues. Although he depicts
himself as a theological gadfly, he is really a sort of
institutional horsefly.
 &HT;    In the months leading up to his retirement, Spong called for a
``New Reformation'' in Christian theology and practice. He argues
that outmoded forms of doctrine and ethics can no longer adequately
express the power and meaning of Christian faith.
 &HT;    In ``Why Christianity Must Change,'' he offered his ``Twelve
Theses'' as a reform agenda arguing, among other things, ``Theism,
as a way of defining God, is dead.''
 &HT;    His autobiography ends with this appeal: ``I urge my successors
in faith to embrace, not to fear, the changes necessary to enable
the Church of the future to be born -- I think a radical
reformation is on our doorstep.''
 &HT;    These insights are neither original nor unique. That theism is
in trouble and that Christianity needs reform are truisms so
obvious that it almost seems ridiculous to state them. And reform
is, in many ways, already occurring. Since the end of World War II,
western Christianity has been undergoing a vast theological and
ethical reorientation that defies simple ``liberal,''
``conservative,'' ``heretical,'' or ``orthodox'' labels.
 &HT;    Many clerics, theologians, and faithful lay persons have
dedicated their lives to thoughtfully guiding Christian
institutions during this challenging time. Old patterns of doing
spiritual business no longer work. Even rather traditional churches
-- such as the bishop's own Episcopal Church -- are experiencing
new waves of creativity in ministry, worship and community.
American church life is being reformed.
 &HT;    But that reformation does not follow a particular agenda.
Sometimes, it takes the form of a local ``community'' church whose
members find spiritual fulfillment in small groups. At other times,
reform expresses itself through walking the labyrinth, silent
retreats and centering prayer.
 &HT;    New interpretations of Jesus -- from ``What Would Jesus Do?'' to
the Jesus Seminar -- are having a powerful impact on theologically
diverse congregations.
 &HT;    Even church conflicts, such as struggle over the role of
homosexual persons in religious life, are reshaping the nature of
faith communities.
 &HT;    In short, Bishop Spong, get with the program. Even those of us
who agree with you on some issues (like gay and lesbian ordination)
do not need your agenda.
 &HT;    Indeed, one of the major problems with contemporary religion is
that it persists in being hierarchical. Having a bishop tell us
that what we should no longer believe is as retrograde as the
biblical fundamentalism you castigate.
 &HT;    Maybe now that you have retired, you can sit in the pews and
listen to us for awhile. We are further along than you suspect. And
we all think you need to shut your mouth.

   SCI-AIDS-ESTROGEN (San Francisco) _ Estrogen has strongly

in experiments in monkeys, offering hope that hormone might be used

San Francisco. By Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GREENBERG-LANGUAGE (Undated) _ Many linguists are reluctant
to tie the root of languages back to a single mother tongue,
largely because languages change so rapidly and any traces of a
single tongues were lost eons ago. But one linguist, Joseph H.
Greenberg of Stanford University, he has classified most of the
world's languages into just a handful of major groups. Though it
remains unclear how these super-families may be related to each
other, he has identified words and concepts that seem common to
them all and could be echoes of a mother tongue. By Nicholas Wade.

<P>
   SCI-GALILEO-EUROPA (Undated) _ When the durability and longevity
of spacecraft have counted most, on long voyages to the outer
planets of the Sun, fortune has smiled on American space
scientists. In the tradition of hardihood, the Galileo spacecraft
has defied engineering's actuarial tables, completing more than
four years of orbiting Jupiter and taking in the sights of its four
major moons. In an especially close encounter with the moon Europa
last month, the spacecraft picked up the most compelling evidence
so far of an electrically conducting material in Europa's
subsurface, like an ocean of salty water. By John Noble Wilford.

   SCI-BREAST-HORMONES (Undated) _ Millions of middle age women now
are weighing hormone replacement therapy in light of possible
increased risks of breast cancer, women's most feared disease. But
the therapy also brings protection against many other diseases. The
bottom line: each woman's individual risks must be assessed, but
most women are likely to find benefits in the therapy: Over all,
studies have shown, women who have used hormone replacement therapy
tend to live longer than women who do not. By Jane E. Brody. (1725

<P>
   SCI-OPTICAL-BLACK-HOLE (Undated) _ Astronomers believe that
nothing, not even light, can escape after it has been captured by a
black hole in space and goes, so to speak, down the cosmic drain.
Two physicists in Sweden have now theorized that the same effects
may be produced in laboratories: light could be gobbled up by
swirling gases and fluids that look suspiciously like water going
down an ordinary drain. Called an optical black hole, this
laboratory creation would rely on the recent discovery that in
certain substances, light can be slowed from its usual 186,000
miles a second to a pace well below a highway speed limit. By James
Glanz. (725 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FIRE-CHEATGRASS (Reno, Nev.) _ The federal government is
spending millions of dollars in a desperate effort to reverse an
accelerating cycle of fire and weed invasion in Nevada. Fire and
cheatgrass _ a fire-loving invasive annual grass from central
Eurasia _ are locked in a deadly dance that is steadily turning the
sagebrush steppes of the Great Basin desert into a weedy wasteland.

<P>
   SCI-PHYSICS-REALITY (Undated) _ It comes as unwelcome news to
some physicists that just as their field is enjoying unparalleled
success, its relationship to reality is being questioned with a
pointedness not seen for decades. Logically, reality would begin
with elementary particles and the interactions that bind them to
build the universe that our instruments measure, our eyes see and
our hands touch. Physics, with its ambition of understanding these
building blocks at the most basic level, therefore becomes a prime
target for doubt. By James Glanz. (1235 words)

   SCI-DEPRESSION (Undated) _ While some forms of depressions are
clearly a result of genetic vulnerability and brain abnormality,
others may have their roots in evolutionary history, a prominent
psychiatrist argues. In some cases, depression may help a person
disengage from what has proved a hopeless effort; in other cases,
it may protect the person from jumping ship too rashly, perhaps
landing in even less hospitable seas. By Erica Goode. (1425 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MEMORY-LOSS (Undated) _ As the huge baby boomer generation
ages _ and the blank stare of a blank memory becomes a not-so-funny
fact of more daily lives _ researchers are increasingly attempting
to discover if memory loss is inevitable with age. At the moment,
it is still thought to be generally true that older people remember
less well than younger people. By Linda Carroll. (1600 words)

achieve many of the health goals established by the surgeon general
in 1979 in an ambitious report called Healthy People 2000. The good

</P>
<P>
   _ Children who show a propensity for extreme aggression at young
ages often have low levels of a hormone produced by the body at
times of fear or stress, researchers have found. Although the
findings may appear counterintuitive, scientists at the University
of Chicago Medical Center believe they may mean that some violent
people may simply experience less fear than normal people, leading
to unchecked aggressiveness. (380 words)

Our rating: 1 star 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout ``Two of Us,'' a shockingly tedious speculative
fiction on a day in 1976 when Paul McCartney visited John Lennon in
New York City, Lennon (Jared Harris) wears a T-shirt (not the one
shown in ads for the TV movie) that reads on the back: ``This is
not here.'' Were we that lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what John and Paul (Aidan Quinn) do in their time
together at Lennon's apartment _ art-directed to look mainly like a
dumpy bachelor pad _ as envisioned by screenwriter Mark Stanfield:
Paul offers John tickets to a Wings concert (surprisingly, John
doesn't kick him out immediately). John pokes fun, repeatedly, at
``Silly Love Songs,'' Paul's hit of the moment but the nadir of his
'70s music. Perhaps a script this insipid shouldn't be knocking
lame works of pop-culture so aggressively. They share some pot.
</P>
<P>
   Paul says, ``Sometimes I feel like there's so much stuff that
hasn't been resolved.'' Well, duh!
</P>
<P>
   They fool around on a piano, dueting, poorly, on, of all things,
``Tumblin' Tumbleweeds.'' They bicker about music and their past
and talk dreamily about their families. They dance to a reggae band
in Central Park, and Paul rescues John from his worst impulses when
a couple of cops harass them. They go to a neighborhood joint for
some cappuccinos, and John insults fans who speak to him. They
reconcile, to a degree, and nearly fall asleep watching ``Saturday
Night Live,'' until Lorne Michaels' infamous request for the
Beatles to reunite on the show almost inspires them to head down to
NBC at that moment. Except, drat the luck, Yoko unwittingly
intervenes; yes, again, Yoko breaks up the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how bad this plays out _ had they played video Pong for a
half-hour, the movie would have been vastly improved. If they had
counted how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall? About the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's quite likely that had the most celebrated songwriting
team of the 20th century in fact got together for a day years after
their acrimonious separation, they probably would spend it in such
a banal fashion _ !ital!but that's no reason to go and make a movie
about it. Lennon has been the victim of speculative fiction in the
past, in ``The Hours and Times'' and ``Backbeat'' (not to mention
Albert Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon''), but at least those
movies (if not the book) had something on their minds beyond simply
cashing in on the ghosts of the past. And at least Goldman's book
was scandalously spurious, not timidly so.
</P>
<P>
   To top it all off, Harris and Quinn don't even really
approximate John and Paul. Quinn looks like McCartney from one
angle, with one expression; otherwise, he's too old and puffy to
credibly depict Paul in his early 30s, and his accent is shaky.
Harris, likewise, is hardly a dead ringer for Lennon, but he
manages to convey a kind of intriguing sense of disconnect from
society that doesn't wholly mask a sharp, embittered intellect
underneath. He might have been interesting had a script with an
ounce of oomph been in his proximity.
</P>
<P>
   Director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who directed the Beatles' last
film, ``Let It Be,'' creates a few tableaux recalling famous photos
of the guys but lets the action drag in a fatally listless fashion.
Lindsay-Hogg doesn't quite betray the band or its memory _ ``Two of
Us'' is far too prosaic for that _ but he has certainly knocked his
own place in the Beatles' iconography down a few pegs. &QL;

&HT;     SUPER BOWL ADS: BIG E-DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There is a commercial that says ``E-nough'' to
dot-com mania. It didn't air during the Super Bowl. It should have.
Then again, we might have forgotten it in the clutter.
</P>
<P>
   When will e-tailers or e-commerce or e-business realize that it
takes more than a funny commercial to make anyone realize who you
are or what you do? Yeah, that cat-wrangling commercial was pretty
funny, but half the country probably thinks EDS has something to do
with erectile dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   With a promise to limit any kind of www.badjokes.com moments,
here's a list of the good, the bad and the bland of Super Bowl
commercials:
</P>
<P>
   All hail E-Trade for its hilarious string of commercials. This
company produced two of the funniest, first with the monkey making
bad music with two dim-witted pals and the kicker, ``Well, we just
wasted two million dollars'' and asking you what you're doing with
your money. Excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the base but hilarious ad where a guy is wheeled into a
hospital face down on a stretcher. His problem: ``He's got money
coming out the wazoo.'' That was a show-stopper. Grade: A-plus for
both.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, the EDS commercial about feline herding was ingenious,
as rough hewn catboys rounded up cute cats, complete with visual
references to balls of yarn, lint brushes and allergies. But what
do they do again? Grade: B-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game started, Motorola had a nice pager commercial
featuring ``Baywatch'' star Yasmine Bleeth trying to pick up her
car at an auto shop where two young men had a shrine built for her.
Hey, that was some of her best acting yet. Grade: B.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed results for Computer.com, whose retro ads and faux
low-budget approach just tried too hard. Still, a couple of laughs.
Grade: B-minus.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the cola wars dominating the Super Bowl. 7-Up failed
to ignite much imagination and came off, in all of their attempts,
as predictable and mediocre. Grade: C-minus.
</P>
<P>
   And what was up with the Pepsi One ad where a rocking commuter
ferry slid that drink and a Coke into the hands of thirsty
travelers. Was the point that Pepsi One, or Diet Pepsi One tasted
as good as Coke? Really? Grade: D.
</P>
<P>
   Give the NFL credit for some nice work thanking the fans and for
reminding us, with Samuel Jackson's narration, that the Super Bowl
is indeed our unofficial national holiday. Grade: A.
</P>
<P>
   Netpliance, with its nerdy tape-on-glasses commercial, gets a B
for good visuals but leaves us mystified at what Eliott Gould's
voice-over is really saying about the company. E-duh?
</P>
<P>
   Bet you can't even remember the Doritos ad. Grade: F.
</P>
<P>
   How about the Tostitos ad with the New York Knicks sliding on
the ice because the floor crew didn't switch Madison Square Garden
from hockey to basketball? Lost in the dot-com craze. Grade:
C-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab usually has good commercials and it came through
again with one on retired athletes (Grade: A-minus), one with staid
golfer David Duval (Grade: B) and one with retired, staid Ringo
Starr (Grade: B).
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com had one of last year's best commercials with its
take on kids saying what they want to be when they grow up (mostly
oppressed at work) and this year went the emotional route, tapping
into the road less traveled, poetry and whimsical images. Grade: A.
</P>
<P>
   What's Budweiser going to do without the frogs and with all this
dot-com competition? Nothing much stood out, even the do-gooder
designated driver ad with Wayne Gretzky driving the zamboni. Or the
talking dog. Whatever. Grade: C.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Dew is usually a hit-and-miss with its ads. But its
take on the mountain biker racing down the ``bad cheetah'' and
ending with, ``That's why I'm not a cat person'' was funny. Grade:
B-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali in almost anything is great TV. But what was WebMD
trying to tell us? Grade: C.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is bad form, but the Nuveen Investments ad where
Christopher Reeve is depicted walking, somehow came off as forced.
Are we really to believe that people will take their dot-com
profits and invest in something good, like research? A stretch.
Grade: B.
</P>
<P>
   Spoofing Gap ads is sooo 1999. But Oldsmobile did it. Grade: B.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Visa has always turned out good ads and the
ones for the Olympics, like synchronized swimming (Grade: B-plus)
and women pole vaulters (Grade: B-plus) worked well.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't know that Oxygen is a cable channel for women,
its ad about baby girls resisting stereotypes was fun. Hats off.
Grade: A.
</P>
<P>
   Wizard of Oz. Fed Ex. No. Grade: D.
</P>
<P>
   ABC hyping Regis. Yes. Grade: B-plus.
</P>
<P>
   We are huge suckers for hand-puppets singing and saying, ``I
think I'm gonna boot.'' So hurray for Pets.com. Grade: A.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, of all the ads for on-line job placement and head
hunting, the only one to stick out was HotJobs.com and its giant,
cocky hand. But that didn't make it good. Grade: C.
</P>
<P>
   Lifeminders.com said its all-type, no graphics ad would be the
worst one of the Super Bowl. Close. Grade: D.
</P>
<P>
   But that ad was trumped by the you've-gotta-be-kidding,
we-hope-this-is-a-costly-spoof campaign by Epidemic.com, where
someone apparently gets money for going to the bathroom and
sneezing. Grade: F.
</P>
<P>
   What we learned from MicroStrategy, other than they exist at
all: That smart, smug people are using e-something to win at life.
Oh, great. Grade: D (or A for arrogance).
</P>
<P>
   Did we eat too much dip of a strange nature or was there a
low-tech commercial with some old guy talking about heart pills?
Correction: Nobody eats green M&AMP;M's, male or female. Grade: C.
</P>
<P>
   There was more. But did there need to be? Outside of E-Trade and
the Pets.com puppet _ and that weird guy with the bad ticker _ will
we remember anything we saw, much less the game?
</P>
<P>
   E-normous e-overkill.

ATTACKS BACKFIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PETERBOROUGH, N.H. &UR;  &LR;  _ Last summer, even with free ice cream,
John McCain couldn't have attracted two-dozen people to his first
meeting with voters here.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday they filled the public assembly hall in this
famously gorgeous community (the inspirational site of Thornton
Wilder's ``Our Town'') _ a solid 1,600 of them _ to chuckle at his
stand-up, poke him with skeptical questions, nod unconsciously when
he agreed with some of his fans only to challenge them to reach out
to those who don't agree, and know that they were witnessing
something special in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley could have ended up the New Hampshire primary like
McCain, basking in respect, enjoying the game, and proud of having
created genuine policy alternatives for conservatives and
independents alike.
</P>
<P>
   But on the ``change'' side of this cycle's equation, it was John
McCain who won the role of Thornton Wilder's metaphorical stage
manager _ in charge and leading, but always gently and reasonably.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, whom I also shadowed on this strange day, chose instead
to be Sampson, pushing on the walls of his party with a torrent of
invective even more bitter and personal than his attacks last week
in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss the point here. Bradley can easily win, and McCain
can just as easily lose. The point is the implications of both
possible events.
</P>
<P>
   IF McCain loses, he would get a mass bow worthy of the Tennessee
Titans for a valiant effort that just fell short. George W. Bush
would get full credit, and not just for rising to McCain's spirited
challenge and coming from behind to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign took at least two hard looks _ one right after
Iowa last week and one last weekend _ at going as negative on
McCain as Bradley has on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   For two reasons _ one strategic and one tactical _ the governor
decided against invective. For one thing, the reasoning was that it
would be better to win on a higher plane for the usual task of
stitching the Republican Party back together for a general
election.
</P>
<P>
   For another, if McCain hangs on to win, better to go toward the
megastate primaries without the black mark of attack campaigning
next to the Bush name. The decision not to brand McCain some kind
of untrustworthy traitor could always be revisited before the Feb.
19 South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   But in Bradley's case, after having fallen behind this month, a
comeback that nips Gore could be attributable only Bradley's
attacks on Gore's character and integrity over the last week.
Taking that message national, into arenas where character attacks
are blood sport (like New York, Ohio, and California, for starters)
would risk opening deep rifts among Democrats and would challenge
the allegiance of the vast majority of them to the policies of the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, the McCain-Bush and Bradley-Gore contests were
neither fundamentally different nor outside the bounds of normal
give-and-take politics. The main elements _ my plan's better than
your plan; my experience is richer than yours; some of your votes
and decisions from the past are inconsistent with your present
stands; you have the establishment I have the people _ are
traditional. There's always hype, but above all, there was debate,
as well as debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley changed all that. When Bush went after details of
McCain's ideas, McCain defended and countered; the public learned
things, and so did the participants. When Gore and Bradley went
after each other's proposals starting last fall, the same thing
happened, until Bradley appeared to be losing the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Since the final days in Iowa, stripped of euphemisms, this is
what Bradley has had to say about Gore: He's a tobacco prostitute,
a Willie Horton-introducing, lying, untrustworthy, possibly illegal
fund-raiser who is unfit for the Oval Office and not committed to
protecting a woman's right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this assault is an oddly Olympian view of self. In a
gathering in Exeter, Bradley offered ``a world of new possibilities
guided by goodness'' while a supporter warmed up the audience by
saying Bradley ``encourages us to be better people by his
example.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has had to sit through sinister suggestions that he
is a tempestuous wacko who peddles influence for campaign cash, has
never lost his cool. He has sharp elbows and is not be trifled
with, but it is his relationship with the people that has made him
the star of the campaign, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his 104th town meeting here, a fellow asked him if
he would support, after years of broken promises, a full funding of
the federal share (40 percent) of the costs of mandated special
education.
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely, McCain replied, but only if you make sure that only
truly needy and eligible kids get in such programs.
</P>
<P>
   That candor and directness have made McCain the champion of
those yearning for a new, accommodative politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley could easily have been that candidate, but at crunch
time, to twist a line from a poet from Vermont, he took the road
more traveled by, and that has made all the difference.

</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: ``Mary and Rhoda'' airs Monday, Feb. 7. Fact box below) 
 
 
 
 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember mild-mannered Mary Richards, Mary Tyler Moore's 1970s
alter ego who just couldn't call her boss anything more familiar
than Mr. Grant, who stood up for everyone but herself, whose every
move and word was laced with genuine and often naive sweetness?
</P>
<P>
   Well, picture Mary Richards 25 years older, wiser, more worldly.
Mary Richards, fresh from her Tae Bo workout and on her way to an
assertiveness training class. A class she teaches.
</P>
<P>
   That's more like the character Moore plays in ``Mary and
Rhoda,'' the long-awaited resurrection of ``The Mary Tyler Moore
Show,'' one of TV's most popular and most honored situation
comedies ever.
</P>
<P>
   She says it was ``tremendous fun'' to play the role again.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always been so much a part of me. Couldn't I be Mary
Richards sitting here talking to you right now? But it's me, Mary
Levine,'' she said, referring to her married name. ``We are soul
mates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary'' isn't coming back as another sitcom because, as Moore,
the executive producer, learned the hard way, there is just too
much information to pack into a half-hour pilot script, what with
renewing old characters and introducing new ones. Instead she has
settled for a two- hour movie, airing Monday on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Harper is back as Rhoda Morgenstern, Mary's neighbor and
close friend from that quaint Minneapolis apartment house. But
anyone looking for other familiar faces _ maybe Edward Asner, Betty
White or Gavin MacLeod _ or warm, fuzzy references to old episodes
may be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   In this scenario, Mary, recently widowed, returns home to
Manhattan. Her daughter, Rose (Joie Lenz), is a semi-punk student
at New York University (she says her tongue jewelry is a
``clip-on''). After WJM, Mary finished her college degree and
worked as a network news producer, but she put her career on hold
for wife-and-mother duties.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rhoda has been in Paris for years in what turned out
to be a bad marriage to a philandering Frenchman. In fact, she and
Mary had parted in anger after Mary told Rhoda that her groom had
been pawing a bridesmaid before the wedding. Rhoda has moved back
to New York to be near her daughter, Meredith (Marisa Ryan), who is
studying at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Mary and Rhoda meet up again in Manhattan, ready to forgive and
forget. Rhoda moves in with Mary at her insistence, and they
attempt to jump-start their careers, Mary in television and Rhoda
in photography.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and Harper, talking about the project, stepped on each
other's words and finished each other's sentences while trying to
drive home the point that this is not a reunion show, that it's
about moving on.
</P>
<P>
   And in the spirit of moving on, Moore suggests this may be the
last we'll see of Mary Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed doing the movie but I think I would rather go
on to other things now,'' Moore said. ``I'm going to hang onto this
experience in that I'm writing an outline now for a book about the
emergence of me, Mary, as a grown-up person who, for the first time
in her life, actually took the reins and made something happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time I was the MTM initials of that fabulous
production company, I really was never involved, but I have been
involved in this, and so I'm going to write this whole story from
trying to sell it as a series and then having it happen as a
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore knows the old series is practically sacred to millions of
fans, revered for its writing, its characters, its shelves of
Emmys. But she did not hesitate to bring back the franchise at the
risk of harsh comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't scare me at all,'' Moore said. ``I think it scared
the hell out of Les Moonves (of CBS), who was the first one I
brought the idea to. He said, `Do you realize you're talking about
possibly casting a shadow on what I think was arguably the best
situation comedy ever on television?' And I said, `Yes, but are you
really going to walk away from this opportunity?' And he said, `No,
I'll give you money to write a script.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day I had an appointment with ABC, and Stu Bloomberg
and Jamie Tarses jumped up and down and said, `We'll give you a
commitment.' And that's how it started.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper said it's important to view the series and the new TV
movie as two distinct works. ``(Mary) said to me, `Val, we can't
let that there was this fabulous show before stop us from doing
this, and ... I will kick myself if I don't do it for fear of how
it will turn out. Maybe we'll fall on our faces, but let's take a
chance.' And I agree with her.''
</P>
<P>
   At 62, Moore wears her age well, distracting from it more than
concealing it with a pair of spike heels and a slim skirt slit up
to there on the thigh. But she faces aging issues head-on in the
story as a qualified applicant confronted by employers' prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can't help but reflect what goes on in society,
whether it's movies or television, and unfortunately that is a fact
of life and a tradition that is hard for some people to let go of _
that is the minute menopause hits, women are no longer
interesting,'' she said. ``And we took that on as our challenge, to
show that, in fact, it does not make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aging is so inevitable, and we should start embracing it,''
added Harper, 59. ``I was so taken with what a wonderful
expression, without wagging a finger, this movie is about our
American ... obsession with shelf life, particularly for women.''
</P>
<P>
   In typical Mary Richards form, Moore can find the silver lining
in graying: ``I don't think the core values have changed,'' she
said of herself. ``Maybe a little rounding of the edges as one gets
older and develops a patina, maybe a little more awareness of the
reality of life as opposed to the happy endings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also more self-acceptance,'' added Harper. ``As Mary quoted (a
line from the movie), `Years ago, this would have devastated me.'
We don't devastate so easy.'' &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The show: ``Mary and Rhoda.'' &QL; 
What: Reunion of characters from the classic sitcom. &QL; 
The stars: Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper, Joie Lenz and Marisa
Ryan. &QL; 
Where: ABC (Channel 7). &QL;

&HT;     FUR GROWS MORE POPULAR DESPITE ACTIVISTS' FURY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KRISTI L. GUSTAFSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ Light and dark, sheared and long hair, jackets and
coats: Furs drape over the ivory couch and weigh down the backs of
the modern dining room chairs in Andrea Mayone's impeccable town
house in Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Mayone, 38, dressed in jeans, a long-sleeved, dark purple
turtleneck and stylish black boots, proudly displays her fur
collection as her two Norwich Terriers dance around her feet.
</P>
<P>
   She loves her furs, and she's not alone: Fur, in the form of
coats, jackets, wraps, accessories, trim and more, has made a
comeback, hitting the runways and closets of many women (and, in
this country, almost solely women) this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite controversy about wearing fur, its popularity is on the
rise, with more than 200 designers employing it in their
collections for 1999-2000, as opposed to 45 designers in 1985,
according to the Fur Information Council of America.
</P>
<P>
   As the fashion frenzy for fur explodes, animal activists,
including members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
are in a fury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wearing fur anything comes from disrespect and arrogance,''
said Kim Krier, coordinator of PETA's anti-fur campaign. ``It has
nothing to do with fashion or warmth and everything to do with
greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayone disagreed, saying she's neither greedy nor disrespectful,
but that each person has the right to dress as he or she wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we all liked the same thing, life would be boring. I do not
wear fur to oppose or upset anyone. I love it on these frigid
days.''
</P>
<P>
   As fashion, fur dates back to the early 1600s, when Native
Americans began trading with the Dutch. Based near the port of
Albany, the New Netherland Co. was a leading trader in the fur
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch continued to trade in fur and keep it at the fashion
forefront until the late 1650s, when a scarcity in beavers, the
prized fur of the time, caused the fur trade to fall off, according
to Charles Ghering, director of the New Netherland Project,
sponsored by the New York State Library.
</P>
<P>
   Although fur came in and out of style, it remained popular for
its practicality throughout the next three centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether fur was being worn for fashion, one thing remained,
regardless of the time in history,'' said Teresa Platt, executive
director of Fur Commission USA. ``The package our dinner came in
was always used for warmth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, society viewed fur strictly as status symbol, to
be worn by the elite to church or black-tie events. That belief is
essentially passe, and fur has become all-week wear, with retailers
and consumers returning to naming its barrier against the cold as
the No. 1 attraction when it comes to outerwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing warmer than a fur,'' Mayone said. ``Once you
own one, you'll never go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Many PETA members believe fur harvesting of any sort is cruel
and that people who support fur farmers and trappers by wearing fur
dislike animals.
</P>
<P>
   Mayone dismissed that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fortunate _ I've never been bothered or harassed. People
seem to respect my decision. I love all animals,'' Mayone said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruel or not, activists say that fur is simply unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fur is frivolous,'' said Christine Mott, a PETA representative
in upstate New York. Mott said many synthetic fabrics keep wearers
warm and do not involve the killing of animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fur may have been appropriate for cavemen or Indians, but the
people I see wearing furs are not nomads. Their use of fur is in no
way fashionable and strictly inhumane,'' Mott said.
</P>
<P>
   While PETA works to spread its ideas, members attempt to do so
in a calm and organized manner, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't go into the fur shops and cause a scene or throw
paint at people,'' Mott said. ``I don't believe these women look
fashionable, but we are not out to ruin something that is their
property.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, folks, the year 2000 is here and the bad news is that
Americans failed to achieve many of the health goals established by
the surgeon general in 1979 in an ambitious report called Healthy
People 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the societal goals, like improvements in maternal and
child health and fewer deaths from breast cancer and heart disease,
were met. But we fell sadly short on most of the objectives that
are under personal control, like diet, exercise and cigarette
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that we are being given a second chance, as
outlined in Healthy People 2010 issued last week by Dr. David
Satcher, the surgeon general. And there is no time like the present
to get started. Americans are living longer than at any time in
history, so it is increasingly important to stay hale and hearty
for as long as our genes and life circumstances permit.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 objective of Healthy People 2010 is to get America
moving. Despite the enormous amount of attention being paid to
physical activity, the sedentary life is as popular as ever. Forty
percent of adults are still sitting on their duffs all day every
day. Only older people have made significant improvements in their
activity levels.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 percent of Americans now engage in moderate physical
activity like brisk walking, swimming, cycling, dancing or doing
yardwork, for at least 30 minutes at a time, five or more times a
week.
</P>
<P>
   And only 23 percent engage in vigorous physical activity, like
jogging, lap swimming and racquet sports, for 20 or more minutes at
a time three or more days a week.
</P>
<P>
   The modest goals for 2010 are to increase to at least 30 percent
the proportion of people who exercise five or more days a week,
increase to at least 30 percent the proportion who do vigorous
exercise, increase to at least 30 percent (from 19) those who do
activities that enhance strength and endurance and increase to at
least 40 percent (from 30 percent) those who do exercises to
enhance flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Participation in regular physical activity is the one behavioral
change that can have the greatest impact on health and longevity.
In addition to rejuvenating nearly every organ system, it reduces
the risk of heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes,
osteoporosis, obesity, stress-induced illness, mental and muscular
deterioration, falls and fractures and even cancer of the colon.
The surgeon general is calling on employers to help by offering
physical activity and fitness programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the nation's young people are now more sedentary than
ever. Only 20 percent of high school students engage in moderate
physical activity five or more times a week. School-based physical
activity has been declining steadily for years. The surgeon general
is asking not just for an increase in physical activity during
school hours, but also wants schools to provide after-school and
year-round access to their gyms and playing fields.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, too, are being asked to participate by assessing and
counseling patients about their physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   You've no doubt heard by now of the ``five-a-day'' program,
which suggests the minimum number of servings of fruits and
vegetables that people should consume daily. Only about 3 percent
of Americans 2 years old and older consume at least three daily
servings of vegetables (and a major proportion do it by consuming
fried potatoes, not the nutritious dark green and deep yellow
vegetables), and only 28 percent consume at least two daily
servings of fruit. Healthy People 2010 wants half the population to
be eating three vegetables and 75 percent to be eating two fruits
daily.
</P>
<P>
   There is probably no other change in eating habits that could
have a greater impact on health. Not a week goes by without a new
study proclaiming yet another health benefit from eating lots of
fruits and vegetables. The risks of developing debilitating
conditions like heart disease, stroke, cancers of the breast and
prostate and sight-robbing cataracts and macular degeneration are
reduced by consuming a plant-rich diet.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, grain-based foods and dried beans and peas are also
plant foods that are associated with better health. These, too, are
rich in protective nutrients and, if grains are unrefined, they are
excellent sources of dietary fiber, which can help to normalize
blood levels of cholesterol and sugar and keep weight under
control. When you eat fiber-rich foods, more is less _ you can
achieve greater dietary satisfaction for fewer calories. Fiber
fills you up before it fills you out.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of filling out, Americans not only failed to reach
the year 2000 goal, we have gotten worse. Some 35 percent are now
significantly overweight (as against 26 percent when the first goal
was established) and by the new standard for 2010, which wants us
leaner still for health reasons, a whopping 59 percent of Americans
are overweight, sporting a body-mass index BMI) of 25 or more. The
proportion who are obese, with a BMI of 30 or greater, has also
risen.
</P>
<P>
   By 2010, the surgeon general wants at least 60 percent of
Americans to be maintaining a healthy weight, with a BMI between
18.5 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   Now, only about two Americans in five fall within that range.
The BMI is calculated by multiplying your weight in pounds by 700,
then dividing the result by your height in inches and dividing that
result by your height in inches once more.
</P>
<P>
   Especially disturbing has been the rise in overweight and
obesity in children. About one child in 10 now weighs too much, a
figure that should be halved by 2010, the new report states.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to exercising more and eating more fruits and
vegetables, better weight control can be achieved by eating less
fat, which supplies more than double the calories of other
foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the percentage of calories from fats has declined from
about 40 percent to about 34 percent, Americans are eating as much
actual fat as ever. They are simply consuming more calories,
primarily as refined carbohydrates (sugars and white, low-fiber
starches).
</P>
<P>
   Although smoking by adults has fallen significantly since the
first Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health in 1964 so
that now only one in four people over 18 is a smoker, the 2000 goal
of 15 percent adult smokers was not achieved (the goal for 2010 is
12 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Most disturbing of all, however, has been the increase in
smoking by teen-agers, especially teen-age girls, who now are as
likely to smoke as boys. The 2010 target is for at most 21 percent
of high schoolers to have used any tobacco product, down from 43
percent in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth Arnold can recall a time when her memory was perfect. Years
ago, working as a college reference librarian, she could put her
finger on any piece of minutia at will. ``I remembered all the
books and what was in them,'' Mrs. Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 81, she finds her memory fuzzy. ``I forget the hour of
an appointment,'' she said. `` I forget who I'm going to see and
what I'm going to tell them. I started out with a very good memory.
It's a lot to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Such laments are hardly uncommon. Misplacing keys, forgetting
lunch dates, losing the car in the mall parking lot _ all are
thought to be a normal part of getting old.
</P>
<P>
   But is such memory loss necessary? As the blank stare of a blank
memory becomes a not-so-funny fact of more daily lives, researchers
are increasingly trying to answer that question.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, it is still thought to be generally true that
older people do not remember as well as younger people. Dr. Denise
C. Park, a professor of psychology and a senior research scientist
at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan
in Ann Arbor, says that when young and old people, ranging in age
from 20 to 90, are asked to listen to a series of numbers and
letters and then reverse the series, young people can remember and
manipulate longer lists faster.
</P>
<P>
   Older people also appear to have more attention problems. Dr.
Sandra Weintraub, associate professor of psychiatry and neurology
and clinical core director of the Alzheimer's Disease Center at
Northwestern University, found a conspicuous different between
older and younger people in a driving simulation experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The older group _ both those with good memories and those with
early Alzheimer's _ were more easily distracted by passing objects
and scenery than the younger group.
</P>
<P>
   But, studies have also shown that more than a third of the
elderly can remember the names and events in their lives as sharply
as their 20-year-old counterparts, suggesting that memory loss is
not necessarily inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   At research centers around the country, scientists are trying to
tease out the underlying causes for non-Alzheimer's-related memory
loss and, ultimately, to find a cure. In one lab, researchers have
improved the memories of older mice by tweaking certain
neurotransmitter levels.
</P>
<P>
   In another lab, investigators studying the effects of stress on
memory have found that the neurons needed for memory shrink in
response to high levels of stress hormones. Long-term exposure to
stress may lead to permanent changes in the brain, some experts
think.
</P>
<P>
   Still other researchers are studying identical and fraternal
twins to discover whether some people are genetically programmed to
become forgetful with old age. Early indications are that genes do
play some role, although experts debate how important it is.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, scientists may discover that age-related memory loss
may be a result of a combination of bad genes and a hard life. ``I
think it's a nature-nurture interaction, in large part,'' said Dr.
Bruce S. McEwen, professor and head of the laboratory for
neuroendocrinology at Rockefeller University in New York. ``A
genetic vulnerability increases the likelihood that experience will
have an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers only recently learned that ``normal'' age-related
memory loss might involve a different part of the hippocampus, a
small structure in the middle of the brain, than Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Several decades ago, scientists learned that the hippocampus was
central to learning and memory. In surgery to cure epilepsy,
doctors removed the hippocampus from a man, curing him of seizures,
but leaving him unable to store new memories.
</P>
<P>
   It was equivalent to having no save function on a computer, said
Dr. Scott A. Small, an assistant professor of neurology at the
Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. One has
the information as long as it is on the screen, but once something
new flashes on the monitor, the old data are lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you met this man at a dinner party, he would know who you
were as long as his attention was focused on you,'' Small said.
``If his attention was diverted in the middle of the conversation,
he would look at you as if he'd never met you before.''
</P>
<P>
   Small and his colleagues have been using functional MRI, an
imaging system sensitive to the activity of nerve cells, to get a
closer look at how Alzheimer's disease and mild age-related memory
loss affect the brain. In one experiment, the scientists put people
into a functional MRI and then watched as neurons sparked in
different regions of the hippocampus when the people remembered
others' faces.
</P>
<P>
   Scans from Alzheimer's patients showed next to no neuronal
activity in a section of the hippocampus called the entorhinal
cortex as well as a variety of other regions. Studies have shown
that the entorhinal cortex is the first area of the hippocampus to
be damaged by Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   But, in people with mild memory loss, the results were
different. In 8 of 12 people, the entorhinal cortex flashed
brightly, while another region, called the subiculum, also in the
hippocampus, glowed dully. The other four people had less activity
in the entorhinal cortex, but still more than those with
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suspect that those four people may have early
Alzheimer's. They will follow the 12 to see if it is possible to
predict who is at risk of developing the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Small and others suspect that the non-Alzheimer's related
deficits in memory are a result of faulty wiring rather than actual
nerve-cell death. Studies have shown that while the brain shrinks
in size, the number of cells stays relatively constant. So,
researchers now think that there is either a scarcity of certain
crucial neurotransmitters or that receptors designed to take up
these brain chemicals are malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the cause of the wiring problem is genes or environment
is the matter of some debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the million dollar question,'' said Dr. Richard
Mayeux, a professor of psychiatry and public health and director of
the Taub Institute on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain at
Columbia. ``There are suggestions from all over that mental
function is a heritable trait, albeit a complex one.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mayeux said, studies that followed twins found that
even in their 80s, identical pairs were often more similar with
respect to memory than fraternal twins. ``This doesn't mean that we
will identify one particular gene that controls preservation of
memory, but it really points to memory being a heritable trait,''
Mayeux said.
</P>
<P>
   While allowing that heredity may play a role in memory loss,
other researchers have focused on a host of environmental factors,
including stress, sex hormones and blood flow to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Large population studies have implicated stress in memory loss.
A 10-year MacArthur Foundation study found that ``self-efficacy,''
along with physical and mental activity, predicted good memory in
old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we called self-efficacy has to do with the control people
feel over their lives, whether they feel they can do something to
influence what happens in their daily lives,''` said Dr. Marilyn S.
Albert, a professor of psychiatry and neurology at Harvard. ``This
general feeling of control, we can think of as a sort of
anti-stress.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, laboratory researchers have looked only at the effects
of short-term stress, which appear not to be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our animal model of stress, you can largely reverse the
effects of stress as long as it hasn't gone on for a number of
weeks,'' McEwen of Rockefeller University said. ``This is actually
a gray area. We don't know yet how long it takes before you produce
permanent brain damage.''
</P>
<P>
   But McEwen says the kinds of stresses generated by tight
deadlines and high pressure jobs are probably not enough to
seriously affect the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``More likely it's the kind of stress experienced by a person at
the low end of the totem pole, in a meaningless job, in a lousy
environment, with bad interpersonal relationships,'' McEwen said.
``It comes from a sense of hopelessness, helplessness, despair and
depression.`
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have looked at other possible culprits to explain
age-related memory loss. Studies of post-menopausal women have
linked low levels of estrogen and testosterone to memory decline.
Some think a byproduct of oxygen metabolism _ free radicals _ could
be toxic to memory brain cells. Or the brain may simply be starving
to death as blood supply from the heart decreases with age.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers, rather than looking for causes, are seeking
treatments. In another Columbia laboratory, researchers are
improving the memories of mice with injections of a drug similar to
dopamine. If young mice are put in a maze several days in a row,
most will learn where the escape route is and go right to it, said
Dr. Eric L. Kandel, a professor at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   If middle-aged mice, those 12 to 14 months old, are in the same
maze for several days, fewer of them will remember how to negotiate
their way out. But when the middle-aged mice are given the dopamine
substitute, their memories improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a fountain of youth, but it restored most of their
function,'' Kandel said. ``The idea that we will one day come up
with a drug that cures all memory problems is a dream. I think it's
a decade away, at least.''

&HT;     COAST GUARD ICE BREAKERS ARE A HOT COMMODITY ON FROZEN HUDSON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ After a day on the Coast Guard cutter Hawser, every
member of the eight-person crew is sore.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve hours of breaking up ice will do that. Twelve hours of
driving the 64-ton, 400-horsepower ship up onto Hudson River ice
until it cracks, or smashing ``pancake'' ice into smaller pieces.
Each impact rocks the boat, jarring crew members.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the team spent half the day freeing two empty
barges belonging to a Troy scrap metal dealer from the foot-thick
ice. It was tedious work. One day later, the harbor was frozen
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nonstop,'' said Jim Todd, the officer in charge, as
the boat took another lurch. ``When we tie up, everybody's dead
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The past month has been a busy time for the Coast Guard
ice-breaking ships that patrol the Hudson _ two 140-foot cutters
and three 65-foot vessels like the Hawser. The river's been frozen
over since Jan. 13, the first time in nearly four years, and the
demand for the heating oil transported by barge has been high.
</P>
<P>
   But aboard the Hawser, ice is not the only thing on the minds of
the men. Some are also worried about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, faced with budget cuts, the Coast Guard seriously
considered cutting 11 ships like the Hawser from the budget,
including the three that patrol the Hudson. Each ship costs $83,000
a year in maintenance and $315,000 in compensation. After three
light winters, it seemed like an easy target for a federal agency
with dwindling funds.
</P>
<P>
   Before the winter began, the Coast Guard had a change of heart _
at least for 2000. What happens to the 65-footers next year is
still up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   That worries both Coast Guard crew members and the oil industry.
At the Port of Albany alone, 3.2 billion gallons arrived between
October 1998 and March 1999, and 90 percent was transported by
river barge (the rest comes by pipeline).
</P>
<P>
   That year, there was little ice to speak of. But this year, if
the Coast Guard did not keep a 100-foot-wide channel open for the
126-mile trip from New York City to Albany, the region would have a
considerable fuel shortfall, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every year we have to remind them how important
the ice-breaking operation is,'' said Thomas J. Peters, executive
vice president of the Empire State Petroleum Association. ``It's
absolutely critical to consumers in this state that the river be
kept open.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard breaks ice in Maine, Massachusetts, the Great
Lakes and, in colder years, as far south as Philadelphia. But since
the winter of 1995-96, these cutters have been doing little
ice-breaking. In New York, the past three mild winters had crews
painting the insides of lighthouses or giving ship tours to
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. The glory days of cutting ice are back. On some
stretches of the Hudson, the ice is 12 inches thick. On Thursday,
as the Hawser hovered around Troy, the 140-foot Sturgeon Bay headed
south from Albany, clearing a channel of frozen, slushy ``brash
ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the water line at the bow of the 662-ton, 2,500-horsepower
boat, the chunks of ice sound like gravel in a clothes dryer. On
the coldest days, barges and tugs will follow in a convoy to avoid
getting stuck in the quick-freezing water.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, the tug boat Rob Roy, pushing an empty barge
down to New York City after a fuel oil delivery to Albany, was
caught in an ice jam near West Point. Less than an hour later, the
Sturgeon Bay came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the bends, it's slow moving,'' said the thankful First Mate
Raymond Pierre, standing on the bridge watching the Coast Guard
free his ship. ``It's real, real thick. We'd be staying until
spring, until the ice melts,'' if the ice breaker hadn't come.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only half a dozen companies run barges up and down the Hudson.
There are 127 tug boats that do the work, but only a few dozen are
hardy enough to handle breaking through ice _ even brash ice. At
any one time in the winter, up to 10 barges from different
companies are on the river, said Pat Conlin, director of sales for
Bouchard Transportation Company Inc. on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Barges carry from one million to six million gallons of fuel.
Trips are planned carefully _ keeping the location of the nearest
Coast Guard ship in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every delay is money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard is not considering getting rid of the
140-footers, the ice-cutting powerhouses. These ships can glide
through even a foot of ice with barely a shudder. The 65-footers,
on the other hand, do more of the detail work _ going to areas like
Troy, inaccessible to the 140-footers because of a low bridge, or
maneuvering close to barges in water too shallow for the bigger
ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are truly the most multimission cutter the Coast Guard
has,'' said Chief Warrant Officer Richard Glasgow, who is based at
the Activities Base in Staten Island. ``I'm happy to say (the Coast
Guard) had enough foresight to say, `Let's hold onto them a little
bit longer.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 65 footers may require more money soon. While the two
120-footers are only a decade old, the smaller boats are twice as
old. That makes it more likely some will need refurbishment in the
near future, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we'll be around,'' said Todd from the bridge, as he
maneuvered the Hawser for another ice-crushing blow. ``I think this
boat does a great service.''

SIDE TRIPS ON `STRAIGHT TALK EXPRESS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ A presidential candidate can wiggle a bit, even
on the ``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush ``would make a good president of the United
States,'' John McCain said last week, as he motored around New
Hampshire on the campaign bus with the noble-sounding name.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two is that he, McCain, would make a
better president, the senator from Arizona explained.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was a pretty straightforward, although highly
subjective, assessment of the two leaders for the Republican White
House nomination.
</P>
<P>
   This was the same day, however, that McCain also was launching a
new television commercial in New Hampshire, claiming that ``there's
only one man running for president who knows the military and
understands the world _ John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that McCain really didn't mean it when he said on
the bus that Bush would make a good president?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to draw that conclusion, particularly since the ad, by
implication, says that Bush doesn't know the military and doesn't
understand the world. And if he doesn't, how could he be even a
mediocre president and commander in chief?
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the wiggle _ either on the ``Straight Talk Express'' or
in the TV ad.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush supporters _ ever so sensitive to such things _ may
have felt their candidate had again been victimized by a
``negative'' ad. In reality, though, the commercial, while pointed
and a bit creative, was easily within the bounds of fair play.
</P>
<P>
   Although Social Security and taxes, over which McCain and Bush
will continue to duel, may be on the minds of many New Hampshire
voters, McCain obviously believes that foreign affairs and
veterans' benefits are major concerns as well. New Hampshire, one
of the senator's campaign leaders noted, has one of the highest
populations, per capita, of veterans in the United States. And
South Carolina, one of the next key nominating tests, has an even
higher percentage of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   So it should be no surprise that McCain, who must score big in
New Hampshire, would attempt to contrast his military background
and foreign affairs experience with Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was a Navy pilot who spent five and one-half years in a
North Vietnamese prison camp. Bush was a Texas National Guard pilot
during the same era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not a hero in the Vietnam War,'' McCain tells voters.
But, pushing the right patriotic buttons, he adds, ``I was
privileged to serve in the company of heroes.``
</P>
<P>
   One man who attended a ``town hall'' meeting with McCain in
Hampton Beach the morning after the last New Hampshire presidential
debate may not end up voting for the Arizona senator. But the man
clearly was impressed with McCain's ``tough-enough'' background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched those damn fools last night who were trying to get
his goat (in the debate), and they forgot he was a POW,'' he was
overheard to tell a friend.
</P>
<P>
   As a U.S. senator, McCain has debated, negotiated and voted on
defense budgets, international treaties and other foreign affairs,
has visited foreign countries in an official capacity and met
foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's main foreign policy experience as governor of Texas has
been to praise the North American Free Trade Agreement and act as a
good will ambassador to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bush isn't the first governor with little foreign policy
experience to run for president. Most governors who run for
president don't have much foreign policy experience because that's
not part of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the last four presidents, however, were governors
before they were elected to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The only recent exception was Bush's father, former President
George Bush. And although his wealth of foreign affairs experience
and his World War II service record may have helped him win the
1988 election, even his success in Desert Storm couldn't boost him
to a second term against a governor who avoided military service
during Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Winning presidential elections and being a successful president
are obviously more than just having or claiming a longer foreign
affairs resume than your opponents. Some governors-turned-president
_ including Republican Ronald Reagan _ became known for foreign
policy successes. And the younger Bush, who has surrounded himself
with foreign policy experts, could prove the merits of high-level,
on-the-job training if he is elected to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But it is understandable that McCain would try to paint a
contrast.

<P>
   We can expect President Clinton to designate more national
monuments before he leaves office. Public support has been
overwhelming for his latest designations.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt
made it clear that other national monuments are being considered:
``There aren't going to be any surprises. There's no master list in
a file somewhere. But what the president has asked me to do is
where there is interest, expressed interest, to get out on the
ground and talk the issues through. And I've been doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the interview, Babbitt emphasized that these potential
sites are still in the talking stage: ``What we're doing is
responding to specific opportunities that are put up to us by local
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   In selecting potential sites for national monument status, the
Department of the Interior also looks at land use for the prior 10
years in terms of development and mining.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is a possible site of two new national monuments. Babbitt
plans to meet with the entire congressional delegation and the
governor about protecting Steens Mountain and Soda Mountain. Steens
Mountain, a geological wonder, is located in southeastern Oregon.
The Soda Mountain region, southeast of Ashland, has been long
recognized for its ecological significance, but faces the threats
posed by a jeep trail and the use of off-road vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said that they are all ``interested in putting together
legislation. And what I'm saying, that's fine. The issue is not
arguing about is it Congress or the president. The issue is
protecting our heritage. And in Oregon, I think we have an
excellent chance of getting a consensus bill worked out between the
delegation and the governor that will have administration support.
Such a bill, would by its own terms make the designation either as
a national monument or as a national conservation area.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has made three visits to Colorado and had discussions
with the delegation. The Department of the Interior has held public
meetings on the sites of interest: Canyon of the Ancients near
Cortez in southwest Colorado, the expansion of the Colorado
National Monument west of Grand Junction, and the possible
expansion of the Great Sand Dunes National Monument 25 miles
northeast of Alamosa.
</P>
<P>
   According to Babbitt, the expansion of the Great Sand Dunes
National Monument has the support of Colorado's congressional
delegation and the state attorney general. Actually, one member of
Colorado's congressional delegation brought the idea of monument's
expansion to Babbitt. There has been talk of expanding the site as
a national park.
</P>
<P>
   President Herbert Hoover designated the Great Sand Dunes
National Monument in 1932. The original boundary was further
enlarged through proclamations by presidents Harry Truman and
Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Babbitt has also discussed two potential national
monument sites with the state's congressional delegation: the Santa
Rosa Mountains near Palm Springs and the Carrizo Plain located in
the San Joaquin Valley near Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of presidential proclamations to make them national
monuments, Congress may offer legislation to protect those sites.
That would be the best scenario, according to Babbitt. Local
residents support special protection for these sites.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona may become home to another national monument, the Empire
Ranch near Tucson. The ranch has been administered by the Bureau of
Land Management since 1988. It encompasses a vast grasslands area
with a rich diversity of wildlife that is now threatened by
commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   And in Montana _ where the Missouri River begins its long
journey _ the river and other geological forces created the
Missouri Breaks at the Upper Missouri River, a landscape of unique,
white bluffs. There are discussions underway to see if there is
support to protect the Missouri Breaks as a national monument.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, after President Clinton designated the Grand
Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southeast Utah, Congress
attempted to limit the president's power under the Antiquities Act.
A bill to do just that passed the U.S. House, but failed in the
Senate even with the support of Utah's powerful Republican Sen.
Orrin Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., promises to introduce a bill in this
Congress to limit the power of the president under the Antiquities
Act. No doubt there will be some members of Congress who will go
along, but it is doubtful that such legislation will pass in an
election year when the public solidly supports the protection of
such national treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Antiquities Act of 1906 was passed into law, 14
presidents _ seven Republicans and seven Democrats _ have used its
power to designate important sites as national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the act had to be used swiftly to protect a site, as
was the case of the Muir Woods National Monument in California.
President Theodore Roosevelt acted in a mere 12 days after being
apprised of the threat to the redwood trees. Congress could not
have acted that quickly.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to attack the Antiquities Act. Congress passed
the act and it can undo any presidential proclamation of a national
monument it doesn't like by simply passing legislation to abolish
its status as a monument. Of the 106 national monuments created by
presidents, six have been abolished by congressional action. One of
those, the Gran Quivira National Monument in New Mexico, 80 years
later was redesignated as the Salinas Pueblo Missions National
Monument.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who was raised on a ranch near Cody, Wyo., ought to know
that Congress can abolish any particular site's status as a
national monument. In 1909, President William Taft designated the
Shoshone Cavern National Monument, a 210-acre site adjacent to
Cody. The designation was abolished by Congress in 1954 and the
cave and acreage was given to the city of Cody to be used as a
public park. The park was never successfully developed and reverted
back to the federal government in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The West's 100-year-old antagonism to public lands, federal
oversight of those lands and the Antiquities Act hasn't diminished.
But neither has urban growth and encroachment upon special public
landscapes diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, members of Congress from the West will have to
learn to live with the new national monuments. The nation, as a
whole, sees the need for special protection of certain selected
sites that are located on federal public lands.
</P>
<P>
   The American public has spoken clearly in poll after poll -- the
public lands are to be protected. The designation of national
monuments is one way to give greater protection to an area of
scientific or historic interest or of great and unusual beauty.

 BEACH BOY: LEONARDO DiCAPRIO ON FAME, `THE BEACH' AND, OH YEAH, (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Leonardo DiCaprio in a scene from ``The

 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It's been two years since ``Titanic,'' and Leonardo DiCaprio is
still fighting to keep his head above water.
 &HT;    ``Every single day I'm drowning in the rumors,'' says the
25-year-old actor, standing on a bluff overlooking a white sandy
beach in Maui.
 &HT;    And what rumors they are: The tabloids say that, during the
making of ``The Beach'' _ his latest film, opening Feb. 11 _
DiCaprio was attacked by sharks. He became paranoid about his food
being poisoned and hired food-tasters. He got co-star Virginie
Ledoyen pregnant _ an impressive feat, since apparently he was also
dating Carmen Electra.
 &HT;    ``I've been shocked in the last couple of years to find out how
easily people will lie about me,'' he says.
 &HT;    These days, he adds, he doesn't let it get to him.
 &HT;    ``There was a point, when `Titanic' first came out, that I took
everything personally,'' he says. ``If someone didn't like me,
misquoted me or lied about me, I was distraught. I couldn't live
with myself. I wanted to give a press conference every five
minutes.''
 &HT;    DiCaprio runs a hand through his windswept hair, pensive in a
black T-shirt and jeans.
 &HT;    ``Now I know that I have no control over my life _ the only
thing I can do is not feed the fire,'' he says. ``I just want my
work to speak for itself and who I am. Any other assumptions about
me can be made _ I just don't care anymore.
 &HT;    ``Fame is a monster that you have no control over,'' DiCaprio
says, throwing his hands up in the air. ``I'm at the point where I
just want to live my own life and defy my fame, because I can't
escape it.''
 &HT;    Escape is the name of the game in ``The Beach,'' which casts
DiCaprio as a young man who, with two companions, seeks fulfilment
on a remote tropical island, only to find that their island Eden
has its own stock of serpents.
 &HT;    It's a dark, quirky story which couldn't be less like
``Titanic'' (1997) or the equally romantic ``William Shakespeare's
Romeo and Juliet'' (1996) _ which, DiCaprio says, is no accident.
 &HT;    ``After `Titanic' I said, `Let's be very clear. I will not play
another doomed romantic hero,''' he recalls.
 &HT;    Instead, he chose Richard, the troubled protagonist of ``The
Beach.''
 &HT;    ``He eventually realizes, as we all do, that paradise is a false
concept,'' DiCaprio says. ``Paradise doesn't really exist. And you
have to make sacrifices and be selfish to achieve your version of
total happiness.''
 &HT;    Director Danny Boyle notes gleefully that DiCaprio's fan base of
adoring teen-age girls may find this a bit hard to take.
 &HT;    ``The studio was constantly handing me notes saying, `Why can't
Leo be a little nicer? Why does he have to lie to people in this
movie? Young girls aren't going to like the fact that he's a little
bit mean,''' the director says.
 &HT;    DiCaprio just shakes his head.
 &HT;    ``I'm playing a real human being,'' he says. ``He is neither a
hero nor a villain.''
 &HT;    If ``Titanic'' made DiCaprio a hero to thousands of young girls,
reports of his hard-partying lifestyle made him a villain to some
others. The actor, who makes no claims to be a role model, shrugs.
 &HT;    ``I didn't sit at home at first,'' DiCaprio says
matter-of-factly. ``I don't think I need to apologize about it _ I
won't be a hermit because it looks good.''
 &HT;    In the next breath, however, he protests that his reckless
lifestyle has been much exaggerated.
 &HT;    ``You know what? Most nights these days, I'm not running around
_ I'm sitting at home on a Friday night. I'm in my living room,
surfing the Web,'' he says, laughing. ``I'll log onto my own sites,
and no one believes that it's me.''
 &HT;    When he does go out, DiCaprio and his ``posse'' can count on an
escort of tabloid photographers _ which, the actor says, is all
right with him.
 &HT;    ``I'm not one to sit here, be bitter and complain about the
position I'm in these days,'' he says. ``There are pros and cons to
everything. You just adapt. I think the opportunities I have been
given for the job I love to do make it all worthwhile.
 &HT;    ``I'm smart enough to know that I could never even hope for all
these opportunities without the fame.''
 &HT;    That fame came on the heels of ``Titanic,'' which won Oscars for
Best Picture and Best Director, as well as an Best Actress
nomination for Kate Winslet _ but not one for DiCaprio. His absence
from the Academy Awards ceremony led to reports that he was sulking
over his omission.
 &HT;    Not so, says the actor, who did attend in 1994, when he was
nominated as Best Supporting Actor for ``What's Eating Gilbert
Grape'' (1993).
 &HT;    ``Nothing against those award shows, but I feel really
uncomfortable at those places,'' DiCaprio says. ``No, I wasn't
nominated, but I wasn't upset about it by any means.
 &HT;    ``During the `Titanic' year, I had no reason to go to the Oscars
_ not being nominated gave me a way out.''
 &HT;    There were also reports of friction between DiCaprio and
``Titanic'' director James Cameron, which he doesn't entirely deny.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I can tell you now that James Cameron has a certain type
of personality,'' DiCaprio says. ``The truth is that it takes a
commanding, general-like personality to do a movie like `Titanic.'
He wouldn't have been able to achieve what he did cinematically if
he couldn't control 1,000 people and contain the environment.''
 &HT;    He might work with Cameron again, he adds, if it were the right
script.
 &HT;    The script is also the answer to another hot rumor, that
DiCaprio will play the adult Annakin Skywalker in George Lucas'
second ``Star Wars'' prequel.
 &HT;    ``I have met with George Lucas,'' DiCaprio admits readily. ``I'm
interested. I'm a huge `Star Wars' fan. But I have to see a
script.''
 &HT;    And no, he adds, that's not a veiled criticism of ``The Phantom
Menace.''
 &HT;    ``I have to see a script of everything I will do,'' he says
firmly.
 &HT;    Those scripts are piling up at his new Los Angeles pad, which he
shares with ... no one. All rumors to the contrary, DiCaprio says
that there is no one special woman in his life.
 &HT;    ``I don't say that sadly,'' he insists. ``This is the time in my
life to focus on work. I still have this insane desire to perform
in front of people _ it has been that way since I was 5 years old.
 &HT;    ``Without sounding pretentious again,'' he adds, ``I really do
think of myself as an artist. And I think being an artist is about
the coolest thing in the world.''
 &HT;    His art will take him to Rome this spring, where he will star in
Martin Scorsese's ``Gangs of New York.'' Some have it pegged as
another potential blockbuster, but DiCaprio says he couldn't care
less.
 &HT;    ``I have no control _ over the box office, over the rumors, over
my life in some respects,'' he says, throwing up his hands and
feeling the brisk winds whipping over the ocean.
 &HT;    ``At this point,'' he says, ``I just let go and hope for the
best.''

QUESTIONS OF THE HEART: A VALENTINE'S-DAY MOVIE QUIZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Cher and Nicolas Cage in a scene from
``Moonstruck.'') 
 By S. BURELISON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Scholars disagree on who St. Valentine was and even how many
Valentines existed. But the most popular account has him as a Roman
bishop who aided young lovers _ and, in A.D. 270, was beheaded for
his efforts.
 &HT;    The idea of losing your head over love has not been lost in the
movies. In fact, romance has been a consistent ingredient
throughout film history.
 &HT;    The earliest snippets of film were usually everyday scenes _ a
sneeze, a boxer _ caught by the camera, but in 1896 the first
glimpse of movie affection was captured. Titled ``The Kiss'' _
a.k.a. ``The Widow Jones'' _ the whole ``picture'' lasted only
three minutes, focusing on the title osculation, and was critiqued
in one journal as ``disgusting.''
 &HT;    A decade later, ``An Exciting Honeymoon'' offered a little more
plot, but its seven-minute length _ and contemporary censorship _
limited how exciting the honeymoon could really get.
 &HT;    As films became longer, boy-meets-girl stories of laughter and
heartache became staples of the medium. And while out-and-out
romances were long relegated to ``women's picture'' status, love
has found its way into every genre from Westerns to war epics to
science fiction.
 &HT;    It may not always take conventional form, of course. King Kong
loved Fay Wray, Norman Bates loved his mother and Citizen Kane
loved his sled. And few would have guessed that the classic film
released on Valentine's Day in 1931 and advertised as ``The Story
of the Strangest Passion the World has Ever Known'' would be ...
``Dracula.''
 &HT;    Test your knowledge of more mainstream film romances with this
heart-tugging quiz.

Henreid)?
 &HT;    8. What famous couple shares a romantic spaghetti dinner behind
Tony's Restaurant?
 &HT;    9. As Richard Gere sweeps Debra Winger off her feet and out of
the paper factory in ``An Officer and a Gentleman'' (1982), what
Oscar-winning song is heard, and who's singing it?
 &HT;    10. ``Casablanca'' (1942) may be the most romantic film ever

sees her in Paris?
 &HT;    11. In ``When Harry Met Sally'' (1989), when and where does

 -0- 
 ANSWERS FOR THE HEART  
 &HT;    1. Her friends call Nina Yakushova ``Ninotchka,'' which is also
the name of the 1939 film promoted by MGM as ``Garbo Laughs!''
 &HT;    2. Ryan's bookstore is ``The Shop Around the Corner,'' a salute
to Ernst Lubitsch's classic film of 1940. A musical version, ``In
the Good Old Summertime,'' was released in 1949, and a stage
musical, ``She Loves Me,'' bowed on Broadway in 1963. All, however,
were derived from Miklos Laszlo's Hungarian play, ``Parfumerie''
(1937).
 &HT;    3. Kerr is hit by a car on her way to the Empire State Building,
where Grant is waiting for her ... at 5 p.m. on July 1.
 &HT;    4. Cage loves Cher and the opera _ which is why he wants to take
her to see ``La Boheme'' at the Metropolitan Opera.
 &HT;    5. Johnson's voiceover narration explains her character's
``Brief Encounter'' with a married man (Trevor Howard).
 &HT;    6. Because she dreams of `` ... a white house with a tree in the
front yard,'' Presley sends Ann-Margret a tree _ but no house.
 &HT;    7. ``Now Voyager'' sees Davis go from beast to beauty. It also
offers Henreid's memorable, if no longer politically correct, stunt
of lighting two cigarettes at once and then passing one to Davis.
 &HT;    8. On their first date, the title dogs in ``Lady and the Tramp''
(1955) dine blissfully in the alley behind Tony's.
 &HT;    9. Trick question: The song is ``Up Where We Belong,'' but no
one is singing it _ only an instrumental version plays during the
climactic scene. It isn't until the final credits roll that Joe
Cocker and Jennifer Warnes add the vocals.
 &HT;    10. As Rick recalls `` ... the Germans wore gray, you wore
blue'' _ though the film is in black-and-white. Ilsa adds, ``I put
that dress away,'' so she must have been wearing a blue dress.
 &HT;    11. Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet in 1977 at
the University of Chicago, prior to sharing an overnight drive to
New York.
 &HT;    12. The Butlers (Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh) honeymoon in New
Orleans, where Scarlett loves the cuisine but longs for Tara.
 &HT;    13. Lulamae _ who prefers to be called Holly Golightly _
receives a Cracker Jack ring from her lover Paul (George Peppard),
whom she calls ``Fred.'' But it features an engraving from her
favorite jewelry store, Tiffany.
 &HT;    14. Knowing that Barbra Streisand was Katie and Robert Redford
was Hubbell should surely revive memories of ``The Way We Were.''
 &HT;    15. Practically any of Woody Allen's screen love stories could
be called a ``nervous romance,'' but the phrase was found on
posters for ``Annie Hall'' (1977).
 &HT;    16. Frequently misquoted, West's line to Grant is actually ``Why
don't you come up some time and see me?''
 &HT;    17. In the original ``A Family Affair'' (1937), Margaret Marquis
played Polly Benedict, high-school sweetheart of Andy Hardy (Mickey
Rooney). For the next 12 films, however, Ann Rutherford took over
the role. After Andy leaves home for college in ``Andy Hardy's
Double Life'' (1942), however, Polly vanishes from the series'
final three films.
 &HT;    18. Grant spills orange juice on Roberts during their second
chance meeting, then invites her to his nearby apartment to clean
up.
 &HT;    19. Gable calls the motel blanket ``the wall of Jericho.'' Like
the original, that wall eventually comes down, in the final shot of
the movie.
 &HT;    20. Ryan O'Neal narrates the opening of the two-hanky ``Love
Story,'' with Ali MacGraw as ``a 25-year-old girl who died.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Haven't we been here before?
 &HT;    Mary Tyler Moore is playing Mary Richards again, engaged in
heated conversation with a smarmy young television editor _ an
exchange that ends with him deferring to Mary with the following
exit line: ``You're a rebel, baby. Ma'am. Baby, ma'am.''
 &HT;    After a few takes, director Barnet Kellman is satisfied. Scene
124A of ``Mary and Rhoda'' is in the can.
 &HT;    Moments later, star/executive producer Moore steps into a
hallway to talk about the much-anticipated television movie that
reunites her with Valerie Harper as Rhoda Morgenstern.
 &HT;    ``This is kind of blurring the lines, isn't it?'' the
63-year-old Moore says cheerfully, eyeing a television camera which
has arrived to tape her playing a scene in a television station
once again. ``It's nice to know that people are excited about what
we're doing.
 &HT;    ``Valerie has finished her scenes already,'' she adds, ``but
when we were working together, it was like coming home. We were
separated twins who came back together after 20 years apart and
were suddenly finishing each other's sentences again. That was such
a pleasure in front of the camera and a real personal glee for
me.''
 &HT;    The movie, which will air Feb. 7 on ABC, catches up with Mary
and Rhoda two-plus decades after the last episodes of ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show'' and its long-running spinoff, ``Rhoda.'' Mary is
a recent widow, Rhoda is divorced and both women are single mothers
struggling to get by in the Big Apple.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to make sure the movie was not a typical reunion,''
Moore says, looking professional in a greenish-gray skirt and
jacket offset by a distinctly less businesslike pair of black
slippers. ``Not an `Oh, there they are again. Isn't that swell?'
kind of thing.
 &HT;    ``I wanted a new story with real impact,'' she adds. ``I wanted
the patina of the years and the experience to show on these women.
Yes, two old friends come together _ but it's about how they deal
with their adult daughters, what they do in the '90s, how they face
being 60 and in the workplace.''
 &HT;    Moore must return to the set in a moment. Before doing so,
however, she confirms the general assumption that ``Mary and
Rhoda'' is a back-door pilot _ that the characters could return on
a weekly basis if the movie draws good enough ratings. Such other
``Mary Tyler Moore'' regulars as Ed Asner (Lou Grant), Betty White
(Sue Ann Nivens) or Cloris Leachman (Phyllis Lindstrom) might even
be involved.
 &HT;    ``I'm thrilled with the idea of doing this as a series,'' she
says. ``We could keep the story going between Mary and Rhoda, and
maybe also bring in Ed or Betty or Cloris from time to time.
 &HT;    ``I just don't know how practical it is for the network,'' she
adds. ``Networks today don't pay what I think of as proper respect
to the people who write and direct _ they send their minions to
dictate what is funny and what is not.
 &HT;    ``So there would have to be an understanding, going in, that the
kind of control I've had on this movie would continue.''
 &HT;    With that comment, a warm handshake and a promise to talk again
when ``Mary and Rhoda'' has wrapped production, Moore strides off.
 &HT;    A few weeks later, the actress follows through on her promise,
calling by telephone from her Manhattan apartment to report on the
finished product.
 &HT;    ``I am so thrilled with it,'' she says. ``It does what I hoped
it would do, which is stand alone as a story.''
 &HT;    Happy though she may be, Moore is now whistling a different tune
about a ``Mary and Rhoda'' series, amid rumors that she and Harper
didn't get along this time around.
 &HT;    ``I would not want to do it again,'' she says. ``At some point,
if somebody wanted to do another movie with, say, Lou Grant or
Phyllis, that would be great fun.
 &HT;    ``And I'm not against doing another series _ I just wouldn't
want to do this one.''
 &HT;    Why the change of heart?
 &HT;    ``Just too many impositions,'' Moore says quietly. ``Arbitrary
negative situations came up and took a little of the fun out of it
for me. While I'm thrilled with the way it turned out, I don't have
the energy to go through that kind of thing again.''
 &HT;    Thirty years ago, of course, Moore had no idea that anyone would
want to see more of Mary Richards. She'd enjoyed a successful run
on ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' (1961-1966), and while ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show'' sounded promising, nobody expected it to make
television history.
 &HT;    ``We had no idea,'' Moore says, laughing. ``We knew the show
would be good, because the spirit and the determination were there.
But there was never any inner epiphany about how it would play.
 &HT;    ``Nor should there ever be,'' she adds. ``When you do something
that turns out well, you're usually focused on the work and you're
not sitting around daydreaming about how it will be received.''
 &HT;    By the time the show faded to black with its famous group hug,
Moore wondered what the future might hold.
 &HT;    ``I was a little concerned that the shadow of Mary Richards
might be a problem,'' she admits, ``but it has never proven to be
that. I have gone from one very different role to another and in
various media.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Moore stunned audiences with her portrayal of an
emotionally frigid wife and mother in Robert Redford's
Oscar-winning ``Ordinary People'' (1980). She received a special
Tony Award for her performance as a quadriplegic in the Broadway
production of ``Whose Life Is It Anyway?'' (1980), and took home an
Emmy for the 1992 cable-television movie ``Stolen Babies.''
 &HT;    It hasn't all been joyous for Moore, however. She's survived
personal traumas and tragedies including the gunshot death of her
only son, which was ruled an accident. She's also struggled with
diabetes, drinking, failed marriages and quickly axed series.
 &HT;    In retrospect, she admits that she regrets having made her
career her life.
 &HT;    ``You can't have it all,'' she says plaintively. ``It is my
life, and I'm not necessarily proud that it is my life _ I wish I'd
had more children. I wish I could have done that better. I wish I
were a grandmother, and I will never be a grandmother.
 &HT;    ``But this has been my life,'' she says, ``and, given that, I'm
very proud of what has happened. I'm very glad that the audience
has seen fit to applaud my work.''
 &HT;    Away from the set these days, Moore spends time with her third
husband, Dr. S. Robert Levine, tends to her garden and horses at
the couple's country home and raises funds for the Juvenile
Diabetes Foundation and several animal-welfare organizations.
 &HT;    Moore also gives speeches to women's groups and students, during
which she discusses her work as an actress and her growth as a
person. It's caused her to re-evaluate her own life, and come to at
least one conclusion.
 &HT;    ``I'm not such a bad kid, after all,'' she says contentedly. ``I
started out as a perfectionist, and was always apologizing to
myself for not being better, for not having done more, for not
having thought of something to do other than what I did.
 &HT;    ``I've eased up on myself,'' she says, ``and in doing that I've
eased up on other people.
 &HT;    ``So Mary Tyler Moore has mellowed, and this is a good thing.''

``Will &AMP; Grace.'') 
 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before 13 February 2000. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Actors who play outlandish television characters are, usually,
quiet and reserved in real life. The zaniest buffoons are generally
virtual churchmice offscreen.
</P>
<P>
   And then again, there's Sean Hayes and there's Megan Mullally.
Better known as the quirky, combative Jack and Karen on the
sophomore series ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' they're actually even more
outrageous than the characters they play.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe, but it's true: After spending the
afternoon at a photo shoot with Mullally and Hayes, you realize
just how restrained their television performances really are.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Will &AMP; Grace'' finally finds its footing after a shaky
beginning to its second season, the characters of Jack McFarland
and Karen Walker have come into their own.
</P>
<P>
   Each started off as little more than a wacky caricature,
basically ids to the title characters' egos. But this season,
through some adroit writing, they have been fleshed out into fully
fledged sociopathic nightmares with the ability to sucker-punch
laughs out of an audience with relentless comic accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   They are the funniest duo working on television right now,
well-manicured hands down.
</P>
<P>
   As the photographer struggles to sweeten the photo set and give
it a Valentine's Day air, Mullally wanders over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love Valentine's Day,'' she says in a voice much
huskier and more thoughtful than her character's. ``I used to love
when we were little kids and we'd get valentines from people at
school _ I think that's so fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually collect antique valentines, from like the '20s and
'30s and the '10s and the Victorian era,'' she adds. ``I love old
valentines. Particularly from the '20s and '30s, though, there are
some cute ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes comes over to see what Mullally is saying, but screws up
his face on hearing the word ``Valentine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Valentine's Day is all about Saccharin for me _ it's all about
the chocolate,'' he says with a scowl, and then bursts out
laughing. ``Yes _ the sugar high!''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes and Mullally are fan favorites, more popular in many
circles than stars Eric McCormack and Debra Messing. Among ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' fans, a common refrain is, ``That show should be called
`Jack &AMP; Karen!'''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes should be flattered, but he bristles at the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Will and Grace, you can't have a Jack and Karen,'' he
says, all trace of laughter draining out of his voice. ``It's very
simple, because a half-hour of Jack and Karen would last about half
a season _ it's too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice balance, and it has become an ensemble,'' he says.
``It has developed into an ensemble show because you realize that
these four people need each other in some way, and it's not about
two people per se.''
</P>
<P>
   All four of the show's leads are accomplished singers, and the
writers are currently exploring the possibility of a completely
musical episode. Mullally, the cast's most experienced vocalist, is
predictably delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should be an operetta,'' she says cheerily. ``No
talking at all, just singing!''
</P>
<P>
   Between shoots on ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' Mullally has found time to
mount a one-woman musical show, entitled ``Sweetheart,'' twice in
the past year. She hopes to stage it again in Los Angeles, then
take it on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a really, really good director that is interested in
coming on,'' she says. ``That would be cool, because I really feel
like there are still some other places to go, creatively. It's
still not where I want it to be, but I really love it.''
</P>
<P>
   A CD of the show can be ordered online at
www.supremeprogram.com.
</P>
<P>
   Mullally and Hayes have nothing but praise for ``Will &AMP; Grace,''
the producers, McCormack and Messing. To all appearances there's
none of the jealousy that second bananas often nurse toward their
names-above-the-title colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ after a moment's thought, Hayes admits that one of
his co-stars really did get on his nerves. That would be ... the
now-departed Guapo the parrot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated that thing,'' he says, laughing. ``I would go down
with my arm to pick him up and he would peck at it. Parrots are
very temperamental, and they're only responsive to their trainers _
it takes a while for them to let other people in.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I had to work with it all week, and it senses if you're
scared. It kind of sensed that I was scared, so obviously it pecked
the s--t out of my arm! They put a little pad underneath my shirt,
so I just went for it. If you get close enough to their feet they
have no choice but to get on, so I just went for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my story,'' he says with a grimace, ``and I'm sticking
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's story lines include Jack's reunion with his father
and a continued exploration of Karen's sordid past, which began
with the revelation that she made a pornographic bondage flick in
her wild youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, honey, we shot footage for that,'' Mullally says, laughing
throatily. ``It was hilarious, but I guess it was too real or
something _ they never showed it on the show, you just heard it
coming out of the TV!''
</P>
<P>
   As its second season gathers steam, ``Will &AMP; Grace'' is looking
to many experts like a ``Seinfeld'' or an ``X-Files,'' shows that
took a while to find their feet but then blossomed into classics.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, Mullally and Hayes will have more than a
little to do with it, a fact which television insiders are already
acknowledging _ none more prominently than ``Frasier's'' David Hyde
Pierce, one of television's most accomplished scene-stealers.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting his Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy
last year, the actor departed from the usual thank-yous, saying
perfectly earnestly that he didn't really deserve the award, which
should have gone to Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty amazing,'' Hayes says, still seemingly awed.
``This is my reaction for about 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   He lets his mouth hang wide open, his eyes glazing over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' he says after a moment. ``I was at
home in my shorts eating popcorn, like `Wow, he just said that
guy's name from `Will &AMP; Grace!'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so weird, but it was really cool, too.''

 BEACH BOY: LEONARDO DiCAPRIO ON FAME, `THE BEACH' AND, OH YEAH, (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Leonardo DiCaprio in a scene from ``The

 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It's been two years since ``Titanic,'' and Leonardo DiCaprio is
still fighting to keep his head above water.
 &HT;    ``Every single day I'm drowning in the rumors,'' says the
25-year-old actor, standing on a bluff overlooking a white sandy
beach in Maui.
 &HT;    And what rumors they are: The tabloids say that, during the
making of ``The Beach'' _ his latest film, opening Feb. 11 _
DiCaprio was attacked by sharks. He became paranoid about his food
being poisoned and hired food-tasters. He got co-star Virginie
Ledoyen pregnant _ an impressive feat, since apparently he was also
dating Carmen Electra.
 &HT;    ``I've been shocked in the last couple of years to find out how
easily people will lie about me,'' he says.
 &HT;    These days, he adds, he doesn't let it get to him.
 &HT;    ``There was a point, when `Titanic' first came out, that I took
everything personally,'' he says. ``If someone didn't like me,
misquoted me or lied about me, I was distraught. I couldn't live
with myself. I wanted to give a press conference every five
minutes.''
 &HT;    DiCaprio runs a hand through his windswept hair, pensive in a
black T-shirt and jeans.
 &HT;    ``Now I know that I have no control over my life _ the only
thing I can do is not feed the fire,'' he says. ``I just want my
work to speak for itself and who I am. Any other assumptions about
me can be made _ I just don't care anymore.
 &HT;    ``Fame is a monster that you have no control over,'' DiCaprio
says, throwing his hands up in the air. ``I'm at the point where I
just want to live my own life and defy my fame, because I can't
escape it.''
 &HT;    Escape is the name of the game in ``The Beach,'' which casts
DiCaprio as a young man who, with two companions, seeks fulfilment
on a remote tropical island, only to find that their island Eden
has its own stock of serpents.
 &HT;    It's a dark, quirky story which couldn't be less like
``Titanic'' (1997) or the equally romantic ``William Shakespeare's
Romeo and Juliet'' (1996) _ which, DiCaprio says, is no accident.
 &HT;    ``After `Titanic' I said, `Let's be very clear. I will not play
another doomed romantic hero,''' he recalls.
 &HT;    Instead, he chose Richard, the troubled protagonist of ``The
Beach.''
 &HT;    ``He eventually realizes, as we all do, that paradise is a false
concept,'' DiCaprio says. ``Paradise doesn't really exist. And you
have to make sacrifices and be selfish to achieve your version of
total happiness.''
 &HT;    Director Danny Boyle notes gleefully that DiCaprio's fan base of
adoring teen-age girls may find this a bit hard to take.
 &HT;    ``The studio was constantly handing me notes saying, `Why can't
Leo be a little nicer? Why does he have to lie to people in this
movie? Young girls aren't going to like the fact that he's a little
bit mean,''' the director says.
 &HT;    DiCaprio just shakes his head.
 &HT;    ``I'm playing a real human being,'' he says. ``He is neither a
hero nor a villain.''
 &HT;    If ``Titanic'' made DiCaprio a hero to thousands of young girls,
reports of his hard-partying lifestyle made him a villain to some
others. The actor, who makes no claims to be a role model, shrugs.
 &HT;    ``I didn't sit at home at first,'' DiCaprio says
matter-of-factly. ``I don't think I need to apologize about it _ I
won't be a hermit because it looks good.''
 &HT;    In the next breath, however, he protests that his reckless
lifestyle has been much exaggerated.
 &HT;    ``You know what? Most nights these days, I'm not running around
_ I'm sitting at home on a Friday night. I'm in my living room,
surfing the Web,'' he says, laughing. ``I'll log onto my own sites,
and no one believes that it's me.''
 &HT;    When he does go out, DiCaprio and his ``posse'' can count on an
escort of tabloid photographers _ which, the actor says, is all
right with him.
 &HT;    ``I'm not one to sit here, be bitter and complain about the
position I'm in these days,'' he says. ``There are pros and cons to
everything. You just adapt. I think the opportunities I have been
given for the job I love to do make it all worthwhile.
 &HT;    ``I'm smart enough to know that I could never even hope for all
these opportunities without the fame.''
 &HT;    That fame came on the heels of ``Titanic,'' which won Oscars for
Best Picture and Best Director, as well as an Best Actress
nomination for Kate Winslet _ but not one for DiCaprio. His absence
from the Academy Awards ceremony led to reports that he was sulking
over his omission.
 &HT;    Not so, says the actor, who did attend in 1994, when he was
nominated as Best Supporting Actor for ``What's Eating Gilbert
Grape'' (1993).
 &HT;    ``Nothing against those award shows, but I feel really
uncomfortable at those places,'' DiCaprio says. ``No, I wasn't
nominated, but I wasn't upset about it by any means.
 &HT;    ``During the `Titanic' year, I had no reason to go to the Oscars
_ not being nominated gave me a way out.''
 &HT;    There were also reports of friction between DiCaprio and
``Titanic'' director James Cameron, which he doesn't entirely deny.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I can tell you now that James Cameron has a certain type
of personality,'' DiCaprio says. ``The truth is that it takes a
commanding, general-like personality to do a movie like `Titanic.'
He wouldn't have been able to achieve what he did cinematically if
he couldn't control 1,000 people and contain the environment.''
 &HT;    He might work with Cameron again, he adds, if it were the right
script.
 &HT;    The script is also the answer to another hot rumor, that
DiCaprio will play the adult Annakin Skywalker in George Lucas'
second ``Star Wars'' prequel.
 &HT;    ``I have met with George Lucas,'' DiCaprio admits readily. ``I'm
interested. I'm a huge `Star Wars' fan. But I have to see a
script.''
 &HT;    And no, he adds, that's not a veiled criticism of ``The Phantom
Menace.''
 &HT;    ``I have to see a script of everything I will do,'' he says
firmly.
 &HT;    Those scripts are piling up at his new Los Angeles pad, which he
shares with ... no one. All rumors to the contrary, DiCaprio says
that there is no one special woman in his life.
 &HT;    ``I don't say that sadly,'' he insists. ``This is the time in my
life to focus on work. I still have this insane desire to perform
in front of people _ it has been that way since I was 5 years old.
 &HT;    ``Without sounding pretentious again,'' he adds, ``I really do
think of myself as an artist. And I think being an artist is about
the coolest thing in the world.''
 &HT;    His art will take him to Rome this spring, where he will star in
Martin Scorsese's ``Gangs of New York.'' Some have it pegged as
another potential blockbuster, but DiCaprio says he couldn't care
less.
 &HT;    ``I have no control _ over the box office, over the rumors, over
my life in some respects,'' he says, throwing up his hands and
feeling the brisk winds whipping over the ocean.
 &HT;    ``At this point,'' he says, ``I just let go and hope for the
best.''

 By S. BURELISON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Scholars disagree on who St. Valentine was and even how many
Valentines existed. But the most popular account has him as a Roman
bishop who aided young lovers _ and, in A.D. 270, was beheaded for
his efforts.
 &HT;    The idea of losing your head over love has not been lost in the
movies. In fact, romance has been a consistent ingredient
throughout film history.
 &HT;    The earliest snippets of film were usually everyday scenes _ a
sneeze, a boxer _ caught by the camera, but in 1896 the first
glimpse of movie affection was captured. Titled ``The Kiss'' _
a.k.a. ``The Widow Jones'' _ the whole ``picture'' lasted only
three minutes, focusing on the title osculation, and was critiqued
in one journal as ``disgusting.''
 &HT;    A decade later, ``An Exciting Honeymoon'' offered a little more
plot, but its seven-minute length _ and contemporary censorship _
limited how exciting the honeymoon could really get.
 &HT;    As films became longer, boy-meets-girl stories of laughter and
heartache became staples of the medium. And while out-and-out
romances were long relegated to ``women's picture'' status, love
has found its way into every genre from Westerns to war epics to
science fiction.
 &HT;    It may not always take conventional form, of course. King Kong
loved Fay Wray, Norman Bates loved his mother and Citizen Kane
loved his sled. And few would have guessed that the classic film
released on Valentine's Day in 1931 and advertised as ``The Story
of the Strangest Passion the World has Ever Known'' would be ...
``Dracula.''

 -0- 
 ANSWERS FOR THE HEART  
 &HT;    1. Her friends call Nina Yakushova ``Ninotchka,'' which is also
the name of the 1939 film promoted by MGM as ``Garbo Laughs!''
 &HT;    2. Ryan's bookstore is ``The Shop Around the Corner,'' a salute
to Ernst Lubitsch's classic film of 1940. A musical version, ``In
the Good Old Summertime,'' was released in 1949, and a stage
musical, ``She Loves Me,'' bowed on Broadway in 1963. All, however,
were derived from Miklos Laszlo's Hungarian play, ``Parfumerie''
(1937).
 &HT;    3. Kerr is hit by a car on her way to the Empire State Building,
where Grant is waiting for her ... at 5 p.m. on July 1.
 &HT;    4. Cage loves Cher and the opera _ which is why he wants to take
her to see ``La Boheme'' at the Metropolitan Opera.
 &HT;    5. Johnson's voiceover narration explains her character's
``Brief Encounter'' with a married man (Trevor Howard).
 &HT;    6. Because she dreams of `` ... a white house with a tree in the
front yard,'' Presley sends Ann-Margret a tree _ but no house.
 &HT;    7. ``Now Voyager'' sees Davi go from beast to beauty. It also
offers Henreid's memorable, if no longer politically correct, stunt
of lighting two cigarettes at once and then passing one to Davis.
 &HT;    8. On their first date, the title dogs in ``Lady and the Tramp''
(1955) dine blissfully in the alley behind Tony's.
 &HT;    9. Trick question: The song is ``Up Where We Belong,'' but no
one is singing it _ only an instrumental version plays during the
climactic scene. It isn't until the final credits roll that Joe
Cocker and Jennifer Warnes add the vocals.
 &HT;    10. As Rick recalls `` ... the Germans wore gray, you wore
blue'' _ though the film is in black-and-white. Ilsa adds, ``I put
that dress away,'' so she must have been wearing a blue dress.
 &HT;    11. Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet in 1977 at
the University of Chicago, prior to sharing an overnight drive to
New York.
 &HT;    12. The Butlers (Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh) honeymoon in New
Orleans, where Scarlett loves the cuisine but longs for Tara.
 &HT;    13. Lulamae _ who prefers to be called Holly Golightly _
receives a Cracker Jack ring from her lover Paul (George Peppard),
whom she calls ``Fred.'' But it features an engraving from her
favorite jewelry store, Tiffany.
 &HT;    14. Knowing that Barbra Streisand was Katie and Robert Redford
was Hubbell should surely revive memories of ``The Way We Were.''
 &HT;    15. Practically any of Woody Allen's screen love stories could
be called a ``nervous romance,'' but the phrase was found on
posters for ``Annie Hall'' (1977).
 &HT;    16. Frequently misquoted, West's line to Grant is actually ``Why
don't you come up some time and see me?''
 &HT;    17. In the original ``A Family Affair'' (1937), Margaret Marquis
played Polly Benedict, high-school sweetheart of Andy Hardy (Mickey
Rooney). For the next 12 films, however, Ann Rutherford took over
the role. After Andy leaves home for college in ``Andy Hardy's
Double Life'' (1942), however, Polly vanishes from the series'
final three films.
 &HT;    18. Grant spills orange juice on Roberts during their second
chance meeting, then invites her to his nearby apartment to clean
up.
 &HT;    19. Gable calls the motel blanket ``the wall of Jericho.'' Like
the original, that wall eventually comes down, in the final shot of
the movie.
 &HT;    20. Ryan O'Neal narrates the opening of the two-hanky ``Love
Story,'' with Ali MacGraw as ``a 25-year-old girl who died.''

THE GIRLS ARE BACK IN TOWN: MARY TYLER MOORE RETEAMS WITH VALERIE
HARPER FOR `MARY AND RHODA'

 (Includes a color slide of Mary Tyler Moore with Valerie Harper in
a scene from ``Mary and Rhoda.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Haven't we been here before?
 &HT;    Mary Tyler Moore is playing Mary Richards again, engaged in
heated conversation with a smarmy young television editor _ an
exchange that ends with him deferring to Mary with the following
exit line: ``You're a rebel, baby. Ma'am. Baby, ma'am.''
 &HT;    After a few takes, director Barnet Kellman is satisfied. Scene
124A of ``Mary and Rhoda'' is in the can.
 &HT;    Moments later, star/executive producer Moore steps into a
hallway to talk about the much-anticipated television movie that
reunites her with Valerie Harper as Rhoda Morgenstern.
 &HT;    ``This is kind of blurring the lines, isn't it?'' the
63-year-old Moore says cheerfully, eyeing a television camera which
has arrived to tape her playing a scene in a television station
once again. ``It's nice to know that people are excited about what
we're doing.
 &HT;    ``Valerie has finished her scenes already,'' she adds, ``but
when we were working together, it was like coming home. We were
separated twins who came back together after 20 years apart and
were suddenly finishing each other's sentences again. That was such
a pleasure in front of the camera and a real personal glee for
me.''
 &HT;    The movie, which will air Feb. 7 on ABC, catches up with Mary
and Rhoda two-plus decades after the last episodes of ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show'' and its long-running spinoff, ``Rhoda.'' Mary is
a recent widow, Rhoda is divorced and both women are single mothers
struggling to get by in the Big Apple.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to make sure the movie was not a typical reunion,''
Moore says, looking professional in a greenish-gray skirt and
jacket offset by a distinctly less businesslike pair of black
slippers. ``Not an `Oh, there they are again. Isn't that swell?'
kind of thing.
 &HT;    ``I wanted a new story with real impact,'' she adds. ``I wanted
the patina of the years and the experience to show on these women.
Yes, two old friends come together _ but it's about how they deal
with their adult daughters, what they do in the '90s, how they face
being 60 and in the workplace.''
 &HT;    Moore must return to the set in a moment. Before doing so,
however, she confirms the general assumption that ``Mary and
Rhoda'' is a back-door pilot _ that the characters could return on
a weekly basis if the movie draws good enough ratings. Such other
``Mary Tyler Moore'' regulars as Ed Asner (Lou Grant), Betty White
(Sue Ann Nivens) or Cloris Leachman (Phyllis Lindstrom) might even
be involved.
 &HT;    ``I'm thrilled with the idea of doing this as a series,'' she
says. ``We could keep the story going between Mary and Rhoda, and
maybe also bring in Ed or Betty or Cloris from time to time.
 &HT;    ``I just don't know how practical it is for the network,'' she
adds. ``Networks today don't pay what I think of as proper respect
to the people who write and direct _ they send their minions to
dictate what is funny and what is not.
 &HT;    ``So there would have to be an understanding, going in, that the
kind of control I've had on this movie would continue.''
 &HT;    With that comment, a warm handshake and a promise to talk again
when ``Mary and Rhoda'' has wrapped production, Moore strides off.
 &HT;    A few weeks later, the actress follows through on her promise,
calling by telephone from her Manhattan apartment to report on the
finished product.
 &HT;    ``I am so thrilled with it,'' she says. ``It does what I hoped
it would do, which is stand alone as a story.''
 &HT;    Happy though she may be, Moore is now whistling a different tune
about a ``Mary and Rhoda'' series, amid rumors that she and Harper
didn't get along this time around.
 &HT;    ``I would not want to do it again,'' she says. ``At some point,
if somebody wanted to do another movie with, say, Lou Grant or
Phyllis, that would be great fun.
 &HT;    ``And I'm not against doing another series _ I just wouldn't
want to do this one.''
 &HT;    Why the change of heart?
 &HT;    ``Just too many impositions,'' Moore says quietly. ``Arbitrary
negative situations came up and took a little of the fun out of it
for me. While I'm thrilled with the way it turned out, I don't have
the energy to go through that kind of thing again.''
 &HT;    Thirty years ago, of course, Moore had no idea that anyone would
want to see more of Mary Richards. She'd enjoyed a successful run
on ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' (1961-1966), and while ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show'' sounded promising, nobody expected it to make
television history.
 &HT;    ``We had no idea,'' Moore says, laughing. ``We knew the show
would be good, because the spirit and the determination were there.
But there was never any inner epiphany about how it would play.
 &HT;    ``Nor should there ever be,'' she adds. ``When you do something
that turns out well, you're usually focused on the work and you're
not sitting around daydreaming about how it will be received.''
 &HT;    By the time the show faded to black with its famous group hug,
Moore wondered what the future might hold.
 &HT;    ``I was a little concerned that the shadow of Mary Richards
might be a problem,'' she admits, ``but it has never proven to be
that. I have gone from one very different role to another and in
various media.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Moore stunned audiences with her portrayal of an
emotionally frigid wife and mother in Robert Redford's
Oscar-winning ``Ordinary People'' (1980). She received a special
Tony Award for her performance as a quadriplegic in the Broadway
production of ``Whose Life Is It Anyway?'' (1980), and took home an
Emmy for the 1992 cable-television movie ``Stolen Babies.''
 &HT;    It hasn't all been joyous for Moore, however. She's survived
personal traumas and tragedies including the gunshot death of her
only son, which was ruled an accident. She's also struggled with
diabetes, drinking, failed marriages and quickly axed series.
 &HT;    In retrospect, she admits that she regrets having made her
career her life.
 &HT;    ``You can't have it all,'' she says plaintively. ``It is my
life, and I'm not necessarily proud that it is my life _ I wish I'd
had more children. I wish I could have done that better. I wish I
were a grandmother, and I will never be a grandmother.
 &HT;    ``But this has been my life,'' she says, ``and, given that, I'm
very proud of what has happened. I'm very glad that the audience
has seen fit to applaud my work.''
 &HT;    Away from the set these days, Moore spends time with her third
husband, Dr. S. Robert Levine, tends to her garden and horses at
the couple's country home and raises funds for the Juvenile
Diabetes Foundation and several animal-welfare organizations.
 &HT;    Moore also gives speeches to women's groups and students, during
which she discusses her work as an actress and her growth as a
person. It's caused her to re-evaluate her own life, and come to at
least one conclusion.
 &HT;    ``I'm not such a bad kid, after all,'' she says contentedly. ``I
started out as a perfectionist, and was always apologizing to
myself for not being better, for not having done more, for not
having thought of something to do other than what I did.
 &HT;    ``I've eased up on myself,'' she says, ``and in doing that I've
eased up on other people.
 &HT;    ``So Mary Tyler Moore has mellowed, and this is a good thing.''

 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before 13 February 2000. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Actors who play outlandish television characters are, usually,
quiet and reserved in real life. The zaniest buffoons are generally
virtual churchmice offscreen.
</P>
<P>
   And then again, there's Sean Hayes and there's Megan Mullally.
Better known as the quirky, combative Jack and Karen on the
sophomore series ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' they're actually even more
outrageous than the characters they play.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe, but it's true: After spending the
afternoon at a photo shoot with Mullally and Hayes, you realize
just how restrained their television performances really are.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Will &AMP; Grace'' finally finds its footing after a shaky
beginning to its second season, the characters of Jack McFarland
and Karen Walker have come into their own.
</P>
<P>
   Each started off as little more than a wacky caricature,
basically ids to the title characters' egos. But this season,
through some adroit writing, they have been fleshed out into fully
fledged sociopathic nightmares with the ability to sucker-punch
laughs out of an audience with relentless comic accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   They are the funniest duo working on television right now,
well-manicured hands down.
</P>
<P>
   As the photographer struggles to sweeten the photo set and give
it a Valentine's Day air, Mullally wanders over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love Valentine's Day,'' she says in a voice much
huskier and more thoughtful than her character's. ``I used to love
when we were little kids and we'd get valentines from people at
school _ I think that's so fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually collect antique valentines, from like the '20s and
'30s and the '10s and the Victorian era,'' she adds. ``I love old
valentines. Particularly from the '20s and '30s, though, there are
some cute ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes comes over to see what Mullally is saying, but screws up
his face on hearing the word ``Valentine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Valentine's Day is all about Saccharin for me _ it's all about
the chocolate,'' he says with a scowl, and then bursts out
laughing. ``Yes _ the sugar high!''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes and Mullally are fan favorites, more popular in many
circles than stars Eric McCormack and Debra Messing. Among ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' fans, a common refrain is, ``That show should be called
`Jack &AMP; Karen!'''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes should be flattered, but he bristles at the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Will and Grace, you can't have a Jack and Karen,'' he
says, all trace of laughter draining out of his voice. ``It's very
simple, because a half-hour of Jack and Karen would last about half
a season _ it's too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice balance, and it has become an ensemble,'' he says.
``It has developed into an ensemble show because you realize that
these four people need each other in some way, and it's not about
two people per se.''
</P>
<P>
   All four of the show's leads are accomplished singers, and the
writers are currently exploring the possibility of a completely
musical episode. Mullally, the cast's most experienced vocalist, is
predictably delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should be an operetta,'' she says cheerily. ``No
talking at all, just singing!''
</P>
<P>
   Between shoots on ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' Mullally has found time to
mount a one-woman musical show, entitled ``Sweetheart,'' twice in
the past year. She hopes to stage it again in Los Angeles, then
take it on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a really, really good director that is interested in
coming on,'' she says. ``That would be cool, because I really feel
like there are still some other places to go, creatively. It's
still not where I want it to be, but I really love it.''
</P>
<P>
   A CD of the show can be ordered online at
www.supremeprogram.com.
</P>
<P>
   Mullally and Hayes have nothing but praise for ``Will &AMP; Grace,''
the producers, McCormack and Messing. To all appearances there's
none of the jealousy that second bananas often nurse toward their
names-above-the-title colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ after a moment's thought, Hayes admits that one of
his co-stars really did get on his nerves. That would be ... the
now-departed Guapo the parrot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated that thing,'' he says, laughing. ``I would go down
with my arm to pick him up and he would peck at it. Parrots are
very temperamental, and they're only responsive to their trainers _
it takes a while for them to let other people in.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I had to work with it all week, and it senses if you're
scared. It kind of sensed that I was scared, so obviously it pecked
the s--t out of my arm! They put a little pad underneath my shirt,
so I just went for it. If you get close enough to their feet they
have no choice but to get on, so I just went for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my story,'' he says with a grimace, ``and I'm sticking
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's story lines include Jack's reunion with his father
and a continued exploration of Karen's sordid past, which began
with the revelation that she made a pornographic bondage flick in
her wild youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, honey, we shot footage for that,'' Mullally says, laughing
throatily. ``It was hilarious, but I guess it was too real or
something _ they never showed it on the show, you just heard it
coming out of the TV!''
</P>
<P>
   As its second season gathers steam, ``Will &AMP; Grace'' is looking
to many experts like a ``Seinfeld'' or an ``X-Files,'' shows that
took a while to find their feet but then blossomed into classics.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, Mullally and Hayes will have more than a
little to do with it, a fact which television insiders are already
acknowledging _ none more prominently than ``Frasier's'' David Hyde
Pierce, one of television's most accomplished scene-stealers.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting his Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy
last year, the actor departed from the usual thank-yous, saying
perfectly earnestly that he didn't really deserve the award, which
should have gone to Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty amazing,'' Hayes says, still seemingly awed.
``This is my reaction for about 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   He lets his mouth hang wide open, his eyes glazing over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' he says after a moment. ``I was at
home in my shorts eating popcorn, like `Wow, he just said that
guy's name from `Will &AMP; Grace!'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so weird, but it was really cool, too.''

   &UR; BEHAVIOR: The Chemistry of Unchecked Aggression &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Children who show a propensity for extreme aggression at young
ages often have low levels of a hormone produced by the body during
times of fear or stress, researchers have found.
</P>
<P>
   Although the findings may appear counterintuitive, scientists at
the University of Chicago Medical Center believe they may mean that
some violent people simply experience less fear than normal people,
leading to unchecked aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests to us that there is something fundamentally
abnormal in one of the systems that responds to stress,'' said Dr.
Keith McBurnett, the child clinical psychologist, who was the lead
author of the study published in The Archive of General Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers were prompted to conduct the study of children,
ages 7 to 12, by an earlier study that found that the most
antisocial prison inmates were ones who had low levels of the
hormone cortisol. Scientists wanted to see if the difference could
be found earlier on, and so over a four-year period they studied a
group of 38 boys who had been referred to a psychiatric clinic for
disruptive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Through interviews, the boys, their families and even their
classmates (who were asked, among other things, to list the three
meanest boys in the class), the scientists gauged the children's
penchant for acts like cruelty to animals or starting fights. They
also took a series of measurements of cortisol from saliva samples.
The 12 children who showed consistently low levels of the hormone
also proved to be three times as aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether the cortisol deficiency is genetic,
environmental or even if it can be caused by stress on the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Although McBurnett said the results were unlikely to lead to
improved diagnosis or treatment any time soon, he said they gave
insight into what might be going wrong biologically with aggressive
children.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTCOMES: Exploring Alzheimer's Early Roots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's remains a poorly understood disease, but one study
suggests a possible link between it and early life.
</P>
<P>
   One of the University of Washington researchers involved in the
study, Dr. Victoria M. Moceri, an epidemiologist, who presented the
research in the journal Neurology, said she was not claiming she
had found the cause of the debilitating illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many different causes of Alzheimer's disease,'' Dr.
Moceri said. ``One factor will not be unique to every person. There
are genetic risk factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware that early childhood factors play roles in a wide variety
of other illness, like cardiovascular disease, the researchers
reasoned that the same might be true for Alzheimer's. They were
especially interested because the areas of the brain showing the
first signs of the disease take the longest to develop, often
maturing well into adolescence, as crucial synaptic and other
connections are made.
</P>
<P>
   So they studied 700 members of a Washington HMO who were 60 or
over. Of those, 393 had Alzheimer's, and the rest showed no signs
of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say they found a link between the patients with
Alzheimer's and the conditions of their childhood homes. For
example, those with more than five siblings, which the researchers
associated with lower income generally, at least when the subjects
were children, had 39 percent more cases of Alzheimer's than other
members of the group. Those who grew up in the suburbs, on the
other hand, were less likely to develop the illness than those who
grew up in poorer farm areas or more crowded cities, places where
children would be more likely to be exposed to infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAUSE &AMP; EFFECT: Little Things That Aggravate Asthma &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists may be no closer to explaining why the incidence of
asthma has been escalating in the United States, but a new study
confirms that a number of common indoor materials may be making the
situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of
Sciences, has issued a report agreeing with those who believe that
factors like dust mites, secondhand smoke and allergens shed by
pets can play a role in making asthma worse for those who are
predisposed to the disease. The institute also recommended ways to
limit the irritants.
</P>
<P>
   More than 17 million Americans suffer from some form of
long-term respiratory disease, and since 1980, the prevalence of
asthma has increased by about 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, scientists working for the medical institute
reviewed the literature about asthma to try to determine what
substances, if any, might cause or worsen it.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest consensus involved dust mites, the tiny creatures
existing in virtually every household.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded that, for dust mites, the evidence showed that
they were a cause of the disease,'' said Dr. Thomas A.E.
Platts-Mills, the allergy division chief at the University of
Virginia Health Sciences Center and a member of the institute
committee that prepared the report. ``But for the other allergens,
the evidence as not as clear.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PATTERNS: For the Mentally Ill, a Gap in Cardiac Care &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mentally ill people who have heart attacks are less likely to be
offered the kind of treatment customarily available to other
patients, a new study reports.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Yale researchers wrote in The Journal of the
American Medical Association, patients with conditions like
schizophrenia are 32 percent less likely to undergo cardiovascular
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing the
cases of 113,653 patients 65 or older who had had heart attacks _
5,653 of whom were listed as mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   They found that those patients with mental disorders were 25
percent less likely to be given angioplasty to remove blockages, 32
percent less likely to have bypass surgery and 28 percent less
likely to have cardiac catheterization.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers were unable to establish a reason for the
disparity, but added that a variety of factors could be involved,
including difficulties dealing with disturbed patients and bias on
the part of the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies found differences in cardiovascular treatments
that appeared to have been related to the race and sex of the
patients, the Yale researchers noted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONSEQUENCES: A Darker Down Side for Mondays &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A British medical journal has reported that Monday is the most
common day for the Scots to suffer fatal heart attacks, and
researchers believe that increased drinking during the weekend may
explain the death rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish scientists, who reported their findings in The
British Medical Journal, recounted a study they made of coronary
heart disease from 1986 to 1995, a period during which about
170,000 people died from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   They found that Monday was the deadliest day for those under the
age of 50 who died outside of a hospital. The group accounted for
about 20 percent of the deaths in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Although they said other factors might play a role, they
theorized that drinking over the weekend could be one of the
causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possible link between binge drinking and deaths from
coronary heart disease has potentially important public health
implications and merits further investigation,'' the authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On a brighter note: Monday night tipplers seemed to have less to
worry about, since Tuesday saw the lowest number of heart attack
deaths.

SAME SONG, SECOND VERSE: A BUSH AND TAXES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush had ample reason to crow in
fall 1995, as the first laws carrying his signature began to take
effect: Welfare reform. A crackdown on juvenile offenders. Curbing
frivolous lawsuits. An education overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four for Four,'' a ``Texas Monthly'' headline had roared in
June, crediting Bush's determined adherence to his priorities as
the glue that held the various programs together.
</P>
<P>
   The new Republican governor said he'd like to use his political
capital to tackle a tougher issue: tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have enough (capital) to do it on my own,'' Bush
cautioned. ``It's not a one-man job.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was prophetic. Two years later, Bush watched
helplessly as a parade of senators walked into his office and
declared their opposition to a compromise plan that would have cut
taxes for some but raised them for others.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating the unpopularity of the legislation, one senator
said, ``The rest of you may want to drink poison Kool-Aid, but I'm
not,'' Bush writes in his autobiography, ``A Charge to Keep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One by one, they would not'' support the plan, Bush said. ``It
was most dramatic and most disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Bush's proposal for sweeping tax reform, which had
consumed him and the Texas Legislature for months, was dead.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, lawmakers voted to increase the standard homestead
exemption, saving the average homeowner about $140 on his or her
school property tax bill with no corresponding tax hikes. Many
complained later that local school tax increases wiped out those
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the bitter failure of the tax plan and the
overwhelming success of the 1995 initiatives provide a glimpse into
Bush's five years as governor of Texas. When sticking to his
popular core issues, he has built bipartisan coalitions,
compromised when necessary and generally enjoyed victory. But when
encountering more politically charged topics, such as tax reform
and last session's battle over hate crimes legislation, he has
tasted defeat or waited quietly on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that the soaring Texas economy has kept Bush from
being severely tested in Austin. But his GOP supporters say they
are confident that he possesses the traits to succeed as president
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that he's had a trial by fire,'' said state Sen.
Bill Ratliff, the Republican lawmaker who helped craft the
education reforms that Bush touted on the campaign trail in 1994.
``I don't know that that's his fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I served in one session where we had to raise gas taxes and we
had to raise some franchise taxes and so forth, and it wasn't
pleasant. My assessment of him is, he can steel himself for
whatever has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   GOOD GOVERNOR, GOOD TIMES
</P>
<P>
   Accessible. Charismatic. Cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Those words come up again and again when legislators describe
Bush's tenure in the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Toby Goodman, R-Arlington, said he marvels at Bush's
approachability, even when the two have disagreed. He said Bush at
times unexpectedly popped into his office or into mundane committee
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's odd for a governor to go to a committee to sit in on
hearing. (Former Gov.) Ann Richards never did that,'' Goodman said.
``He's been real accessible to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Glen Maxey, D-Austin, calls Bush a ``super nice guy'' who
``goes out of his way to make you feel like he knows you well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maxey, the only openly gay member of the Texas Legislature,
said Bush has avoided firm stands on controversial issues such as
the hate crimes bill in 1999. Opponents have echoed the criticism
on the presidential campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tends to run away from a lot of the nitty-gritty things
that could get somebody in trouble,'' Maxey said. ``He never got
out front or put his fingerprints on'' the hate crimes bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, describes Bush's gubernatorial
agenda as ``fairly modest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to come in and try to give
a tax cut when you have a record surplus,'' he said. ``I'd say he
did a good job as governor during the best of times. The real
challenge is: What kind of leader will he be, if the people give
him the opportunity, during the worst of times?''
</P>
<P>
   EXAMINING THE RECORD
</P>
<P>
   As Bush crisscrosses the nation in pursuit of the Republican
presidential nomination, his record as governor of the second
most-populous state is under increasing scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   During his two terms, he has worked with three legislatures. In
five years, Bush:
</P>
<P>
   _Advocated between $6 billion and $7 billion in tax cuts and
signed legislation enacting about $2.7 billion. Though the cuts
were popular, some claim that the state property tax reductions
were negated by local tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   _Vowed to return ``local control'' to and increase
accountability in public schools, to end ``social promotions'' and
fight for limited private school vouchers. Vouchers failed, but a
compromise bill curtailing social promotion passed in 1999. The
1995 education bill, which included local control and
accountability revisions, passed largely intact.
</P>
<P>
   _Spearheaded efforts to curtail damages awarded from lawsuits,
advocated a voluntary approach to reducing pollution from factories
exempted from clean air laws, and helped scrap an unpopular auto
tailpipe testing program.
</P>
<P>
   _Pushed for and signed legislation requiring that parents be
notified of a minor's abortion, signed compromise legislation
toughening the state's welfare laws and accepted a bill to limit
cities' ability to sue gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But the tax plan was the focus of Bush's second legislative
session.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was difficult because it required raising some taxes
and dissolving certain business exemptions to get the revenue
necessary to fund meaningful property tax reforms, lawmakers and
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's original proposal, many entities that do not pay
franchise taxes _ such as doctors, lawyers and accountants, who
typically organize as exempt partnerships _ would have been taxed.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for that and a higher general sales tax, property
taxes would have been lowered for both residential and commercial
property owners. The plan also used a $1 billion budget surplus to
achieve tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   Although some property-intensive companies liked the concept,
many politically powerful business interests did not, and they made
that known to lawmakers.
(MORE)
nn
</P>
<P>
   Tony Proffitt, a former aide to the late Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock
and now a private consultant with clients from both parties, said
many senators were taken aback by the new franchise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `We're going to put doctors in, we're going to put
lawyers in, we're going to put sole proprietors in.' They were
like, `Now, why are we doing this again?' '' Proffitt recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut effort was controversial from the beginning. The day
it was introduced, the bill's sponsor, Rep. Tom Craddick,
R-Midland, said he attached his name to the legislation as a
courtesy to Bush and declined to answer any questions about it.
</P>
<P>
   The structure of Bush's proposed ``business activity tax'' also
became contentious. The plan called for a 1.25 percent tax on
revenues over $500,000, minus the cost of goods and capital
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans alike called it an income tax _
something Texas has never had, and which polls show voters don't
want.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had vehemently opposed a state income tax, and he denied
that his plan would create one. But many lawmakers, including
Bush's own fellow Republicans, didn't buy that logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call a horse a donkey and it's still a horse. It was
an income tax,'' Goodman said. ``If it's a tax on gross revenue,
it's an income tax.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, a House committee dumped the plan and began
considering alternatives before settling on a bill that would cut
school property taxes by about half in many districts. But it
included more than $4 billion in increased tax revenue, raised in
part by the removal of many sales tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, quickly became problematic. Virtually every industry
whose exemption was to be removed, ranging from aviation fuel to
hair-cutting services, protested loudly. The compromise would also
have raised cigarette taxes by 25 cents a pack.
</P>
<P>
   The plan eventually passed a cautious House in the final weeks
of the session, although half the Republicans voted against it.
Bush watched the debate on closed-circuit TV and made a rare
appearance on the floor to offer his support.
</P>
<P>
   But that House vote was as close as Texas came to dramatically
restructuring taxes on Bush's watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something finally emerged from the House, it was not
agreeable to Bush's own Republican senators,'' Proffitt said. ``So
Bullock told him it was dead unless he could turn his own people
around.''
</P>
<P>
   He could not, and legislators settled for something Bullock had
proposed months earlier: an increased homestead exemption, paid for
with the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he sincerely thought this was a way, as a
conservative, to provide leadership,'' Proffitt said of Bush's
tax-cutting mission. ``Of course, it begs the point of, `well, did
he have enough experience or enough understanding of the
Legislature to cut this deal?'
</P>
<P>
   ``As it turns out, apparently he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   WORKING WITH DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   The problems of 1997 stand in stark contrast to the 1995
session, which Bush supporters cite as a model of bipartisan
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1994, it became clear that Bush was seriously gaining on
Richards among likely voters, despite polls showing the incumbent
Democrat with historically high approval ratings _ about 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that he would win, Bush decided to pay a visit to
Bullock, the crusty Democratic powerhouse of the Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   After some small talk, Bullock cut to the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very, very disappointed, and still am, in Ann
Richards,'' Bullock told Bush, according to the biography ``First
Son: George W. Bush and the Bush Family Dynasty.'' ``If you're
going to be that kind of pussy-footing, headline-grabbing,
television-grabbing governor, forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied: ``I'm going to work with you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of a close friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock crossed party lines to endorse Bush's re-election bid in
1998, and praised his prospects as a presidential candidate before
he died of lung cancer last year.
</P>
<P>
   That tendency to reach out to would-be enemies has served Bush
well, said many lawmakers, including those who have had policy
disagreements with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann probably had a staff that had more of a political agenda
of their own than Bush's staff at the beginning,'' said House
Speaker Pete Laney, D-Hale Center. ``Sometimes you've got to give a
little bit on your cause to make the system work.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Laney credits Bush for making things ``work smooth from
the executive branch standpoint'' in 1995, the speaker said much of
what the governor advocated on the campaign trail was already in
the works in the Democrat-controlled Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tracked what we were doing pretty close,'' Laney said. ``I
think it was probably, one, good politics on his part, but it also
was probably what his focus groups were telling him what the public
was talking about. And if the Republicans hadn't been talking about
it, we probably wouldn't have been talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ART OF COMPROMISE
</P>
<P>
   Observers say Bush can legitimately claim success in each of the
four areas where he focused his energy in that first session. But
he also had to accept significant compromise and change.
</P>
<P>
   In reforming the way lawsuits are handled, the Legislature
approved caps on punitive damages of $750,000 _ higher than lots of
Republicans wanted but not high enough for many Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also approved changes in the way juvenile offenders
are handled. They lowered, for example, the age at which juveniles
can be tried as adults from 15 to 14 _ something Bush had strongly
advocated.
</P>
<P>
   In the welfare reform effort, Bush suffered a couple of serious
setbacks. He had fought hard for his campaign promise of capping
benefits to women who have more children while on welfare. But
Bullock didn't like the idea, and it didn't make it in the final
version.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill, which Bush called ``watered-down,'' also
did not contain the lifetime cap on cash welfare benefits that Bush
sought.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Bush's agenda was decentralizing public
education by giving local districts more control over their
programs and curriculum. Many now cite the law as at least
partially responsible for improved education statistics. (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff, the Mount Pleasant Republican who chairs the Senate
Education Committee, said in July that the school district
accountability system put in place in 1993, before Bush took
office, is ``the major reason that things are improving.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview this year, Ratliff said the 1993 reforms
were a precursor to even more difficult reforms that occurred in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (1993 reform) only got us the foundation so that we could
take the controls off (in 1995,) the decontrol and removal of all
the mandates, and frankly between the two that was the harder
task,'' Ratliff said. ``I'm convinced we never could have put in
place the massive reforms we put in place in 1995 if it hadn't been
for his extraordinary support.''
</P>
<P>
   Both inside and outside the legislative arena, Bush also had a
hand in shaping the state's environmental policies, which have
since come under sharp attack. Houston has the nation's dirtiest
air and the federal government is coming down hard on local and
state government agencies with mandates to clean up the air in
North Texas and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush says the state is making progress toward cleaner air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas leads the nation in the reduction of toxic waste. We've
reduced industrial emissions,'' he said. ``I signed an electric
deregulation bill that was hailed by the Environmental Defense Fund
as one of the best bills in the country in terms of reducing
industrial pollution. ... We're making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   That electric restructuring bill was signed into law during the
legislative session that began in January 1999. By that time, the
governor was well on his way to a presidential campaign, and the
eyes of the national media were on Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One aim of deregulation was to reduce emissions from electric
power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had for months been insisting on an industry-backed,
voluntary approach to reducing pollution from so-called
``grandfathered'' plants, which had for three decades been exempt
from modern clean-air laws.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists were surprised, therefore, when he agreed
to a provision that made emission reductions mandatory for
grandfathered utility plants.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks earlier, Bush had also stunned environmentalists and
business leaders alike when he shifted his position on global
warming, saying he had been convinced the planet is indeed getting
hotter. He had said before that the science was inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   HATE CRIMES MELTDOWN
</P>
<P>
   As in 1995, the 1999 session also featured tightly organized
priorities that Bush advocated.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not get everything he wanted _ a plan for
publicly funded private school vouchers failed, for example _ much
of his agenda passed.
</P>
<P>
   Among those items: business and property tax cuts, a law
requiring parental notification when minors receive abortions, and
a huge boost in state funding for education.
</P>
<P>
   One item that was not on Bush's priority list in 1999 _ or his
political radar screen, critics say _ was a bill strengthening laws
against hate crimes. It would prove to be a key moment in the 76th
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, the Houston Democrat who gives Bush high marks for
working with minority lawmakers like him, had named the bill in
honor of James Byrd Jr., the black man whose dragging death
horrified the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Before debate over the legislation ended, a bitter partisan
fight would temporarily shut down the Senate, threaten to kill off
dozens of unrelated measures and prompt President Clinton to urge
Bush's support for the measure during an Austin appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Bush) saw it coming,'' Ellis said. ``I don't
think they realized how that issue became such a hot button and had
the potential of blowing up the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not publicly stake a position and stayed out of the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood back and said I was going to analyze the bill once it
made it off the floor of the Senate. It never did,'' he said at an
appearance in Dallas shortly after the bill failed.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the sticking point was a provision that extended
protections to homosexuals. Ellis said some Republican senators
told him that if he dropped gays from the bill it would pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody in this building understood the real issue
was the fear of a backlash by having the phrase `sexual
orientation' in the bill, that you'd have a backlash from the right
wing of the Republican Party,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denied that the gay issue was the only sticking point,
telling reporters ``good people just couldn't agree.'' However,
Bush did say he was opposed to including homosexuals in the hate
crimes law.
</P>
<P>
   BIPARTISAN PARADE
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, state lawmakers disagree about whether Bush has had
a positive impact on Texas during his five years as governor.
</P>
<P>
   One view, held by his most vociferous detractors, is that Bush
takes credit for successes that were not of his making. They say
that the one time he abandoned that strategy _ in the 1997 tax
reform effort _ he faltered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush waits for Democrats to do the real work and make the
tough decisions, then he jumps out in front of the parade to make
it look like he's leading it,'' state Democratic Party Chairwoman
Molly Beth Malcolm said. ``When he tried to break out on his own
and be a real leader, he fell flat on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Chris Harris, R-Arlington, said the various reforms
that have passed on Bush's watch _ from tax cuts to education
rewrites _ would not have happened had it not been for the
governor's ability to build coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his career as governor he has been able to get a
substantial number of things passed and do it in a way where
everybody thought they were a party to it,'' Harris said. ``I think
his bipartisanship is his strength.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Catholic priests in the United States are dying of
AIDS at least four times faster than the general population,
largely as a result of homosexual contact that the church hierarchy
has anxiously sought to hush up, according to an extensive study
published in the Kansas City Star newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, which began publishing a series of reports on Sunday,
found medical records or family testimony on around 100 priests who
had died of AIDS since the mid-1980s, and secondhand evidence of
another 200 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts put the total number of deaths as high as 1,000,
out of a national Catholic priesthood of 46,000.
</P>
<P>
   A survey sent out by the paper to around 3,000 priests received
800 replies, many of them very frank about the failings of the
church to equip seminarians psychologically for their vow of
chastity and to acknowledge the tragic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 percent of respondents said they personally knew at
least one priest who had died of AIDS, and one in three said they
knew priests who were either ill with AIDS or HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this speaks to a failure on the part of the church,''
Thomas Gumbleton, an auxiliary bishop in Detroit, told the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay priests and heterosexual priests didn't know how to handle
their sexuality, their sexual drive... How to be celibate and to be
gay at the same time, and how to be celibate and heterosexual at
the same time, that's what we were never really taught how to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A gay priest, responding to the survey anonymously, added: ``I
don't think the real problem is HIV/AIDS but rather the basic
dishonesty of the church with regard to all sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priests and others have to disguise and hide their sexuality
in all sorts of ways and of course this leads to unhealthy sexual
expression.''
</P>
<P>
   The high degree of HIV infection in the priesthood strikes at
the core of present Catholic doctrine, which preaches abstinence as
the solution for nearly all sex issues outside the confines of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It is not entirely surprising, however, that U.S. priests were
willing to talk to the Kansas City Star, since the American
Catholic church has for many years been lobbying the Vatican _
unsuccessfully _ to loosen its strict zero-tolerance policies on
safe sex, contraception, active homosexuality and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Vatican and senior U.S. church officials refused to
comment on the findings.
</P>
<P>
   According to the paper's research, the U.S. church has increased
its level of counselling on sexuality in seminaries and has now
made an AIDS test a requirement before ordination. But for years it
applied pressure on doctors not to declare AIDS or obvious
AIDS-related illnesses as the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   When Emerson Moore, a bishop from New York, died in a Minnesota
hospice in 1995, his death certificate listed his occupation as
``laborer'' and said he died of ``unknown natural causes.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was only changed to ``HIV-related illness''
following a formal complaint from a local AIDS activist. &QL;

`DEGAS TO PICASSO' EXPLORES THE ROLE OF PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE CREATIVE
PROCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ANDREW MARTON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plenty might have gone awry with ``Degas to Picasso: Painters,
Sculptors, and the Camera,'' the Dallas Museum of Art's sprawling
new exhibit opening on Tuesday. Its roster of 14 post-impressionist
and symbolist artists is a recipe for aesthetic overkill. Its
400-plus works risks being more exhausting than stimulating. And
the need for at least an hour to absorb the exhibit flies in the
face of what appears to be the current fad for narrowcast shows
catering to shrinking attention spans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is precisely the scope of ``Degas to Picasso'' that
serves as its greatest asset. From the grand tableaux of Edgar
Degas and Pablo Picasso, the majestic sculptures of Auguste Rodin,
to the smaller, more sensual works by Pierre Bonnard and Edouard
Vuillard, any novice gallery patron will have much to feast on. As
for the seasoned art aficionado, the show's sheer girth allows for
plenty of scholarly exploration of the role of photography in the
mysterious alchemy of creating a grand painting or sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of this exhibit made a fortuitous decision. They
shrewdly larded the show with plenty of choice artworks, as its
cerebral premise might have ponderously clouded over the
collection's beauty. The impetus for ``Degas to Picasso'' is very
much a curatorial one; the show is the ambitious brainchild of the
DMA's curator of European art, Dorothy Kosinski. Kosinski, the
editor of the exhibit's opulent catalog, is a passionately erudite
champion of the underappreciated role photography played at the
dawn of the 20th century in stimulating a slew of artists from
Paris to Prague.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the show is sometimes fuzzy in its focus, shifting
between photography as artistic influence or as individual art form
capable of exposing a Freudian inner landscape. Still, the exhibit
never wavers from its theme: introducing the camera as a new tool
in the hands of artists previously associated only with a brush or
chisel. So on the one hand there is the familiar beauty of Degas'
canvas ``Blue Dancers.'' On the other, it is paired with
photographer Eadweard Muybridge's lineup of dancers, all done in
poses implying that Degas made use of the shots to help him
choreograph his ballerinas.
</P>
<P>
   But _ and this is the exhibit at its most innovative _ there are
several photographs taken ``by'' Degas. The self-portraits, along
with a particularly inspired shot of Pierre-Auguste Renoir,
constitute a voyeur's dream, allowing the viewer access to Degas'
private photo album. It is particularly amusing to consider that
many great painters of Degas' echelon, though avid users of this
emerging tool, all sniffed at photography's claim to be art. That
the artists would continue to use the camera for their own art only
underscores their hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of ``Degas to Picasso'' is at its most literal in
the painting ``Wayfaring Poet,'' by Gustave Moreau. This 1891 work
is preceded by several preparatory studies. But unlike classic
preliminary work done in charcoal or pen and ink, Moreau used Henri
Rupp's photo ``Male Model Posing for `Wayfaring Poet.''' This shot
provided Moreau with almost the exact position of the arms, leg and
any other detail that Moreau used in his final canvas. The only
major difference is gender, as Moreau's ethereal poet is most
assuredly a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The forest of Rodin sculptures in the exhibit's third gallery is
alone worth the price of admission. It is difficult not to spend an
hour just basking in ``Shade, Adam,'' excerpted from Rodin's grand
``The Gates of Hell,'' or any one of the grandiose ``Balzac''
bronzes. The accompanying photos by, among others, Jean-Francois
Limet and Jacques-Ernst Bulloz are certainly serviceable homages to
Rodin's works, but they seem inconsequential compared with Edward
Steichen's sepulchral shots, especially one of the Balzacs titled
``The Silhouette, 4 a.m., Meudon.'' Here, Steichen transforms the
pompous Balzac figure into someone otherworldly.
</P>
<P>
   The Paul Gauguin section reveals that the exhibition has a more
ambitious agenda than first thought. Rather than just plumb the tie
between photography, painting and sculpture, the exhibit hopes to
dissect the flesh and bone of the artistic process. As the Gauguin
room makes clear, artistic inspiration don't always emerge from a
live scene. More likely, art can be midwifed from such varied
elements as photographs, plaster casts, wax imprints and
illustrated journals, all contributing to the final canvas.
</P>
<P>
   A series of Charles Spitz's sepia-hued photos of Tahitian
thatched huts and banana-toting natives clearly gave much artistic
grist for Gauguin's paintings. The photos take on the role of a
kind of intermediate veil or substitute truth. In ``The Large Tree
(Te raau rahi),'' the finely detailed bamboo logs echo the Spitz
photo, ``Tahiti: Indigenous Dance.'' And in a stunning bit of
replication, Gauguin's richly colored ``Melancholic (Faaturuma)''
calls on inspirational sources mimicking the pose used by Henri
Lemasson in his photographic study, ``Half-Tahitian Woman'' and
found in an anonymous reproduction of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot's
``The Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   While this section of the exhibit clearly illustrates the
protean origins of artistic inspiration, it sometimes neglects to
delineate fully the bridge between one medium and another. Where
Gauguin is concerned, it is a stretch to connect the posed figures
on the photo of the ``Relief on Temple at Borobudur, Java'' and the
positioning of three of the figures in Gauguin's ``Change of
Residence.''
</P>
<P>
   The photographs of Milanese-trained sculptor Medardo Rosso's
wax-over-plaster figures actually transform the original
sculptures. All of the ridges and crevices of Rosso's ``The
Concierge (La Portinaia)'' seem to melt away in the photo of the
same work.
</P>
<P>
   One is pleasantly torn between Edvard Munch's grandiloquent oils
of ``Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche'' or ``Female Nude (Anna)'' and
his scrapbook of photographic self-portraits. The photos show
Munch's fascination with how a Kodak box camera captures light and
shadow through under- and overexposure and with photographic
accidents producing inadvertent halos.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Munch's beautifully realized oil ``Friedrich
Nietzsche'' relied on such disparate source material as a postcard
of Nietzsche and a Hans Olde photograph of the philosopher. Yet the
exhibition falls short by not elaborating on which aspects of the
photograph's texture or lighting actually shaped Munch's resulting
canvas.
</P>
<P>
   What ``is'' made clear is that the photographs can actually
transform the artist from behind-the-scenes interpreter to upfront
actor. This is never more evident than in the work of Franz von
Stuck, where a photo of him posing with his wife duplicates the
exact position of John and Mary in his ``Crucifixion of Christ.''
Von Stuck's campy Kodak moment is easily as illuminating as his
painting.
</P>
<P>
   As for Constantin Brancusi, while the exhibit contains two
lovely sculptures including the maple, limestone and oak ``The
Sorceress,'' it is the series of self-portraits of the Romanian
artist at work, the proletarian craftsman caught in an inky studio
corner, that commands attention. And a Brancusi photo of ``The
Kiss,'' made roughly 12 years after he cast the original in
plaster, obscures the sculpture's original effect. The statue
delivers the embrace's passion, while the photo makes it clinical
and distant.
</P>
<P>
   The final Picasso section is, in this rich collection, perhaps
the most haphazardly presented. Though the viewer is rightfully
hypnotized by the two wondrous paintings _ ``Two Youths (Les
Adolescents)'' and ``Boy With a Pipe'' _ representing respectively
Picasso's rose and blue periods, there is a surfeit of pen-and-ink
studies, charcoal on paper and watercolors, in addition to
photographs, some of which are too tangential to Picasso's final
work to be germane.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is precisely this attic's box of influences in the
Picasso section that drives home the exhibition's ultimate raison
d'etre. While the camera's influence on the final art is manifestly
clear, the exhibition can't ignore the art's other conspiring
forces. Though uneven at times, this show should be commended for
attempting to disentangle the chaos of creativity, atomizing it
down to something as innocuous as a Kodak snapshot.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Every Sunday for the past 29 years, a storefront
church in the heart of San Francisco has swayed to the mellifluous
tones and odd rhythms of jazz legend John Coltrane in the name of
divine worship.
</P>
<P>
   The music is not a prop, but the very key to the Almighty. For
this is no ordinary house of God, but the St. John Coltrane African
Orthodox Church, the first place on earth to turn a jazz saxophone
player into an object of religious devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz fans have been quietly coming for years, as have local
aficionados bedazzled by the mystic allure of Coltrane's sleeve
notes for his 1964 album, ``A Love Supreme'' (reproduced right).
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in fact, the church has become something of a minor
San Francisco institution, offering food and clothing to the
homeless as well as a free education in be-bop era jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But that all now looks like it will be coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The building containing the church has been sold, the new owner
has more than doubled the rent, and the church fathers have had no
choice but to accept an eviction order that will toss them out by
the middle of March.
</P>
<P>
   Franzo King, the founder of St. John Coltrane and a bishop of
the African Orthodox Church, has warned his parishioners they face
a ``great transition'' and appealed for financial help to find a
new address within the city.
</P>
<P>
   With San Francisco's housing prices rising through the roof
thanks to the economic boom and the internet revolution, though,
Bishop King has few illusions about his chances of finding
anywhere. ``We're pretty much out of here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so the curtain appears to be closing on an eccentric little
institution whose origins go back to a revelatory night in 1965
when Franzo King, then working as a hairdresser, happened to hear
Coltrane and his quartet at a club in the Western Addition
neighborhood called the Jazz Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to him that night, he later recounted, was
tantamount to a ``baptism in sound,'' a realization that the music
could help him to see God.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, Coltrane himself had revealed his own spiritual
awakening after years of heroin addiction and ill health. The
sleeve notes to ``A Love Supreme,'' the first in a flurry of
ground-breaking albums recorded in the three years before his
premature death, include a hosannah to the Lord and a poem that
reads much like a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   On this rock of 1960s jazz was the church founded. In its
original form it was called the One Mind Temple Evolutionary
Transitional Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the tracks from ``A Love Supreme'' had been incorporated
into its weekly services, complete with gospel chorus backing from
the Sisters of Compassion, led by King's wife Marina.
</P>
<P>
   At first the Kings enjoyed the approval of Coltrane's widow
Alice, but in 1981 she sued them for $7.5 million for desecration
of her late husband's image.
</P>
<P>
   In a peculiar settlement, the Kings allowed themselves to be
taken over by the Chicago-based African Orthodox Church and agreed
to stop treating Coltrane like a God if in exchange they could
proclaim him a saint.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the one-room church have been adorned with 10-ft.
murals of Coltrane ever since, along with a portrait of a black
Jesus Christ above the altar.
</P>
<P>
   The Lord's Prayer is chanted to Coltrane's ``Spiritual''; ``The
Lord Is My Shepherd'' is sung to the sax line from
``Acknowledgement.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the church did not need to rely on a collection
plate, surviving on private donations, cake sales and a modest
business in T-shirts and postcards. Now, the Kings are lobbying
everyone from Mayor Willie Brown down to save their church.
</P>
<P>
   Once they had ambitions of making ``A Love Supreme'' the U.S.
national anthem. Now just a roof over their heads would do. &QL;

&HT;     PARENTS OF MISSING CHILDREN GRIEVE AS ELIAN GONZALEZ GETS
ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALISON GREGOR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ A small child is taken by one parent,
survives a perilous journey to a foreign land and becomes the
center of an impassioned international custody dispute.
</P>
<P>
   No, the child is not Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban whose
name has become a household word since he arrived in the United
States on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, thousands of children are taken by one parent from
another and spirited across international boundaries never to be
heard from again. These stories are rarely told.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Luna, who lives near Austin, gazes daily at her missing
daughter's face in a photograph taped to the dashboard of her car.
But Luna doesn't see 7-year-old Laura on the television or read
about her in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been sitting here, waiting and waiting,'' said Luna, who
said she believes Laura was taken to Tamaulipas, Mexico, two years
ago by Luna's former husband, Joel Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This comes up, and he (Elian) gets all the attention,'' she
said in frustration. ``With this little boy, they are doing
everything they can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that any child that's missing should get that
attention,'' Luna said.
</P>
<P>
   Other parents are equally befuddled or embittered by the hype
over Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Congress would do half as much as what they're trying
to do for Elian for the thousands of American children, including
Vivian Trout, who are overseas against their will,'' said John
Trout of Miami, whose 5-year-old daughter has been taken twice to
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   When Trout last saw his daughter, she was 2. He said he believes
she may be in Spain, where his estranged wife, Marina Lopez, has
relatives, or Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   But he admits he really doesn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just tearing me up,'' he said. ``I've gotten almost no
attention for my case, because all the newspapers and TV stations
tell me that there are too many parental kidnapping cases to put
the pictures in the paper or on TV. ... If there's too many of
them, doesn't that right there tell you there's a major problem?''
</P>
<P>
   While Elian Gonzalez's face has been burned into the national
consciousness by extensive news reports, the faces of these other
children linger in the shadowy recesses of the mind, stowed away
after glimpses at milk cartons, junk mail or posters at Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are really angry and frustrated that their cases
haven't received this kind of attention,'' said Maureen Dabbagh,
president of PARENT, a Virginia Beach, Va., group that helps
parents of children abducted internationally by noncustodial
parents. ``And they're really confused as to why legislators would
work so hard, but not on their case.''
</P>
<P>
   Dabbagh said Congress has passed only one resolution in U.S.
history asking for the return of a child _ her daughter, Nadia,
from Syria in 1998. But the effort stopped there, and Dabbagh's
daughter remains lost to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet they're in this frenzy looking for loopholes to help
Elian,'' she said. ``Not only are they dissecting the law, but they
are willing to override it.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno last week that any intervention by
Congress in the Gonzalez case could cause problems later for
Americans trying to recover abducted children. Some lawmakers are
considering legislation that would grant the Cuban boy citizenship,
although many concede it is unlikely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we got into a situation where American children ended up
abroad and American parents wanted them returned and a foreign
country made them a citizen so they did not return, I don't think
the people in the United States would be very happy about it,''
Reno told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts warn that circumventing U.S. laws about
custodial jurisdiction and ignoring precedents in international law
to keep Gonzalez in this country could undermine the 20-year-old
Hague Convention, a treaty among 53 nations that establishes
procedures to find children and resolve custody cases.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty is meant to help all parents equally. Though Cuba did
not sign that agreement, the United States did, and some lawyers
feel that may be binding enough.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gonzalez case, it is not his mother, who died when their
boat capsized off the Florida coast, demanding to be awarded
custody and citizenship for Elian. It's relatives in Florida with
tenuous connections, wanting to keep the boy from his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress chooses to (grant Elian citizenship), they would
certainly be undermining the spirit of the Hague Convention. They
would be thumbing their noses at all its precepts,'' Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Hilgeman, director of the San Jose, Calif.-based
Vanished Children's Alliance, another advocacy organization for
parents of internationally abducted children, said: ``If our
country doesn't respect the rights of other countries, we can't
expect that in reverse.''

   Pam Fortney of Hollywood, Fla., knows all about that. She hasn't
seen her sons, Daniel, 8, and Christopher, 11, in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fortney has legal custody of the boys, her numerous trips
to Mexico to recover them have been unsuccessful. She tried to get
a local news station interested in a trip she made to Mexico to
find the boys in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Fortney and 14 Mexican law enforcement officials tried to
recover her sons from school, but the principal locked them out,
stalling them until Fortney's ex-husband, Juan Munguia, could file
another court challenge, partially typed on a typewriter on a card
table outside the school gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a circus,'' said Fortney, who left hours later without
even seeing her sons. But the news station wasn't interested in the
story without videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, how much has been made of the fact that these
grandmothers went back to Washington, D.C., without seeing their
grandson?'' Fortney asked resentfully, referring to reports about
Elian's two grandmothers' early attempts to see him before a
meeting was ordered last week by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. ``I mean, here's a mother, and because that camera wasn't
rolling, nobody cares.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has spurred public protests in the United States and
Cuba, legislative subpoenas, congressional banter and unending news
reports to help catapult the issue of international parental
abduction into the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   But to parents with empty houses, every click of the camera
shutter on Elian marks another heartbeat separating them in time
from their missing children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe his case is going to help anybody else in this
situation,'' said Paul Fedynich, an Orlando, Fla., resident whose
three children were taken in 1998. He said he believes they are in
Mexico with his ex-wife, Linda Marie Fedynich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, everybody's going to get tired of hearing about this
issue,'' Paul Fedynich said.

REPORTS BY U.N., INDONESIA IMPLICATE MILITARY IN EAST TIMOR
VIOLENCE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ An Indonesian human rights panel on Monday
accused top military commanders, including Gen. Wiranto, of
involvement in ``crimes against humanity'' in East Timor, and a
U.N. team reported on Monday that it had reached similar
conclusions and recommended that military leaders be tried by an
international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian panel handed its case to the attorney general for
formal investigation, while the Security Council has not committed
itself to establishing an international tribunal for East Timor.
The Indonesian government has said it prefers to pursue charges
stemming from the violence in East Timor on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights panel's accusation against the once untouchable
military leadership intensified a high-stakes campaign under
President Abdurrahman Wahid to reduce the political power of the
military and to make it answerable for its abuses. He has said that
he would fire Wiranto from his post in the cabinet if he was cited
in the human rights report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Facts show the civilian and military apparatus, including the
police, cooperated with the militias to create an atmosphere that
supported crimes against humanity,'' said Djoko Sugianto, a member
of the government panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were in the form of mass killings, torture, kidnapping,
violence against women _ including rape and sexual slavery _ forced
evacuations and total destruction of property,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the panel, Albert Hasibuan, said Wiranto is
culpable because of his position as chief of the armed forces
during violence in East Timor last year surrounding a referendum in
which the people of the former Portuguese colony voted
overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia. ``He knew what
happened, but did not take effective measures to handle or prevent
the violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The general made no public comment about the report on Monday.
On Sunday, he said: ``We should just await the process of
investigation.'' He has claimed in the past that he lost control of
his men on the ground because of their emotional commitment to East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts here disagree over whether he was culpable
``by omission,'' as one panel member put it, or whether he was
actively involved in creating, funding and commanding the irregular
militias that carried out most of the violence and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The general has had an uneasy relationship with Wahid, who
removed him as armed forces commander when he took office in
November but gave him the influential cabinet position of
coordinating minister for security affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The president's unsubtle efforts to curb military power in
Indonesia have caused rising discontent among officers. In recent
weeks, rumors that he would remove Wiranto have mingled with rumors
that the military might strike back with some sort of coup.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Reuters Television in Davos, Switzerland, where he
is attending an economic conference, Wahid said on Monday that he
would carry out his promise to dismiss the general if he was named
in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, of course,'' he said. ``I will ask him, to use a
polite word, ask him to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the increasingly resentful military would react to the
firing of the charismatic general, he asserted: ``They will listen
to us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before leaving Jakarta on Friday, the president dismissed rumors
of a coup (he called the restive generals ``cowards'') and signed a
decree requiring Wiranto and three other generals to give up their
military commissions because they had become cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a joint news conference here with the human rights
investigators, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman, said on Monday
that state prosecutors would investigate the allegations. But he
did not say when any charges might be brought.
</P>
<P>
   The special human rights panel named 33 people as culpable in
the crimes in East Timor, including top military and police
commanders there as well as local government officials and leaders
of the militia groups.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping accusations refuted concerns that a domestic
Indonesian inquiry would, like similar panels in the past, lay the
blame only on lower-ranking officers while leaving their commanders
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   The president has asked the United Nations to hold back on any
war crimes investigation of its own while Indonesia attempts to
discipline its own troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian military has been condemned around the world for
its role in the violence in East Timor. The military invaded East
Timor in 1975 and was widely accused of human rights abuses in the
ensuing years as it fought to subdue an armed independence
movement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When former President B.J. Habibie, ignoring warnings of
potential violence, announced early last year that he would allow a
referendum, the military set about to undermine it by forming and
arming militias.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers, including foreign journalists, witnessed the
close involvement of the military with the militias. They were seen
giving them training, transport and logistics support. In some
cases, military officers, sometimes in uniform and sometimes in
civilian clothes, appeared to be leading militia actions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the attacks and threats were directed at the United
Nations, which had organized the referendum. A number of East
Timorese working for the United Nations were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mass killings claimed the lives mostly of civilians,''
said Sugianto of the human rights panel. ``They were conducted in a
systematic and cruel way. Many were committed at churches and
police headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   East Timor today is firmly under the control of U.N.
peacekeeping forces, but they continue to face problems in
maintaining order. Homeless, jobless and traumatized, some East
Timorese have become restive and violent, with brawls breaking out
among gangs of young men.
</P>
<P>
   The militias continue to hold tens of thousands of forced
evacuees in camps in Indonesian West Timor, where they drove them
after the independence vote in an apparent campaign of
depopulation.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic militia violence continues as well. International
forces said on Monday that about 12 men armed with homemade guns
confronted troops in the enclave of Oecussi, which abuts West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, Jose Ramos-Horta, the East Timorese publicist who
won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1996, said Wiranto had been
directly involved in the funding and training of the militias that
carried out much of the violence and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   He said the general must face trial if human rights are to be
respected. ``In this day and age you cannot kill hundreds of
people, destroy a whole country and then just get fired,'' he said.

in the state, the first such moratorium in the nation. Ryan, a
moderate Republican, noted that 13 men had been sentenced to death
in Illinois since 1977 for crimes they did not commit, before
ultimately being exonerated and freed by the courts. The ruling was
hailed by opponents of the death penalty, who said the mistaken
convictions discovered in Illinois were common throughout the
United States. Some 85 people have been found innocent and released
from death row since 1977, when the Supreme Court allowed the
reinstatement of the death penalty. By Dirk Johnson.

SIMULATING A BLACK HOLE IN A LAB 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers believe that nothing, not even light, can escape
after it has been captured by the powerful gravity of a black hole
in space and goes, so to speak, down the cosmic drain.
</P>
<P>
   Two physicists in Sweden have now theorized that the same
strange effects might be produced in laboratories on Earth, though
not with gravity. Instead, they suggest, light itself could be
gobbled up by swirling gases and fluids that look suspiciously like
water going down an ordinary drain.
</P>
<P>
   Called an optical black hole, this laboratory creation would
rely on the recent discovery that in certain substances, light can
be slowed from its usual 186,000 miles a second to a pace well
below a highway speed limit. In that sort of fluid medium,
according to the physicists, a very fast vortex would also have a
point of no return for light rays that came too close to its
center, or ``eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Light that passed inside the boundary, which in gravitational
black holes is called the event horizon, would be inexorably
dragged into the eye of the vortex, like an unfortunate flea
carried down a bathtub drain no matter how desperately it
struggles. And far from being a mere curiosity, such an experiment
might let laboratory physicists study the properties of real black
holes in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mathematical analogy between the two,'' said Dr. Ulf
Leonhardt, a physicist at the Royal Institute of Technology in
Stockholm and the University of Saint Andrews in Scotland.
``Therefore, the effects you expect to occur for gravity, you would
also expect'' in the vortexes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A paper on the theory by Leonhardt and a colleague, Paul
Piwnicki of the Royal Institute of Technology, was published in the
Jan. 31 issue of the journal Physical Review Letters.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that moving matter can drag light goes all the way back
to Augustin Jean Fresnel, a French physicist who lived around the
turn of the 19th century. Light moves more slowly in any
transparent medium, like water or air, than it does in a vacuum.
But Fresnel realized that any such medium could, in effect, exert a
weak pull on light and change its speed by moving, too.
</P>
<P>
   At about the midpoint of that century, another Frenchman, Armand
Fizeau, actually showed that light moved slightly more slowly
against the flow of water than with it.
</P>
<P>
   But those changes amount to a small fraction of the overall
speed of light, so that the consequences are ``not very exciting,''
Leonhardt said. More interesting possibilities had to await the
testing of materials that could slow light much more, and therefore
were able to exert a stronger pull when they were moving.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking such experiments were performed last year by
Dr. Lene Vestergaard Hau of Harvard University, Dr. Stephen E.
Harris of Stanford University and their colleagues. They used an
ultracold cluster of sodium atoms called a Bose-Einstein condensate
to slow light to a speed of about 40 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Related experiments have been done in a vapor of rubidium atoms,
Leonhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Leonhardt and Piwnicki suggest that experimenters
create vortexes in those substances while shining laser light
through them. They calculate that the black hole effect could take
over in small vortexes moving at the outer edge of the effective
black hole with speeds of from hundreds of yards per second to just
a few feet per second, depending on how much further progress is
made on the slow-light substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that now there will be a laboratory-scale, even
simple, benchtop way of making predictions about what the
astronomers may then go out and try to verify,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   One conceivable laboratory measurement of black hole properties
will certainly not be made by astronomers anytime soon. That
property is a kind of faint radiation that the British cosmologist
Dr. Stephen W. Hawking predicted should be emitted from just
outside the event horizon of a real black hole.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Hawking emissions would be obscured by more powerful
radiation sources in space, it would be difficult to observe with
astronomical instruments. But Leonhardt hopes that optical black
holes will reveal Hawking radiation, though he cautions that he has
not yet managed to calculate how intense it would be in the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe by thinking about this analogy, one can get a better
understanding of Hawking radiation,'' Leonhardt said.

`NOVA' SERIES REVEALS SOME SECRETS, OTHERS REMAIN A MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like any 9-year-old, I love to throw things. Small rocks across
water. Big rocks into water. Pine cones at tree trunks. Nerf balls
at wastebaskets. Socks into a hamper from 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Could be a genetic thing. Or, as my wife suspects, just a
pathetic thing. I don't care. After viewing ``Medieval Siege'' I
want my own trebuchet. And I want it now, please.
</P>
<P>
   A trebuchet is a slingshot on steroids, a gunpowderless cannon
that can hurl a projectile the length of two football fields and
hit a wide receiver on the numbers. Said wide receiver would then
be listed as questionable for next week's game, but anyone trying
to catch a 250-pound stone ball is probably questionable to begin
with.
</P>
<P>
   I digress.
</P>
<P>
   King Edward I of England _ the bad guy from ``Braveheart,''
remember? _ also liked to throw things. A bellicose sort who went
about the countryside alternately building and destroying castles,
Edward was a cagey military strategist who usually won, Mel Gibson
notwithstanding, because he had better war toys.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 13th century, when castle walls were getting thicker
than a linebacker's neck, Edward ordered up some trebuchets and
made the Scottish skittish. The rest, as they say, is history,
except no one bothered to save a blueprint of a trebuchet for those
of us who might want to fling boulders in our spare time.
</P>
<P>
   That's where ``Nova'' comes in. Armed with a limited budget but
limitless curiosity, the PBS series that makes science more fun
than recess created two medieval catapults on the strength of
sketchy information and healthy conjecture. The result is
installment one of a wonderful new ``Secrets of Lost Empires''
package on ``Nova'' _ an idea that began in 1992 with ``This Old
Pyramid'' and blossomed in 1997 into the first ``Secrets'' series,
which explored how the ancients built Stonehenge in England, the
obelisks in Egypt, intricate temples in the land of the Incas, and
huge awnings over the Colosseum in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the medieval trebuchet, this latest ``Secrets''
tackles obelisks again (they didn't get it right the first time),
along with the enormous statues of Easter Island, incredibly
ingenious Roman baths, and the startlingly beautiful rainbow
bridges of 12th-century China, all without benefit of blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the specials, airing on Tuesdays before the regularly
scheduled ``Nova,'' emphasizes the exclusive use of tools and
techniques available to the ancients. Because of time constraints,
most of the construction teams ended up cheating a bit _ it's
amazing what a little silicone caulk will do in a pinch _ but the
point of ``Secrets of Lost Empires'' is not lost because ``Nova''
cut corners. Rather, it is enhanced. Turns out that the knowledge
of ancient civilizations, sometimes lost for centuries before being
rediscovered by others, is a terrific teacher _ and a great
humbler.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the five-week miniseries:
</P>
<P>
   `Medieval Siege'
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night
</P>
<P>
   This one's the cream of the crop for those who like to throw
stuff. The efforts of two teams trying to replicate a medieval
catapult encapsulates the best of ``Nova'': scientifically
satisfying, historically rewarding, and just plain fun to watch.

<P>
   After getting maybe a little too technical in trying to emulate
the Egyptians' knack for pointing massive, one-piece granite
needles skyward, the ``Nova'' team realizes that simplicity is
probably a better approach than a complex system of weights,
counterweights and pivots. Either way, the abilities of the ancient
builders is something to contemplate.

   Native legend has it that the mammoth stone heads of Easter
Island, called moai, walked from the quarry to their sacred
platforms scattered about the island. A team of archaeologists,
engineers and architects tries to suggest otherwise, but despite
some success in moving a modern version of a moai, the legend seems
like a fairly reasonable alternative.

   `Roman Bath'
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 22
</P>
<P>
   Probably the least satisfying of the ``Secrets of Lost Empires''
miniseries, ``Roman Bath'' bogs down because the construction of a
mini-bathhouse in Turkey uses construction techniques that are
essentially similar to modern methods. While certainly a tribute to
the Romans' engineering savvy, it's a lot like watching your
neighbor install a spiffy new spa.

   `China Bridge'
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 29
</P>
<P>
   Though not available for screening, this episode promises to
blend science and art in a refreshing way. Reproduced throughout
China, a scroll painting of an intricately woven rainbow bridge of
the 12th-century Song Dynasty is as ubiquitous there, ``Nova''
says, as the Mona Lisa is in the West. But how the bridge was built
is a mystery because the elegant wooden arch ultimately succumbed
to the elements, and no plans of the rainbow bridge exist today.

 &HT;    ESCALATED FIGHTING IN LEBANON ENDANGERING SYRIA-ISRAEL TALKS
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After the killing of three Israeli soldiers Monday,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak threatened not to resume peace talks with
Syria until it reigns in Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israeli government cannot conduct negotiations when the
Syrians are not preventing the Hezbollah from its activities
against the Israel Defense Forces,'' Barak said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The statement came after a three-hour, emergency meeting of
Barak's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Hezbollah opened fire with rocket-propelled
grenades on an Israeli post in southern Lebanon. A major was among
those killed, and four others were wounded _ one critically.
</P>
<P>
   It came a day after Hezbollah killed a top commander of the
South Lebanon Army, a force trained and paid by Israel. For nearly
18 years, Israel has occupied a swath of land, now about nine miles
wide, of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. officials feared that the war could escalate out of
control, the Israeli Air Force retaliated with bombing runs on
Hezbollah targets. U.S. officials have been trying to restart peace
talks between Israel and Syria, and the fighting Monday seemed to
complicate that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is the dominant power in neighboring Lebanon and maintains
40,000 troops there. Syrian officials maintain they are limited in
their ability to control Hezbollah, a grass-roots Lebanese force
backed by Iran, that aims to push Israel out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Israelis accuse the Syrians of encouraging Hezbollah
attacks as a way to exert pressure on Israel to make concessions in
currently stalled peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Syrians must understand that the present situation has a
risk of deterioration,'' Barak said on Israel Army Radio. ``That
could hurt Syrian interests.''
</P>
<P>
   He also vowed to not let the attacks go unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will arrange to make our enemies pay the price,'' Barak
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the attacks also prompted renewed calls in Israel for
a withdrawal from southern Lebanon. Barak has promised to remove
the more than 1,000 Israeli troops there sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly four years without formal negotiations, Israel and
Syria opened peace talks in December in Shepherdstown, W.Va., near
Washington. But, they stalled again three weeks ago. The Syrians
complained that Israel had not committed to what they consider a
full withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights. Israel captured
the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to, and throughout, the talks, southern Lebanon had
been relatively quiet. But, last week, Hezbollah killed the first
Israeli soldier to die there in months. Sunday, a roadside bomb
killed South Lebanon Army Col. Akl Hashem. He was expected to
someday lead the force, and his assassination was a major Hezbollah
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's attack brought to four the number of Israeli deaths
there this month.
</P>
<P>
   However, in one sign that Israel may be planning a restrained
reaction, Israeli officials were not ordering residents of northern
Israel into bomb shelters. That order is usually given when it
appears the violence could escalate.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official in Israel said Monday that diplomats for
the United States were contacting Israeli, Syrian and Lebanese
officials in order to try to control the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the official said that
Syria had been restraining Hezbollah in the last six to nine months
but that, historically, southern Lebanon has become more violent
when Syrian-Israeli talks were stalled.

AIR-COOLED HORSEPOWER  
 PLANT PROTECTOR  
 FIREBALL OVER YUKON 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any animal that loses its cool during physical activity is in
for trouble. Specifically, the brain cannot be allowed to overheat,
or irreversible damage may occur. Most animals have evolved some
sort of system for regulating brain temperature during exercise,
but how horses do it has been a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, veterinary researchers in Canada have discovered that, like
an old VW engine, a horse is air-cooled.
</P>
<P>
   A horse's internal carotid arteries, which supply blood to the
brain, are enveloped by a pair of air-filled pouches associated
with the upper respiratory tract. By using tiny implanted
thermometers, researchers found that these structures, known as
guttural pouches and containing about half a pint of air, cool the
carotid arteries when the horse exercises.
</P>
<P>
   During cantering, for example, the temperature of the blood in
the arteries before it passes through the pouches climbs about one
and a half degrees over five minutes. The arterial temperature
measured on the brain side of the pouches, however, actually drops
slightly, the heat having been transferred to the air. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plants do not get much exercise, but they can have overheating
problems as well. That is, too much sunlight can cause oxidation
and death of cells, bleaching a plant like a cheap T-shirt left on
a clothesline for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Most plants have a way of dissipating excess solar energy as
heat, but the mechanism by which this happens has not been well
understood. Now, Swedish and American researchers have discovered
that a specific protein plays a major role.
</P>
<P>
   The protein, called PsbS, is one of many involved in the
photosynthesis process. The researchers, in experiments with
Arabidopsis, a weed with a relatively small and simple genome,
found that mutant plants without the protein could not handle too
much sun, developing bleached, dead spots. When the scientists
reintroduced the gene that produces PsbS, the resulting plants were
able to dissipate the excess energy.
</P>
<P>
   The work, reported in Nature, also suggests that some plants
synthesize more of the protein as they are exposed to excess
sunlight on a daily basis. So PsbS may play a role in helping some
plants become acclimated as their environment changes. &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Yukon in northwestern Canada might have
wondered if United States-Russian friendship had come to a
screaming end in mid-January, when a huge, and loud, fireball
lighted up the early morning sky. It was not a nuclear warhead (or
even the latest antimissile missile test) but rather a meteor, one
of the most spectacular to be seen in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The meteor, which exploded at an altitude of about 80,000 feet
with a force estimated to be equal to about two or three thousand
tons of TNT, was detected by U.S. military satellites and caused
two sonic booms heard across the Yukon and into Alaska. It left a
contrail that lingered for about half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, a foul odor was detected for several hours after
the explosion. A witness said the fireball lighted up mountains
about 10 miles away as bright as daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the Jan. 18 event, NASA sent a high-altitude
research plane into the region to collect samples from the
lingering plume of particulates left by the meteor. Any dust or
rock particles recovered may give a hint as to the origin of the
meteor.
</P>
<P>
   The plane also took reconnaissance photos of the area, which is
largely unpopulated, in hope of discovering any impact crater or
other damage on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Any damage found is likely to be slight compared with the
devastation caused by another spectacular aerial blast, in Siberia
in 1908. That explosion, thought to have been caused by a meteor
with a 100-foot diameter, was equivalent to 20 million tons of TNT
and incinerated trees in a 9-mile radius.

STRETCHING: THE TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY E. NEVALA  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Double-knot your running shoes, drink water and stretch _ that's
the long-recommended routine to start an injury-free workout.
</P>
<P>
   But a study in the journal of the American College of Sports
Medicine this month says stretching before exercise doesn't prevent
muscle pulls and strains.
</P>
<P>
   And if stretching is performed wrong, the study says it may hurt
the body more than help it.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries can happen whether or not you stretch before exercise,
said Rod Pope, the study's lead author. The Australian army
physiotherapist found no difference in injury rates among 2,660
Australian soldiers, some of whom stretched before training, while
others didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stretching was assumed to work in preventing injury, but there
was no evidence to suggest it did,'' said Pope. ``We are telling
the army to no longer stretch, but it's a long tradition and
traditions die hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope's research follows a study published last year by Dr. Ian
Shrier, of Quebec's Centre for Clinical and Community Studies, who
found that ``stretching before exercise is more likely to cause
injury than to prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   His findings, which appeared in the Clinical Journal of Sport
Medicine, were based on 12 articles, all grounded in clinical and
scientific research. Four suggested stretching before exercise is
beneficial, three called it detrimental and five suggested no
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the only studies to suggest that stretching before
exercise might prevent injuries (also) included a warm-up
program,'' Shrier reports. ``All other studies suggested that
stretching before exercise does not benefit or may be
detrimental.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-area exercise authorities aren't ready to dump
stretching, and some say it is an absolute necessity for some
professions, such as ballet. But in general, warm-up exercises _
combined with, or instead of, stretching _ may be even more
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still recommend warming up,'' said John O'Kane, team
physician for the University of Washington intercollegiate athletic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Muscles are like rubber, he explained. Warming up, or
encouraging blood flow through the tissue, helps muscle loosen and
operate more efficiently and effectively. A light jog before a run
or an easy swim before laps can warm the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``An ideal situation is to do a gentle warm-up and after five to
10 minutes, when the muscles are warm, do some stretching,'' O'Kane
said. ``If you don't have time for that, I'd say the warm-up is
more important than stretching.''
</P>
<P>
   He added a cautionary note about stretching.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a morning runner, you don't want to hit the floor
cold, stretch and then go running,'' he said, because jerking tight
muscles with a stretch can trigger pulls and strains.
</P>
<P>
   O'Kane's preference for a warm-up over just stretching is good
news for Cindy Martin, 48, who hates stretching but does warm-ups.
Her weekly exercise routine includes five hours of swimming, three
hours of weight-lifting, 12 miles of running, plus weekend skiing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be the poster girl for never stretching,'' said
Martin, of Seattle. ``I'm so inflexible because I don't stretch, so
when I do it, it hurts. So I'm like, `Oh, forget it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, it's boring. I usually start out running slowly and
figure that will take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian physiotherapist Pope stresses that it is important to
stretch tight muscles and he suspects that stretching after
exercise could be beneficial, although this has not been
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Some physical therapists cringe when exercisers shrug off
stretching. Exercise science suggests that when stretching is done
correctly, athletes who make it part of their training prevent or
reverse the loss in joint range-of-motion that occurs with aging.
</P>
<P>
   This encourages a limber body longer and later in life.
</P>
<P>
   Therapists also say stretching improves athletic performance by
building stronger muscles and flexibility. This can, say, shave
strokes off golf handicaps or add height to soccer kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my work with athletes, I've seen that a good, stretched-out
muscle responds much better than a muscle that's all knotted up,''
said sports medicine physical therapist Lori Sabado at the
University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sabado recommends stretching to her patients. ``Years of
anecdotal evidence can't be wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For baseball pitchers, gymnasts and other athletes whose sports
require noodlelike flexibility, stretching before a game or
performance isn't optional.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as an inflexible, unstretchable
ballerina,'' said Marjorie Thompson, therapy and conditioning
program coordinator with the Pacific Northwest Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   If increased flexibility is your goal, O'Kane said the best time
to stretch may be after your workout, when the muscles are warm
from blood churning through the tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Sabado said people need to be careful if they stretch. ``You're
better off not doing it if you do it wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   While bending over, grabbing her ankles and bouncing a hamstring
stretch, Sabado said, ``this form is bad. I've seen kids hurt
themselves by bouncing like this, which can strain muscles.''
</P>
<P>
   Pain while stretching indicates improper technique. Athletic
trainers, physical therapists, and aerobic and yoga instructors can
advise on correct positions.
</P>
<P>
   Whether stretching is good or not, it appears fixed in our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Toddlers nationwide flex tiny calves and biceps through
Stretch-n-Grow classes, while 90-year-olds attempt to beat
arthritis and keep hamstrings limber through toe touches in
retirement-home programs.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching gimmicks _ from Stop 'n Stretch videos to the Helping
Hand Stretch-o-cizer _ stock the shelves. A ministry in Memphis
stretches parishioners arms, legs and necks along with their
spirits. ``Maintaining our health depends on the regular nurturing
of both body and spirit,'' said chaplain Kim Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle area Microsoft employees flock to yoga classes seeking
relief for computer-cramped necks, shoulders and backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are some of our biggest clients,'' said Mona Renner,
assistant director of Yoga Centers in Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   And humans aren't the only ones who stretch. ``Some trainers
have begun to stretch and warm up their dogs prior to
competition,'' said Robert Gillette, a senior research fellow in
veterinary sports medicine at Auburn University in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Still not convinced that stretching works? Anxious to simply get
sweaty? Maybe you should take the gazelle as your role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certain,'' Gillette said, ``that the Thompson's gazelle
does not take the time to warm up before running away from the
cheetah.''

   &UR; Synthetic Blood &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will it ever be possible to synthesize blood the way insulin
is made?
</P>
<P>
   A. Artificial blood will not be available any time soon, and the
need for donations will remain acute for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Synthesizing blood is much more complex than synthesizing
insulin, explained Dr. Robert L. Jones, president of the New York
Blood Center. Blood is a cellular substance that includes many
different kinds of cells, he said, while insulin is a protein.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ways to make hemoglobin, the protein in blood that
carries oxygen,'' Jones said, ``and most of the blood alternatives
or substitutes that are being worked on are hemoglobin molecules
aggregated together. They will serve as a bridge for people who
need transfusions. However, the products that are being worked on
would not be substitutes for transfused blood, except in
emergencies or acute blood loss.''
</P>
<P>
   As for artificial blood cells, Jones said, ``They are way off in
the future, a decade or more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pigs' blood, with minor modification of the surface of its
cells, would be compatible in humans,'' Jones said, ``but its use
raises all kinds of other issues, like disease transmission, that
would have to be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Many products have been available for some time that serve many,
but not all, of the functions of plasma, the liquid that carries
the cells and proteins of blood, and can be used in certain
situations, Jones said.

 &HT;    CONSUMER, BUSINESS GROUPS SEEK LOWER MONTHLY PHONE FEES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of business and consumer groups urged
the federal government Monday to reduce monthly telephone fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern stems from the fact that since Congress passed the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, consumers have seen more than $4
billion in fees,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers
Union. The act was supposed to reduce telephone users' costs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The group called for cutting subscriber line charges on
consumers' and business' phone bills by $1 a month, eliminating a
$1.50 monthly federal access charge and cutting other special
access charges many businesses pay. Telephone users would save
nearly $8 billion over the next four years, Kimmelman said.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition includes the Texas Office of Public Utility
Counsel, the National Retail Federation, AARP, Consumer Federation
of America and others.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it would will ask the Federation Communications
Commission to adjust a telephone access fee reform proposal
submitted by an industry group known as CALLS, for Coalition for
Affordable Local and Long Distance Service. Members of CALLS
includes Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, AT&AMP;T, GTE, SBC and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   It said the CALLS plan fails to utilize the limited cost-cutting
mechanism in FCC rules and adds $2 billion a year in new fees to
phone bills, the coalition said.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's plan is misleading, responded John Nakahata, a
CALLS spokesman. He said contrary to the consumer groups' claim,
CALLS would not add any new charges, and in fact would save
consumers in every income category $5.8 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Nakahata also noted that the telephone fees are an important
source of funding for telephone service for rural and low-income
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (coalition's) plan does not guarantee universal service,
fails to strengthen protection for low-income consumers, does
nothing to promote competition and choice and strands rural
consumers on the wrong side of the digital divide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if you could construct the phone network for
free, but that's not the case,'' Nakahata said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Moir, who represents the International Consumers
Association, said CALLS' $2.50 per line monthly fee may not seem
like much to large companies, but it adds up when major
universities, for example, have 30,000 phone lines. He said the
universities are forced to increase tuition and other fees to pay
for the extra phone charges.
</P>
<P>
   The phone companies have decreased long-distance charges, but
the low per-minute rates cited in television ads are misleading,
said Mark Cooper of Consumer Federation of America. He said
consumers are not aware that they are paying up to $15 per month in
line charges ``before you place a call.''

VIEWING DEPRESSION AS TOOL FOR SURVIVAL

<P>
   The case, Dr. Randolph M. Nesse said, did not fit tidily with
the view that depression is only a matter of disordered brain
chemicals:
</P>
<P>
   A woman sought help from a psychiatric clinic because she was
desperately depressed. She had dedicated five years to becoming a
professional musician, despite her teachers' admonitions that she
lacked the talent to succeed. She persisted, the woman said,
because it was her mother's dream for her.
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatrists at the clinic treated her with a variety of
antidepressant medications and with psychotherapy. Nothing helped.
But when, one day, the woman reached a decision, giving up music in
favor of a career more suited to her abilities, her depression
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Nesse, director of the Evolution and Human Adaptation program at
the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, has
collected many such cases, (he alters details to protect patients'
identities) because he believes they offer clues to a deeper
understanding of depression.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in Archives of General Psychiatry, Nesse
argued that while some forms of depression were clearly a result of
genetic vulnerability and brain abnormality, others might have
their roots in evolutionary history.
</P>
<P>
   Darwinian theory holds that evolution selects for fitness:
organisms with traits that promote survival or reproduction pass on
their genes; organisms without such traits die off.
</P>
<P>
   Depression may have developed, Nesse suggested, as a useful
response to situations in which a desired goal is unattainable, or,
as he has put it, ``when one of life's paths peters out into the
woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Locked in pursuit of the impossible, it makes sense for an
animal to hunker down, take stock and figure out what to do next,
Nesse said. In some cases, depression may help a person disengage
from what has proved a hopeless effort; in other cases, it may
protect the person from jumping ship too rashly, perhaps landing in
even less hospitable seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to put my position in a nutshell,'' he said, ``I'd
say that mood exists to regulate investment strategies, so that we
spend more time on things that work, and less time on things that
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, Nesse's conception echoes that of the
psychoanalyst Dr. Emmy Gut. In a 1989 book ``Productive and
Unproductive Depression'' (Basic Books), Gut described, among other
cases, the experience of a biochemist, Albert, who frequently
became depressed when a research strategy he was pursuing went
nowhere. When the feelings of despair passed, he said, he saw ``an
entirely different way to tackle the problem, or else, I have
recognized that the project was unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gut, who lives in Sweden, said: ``I think that
depression is a normal mechanism. It's an attempt toward adaptation
to a problem.'' Nesse and Gut are not the first to ponder what
evolutionary function depression _ and its close relative, sadness
or low mood _ might serve.
</P>
<P>
   Thinkers from Schopenhauer to Freud have offered their views.
Over the years, scientists have speculated variously that
depression represents a plea for help, a strategy for manipulating
others into providing resources, a signal of submission or yielding
in conflict, or a way to conserve an organism's energy and
resources in hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Other investigators see no point in viewing depression as
anything other than a malfunction of brain chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Nesse, however, is one of a growing number of scientists who
over the past decade have systematically tried to bring a Darwinian
perspective to medicine, hoping to learn more about how evolution
has shaped humans' vulnerability to disease.
</P>
<P>
   The approach is yielding a richer understanding of illness, and
in particular, is helping scientists distinguish between diseases
and medical conditions that developed as defenses against other
more serious threats to survival.
</P>
<P>
   Coughing, for example, is not a disease in itself but is the
body's attempt to rid itself of bacteria in the lungs. Diarrhea and
vomiting, though unpleasant, also serve as defenses, evolving as
ways to evade danger, and thus to preserve fitness.
</P>
<P>
   And the ability to feel pain is essential for an organism's
survival. ``People who are born without any capacity to feel pain
are usually dead by early adulthood,'' Nesse said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, emotions like anxiety, fear and depression can be
viewed as defensive strategies. Such defenses make sense, Nesse
noted, because they have a low cost, especially when compared with
their potential for protection. Vomiting, for instance, involves
only the loss of few hundred calories, but might save an animal's
life if the substance ingested is poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, being frightened and anxious when no threat
exists is a small price to pay for the readiness to fight or flee
when true danger looms. Yet these tactics also sometimes go awry,
and illness results: chronic pain syndromes or panic attacks, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Nesse believes the need to gain a deeper understanding of what
purpose depression might serve is especially pressing at a time
when the illness is so prevalent. Surveys indicate that 10 percent
of Americans suffer from clinical depression; millions more endure
a darkness that is not severe enough to earn a diagnosis but still
interferes with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have also found that the rates of depression have
increased in people born after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony,'' Nesse said, ``is that here we have finally
created a society where not many people are hungry, we stay warm,
we can take baths, we can travel and have relative freedom, and yet
so many people are so miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has changed over the eons is the increased
pressure people feel to set ever larger goals. Ancestral hominids
may have striven to pick enough berries to last for a week; modern
humans want to look like supermodels, make a million dollars in the
stock market or produce flawless children.
</P>
<P>
   In shaping his ideas, Nesse has drawn upon the work of
psychologists like Dr. Eric Klinger, at the University of
Minnesota, who studies how people become committed to goals, and
how they reach those goals or abandon them.
</P>
<P>
   Klinger's studies indicate that depression plays a crucial role
in the process of disengaging from a goal. To illustrate this, he
uses the analogy of a soda machine. ``You put your 75 cents into
the machine and nothing happens,'' he said. ``Then you go through a
series of phases: your behavior gets more invigorated, you pay more
attention to the signs, you pull on levers, you put in more change.
If it still doesn't work you may start to rough up the machine. But
at some point,'' he said, ``you walk away, feeling down, feeling
disappointed. It's a minor depression.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that depression sets in after someone is prepared to
suffer a failure or a loss, Klinger said, is important. ``It slows
you down, and makes you take your bearings,'' he said, ``and at the
same time it's very unpleasant, so that people are not going to be
attracted to giving up quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nesse believes there are many varieties of depression, not all
of them captured by official diagnostic categories. An evolutionary
view, he and others hope, might encourage a broader, more nuanced
search for treatments.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if depression is a defense, it might not always
make sense to block its defensive properties with medication. When
drugs are used to treat chronic diarrhea caused by the shigella
bacteria, he noted, complications often result.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my money,'' said Dr. Paul Gilbert, a psychologist at the
University of Derby in England, who has written on depression and
evolution, ``the key thing really is recognition that the
environment is key to many of these disorders. And if you really
want to affect depression, it's nice to have therapies that work,
and it's nice to have drugs that work. But do we really want a
society where we drive everyone mad and then give them drugs to get
them out of it?''

<P>
   RENO, Nev. _ Fire and cheatgrass, a fire-loving invasive annual
grass from central Eurasia, are locked in a deadly dance that is
steadily turning the sagebrush steppes of the Great Basin desert
into a wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the government is spending a desperate effort to
reverse a cycle of fire and weed invasion in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, dry lightning storms set off wildfires that raced
across cheatgrass-infested range land and blackened a record 1.8
million acres in northern Nevada. By next summer, experts warn,
much of the burned area will be covered with cheatgrass and the
stage will be set for even bigger fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're to the point of almost no return,'' said Robert V.
Abbey, state director of the federal Bureau of Land Management in
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   While federal land managers are deliberately burning forests and
grasslands in many parts of the country as a force for restoration,
fire is naturally coming more frequently to the Great Basin. But
here, fire is in league with weeds. Moreover, while the spread of
invasive species is considered a threat nationwide, it appears that
the best tool for fighting the spread of fire and cheatgrass is to
introduce even more exotic grasses and shrubs from Eurasia, the
original home of cheatgrass.
</P>
<P>
   So this winter the government is spending $43 million to get
grass and shrub seeds on the burned land before cheatgrass takes
over. Officials said it was the biggest single post-fire
rehabilitation plan ever undertaken by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of trucks loaded with 50-pound sacks of seeds have
arrived in Nevada in recent months on a staggered schedule because
there is not enough warehouse space for the 5.4 million pounds of
seeds. Pilots have been flying over the burned land dumping seeds.
Crews have been using farm equipment to sow seeds and turn the
soil. Volunteers have been gathering seeds from native plants like
sagebrush.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a shortage of seeds, money, equipment and
workers, this effort will cover only about a third of the burned
land this year. Native plants made up less than a third of the
seeds planted after the fires and only 1 percent was sagebrush.
</P>
<P>
   So the Bureau of Land Management is proposing to spend up to $25
million a year on a Great Basin Restoration Initiative to try to
stop the cycle and restore the grasslands. ``We're going to spend
the money anyway,'' Abbey said. Although restoration will cost $32
to $80 an acre, Abbey said it would help reduce firefighting costs.
</P>
<P>
   If the restoration effort does not succeed, the Great Basin
could join the ranks of the world's bleakest deserts, warned Dr.
James Young, a scientist with the federal Agriculture Research
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Young said that what was once an unbroken ocean of sagebrush was
now ``an endangered landscape.'' Cheatgrass has already taken over
a third of the 19 million acres of sagebrush grasslands in Nevada,
he said, and more than 100 million acres across the West.
</P>
<P>
   Vast steppes once covered with tall bunch grasses interspersed
with pungent-smelling, gray-green sagebrush shrubs are increasingly
covered with a uniform carpet of short blond cheatgrass. Cheatgrass
has a foothold in nearly all the sagebrush, Young said, and it
dominates much of land that has burned in this century.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe that cheatgrass arrived in North America in
the mid-1800s as a contaminant in grain seeds from Europe. Farmers
called it cheatgrass because it lowered their yields. Its spiky
seeds easily stick in hind and hair, so cheatgrass steadily
expanded with herds.
</P>
<P>
   An annual that puts all its energy into seeds, cheatgrass easily
outcompetes native perennial grasses and sagebrush when the land is
disturbed. In winter and early spring, cheatgrass sends roots deep,
monopolizing water and nutrients. And it sets seeds early in the
summer, then dries to an explosive tinder.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, fires were smaller and lower in intensity than
those today. The frequency in any given patch of healthy sagebrush
ranged from once every 11 years, which is just long enough for
sagebrush to get established, to as seldom as every 200 years. By
contrast, cheatgrass-dominated lands burn every two to five years,
giving sagebrush no chance to come back.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Sagebrush is especially vulnerable to the frequent fires that
cheatgrass fuels. Sagebrush usually dies after a fire. Its seeds
may survive, but when they compete with cheatgrass, they lose. And
sagebrush's tiny seeds fall right around the plant, so stands of
sagebrush expand slowly.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is not just sagebrush, and a landscape that might
already seem bleak and forbidding, but a whole ecosystem that is
changing rapidly as cheatgrass spreads. Some species benefit
temporarily, like mice that feast on abundant cheatgrass seeds.
</P>
<P>
   But many animals are left bereft, without a home. The sage
grouse, for example, scientists say, seems to be headed for the
endangered species list. Small birds like the sage thrasher, small
mammals like the pygmy rabbit, and a host of reptiles like the
sagebrush lizard all depend on sagebrush for shelter. &UR;  &LR;  ``When the
sagebrush goes, the structure goes, and when the structure goes,
most of the vertebrates go,'' said Dr. Peter Brussard, co-director
of the Nevada Biodiversity Initiative, a federally financed effort
to document and monitor the state's ecological health. And many of
these animals will never return to the burned land if it turns to
cheatgrass.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Nevada Division of Wildlife said last
summer's fires burned habitat that was used by close to 40 percent
of the state's wildlife, including pronghorn antelope, elk and mule
deer. In some areas of the state that burned in previous years, the
mule deer population has fallen in direct proportion to the loss of
sagebrush.
</P>
<P>
   So far the main strategy for fighting the spread of cheatgrass
has been to use other exotic species from Eurasia, like crested
wheatgrass, a perennial grass, and forage kochia, a shrub. These
plants are more resistant to fire and grazing than their native
counterparts, so they can compete with cheatgrass. They also
provide forage for livestock and big game wildlife like deer.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain, said Young: The West will look more
like the Eurasian deserts, at least in the short term. Using these
exotic species is an ``ecological Band-Aid,'' he said, ``but it's
the best thing we've got now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists doubt that native grasses and sagebrush will
ever come back and compete with the introduced species.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you end up with at best is replacement of one introduced
species with another,'' said Dr. Richard Mack, a professor of
biological sciences at Washington State University, who has studied
the spread of cheatgrass across the West. ``Restoration doesn't
mean sowing non-native species over large areas of the
intermountain West. If you're going to restore, you're going to put
back what was there, and that would mean the native communities
that were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Monsen, a botanist with the U.S. Forest Service's Rocky
Mountain Research Station in Provo, Utah, said there was a middle
ground in the debate. Scientists at the research station have been
searching for ways to combat cheatgrass invasions in the West since
the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a shift now to try to restore the native communities
and to move away from introduced species,'' said Monsen, who has
worked on projects around the West that have succeeded in restoring
the key species in sagebrush grasslands. What is needed, he said,
is both an immediate intervention to halt the spread of cheatgrass
and a long-term restoration effort to bring back native plants.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that huge fires like those that burned 1.8
million acres in the Great Basin last summer quickly swallow up all
the available native seeds and resources for restoration, and still
much of the land remains vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My big concern in Nevada,'' said Monsen, ``is that if they're
not successful in seeding, the next burn will be five or 10 times
that size.''

NEW STUDY OF WHAT PUTS CHILDREN IN HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asthma and infections like pneumonia and bronchitis accounted
for more than half the hospitalizations of children from 1 to 4
years old in a major study of children's health in the United
States. The research, the most comprehensive in a decade, also
found that the conditions were responsible for nearly a third of
hospital stays for 5- to 9-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Among 15- to 17-year-olds, 3 out of 10 hospitalizations were for
pregnancy or childbirth. And for younger adolescents, depression
and other mental disorders were the main diagnoses, accounting for
more than 9 percent of hospital stays for 10- to 14-year-olds,
compared with less than 2 percent for adults.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by the United States Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality, a research arm of the Department of Health
and Human Services, is in the current issue of The Journal of the
Ambulatory Pediatrics Association. The wide-ranging study culled
1996 statistics, the latest available, from parents, hospitals and
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marie C. McCormick, a researcher at the Harvard Center for
Children's Health and an author of the report, said that while the
findings would not surprise professionals in pediatric medicine,
they did point out the differences between the medical needs of
adults and children. As the report shows, she said, children are
most often hospitalized for a handful of reasons while the
diagnoses for adults are much more varied.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on children's health have been sorely outdated, Dr.
McCormick said. Medicare provides a wealth of data on care of the
elderly, she noted, but children have been less carefully tracked,
in part because of the expense.
</P>
<P>
   But with a push from Congress in the late 1990s, the agency put
children's health care back in the limelight. This is the first in
a series of annual reports that the agency plans to issue that will
also monitor expenditures and patient satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This research will become particularly important in the next
few years as we see such rapid changes in children's health care,''
Dr. McCormick said. Those changes include a decline in private
coverage and growth of state-sponsored insurance programs for
children.
</P>
<P>
   From 1987 to 1996, the number of children covered by private
plans dropped, while public coverage grew. In two-parent families,
the percentage of children with public coverage doubled in that
period, to 12.7 percent from 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, Dr. McCormick said, will be important in
tracking the effects of the new state-based insurance coverage for
children that was begun through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.
With $24 billion set aside over five years, the State Children's
Health Insurance Program has resulted in the largest single
expansion of health insurance coverage for children in more than 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   The report also looked at who paid for children's hospital
visits, and more often than for adults, it was Medicaid. Of all
hospitalizations in 1996, Medicaid paid for about 40 percent of
children's stays, and only about 17 percent of adult stays, the
study found. Nearly 90 percent of children under 18 had health
insurance for some part of 1996, and about 21 percent of them were
covered by public insurance like Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although a lot of people look down on Medicaid, it is an
increasingly important part of the safety net to ensure care for
children,'' Dr. McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   One finding that did surprise Dr. McCormick was that fewer than
half of all children under 18 saw a dentist in 1996. ``The low use
of dental care clearly reflects the access to insurance,'' she
said. Although dental care is covered by Medicaid, the families of
many children either do not take advantage of it or cannot find a
dentist who accepts Medicaid, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The data for black and Hispanic children were even more grim,
with fewer than 1 in 3 making a dental care visit in the year.
Hispanic children were the most likely to be uninsured, with 21
percent having no coverage. Nearly four times as many black
children were covered by public health insurance as white children.
</P>
<P>
   Not unexpectedly, the method of payment affects the care a child
receives. Publicly insured children were 50 percent more likely
than uninsured children and 20 percent more likely than privately
insured children to make at least one trip to the emergency room in
a year. Although more than half of all children receive at least
one prescription medicine in a year, only about 36 percent of
uninsured children do.

 DRAWING ATTENTION: LeWitt's Giant Paintings Add a Splash of
Color  to Museum  
 (ART ADV: Art being sent to NYT photo clients.)  
 By JESSE HAMLIN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Somebody once asked Sol LeWitt, the conceptual
artist who began making wall drawings in the 1960s, who started the
wall-drawing thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be those cave people,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's how Joe Watanabe tells the story. He's the guy
directing the draftsmen now painting a pair of giant LeWitt
drawings on the atrium walls at the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art, where ``Sol LeWitt: A Retrospective,'' opens February 19.
</P>
<P>
   It pleases Watanabe that they're using an acrylic paint called
Lascaux _ named for the French caves where Cro-Magnon painters made
potent images of animals. It's just a coincidence that LeWitt
picked Lascaux, a Swiss paint whose rich color and pigment he
preferred to the other brands he and his crew experimented with.
But it's a coincidence Watanabe finds ``very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   A printmaker by training, Watanabe has overseen the physical
creation of many LeWitt works since the 1970s. At SFMOMA, he's
directing the work of some 20 artists and art students making 46
LeWitt wall drawings in paint, ink or pencil. The artist's first
major retrospective since 1978, the show will also include
structures, photographs, books and works on paper.
</P>
<P>
   The museum commissioned LeWitt to create two 29-by-32-foot works
in the vast, light-filled atrium, one on either side of the central
black-granite stairway. They're huge, but not LeWitt's biggest: At
Atlanta's High Museum of Art, he created a six-panel piece that was
nearly 80 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Here, working on 40-foot scaffolding that was erected at 3 a.m.
a few Sundays ago, four painters are executing LeWitt's giant
rainbow-colored drawings. The pieces, which the artist conceived
after visiting the museum a few months ago, are adaptations of the
gouaches LeWitt painted for the cover of the exhibition catalog.
</P>
<P>
   One side consists of four black-framed panels filled with arcs,
each set running in a different direction; the other has four
black-framed panels of stripes _ one vertical, one horizontal and
two panels of diagonals in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer of conceptual art, LeWitt has always focused on the
idea; the physical object is the manifestation of the idea, and who
actually makes it is unimportant as long as it's done right. That's
the job of Watanabe and the artists LeWitt hires to produce the
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not an artist. I am basically an extension of Sol's
hands,'' says Watanabe, 53, a Tokyo native who owns a print shop in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has only two hands. If he has me to do certain things, then
he can do more things at the same time. Then I always have
extensions,'' he says, motioning to the crew, ``and they have
extensions, too, people from San Francisco to help them. So Sol's
hands are, let's say, 20 feet in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Taped to the wall are photocopies of LeWitt's schematic
drawings, simple pencil sketches showing the design of the pieces
and the color of each band: ``P'' for purple, ``G'' for green,
``O'' for orange and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The painters _ Dutch artist Wim Starkenburg, the New York-based
Norwegian painter Thomas Ramberg and San Francisco artists Andy Cox
and Susan Dopp _ have translated LeWitt's little hand-drawn lines
into 15-foot red, blue and yellow stripes.
</P>
<P>
   But before they could begin, the walls needed a coat of
oil-based primer, then three coats of white latex paint. ``The
walls have to be really smooth,'' says Kent Roberts, the museum's
director of exhibition design. His staff also also prepped walls on
the fourth and fifth floors where LeWitt's work will be installed.
``They had to be painted cross-hatched, because (LeWitt) doesn't
want any lines to show through.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve the uniform look LeWitt wants, the painters often
switch position on the scaffolding. The goal is to create bands of
pure color with no gestural marks, ``very bright and very
plastic,'' Watanabe says, ``like a brand-new car body.''
</P>
<P>
   LeWitt usually likes the finished pieces when he sees them,
Watanabe says, but sometimes he doesn't. When that happened at a
museum in the Midwest, LeWitt hired a new crew and redid the whole
piece.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it's working very nicely here,'' says Watanabe. ``It's
satisfying that Sol LeWitt formula.''
</P>
<P>
   That formula for making art, as Watanabe calls it, derives from
LeWitt's way of ``bringing up the essence of the visual world,
seeing the world as lines _ straight lines, broken lines, and the
directions of those lines. (Then) there's the color and the
location in space. The combination of all that, somehow, attracts
the human mind very strong ly.''
</P>
<P>
   The genius of LeWitt, Watanabe adds, is that in ``using one
idea, he comes up with so many different results as individual
works. ... I like this piece very much. It delights me.''
</P>
<P>
   Starkenburg, who lives outside Amsterdam, is an abstract painter
who has worked on several major LeWitt installations, the first in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I compare it often to music,'' says Starkenburg, 53. ``Sol is
the the composer and we are the musicians. We're playing with
colors.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ramberg, 26, the job depends on his ability to conceive the
piece in his mind and focus on drafting it precisely.
</P>
<P>
   He takes pleasure in ``how simple it is in its essence,
(although) it's a complex piece. There are different coherences,
reminiscences of different kinds of systems, different levels of
logic. It's a play; it's like a puzzle. But it doesn't go one way,
it's sort of circular. There are always surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   He also likes the way these LeWitts play off the architecture,
the visual rhythm of the color bands in counterpoint with the
various striped forms throughout the atrium: the granite stairway,
the wooden walls and ceiling, the steel framing in the huge
elliptical skylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in a very interesting dialogue with this room,'' Ramberg
says. ``It's very musical in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will have plenty of time to check out the groove. The
LeWitts will stay on the atrium walls indefinitely.

 &HT;    CHINESE THIRSTY FOR AMERICAN CITRUS, OFFICIALS SAY
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By ANGEL WILSON and LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Exports of fresh U.S. citrus to China could begin
soon, a group of Chinese officials told members of Congress Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Xia Hongmin, who headed a delegation of Chinese agriculture
officials who toured citrus groves and packing houses in four
states _ Florida, Texas, Arizona and California _ said the
inspections were running ``quite smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The delegation was well received in all four states,'' Xia
said through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   The only missing pieces, Xia said, are U.S. Department of
Agriculture documents related to shippers, packagers and groves
involved in the prospective trade. The Chinese delegation also
would like to see the reports on fruit fly infestations from 1998
through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Xia's comments came at a luncheon in a Senate office building
with Reps. Mark Foley, R-Fla., and Matt Salmon, R-Ariz. Also on
hand were representatives of federal and state agriculture
departments, and growers headed by Henry ``Skip'' Clements, chief
executive of Clements Citrus Sales of Stuart, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Clements, who organized the lunch _ which included chicken,
twice-baked potatoes, green beans and of course, orange juice _
said he was confident that last year's citrus trade agreement
between the United States and China will be very successful.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is already exporting frozen orange juice to
China, and Clements said he believes fresh citrus and perhaps even
meat may be not far behind. Clements started trade talks with the
Chinese on his own two years ago, meeting with officials and
retailers from China to educate them about U.S. grown citrus.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, noting that Xia will likely make the key decisions on
imports, called it ``helpful and hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the guy who apparently can make that decision,'' Foley
said, adding that he spoke with the Chinese Prime Minister Zhu
Rongii about citrus exports during a trip to China a few years ago
with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Foley told the Chinese delegation that they must be prepared for
a ``two-way street'' involving trade with the United States _ not
only shipping goods to America but also purchasing products such as
citrus from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials promised to expedite whatever documentation is
needed by the Chinese before final approval for exports will be
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's all that remains, Hallelujah, it's time to ship!''
Foley said.

   WASHINGTON _ Exports of fresh U.S. citrus to China could begin
soon, a group of Chinese officials told members of Congress Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Xia Hongmin, who headed a delegation of Chinese agriculture
officials who toured citrus groves and packing houses in four
states _ Florida, Texas, Arizona and California _ said the
inspections were running ``quite smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The delegation was well received in all four states,'' Xia
said through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   The only missing pieces, Xia said, are U.S. Department of
Agriculture documents related to shippers, packagers and groves
involved in the prospective trade. The Chinese delegation also
would like to see the reports on fruit fly infestations from 1998
through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Xia's comments came at a luncheon in a Senate office building
with Reps. Mark Foley, R-Fla., and Matt Salmon, R-Ariz. Also on
hand were representatives of federal and state agriculture
departments, and growers headed by Henry ``Skip'' Clements, chief
executive of Clements Citrus Sales of Stuart, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Clements, who organized the lunch _ which included chicken,
twice-baked potatoes, green beans and of course, orange juice _
said he was confident that last year's citrus trade agreement
between the United States and China will be very successful.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is already exporting frozen orange juice to
China, and Clements said he believes fresh citrus and perhaps even
meat may be not far behind. Clements started trade talks with the
Chinese on his own two years ago, meeting with officials and
retailers from China to educate them about U.S. grown citrus.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, noting that Xia will likely make the key decisions on
imports, called it ``helpful and hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the guy who apparently can make that decision,'' Foley
said, adding that he spoke with the Chinese Prime Minister Zhu
Rongii about citrus exports during a trip to China a few years ago
with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Foley told the Chinese delegation that they must be prepared for
a ``two-way street'' involving trade with the United States _ not
only shipping goods to America but also purchasing products such as
citrus from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials promised to expedite whatever documentation is
needed by the Chinese before final approval for exports will be
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's all that remains, Hallelujah, it's time to ship!''
Foley said.

&HT;     MCCAIN MAKES SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once again, Sen. John McCain got it right.
</P>
<P>
   He is the only anti-abortion Republican presidential candidate
with the wisdom and courage to acknowledge that a pregnant woman
may have powerful, legitimate reasons not to bear the child.
</P>
<P>
   He has also said that were his teen-age daughter to become
pregnant, what she did about it would be ``a family decision,''
suggesting that he would not automatically rule out an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican party is so solidly against abortion that all its
other candidates are sticking to the rigid doctrine expressed in
the 1996 GOP platform, which demands the procedure be outlawed
entirely, with no exception to protect the health of the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Even Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who used to favor exceptions for
rape, incest or for saving the mother's life, now says he supports
the current platform and supports the overturn of Roe vs. Wade, the
Supreme Court ruling that a woman's right to privacy provides
limited constitutional protection for abortion in the early phases
of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain insists he is just as opposed to abortion as his
presidential rivals but he is the only one to express concern for
the living adult involved as well as the fetus. In this, he is
being politically savvy, appealing to moderate and independent
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Careful balances'' among competing interests are required, he
said on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' citing ``legitimate exceptions''`
that might make an abortion necessary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said he believes that life begins at conception,
which is the basis for the political position that a fertilized egg
has rights equal, if not superior, to those of the pregnant woman,
making abortion the equivalent of murder. But religions differ;
some Protestant and Jewish theologians hold that life does not
begin until the fetus ``quickens'' after a few months and is
capable of living independently outside the womb, which is the
viewpoint adopted by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   McCain adds, however, that ``I don't claim to be a theologian.''
No one can know for certain which religious theory is correct.
</P>
<P>
   This does not bother Bush, Steve Forbes and the other GOP
candidates, who would impose their moral certitude upon those who
disagree with them by criminalizing the procedure. The most extreme
of the group, Alan Keyes, lectured a classroom of 10-year-olds
recently in frightening terms, graphically comparing abortion to
the killing of a living child and refusing to concede any moral or
theological disagreement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, competing for the GOP's anti-abortion vote, has accused
Bush of ``straddling'' the issue because Bush veils his references
to Supreme Court appointments in strict constructionist language
rather than pledge to make uncompromising anti-abortion selections
to the bench. The Forbes complaint is silly _ but Forbes is a
desperate candidate, willing to pander to anyone with a particular
gripe.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are similarly united on the abortion issue, lined
up on the opposite side.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vice President Al Gore and ex-Sen. Bill Bradley support a
woman's right to choose an abortion, insisting the decision should
be a private one between her and her doctor. Bradley, challenging
Gore's integrity, is trying to make an issue of the fact that in
Congress two decades ago Gore opposed federal funding for the
procedure for poor women and voted for an amendment describing a
fetus as ``a living human being.'' This is as silly as Forbes'
attack on Bush and will have the same impact on the voters _ none.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responds that he long ago resolved his doubts on the issue
and has been firmly pro-choice ever since, which the record
confirms. It is not where he used to be but where he is now that
counts.
</P>
<P>
   In the general election, no matter which Republican or which
Democrat is running, the contrasting opinions on abortion will be
sharply drawn.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's compassion toward the plight of pregnant women unable
emotionally, economically or physically to bear a child may make
his opposition less alarming than that of say, Gary Bauer, who
promises to work night and day in the White House on the cause.
Although I happen to think he is wrong to oppose abortion, McCain
strikes me as a reasonable man, not a scary demagogue.
</P>
<P>
   If this is indeed to become one of the campaign's central
issues, the candidates will have to address the way they intend to
enforce their views. This is a tough one for the Republicans. If
abortion is illegal, does someone go to jail for it? The woman, the
doctor, the father, the parents, the clinic receptionist? Or
everyone? Who gives evidence and becomes the new Linda Tripp?
</P>
<P>
   Voiding the Supreme Court decision would merely leave it up to
the state legislatures to determine legality. This would result in
unequal treatment, of course, with women in some states penalized
and those in other states free to exercise their will on the issue.
This would never do for those who believe that life begins at
conception.
</P>
<P>
   The battle would spread across the country, creating political
chaos, religious tension and social instability. Not a good thing.

A MILLION REASONS TO KEEP HAMMERING AWAY AT THAT BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TACOMA, Wash. _ Mother of three sons, wife of an attorney,
part-time college secretary _ these were the devotions of Linda
Nichols' daily life for many years. And there was her devotion to
writing, as she toiled away at community college writing workshops,
listened to critiques of her work by fellow students and hoped that
someday some of her words might be published.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the encouragement of her teaching mentor, Nichols
decided to finally act on her writer's dreams. This is what happens
in just three weeks:
</P>
<P>
   _She sends out 19 query letters to literary agents, asking if
they might be interested in taking a look at her novel, a romantic
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   _New York agent Theresa Park, who discovered best-selling
novelist Nicholas Sparks, quickly plucks Nichols' letter from her
``slush pile'' of unsolicited inquiries, asks to see a copy of the
novel, reads it with great enthusiasm and immediately signs up
Nichols as a client.
</P>
<P>
   _Universal and Dreamworks, through Park's Hollywood connections,
buy the film rights to Nichols' novel at a price of $1 million
($500,000 up front, $500,000 upon film completion), a sum similar
to what was paid to David Guterson for the film rights to ``Snow
Falling on Cedars.''
</P>
<P>
   _Delacorte Press, spurred by the film sale, decides to publish
the novel and pays a hefty advance of $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   This three-week whirlwind hit more than a year ago, yet Nichols
is still recovering from her sudden good fortune as her first
novel, ``Handyman'' (Delacorte, 296 pages, $20), finally appears in
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked myself many times, `Why me?''' Nichols relates in
the dining room of the family's bungalow. ``The only thing I can
come up with is that, for whatever reasons, God decides to bless
you. I'm very grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, 45, also has been the beneficiary of the increasing
synergy between the publishing industry in New York and the film
business in Hollywood. Their never-ending search for new material
sometimes prompts a feeding frenzy that sends prices skyrocketing,
especially when a property from an unexpected source is deemed
eminently marketable as both a book and a film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handyman'' is definitely that. Think Tom Hanks, think Meg
Ryan, think boffo box office and soaring book sales. For
``Handyman'' is a chocolate bonbon of a book, a guilty-pleasure
fairy tale of modern love and romance that is based upon an
absolutely irresistible plot premise.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Ivey is a 26-year-old single mom struggling to get by in
the Bay Area. She has a dead-end bank job, a leering boss intent on
sexual harassment and a ramshackle apartment in a rough
neighborhood. Her problems are intensified by guilt about a
4-year-old son growing up without a father and no male replacements
on the horizon, plus the death of her own dreams of being an
artist. Maggie's life is, in short, a mess, with prospects of it
only getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   So a sympathetic friend signs her up for the ``21-Day Overhaul''
offered by Dr. Jayson Solomon Golding, a popular pop psychologist
and best-selling author. Maggie turns up for her first session in
tears and finds Dr. Golding to be a most sympathetic listener, such
a sympathetic listener that he hardly asks any questions at all.
But the hour together flies by and it turns out to be a comforting
experience for Maggie.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that the person listening to all her
problems is not Dr. Golding. He is a contractor, about to embark on
a remodel of the doctor's office, who has been surprised by the
arrival of the crying visitor and is overcome with pangs of
sympathy. ``She was so _ pathetic. It was like I was her last
hope,'' Jake Cooper tells a friend afterward. Jake is a
good-hearted guy who has a tendency to turn shy and tongue-tied
around women, as he demonstrated in that first encounter with
Maggie.
</P>
<P>
   How long it will take Jake's psychologist charade to unravel,
and with what consequences, is the delectable tease of Nichols'
novel. It entices even more as Maggie's life takes a turn for the
better with Jake's unorthodox assistance, and she comes to reflect
that ``he had turned out to be nothing like she had thought he
would be, and his practical caring was nothing like the silly
psychotherapy she had been afraid he would offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols came up with this comic premise after years of
frustrating attempts to concoct short stories of the gloomy sort
published in the literary magazines she kept buying in hopes of
picking up pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The philosophy of those stories always was that life is
absurd, and that never fit my own beliefs,'' Nichols stresses. ``I
am not a pessimist at heart, and thinking that way never occurred
to me. So I decided to have some fun with my writing, just goof
around a little and try to write something romantic for the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols often took solace in romantic comedies on video during
difficult periods in her own life. Viewing one during her writing
crisis prompted her to think ``I could write that!'' and she was
soon reflecting on film comedies and what made them work, as she
brainstormed her novel.
</P>
<P>
   A deception was a key element, Nichols concluded; a deception
made especially interesting when one person is smitten with someone
who is not who he seems to be. Where that seemed most likely to
occur was in a work situation and counseling soon popped into
Nichols' head because of its shared trust. So a counselor who was
not a real counselor, and a loser in love besides, became her
premise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handyman'' flowed swiftly into the computer crowded into the
corner of Nichols' small bedroom, the queen bed often strewn with
papers, the writer often wearing what she laughingly calls her ``I
Love Lucy'' pajamas. She completed the first draft in six months,
amid her usual doubts about whether it would be published, even
with her communications degree from the University of Washington
and her six years of writing workshops.
</P>
<P>
   But she paid Kathy Keller, her teacher and friend at Tacoma
Community College, to critique the novel. Her verdict was delivered
over lunch at a time when Nichols was considering whether to quit
writing and enroll in nursing school, where she had finally been
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it to me straight,'' Nichols said to Keller. ``Do you
think I will be able to get an agent and sell a novel? Should I
continue writing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I absolutely do _ but you're going to have to work to
develop your craft,'' Keller replied. ``I think you should continue
writing. Take a year, say until January 2000, and if you still do
not have an agent or have not sold a book, then go to nursing
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols embarked upon her search for an agent, with no
expectation that her fairy tale novel was about to turn into a
real-life fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was optimistic that I would eventually get an agent, but did
not have not any premonition about `Handyman.' It wouldn't have
surprised me that I would have to write two or three books to sell
one,'' Nichols remembers. ``But I did know I had a lot of
determination and I was not going to give up easily.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was shocked when agent Park wanted to see her manuscript
as soon as possible. Nichols ``just about died'' when she had to
spend $50 to ship it to New York, the first time she had used
Federal Express for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Park called back after the weekend, voicing her enthusiasm for
the novel, and telling Nichols that she had shown a copy to two
film agents who might want to make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For how much?'' asked Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to guess,'' Park said. ``How much would you
want?''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols thought for a moment, then suggested, ``Two of my sons
attend private school and if film rights could pay the rest of
their tuition and I wouldn't have to go back to work, that would be
great. That is $8,000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Nichols was hooked up in a four-way conference
call with her literary agent in New York and the two film agents in
Los Angeles who informed her that she was being offered $1 million
for the rights to her novel (``which should probably cover your
tuition,'' one added).
</P>
<P>
   Nichols was so stunned that she asked if she could call them
back. It was no negotiating ploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a strange reaction,'' Nichols recalls. ``It would have
been a lot easier to say yes if I had been offered $20,000. I sort
of freaked out about being offered so much money. I also had fears
about what Hollywood does to books. I didn't want to be associated
with something I would be ashamed of, especially morally. I had
written a romantic comedy and I didn't want it turned into
something sleazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nichols' Christian faith is much in evidence in their home,
with sheet music for hymns on the piano in the dining room,
religious and inspirational sayings displayed on the walls,
including ``God Bless Our Home'' above the mantle.
</P>
<P>
   It is a home that may have been short on money, but was rich in
other things. As Nichols says proudly, ``I'm very grateful that we
did not have a lot of money during the first half of our years
bringing up our boys. They have not been spoiled that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone call, Ken Nichols advised his rattled wife that
he thought it would be fine for her to accept the $1 million for
the film rights to her novel. She was, he said, only responsible
for what she had written and there was certainly nothing sleazy
about that. That quieted her concerns to a manageable level.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the book is finally out (with 100 added pages from the
original draft), Good Housekeeping is set to publish a condensed
version of ``Handyman'' in its next issue. And the film plans are
progressing, with screenwriter Gary David Goldberg (``Family
Ties,'' ``Spin City'') working on a script and Tom Shadiak (``Patch
Adams'') set to direct.
</P>
<P>
   Life at the Nichols' house has not changed greatly. A restaurant
meal is more likely, every now and then. The young men in the
family (ages 18, 15, 13) have each received a present or two
(snowboard, guitar), although it has been slow to dawn on them, as
one said, ``so, mom, this is like a very big deal.'' And Ken is now
cutting back his law practice.

   But great extravagance seems unlikely, despite the ``Handyman''
windfall. This is a family that moved down the street to a larger
house a couple years ago, but moved back to where they had lived
before after five months away. The new place was more spacious, but
did not feel like home.

   Nor does Linda Nichols plan to mention her publishing success

Seattle. That could divert attention toward her and cause
unnecessary distraction. She's in the class, after all, because she
wants to learn more about writing.

<P>
   &UR; In the beginning, there was one people, perhaps no more than
2,000 strong, who had acquired an amazing gift, the faculty for
complex language. Favored by the blessings of speech, their numbers
grew, and from their cradle in the northeast of Africa, they spread
far and wide throughout the continent.  &LR;   &UR; One small band, expert in
the making of boats, sailed to Asia, where some of their
descendants turned westward, ousting the Neanderthal people of
Europe. Others traveled east toward Siberia and the Americas.  &LR; 
 &UR; These epic explorations began some 50,000 years ago and by the
time the whole world was occupied, the one people had become many.
Differing in creed, culture and even appearance, because their hair
and skin had adapted to the world's many climates in which they now
lived, they no longer recognized one another as the children of one
family. Speaking 5,000 languages, they had long forgotten the
ancient mother tongue that had both united and yet dispersed this
little band of cousins to the four corners of the earth.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So might read one possible account of human origins as implied
by the new evidence from population genetics and archaeology. But
the implication that all languages are branches of a single tree is
a subject on which linguists appear strangely tongue-tied.
</P>
<P>
   Many deride attempts to reconstruct the family tree of languages
beyond the most obvious groupings like the Romance languages, and
Indo-European. Their argument is that language changes too fast for
its roots to be traced back further than a few thousand years. If
any single language ever existed, most linguists say, it is
irretrievably lost.
</P>
<P>
   One scholar in particular, Dr. Joseph H. Greenberg of Stanford
University, has defied this ardent pessimism. In the course of a
long career, he has classified most of the world's languages into
just a handful of major groups.
</P>
<P>
   Though it remains unclear how these superfamilies may be related
to one another, he has identified words and concepts that seem
common to them all and could be echoes of a mother tongue.
</P>
<P>
   This month, at the age of 84, Greenberg is publishing the first
of two volumes on Eurasiatic, his proposed superfamily that
includes a swath of languages spoken from Portugal to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Like the biologist E.O. Wilson, Greenberg is that rare breed of
academic, a synthesizer who derives patterns from the work of many
specialists, an exercise the specialists do not always welcome.
Though biologists came to acknowledge the pioneering value of
Wilson's work, linguists have reached no such consensus on that of
Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg is by no means an outcast from his profession. He is
one of the very few linguists who are members of the National
Academy of Sciences, the country's most exclusive scientific club.
His work on language typology (universal patterns of word order) is
highly regarded. Somewhat puzzlingly, his fellow linguists
generally accept his work on the relationships among African
languages but furiously dispute his ordering of American Indian
languages, even though both classifications were achieved with the
same method.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg's work is of considerable interest to population
geneticists trying to reconstruct the path of early human
migrations by means of genetic patterning in different peoples.
Although genes and languages are not bequeathed in the same way,
both proceed in a series of population splits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found a lot of significant correspondences between
what he says and what we see genetically,'' said Dr. Luca
Cavalli-Sforza, a leading population geneticist at Stanford. In his
view, the majority of linguists are not interested in the evolution
of language. They ``have attacked Greenberg cruelly, and I think
frankly there is some jealousy behind it because he has been so
successful,'' Cavalli-Sforza said.
</P>
<P>
   In a windowless office lined with grammars and dictionaries of
languages from all over the world, Greenberg fishes in the plastic
shopping bag that is serving as his briefcase. He pulls out one of
the handwritten notebooks that are the key to his method of
discovering language relationships. Down the left hand margin is a
list of the languages being compared. Along the top are names of
the vocabulary words likely to yield similarities.
</P>
<P>
   His method, which he calls mass or multilateral comparison, is
to compare many languages simultaneously on the basis of 300 core
words in the hope that they will sort themselves into clusters
representative of their historical development. Many linguists
believe such an exercise is futile because words change too quickly
to preserve any ancestry older than 5,000 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sell their own subject short,'' Greenberg says. ``Certain
items in language are extremely stable, like personal pronouns or
parts of the human body.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1915, he was interested in language
almost from birth. His father spoke Yiddish and his mother's
family, German. ``I was brought up to believe Yiddish was an
inferior language because my father's relatives got invited to the
house as seldom as possible,'' he said. Hebrew school exposed him
to a fourth language. He had a good enough ear that an alternative
career as a professional pianist beckoned, but anthropology won
out. After doctoral studies at Northwestern, he did fieldwork on
the pagan cults of the Hausa-speaking people of northern Nigeria
before deciding that his true interest lay in linguistics.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there was no agreement on the history of African
languages. ``So I started in a simple-minded way,'' Greenberg said.
``I took common words in a number of languages and saw if the
languages fell into groups.'' He found that he could reduce all the
continent's languages first to 14 and later to 4 major clusters.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1955 article, he described these as Afro-Asiatic, which
includes the Semitic languages of Arabic and Hebrew, as well as
ancient Egyptian, and is spread across Northern Africa;
Nilo-Saharan, a group of languages spoken in Central Africa and
Sudan; Khoisan, which includes the click languages of the south;
and Niger-Kordofanian, a superfamily that includes everything in
between, including the pervasive Bantu languages.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of controversy, Greenberg's African
classification became widely accepted. ``But then a lot of people
said I had gotten the correct results with the wrong method,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Method is the formal issue that divides Greenberg from his
critics. They say that the only way to prove that a group of
languages is related is by establishing regular rules governing how
words change as one language morphs into another. The `p' sounds in
ancestral Indo-European, for example, change predictably into `f'
in German and English. Mere similarities between the words in
different languages, like those on which Greenberg relies, fall far
short of proof, his critics say, because the similarities could
arise from chance or borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the looseness of sound and meaning that Greenberg
allows in claiming similarities, his data ``do not rise above the
level of chance,'' said Dr. Sarah Thomason, a linguist at the
University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian D. Joseph of Ohio State University, who studies
Nostratic, a proposed language superfamily similar to Euroasiatic,
described Greenberg as ``a romantic'' for believing his methods
could retrieve long lost languages. Dr. Lyle Campbell, of the
University of Canterbury in New Zealand and the author of a
textbook on historical linguistics, said that rigorous proof was
necessary because languages changed so fast, and that Greenberg's
methods were ``woefully inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To Greenberg and his Stanford colleague Dr. Merritt Ruhlen, the
insistence on sound regularities as the only acceptable proof of
relatedness is a reversal both of history and of common sense.
Sound regularities were perceived in the Indo-European languages
only after the languages had been grouped by inductive methods
similar to Greenberg's. In their view, the critics' novel criterion
has blocked any further reconstruction of language families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a misguided perfectionism that is so perfect they have
had no result,'' Ruhlen said. His and Greenberg's aim is to
establish the probable links from which the full history of human
language can be inferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate goal,'' Greenberg said in concluding his 1987
book ``Language in the Americas'' (Stanford University Press), ``is
a comprehensive classification of what is very likely a single
language family. The implications of such a classification for the
origin and history of our species would, of course, be very
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Americas have been inhabited only recently, at least
as compared with Africa, it would be surprising to find a larger
number of language groups, and Greenberg decided there were only
three, even though other linguists posit 100 or so independent
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Amerind is the vast superfamily to which, in his view, most
native languages of North and South America belong. The other two
clusters are Na-Dene, a group of languages spoken mostly in Alaska
and northeast Canada, and Eskimo-Aleut, which is spoken in the
Aleutians and across northern Alaska and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   One striking feature that unites the Amerindian languages of
both Americas, in Greenberg's view, is the use of words starting in
`n' to mean I/mine/we/ours and words beginning in `m' to mean
thou/thine/you/yours. Not every language shows this pattern, but
almost every Amerindian language family has one or more languages
that have it, suggesting that all are derived from an original
language in which first and second person pronouns started this
way.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of classifying the languages of the Americas,
Greenberg realized that their major families were related to
languages on the Eurasian continent, as would be expected if the
Americas had been inhabited by people migrating through Siberia.
Na-Dene, for example, is related to an isolated Siberian language
known as Ket.
</P>
<P>
   To help with the American classification, Greenberg started
making lists of words in languages of the Eurasian land mass,
particularly personal pronouns and interrogative pronouns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to see when I lined these up that there is a whole
group of languages through northern Asia. I must have noticed this
20 years ago. But I realized what scorn the idea would provoke and
put off detailed study of it until I had finished the American
languages book,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years later, Greenberg has now classified most of the
languages of Europe and Asia into the superfamily he calls
Eurasiatic. Its seven living components are Indo-European (examples
are English, Russian, Greek, Iranian, Hindu); Uralic (Hungarian,
Finnish); Altaic (Turkish, Mongolian); the Korean-Japanese-Ainu
group; Eskimo-Aleut; and two Siberian families known as Gilyak and
Chukotian.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of Eurasiatic was derived independently but overlaps
with the proposed Nostratic superfamily, the theory of which has
been developed in the last 30 years by Russian linguists.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight it may seem hard to believe that languages as
different as English and Japanese, say, share any commonalities.
But in his new book on the grammar of Eurasiatic (a second volume
on vocabulary is in progress), Greenberg has found many elements
that he argues knit the major Eurasian language families into a
single group.
</P>
<P>
   Words beginning in `m,' for example, are found in every
Eurasiatic family to designate the first person (English: me;
Finnish: mina; proto-Altaic: min; Old Japanese: mi). Every branch
of Eurasiatic, Greenberg says, uses n-words to designate a
negative, from the no/not of English to the -nai ending that makes
Japanese verbs negative.
</P>
<P>
   Every branch uses `k' sounds to indicate a question. In
Indo-European, many Latin interrogatives begin qu-, as in quid pro
quo. In Finnish, -ko is added to a verb to indicate a question. In
Japanese the same role is played by -ka. The word for `who?' is kim
in Turkish, kin in Aleut.
</P>
<P>
   If Greenberg's Eurasiatic proposal is at first no more favorably
received than his Amerindian classification, he will not be
surprised. ``A fair part of my publications is just polemics,'' he
says, with an air of resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ruhlen believes that if the Eurasiatic grouping is
accepted, the world's 5,000 languages can be seen to fall into just
12 superfamilies.
</P>
<P>
   How these in turn might be related to a single mother tongue
remains to be seen. But several years ago, Greenberg identified a
possible global etymology derived from the universal human habit of
holding up a single finger to denote one.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nilo-Saharan languages the word tok, tek or dik means
one. The stem tik means finger in Amerind, one in Sino-Tibetan. In
Eskimo, tikeq is the middle finger, in Aleut tiqlaq is the middle
finger. An Indo-European stem dik, meaning to point, is the origin
of daktulos, digitus, and doigt _ Greek, Latin and French for
finger _ as well as the English word digital.
</P>
<P>
   No one has pointed more clearly at the one language than Joseph
Greenberg.

 &HT;    ESCALATED FIGHTING IN LEBANON ENDANGERING SYRIA-ISRAEL TALKS
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After the killing of three Israeli soldiers Monday,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak threatened not to resume peace talks with
Syria until it reins in Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israeli government cannot conduct negotiations when the
Syrians are not preventing the Hezbollah from its activities
against the Israel Defense Forces,'' Barak said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The statement came after a three-hour, emergency meeting of
Barak's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Hezbollah opened fire with rocket-propelled
grenades on an Israeli post in southern Lebanon. A major was among
those killed, and four others were wounded _ one critically.
</P>
<P>
   It came a day after Hezbollah killed a top commander of the
South Lebanon Army, a force trained and paid by Israel. For nearly
18 years, Israel has occupied a swath of land, now about nine miles
wide, of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. officials feared that the war could escalate out of
control, the Israeli Air Force retaliated with bombing runs on
Hezbollah targets. U.S. officials have been trying to restart peace
talks between Israel and Syria, and the fighting Monday seemed to
complicate that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is the dominant power in neighboring Lebanon and maintains
40,000 troops there. Syrian officials maintain they are limited in
their ability to control Hezbollah, a grass-roots Lebanese force
backed by Iran, that aims to push Israel out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Israelis accuse the Syrians of encouraging Hezbollah
attacks as a way to exert pressure on Israel to make concessions in
currently stalled peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Syrians must understand that the present situation has a
risk of deterioration,'' Barak said on Israel Army Radio. ``That
could hurt Syrian interests.''
</P>
<P>
   He also vowed to not let the attacks go unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will arrange to make our enemies pay the price,'' Barak
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the attacks also prompted renewed calls in Israel for
a withdrawal from southern Lebanon. Barak has promised to remove
the more than 1,000 Israeli troops there sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly four years without formal negotiations, Israel and
Syria opened peace talks in December in Shepherdstown, W.Va., near
Washington. But, they stalled again three weeks ago. The Syrians
complained that Israel had not committed to what they consider a
full withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights. Israel captured
the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to, and throughout, the talks, southern Lebanon had
been relatively quiet. But, last week, Hezbollah killed the first
Israeli soldier to die there in months. Sunday, a roadside bomb
killed South Lebanon Army Col. Akl Hashem. He was expected to
someday lead the force, and his assassination was a major Hezbollah
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's attack brought to four the number of Israeli deaths
there this month.
</P>
<P>
   However, in one sign that Israel may be planning a restrained
reaction, Israeli officials were not ordering residents of northern
Israel into bomb shelters. That order is usually given when it
appears the violence could escalate.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official in Israel said Monday that diplomats for
the United States were contacting Israeli, Syrian and Lebanese
officials in order to try to control the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the official said that
Syria had been restraining Hezbollah in the last six to nine months
but that, historically, southern Lebanon has become more violent
when Syrian-Israeli talks were stalled.

HORMONE REPLACEMENT: WEIGHING RISKS AND BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Should I or shouldn't I?'' It's a question millions of women
ask themselves these days, as baby boomers near or recently past
menopause try to decide whether to take hormone replacement.
Joining them are millions of older women, many of whom have been
taking estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progestin for
years and wonder if it is wise to continue, as well as many others
who wonder if it is wise to start.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is an oft-repeated finding that the use of hormone
replacement is associated with an increased risk of developing
breast cancer, especially when the hormones are taken for upwards
of 10 years or more. Although heart disease ultimately kills six
times as many women as breast cancer and the cancers linked to
hormone replacement tend to be highly curable, there is an
emotional factor to consider: Justifiably or not, breast cancer is
the disease most feared by American women.
</P>
<P>
   A new study, reported last week in The Journal of the American
Medical Association, suggests that, although estrogen has long been
considered the main hormonal risk in breast cancer, progestin may
be a more important factor. The study, by scientists at the
National Cancer Institute conducted among 46,355 postmenopausal
women, found that in lean (but not in heavy) women, taking estrogen
with progestin was associated with an 8 percent increase in breast
cancer risk with each year of use, as opposed to a 1 percent
increase when estrogen alone was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a study conducted in Los Angeles County by Dr. Ronald
K. Ross and colleagues at the University of Southern California
among 1,900 postmenopausal breast cancer patients and 1,600 healthy
postmenopausal women found a substantially higher risk of breast
cancer when progestin was combined with estrogen for hormone
replacement therapy than when estrogen alone was taken. This study
is scheduled for publication this month in The Journal of the
National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Women may rightly regard these findings, which confirm several
previous studies, as a cruel twist of fate, since progestin has
been included in the regimen specifically to prevent estrogen from
inducing endometrial cancer, a cancer of the uterine lining.
Endometrial cancer is much rarer than breast cancer and has a very
high cure rate, but the treatment for it can be quite debilitating.
When a woman with a uterus takes estrogen without progestin, the
risk of endometrial cancer is increased as much as 14-fold.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is further complicated by the fact that all of
these studies have flaws. Many of them rely on women's memories of
what hormone treatments they took, and memories can be imprecise.
The studies are not controlled clinical trials _ that is, women are
not randomly assigned to receive hormones or placebos. A large
placebo-controlled clinical trial, sponsored by the National
Institutes of Health, is under way, but results are not expected
until 2006 and even then may not answer all the questions.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, studies have shown, women who have used hormone
replacement therapy tend to live longer than women who do not. But
these studies too are flawed, in that hormone use is most common
among well-educated, better-off women, who may be more likely to
follow healthy diets and exercise regularly.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this uncertainty, doctors have long advised women
to weigh their individual circumstances _ their own health and
their family histories of cancer, osteoporosis, heart disease and
so on _ in making the decision on hormone replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason women start hormone replacement is to counter
the symptoms of menopause, primarily hot flashes that disrupt sleep
and cause daytime discomfort and, secondarily, vaginal dryness.
There is wide agreement that hormone treatment for a few years,
until a woman gets past the hot flash stage, is advantageous, as is
hormone replacement for a limited time for women who have had their
ovaries removed before natural menopause.
</P>
<P>
   But estrogen is believed to have a host of other benefits that
are especially important now that a woman of 50 can expect to live
to 85 or beyond. Unfortunately, these benefits accrue only while
taking estrogen; once the hormone is stopped, both the risks and
the benefits dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   On the benefit side, estrogen raises protective HDL cholesterol
and its use after menopause has been associated with a 50 percent
reduction in heart disease and stroke. Estrogen also prevents the
loss of bone density that accelerates at menopause and the hormone
may actually increase bone mass after menopause, countering
osteoporosis and debilitating fractures, some of which are
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, preliminary research suggests, among women who have
taken estrogen for many years, the risk of developing Alzheimer's
disease is cut in half. Estrogen also reduces the accretion of
abdominal fat, which is a risk factor for heart disease and a major
source of cosmetic distress for many middle-aged women.
</P>
<P>
   But because it is not known how much of these benefits derive
from the hormone replacement, and how much from lifestyle, many
women and their doctors are considering other strategies for coping
with menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Hormone replacement is not the only route to a stronger heart
and bones. Wholesome living habits _ a good diet that is low in
saturated fat and rich in fruits and vegetables and whole grains,
regular weight-bearing exercise, avoiding smoking and maintaining a
normal body weight _ are the surest and safest ways to achieve a
healthy old age.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the American Heart Association calls them
``first-line'' therapies for postmenopausal women at risk of
cardiovascular disease. If such an approach fails to control
cardiac risk factors like high cholesterol or high blood pressure,
there are a number of medications that can help and, according to
the heart association, they should be tried before hormone
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the new JAMA study, Dr. Walter C.
Willett, Dr. Graham Colditz and Dr. Meir Stampfer, epidemiologists
at the Harvard School of Public Health, point out that ``the
commonly held belief that aging routinely requires pharmacological
management has unfortunately led to neglect of diet and lifestyle
as the primary means to achieve healthy aging.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There are also two licensed substitutes for estrogen and more in
the research pipeline. These drugs, the ``designer estrogens''
tamoxifen and raloxifene, protect the heart and bones without
raising the risk of breast cancer. In fact, tamoxifen has been
shown to prevent breast cancer, and early findings suggest that
raloxifene may have a similar benefit. But neither drug prevents
hot flashes. Instead they increase this problem, and tamoxifen (but
not raloxifene) also increases the risk of endometrial cancer. And
it is not known what, if any, benefit they have on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to raloxifene, which was licensed to counter
postmenopausal bone loss, there are other bone-building drugs, the
biphosphates, that do not cause hot flashes.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of women concerned about the risks of hormone
replacement (like a woman's own estrogen, estrogen therapy also
increases the risk of blood clots) are turning to so-called natural
alternatives. These are foods and herbs that are rich in
phytoestrogens, plant-based chemicals that act like weak estrogens.
The most popular among them are soy, flaxseed and black cohosh.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has long been assumed that a diet rich in soy is a
major reason for the low rate of breast cancer among Japanese
women, recent evidence points to a host of other factors, including
differences in the amount, type and effects of the estrogens
produced by Japanese women.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while phytoestrogens may help to counter menopausal
symptoms, it is not known whether they decrease, increase or have
no effect on the risk of breast cancer, or any other
estrogen-related disease, for that matter. The estrogen in the most
widely used hormone replacement products is derived from the serum
of pregnant mares.
</P>
<P>
   Are there other ways around the hormone dilemma? Dr. Malcolm C.
Pike and Dr. Ross at USC have proposed two alternatives to current
regimens of estrogen and progestin to limit the effects of
progestin on the breast. Instead of a monthly oral use of
progestin, they said the hormone could be administered vaginally,
which would limit the amount to which breast tissue might be
exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Or, instead of taking the two hormones daily or using progestin
for a part of each month to protect the uterus, they suggest taking
progestin for 10 days at a time only once every three to four
months. Other experts have suggested that taking progestin only
twice a year may be frequent enough to prevent endometrial cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for women without a uterus, there is no need to take
progestin at all because they have no chance of developing
endometrial cancer. On estrogen alone, apparently the increase in
breast cancer risk is very small.
</P>
<P>
   What is the bottom line? Several studies now under way may help
to clarify both the risks and benefits of postmenopausal hormone
replacement, although none is likely to provide the definitive
answers that most women seek. But answers may not come in time for
the current generation of menopausal women because the kinds of
studies required to establish them are very costly, difficult to do
and would take decades to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, every woman facing the hormone decision must
evaluate the potential benefits and risks based on her own family
and personal medical history, as well as her comfort level with
taking or not taking hormones. Does she have a strong family
history of heart disease or breast cancer or, perhaps, even
Alzheimer's disease? Does she have highly cystic breasts? Has she
required one or more breast biopsies? Is she willing to modify her
living habits to reduce her risk of life-threatening chronic
diseases that are influenced by estrogen?

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seasonably cold, dry weather will dominate the Northeast Coast
on Tuesday as a brisk wind from the west descends the Appalachians
causing low clouds to yield to intervals of sunshine. An
approaching cold front will contribute to snow showers near the
eastern Great Lakes and along the west slopes of the northern
Appalachians. Very chilly air will return to the upper lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure over the Southeast will promote sunny and cool
conditions in most of the Carolinas. A stream of clouds associated
with the southern branch of the jet stream will spread across
Florida and the central Gulf States. Low pressure developing in the
western Gulf of Mexico should produce a cold rain in central Texas
and a wintry mixture from the Red River Valley to east central New
Mexico. Light rain and drizzle will dampen much of south Texas and
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonably mild conditions will cover the northern Rockies and
western Plains. A large fair weather system, crested over Wyoming,
will circulate Pacific air into this region with ample sunshine and
an active afternoon breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and strong winds are expected to buffet the Northwest Coast
as a potent disturbance approaches Washington. A surge of
relatively mild, moist air will raise snow levels and limit
freezing rain to a few patches well inland. Showers should reach
northern California late in the day. The Southwest will become
brighter and milder, especially as winds blow offshore in southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Forecasting Snow
</P>
<P>
   A storm that left a trace to more than a foot of snow around the
Northeast on Sunday supports the notion that predicting snow totals
is the most difficult problem in weather forecasting.
Meteorologists begin by estimating the amount of liquid that will
fall. On average, an inch of liquid will produce 10 inches of snow.
However, the ratio of liquid to solid precipitation can vary by
over 200 percent, depending on temperature and moisture conditions
aloft. Also, because the heaviest snow often occurs at temperatures
near freezing, mixtures of sleet and freezing rain complicate
snowfall forecasts.

THEORY, REALITY AND SKEPTICAL TOURISTS IN PHYSICS LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a Fodor's guide to Manhattan, the science of physics is
generally sold as the ultimate, indispensable, up-to-the-minute
guide to reality. The parallel is far from exact: physicists cannot
credibly tout their research as inexpensive and easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is one thing that the painstaking experiments and
deep thinking of physics are meant to produce, it is theories that
explain both the delights and the details of natural reality at its
most fundamental level.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as unwelcome news to some physicists that just as
their field is enjoying unparalleled success, its relationship to
reality is being questioned with a pointedness not seen for
decades. Since the doubters are mostly nonphysicists _
philosophers, historians, even the public in general _ it is as if
tourists from Keokuk had begun questioning just how unimpeachable
the guidebooks are.
</P>
<P>
   In a quick-and-dirty definition, reality would begin with
elementary particles and the interactions that bind them to build
the universe that our instruments measure, our eyes see and our
hands touch. Physics, with its ambition of understanding these
building blocks at the most basic level, therefore becomes a prime
target for doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Some motives for this skepticism can be found in the 20th
century's scientific triumphs themselves, said Dr. George Levine,
director of the Center for the Critical Analysis of Contemporary
Culture at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's provoked by the overwhelming authority that
science has been able to accumulate,'' Levine said. ``There's a
sense that there are a few adepts, highly trained, who talk to each
other, and there is no point of entry for anyone outside that
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven by that sense of disenfranchisement, Levine said, anyone
can scour the annals of philosophy for potential wedges to separate
science from an immutable, objective reality that it seeks to
explain. Philosophical pragmatists and empiricists, for example,
hold that while a successful theory should describe experiments as
accurately as possible, it has no necessary relation to ultimate
reality, partly because one can never say whether new experiments
will give new results and force changes in the theory.
</P>
<P>
   More irksome to physicists is a school that finds its source in
``The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,'' a book first published
in 1962 by the philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn. In this school,
the form that theories take has as much to do with the politics and
sociology of science as with its duty to describe reality.
</P>
<P>
   The book seemed to show that science did not progress inevitably
toward a better and better representation of reality, but instead
that scientists moved from one ``paradigm,'' or theoretical
framework, to another based on social and psychological factors as
well as experimental ones.
</P>
<P>
   That view suggests that research in any paradigm brings science
``closer to answering its own questions,'' said Dr. Steve Fuller, a
sociology professor at the University of Warwick in England, whose
book, ``Thomas Kuhn: A Philosophical History for Our Times,'' is to
be published soon by the University of Chicago Press. ``But those
questions are autonomous from the bigger question of how close they
are getting to reality as such.''
</P>
<P>
   Measured against such doubts, physicists almost seem to be
inhabiting another universe. For one thing, physicists regard their
theories as much more than a Fodor-like compendium of detail.
</P>
<P>
   Theories like the one governing elementary particle physics are
based on simple principles with a distinct aesthetic appeal. And
physicists point out that they have a presumably objective arbiter
for deciding the correctness of a theory: how well its predictions
compare with experiments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Dr. Frank Wilczek, a theoretical physicist at the
Institute for Advanced Study, and two other physicists came up with
the idea of asymptotic freedom, which held that the elementary
particles called quarks have the strange property that they feel
scarcely any mutual attraction when they are very near one another,
despite their powerful attraction when separated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that that has moved us closer
to reality,'' Wilczek said. ``There were experiments whose outcome
was doubtful,'' but they later supported the theory, he said. ``So,
yes, we have understood more; it's not a social construction.''
</P>
<P>
   When pushed, physicists will often concede that there is room,
at least linguistically, to wonder how absolute the correspondence
is between successful theories and what might be regarded as
ultimate reality.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the spirit of philosophical empiricism, theories get
revised in light of fresh evidence that they cannot explain.
Sometimes the need for later revision is clear even as the theories
are being devised: nearly all modern theories of matter and energy
are called ``effective field theories.''
</P>
<P>
   That qualifier, ``effective,'' means physicists already know
that as the level of energy of things like particle collisions is
pushed higher and higher, the theory gives wrong answers and cannot
be trusted _ even though physicists may not be sure how to fix it
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we always required that our field theories would
at least mathematically be consistent up to the highest possible
energies,'' said Dr. Chris Quigg, a physicist at the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory. ``Now we admit the feeling of humility.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Newton's laws of motion, which hold that gravity
moves objects by applying a force on them at some distance from a
star or planet, were superseded by Einstein's general theory of
relativity. In that view, the objects move because gravity curves
space around them, leaving force-at-a-distance out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   These revisions, however, do not rattle physicists, since the
earlier theories almost always remain mathematically valid in some
way or other. Effective field theories will still work at low
energies, even after a fancier version is developed for higher
energies; Newton's laws hold when the strength of gravity, and the
curvature, are small.
</P>
<P>
   As Fuller's book recounts, Kuhn rejected many skeptical schools
of thought that were generated by his own ideas. But with varying
degrees, those schools assert that the forms taken by accepted
scientific theories, at any level, have as much to do with
ephemeral factors of politics, personal influence and historical
chance as with reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason one theory becomes dominant is because of locally
specific, social factors which then get a kind of institutional
momentum at one time,'' Fuller said of his own views, which do
allow for a connection between physics and reality. The distance
between the two views is so great that cliche-makers have coined
the term ``science wars'' to describe their interaction.
</P>
<P>
   In a more worrisome if less fraught metaphor, scientists, who
depend heavily on public financing for their work, may wonder if
the doubts will someday keep the tourists, so to speak, from
feeling an occasional need to visit the scientific paradise of
ideas. Without those tourist dollars, the debate could become moot
even as it remains unresolved.

reform, which had consumed him and the Texas Legislature for months
in 1997, was dead. In the end, lawmakers voted to increase the

EXPOSING KIDS TO GOOD MULTICULTURAL MUSIC MAKES THE WORLD A BETTER
PLACE
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give children music and they smile.
</P>
<P>
   Give them rhythms and percussion and happy sounds, and they
dance and laugh and spin around and shake their hips _ joyously,
without a hint of self-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Give them music made all around the world, and not only will
they do all of the above, but they will begin what could, with
luck, be a lifetime discovery of other cultures and countries, from
the reggae of Jamaica to the sinuous salsa and merengue rhythms of
Latin America to the ``rancheras'' of Mexico to the jigs and reels
of Ireland to the zydeco of Louisiana, and more.
</P>
<P>
   World music _ and that includes such divergent influences as Bob
Marley, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the Chieftains, Johnny Clegg and
Ry Cooder's Cuban connection, the Buena Vista Social Club _ has
never been more popular.
</P>
<P>
   From contributions to pop records (see Paul Simon's
``Graceland)'' to collaborations (as in Ry Cooder and his Cuban
pals) to stand-alone releases (Ali Farka Toure or Bob Marley,
anyone?), world beat musicians have never been more high-profile.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you bring world beat music to your kids? And how do
you make the experience meaningful?
</P>
<P>
   It's as easy as playing music and talking, say several world
beat and children's music experts _ and it's an important part of
kids' development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate good is that if children can learn about other
cultures, there's enormous opportunity to expand their horizons and
make them interested in the world, to explore other cultures,''
says Dan Storper, president and CEO of Putumayo World Music, which
has released several excellent world beat children's records, as
well as, for schools, a multicultural curriculum kit that blends
cultural information and music. ``It's the first step toward
eradicating prejudice and racism.''
</P>
<P>
   And one of the most enjoyable. Remember, say Storper and
Grammy-nominated musician Linda Tillery, that you probably already
have some world music around the house, be it Marley or Santana or
Chieftains. Just find some world beat you like, start playing it
for your toddler and go from there, building a collection as time
and money permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids' tastes are far more eclectic than we imagine,'' says
Tillery, who has cut several children's records, including one,
``Shakin' a Tailfeather,'' that earned her and collaborator Taj
Mahal a 1998 Grammy nomination. ``And I'd start talking to them
about it as soon as they can understand.''
</P>
<P>
   What to say? Well, you can always listen to a song and then
explain what the music is, and where it comes from, and about the
country and culture of origin. Ask your kids why they like it. What
are some of the instruments they hear? How would they play them?
What do they know about, say, Africa or Cuba or Ireland?
</P>
<P>
   And from there, you can drop in little nuggets of history and
culture and discuss different races.
</P>
<P>
   Tillery says kids ``will follow a parent's lead. And they know
what they like. I'd play them 50 percent what they like and 50
percent what they might like but won't know unless they get a
chance to hear it. You can play Ladysmith for them and explain to
your child what makes their music different from music from another
place. You can never underestimate little people's ability to
absorb and retain information.''
</P>
<P>
   Storper advises parents to read the liner notes and mix
narratives with the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids love the romance of far-off places and imagining
themselves there,'' he says. ``If you can combine stories with
music, it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   This is becoming easier and easier to do. Fifteen years ago, the
Music For Little People label became the first record company to
introduce world music to children.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the label has a series of CDs by everyone from Los Lobos
to Sweet Honey In the Rock that combines children's stories with
bright, fun, colorful music. ``Gift of the Tortoise,'' for example,
fuses a story about Africa as told by an old tortoise with
Ladysmith's music.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's society, people in the U.S. are very isolated about
knowledge of other cultures,'' says Sheron Sherman, the label's
founder and CEO. ``It's important for children to know about this.
You can sing and play and dance and then sit down and talk with the
child about the country.''
</P>
<P>
   And giving kids these sorts of fun cultural lessons is
increasingly important, what whith pop music invading kids' lives
earlier and earlier, via teen-focus acts such as Britney Spears and
the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Those influences will inevitably creep in, but teaching kids
about music from other places at a young age lets them know there's
more out there than one-hit-wonder bands on VH1.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a kid, it's often uncomfortable to be on the
outside,'' Tillery says. ``But if you've introduced kids to
multicultural music, by the time they're 14 or so, they can hold
their own. They can value something other than American pop
music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get away from TV and videos,'' says Sherman. ``They
don't give anything to the intellect. There's no doubt this gets
harder as the kid grows up, but there's also no doubt I control my
9-year-old son Dusty's purse strings, too. I'm going to spend time
with him that he's just not going to listen to Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to parents to regulate what their child listens to,
not the child driving the parent. The more positive musical
experiences we can give our children, the better off the whole
country is going to be.''

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Finding cupid in the haystack can be as hard
as finding the proverbial needle, say some lonely-hearts who are
looking for friendship and romance in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I graduated in a town of 1,000 people,'' said Don Trewin of
Fredericksburg, Iowa. ``Half of the girls went to college and never
came back, and those who stayed around got married within a year or
two. Now there's no one left. Next thing I know, I'm partying with
the kids of the ones who got married.''
</P>
<P>
   Trewin was a prime candidate for membership in a club called
Singles in Agriculture, which aims to help single people who hanker
to socialize with someone other than farm animals or the county
extension agent.
</P>
<P>
   Living on a farm or ranch, miles away from a city, can make that
a bleak prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Singles in Agriculture, based in Pearl City, Ill., has about
1,600 members nationally and schedules several meetings a year,
including an annual national convention and social functions in
several states.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, the club has arranged mixers in
connection with the Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Trewin and about 40 other single men and women from across Texas
and the United States came to the show to mingle with kindred
spirits. In addition to the show, the group attended the rodeo and
visited the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The group allows anyone who is single, divorced or widowed to
join but asks that they have some background in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't come to meet Prince Charming or Cinderella,'' suggested
John Newcomb, who leads the club in Fort Worth. ``Just come to make
friends with people who have something in common with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The club does not promote high-pressure romance but offers a
venue for singles with like interests to meet for friendship, and
perhaps dates, said Jerome Hoelscher, who owns a farm near Midland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people get married and others just meet new people,''
Hoelscher said. ``It's just a chance to meet people with the same
kind of lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Dating people with urban backgrounds often ends in rejection for
some who live in the country, said Margie Hayden, who lives in San
Antonio but helps on her parents' farm in Floresville.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think it's a novelty,'' she said. ``They think, `Oh the
cows are interesting,' but they don't want to stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoelscher agreed. He said that some city slickers don't
appreciate the slow pace of rural life, with its lack of noise and
bright lights. In rural West Texas, he said, ``It's so quiet you
can hear the quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are different,'' Hoelscher said of city dwellers. ``Some
people, when they don't see the lights, they can't handle it. A lot
of people who live in the city don't want anything to do with a
farm. They say, `This is way out here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's why a group like Singles in Agriculture is needed to
bring people together, whether they find romance or not, said
Hayden, who had just finished a conversation about how to handle a
bull in a pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about working the animals,'' she said. ``You
can't do that with most people who only quote movies like `City
Slickers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The singles group has sparked several romances, some of which
have led to marriage. Group members range in age from about 45 to
55, but the club rules allow membership for anyone over 21. The
Iowa chapter is the largest, with about 380 members. The Texas
chapter has about 90.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Green, of Cedar Park, Texas, near Austin, said she joined
the group to socialize with those who have like interests. But if
she finds a significant other along the way, well, that's OK, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know if you can associate with people with a farming or
ranching background, then they are just good stock people,'' Green
said. ``But this is not one of those singles groups where everyone
has to get together.''
</P>
<P>
   Some singles in the group, however, wouldn't mind _ after
meeting the right someone _ joining an offshoot branch of the club,
Singles No More.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I joined the group was to look for guys,'' Hayden
said. ``There's lots of flirtation; that's always good. All the
guys dance with all the girls. It doesn't matter what you do or
what you look like. I hope to meet someone and think, `Gee, down
the road, maybe we'll be more than just friends.' ''

TV PROGRAMMING FOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS MORE BALANCED THIS YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's one television program airing this month that I'd
recommend without reservation, it's ``Freedom Song,'' a startling,
exceptionally well-acted examination of what happens when the civil
rights movement parachutes into a sleepy little Southern town and
engulfs it.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by real-life events and airing Feb. 27 on the cable
network TNT, ``Freedom Song'' is remarkable for what it is and
isn't _ meaning, for a production shoehorned into the Black History
Month celebration, it isn't two hours of white-on-black
victimization or a production devoted explicitly to racist violence
and black rage.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the production is noteworthy for its straightforward,
even gentle, storytelling, a coming-of-age declaration told through
the eyes of a teen-ager who can't comprehend or accept the
nonviolent techniques of his elders, particularly when they seem to
stiffen in the face of white oppressive danger.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't surprised to hear that ``Freedom Song'' was first
conceived as a feature film; nor was it shocking to learn that
executive producer, actor and activist Danny Glover, was turned
away from every major studio leery of this story's odds of
attracting not only a white audience but a sizable black one.
Networks couldn't fathom such a project, either.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, even African-Americans, weary from watching
lynchings and the psychological torture of a race that was once
deemed subhuman, have for the most part stayed away from movies
centering on the civil rights movement and even more so from slave
period pieces. (Which helps explain the box office crash and burn
of Oprah Winfrey's ``Beloved''; well, that, and a convoluted story
line.)
</P>
<P>
   Part of the blame goes to the filmmakers. Let's face it:
Television, from the big networks to the tiny cable channels, is so
hungry for black history product during February it seems that
almost anything passes the black heritage litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings often go up anyway, driven by promotions and provocative
subject matter (the Sally Hemings-Thomas Jefferson
was-it-love-or-rape? project should do just fine), so it's a
win-win situation in attracting a few more viewers than usual and
earning brownie points from that picky NAACP. Unfortunately, in the
past, most of the stuff was bad.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that some of the best TV movies with
African-American themes have aired during months other than
February and on cable _ ``Miss Evers' Boys,'' ``Dorothy
Dandridge,'' ``A Lesson Before Dying,'' for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's cable's growth or the suggestion that racial
matters are being discussed openly again (the 1998 dragging death
of James Byrd in Jasper certainly got things going here), this is
one of the more balanced months of black history progamming in
years. And it got that way without much help from the major
networks, which are increasingly concentrating on more important
sweeps battles.
</P>
<P>
   Even CBS' ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal'' (the fact that
``scandal'' is used in the title suggests the kind of viewers CBS
wants to attract) as a four-hour miniseries exploring the origins
of the controversial 38-year relationship between Thomas Jefferson
(Sam Neill) and his slave is more a dramatic serial than historical
examination.
</P>
<P>
   Sally is played by a strikingly beautiful Carmen Ejogo (every
Sally I've seen so far has been enormously gorgeous, which points
to the creators' theories that Jefferson simply couldn't help
himself), who falls for the rich and influential statesman while
working as Jefferson's maid in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Sally Hemings'' shifts back to America, Sally, now a slave,
continues the affair, giving birth to Jefferson's children, which
threatens Jefferson's presidency and wealth. The miniseries airs at
8 p.m. CST Sunday, Feb. 13, and Wednesday, Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   On cable, I recommend ``The Color of Friendship,'' about a white
South African exchange student and her black American family. The
scenes are woefully telegraphed, but it manages to sidestep a
number of cliches to deliver a subtle lecture on prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1977, ``The Color of Friendship'' is based on the true
story of U.S. Rep. Ron V. Dellums and his family, who were shocked
when a white South African showed up on their doorstep. (Director
Kevin Hooks says this actually happened twice to the family; the
first girl adapted well. The second was more entrenched in the
apartheid system, so sparks flew.)
</P>
<P>
   There are other notable programs that are listed below. Does
this signal the television industry's willingness to deal with past
injustices candidly? We'll see. No matter how painful it is to
watch TLC's ``Civil Rights Martyrs: Free at Last,'' which is about
the personal stories of those who gave their lives for the civil
rights movement, it's these cinematic efforts that will ensure that
this American Holocaust is not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs this month (all times CST):
</P>
<P>
   ``Sidney Poitier: One Bright Light, An American Masters
Special'' (8 p.m. Wednesday, PBS) _ How amazing is it that Poitier
remains the only black American to receive a Best Actor or Best
Actress Oscar? His career is defined and documented here through
interviews with Quincy Jones, James Earl Jones and Denzel
Washington, the current best bet to match Poitier in Best Actor
honors. (Washington has a Best Supporting Actor Oscar and just won
a Golden Globe for Best Actor.) Most impressive about ``One Bright
Light'' is how it uses the modern history of blacks in American
film as a nice backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Color of Friendship'' (6:30 p.m. Feb. 5, Disney) _
Inspired by true events in the life of black congressman Dellums,
this is the touching story of a friendship between two teen-age
girls _ a white South African exchange student and the black
American girl whose family has taken her in for the summer. The
South African (Lindsay Haun) is a product of the apartheid system
and views blacks as second-class citizens. The Disney film, which
is set in 1977 and targets young viewers, is moving and effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color Me Dark'' (6:30 p.m. Feb. 7, HBO) _ Fictional story of
Nellie Lee Love, a young Southern girl who moves to Chicago to
learn that even in a place where black Americans can own
businesses, shops and restaurants, racism is just below the
surface. This is part of the terrific ``Dear America'' series of
Scholastic's bestselling book series. (MORE) nn

SICK AND WIRED? TAKE 2 DOT.COMS _ BUT CALL YOUR DOCTOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's ironic, isn't it, how medical information gleaned from the
Internet can have detrimental side effects.
</P>
<P>
   I recently took the life-expectancy quiz on the Web site
health.yahoo.com. The test results told me I may live to age 80. If
I drop all my bad habits, it said, I'll live to age 82.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years gained? Really? I decide the quiz is solid proof
I should lie around and eat chocolate, lest I spend the last two
years of my old age bitter about not having taken more time to
enjoy life. This is likely not the result the health.yahoo.com
folks had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are flocking to health-related Web sites. One popular
site, the Mayo Clinic Health Oasis, reported nearly 2 million
visits in November, about double the number of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocacy groups watching the Web say the Internet is a
valuable tool for researching health conditions, if we do so with a
good dose of caution.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of room for error. Using the Alta Vista search
engine, I found 87,658 sites that mention back pain. Obviously, not
all of those sites are worthy of an Internet browser's time.
</P>
<P>
   Here's advice from consumer advocates for judging Web sites:
</P>
<P>
   Information on the Web should support, not replace, a patient's
relationship with his or her doctor. That's the most important rule
for consumers, say consumer groups, which would frown upon me
making a health decision based on an Internet quiz.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to distinguish between reliable and
questionable sources is to consider who sponsors the page.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayo Clinic recommends looking for pages sponsored by
well-known sources, such as medical schools, government agencies or
national organizations like the American Cancer Society or the
American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Those sites aren't selling or representing a product, and are
therefore more likely to offer objective information.
</P>
<P>
   Web addresses ending with .gov indicate the page is sponsored by
a government agency; a nonprofit organization's address ends with
.org; and sites by colleges and universities end with .edu.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial sites _ those with addresses followed by .com _ can
be good sources for information, but read them with some caution.
The ``dot-coms'' sometimes find themselves in real or perceived
conflicts of interest. ``Men's Fitness'' magazine in its December
issue reported that DrKoop.com, the site started by former Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop, had listed 14 hospitals as the ``most
innovative,'' only to have it revealed that those hospitals had
paid to be in the listing. The site has since abandoned the
practice of mixing advertising and editorial content, ``Men's
Fitness'' reported.
</P>
<P>
   One example of a good commercial site is health.yahoo.com, which
provides a roundup of articles from mainstream news sources, such
as The Associated Press and Reuters news service. This site is
considered commercial not because it sells a product it might be
tempted to tout, but because it sells advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Sites that sell products can contain insightful information,
but, again, read them with caution. Know that clickwell.com, for
instance, is a vitamin purveyor, and its lengthy list of columns on
fitness and nutrition are interesting, but remember it will not
steer you away from vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the site address, it's a good idea to click on
the ``About Us'' or ``Mission Statement'' icon found on most Web
sites. They offer insight into the policies of the page's sponsor,
and oftentimes disclaimers that stress the limits that should be
placed upon the information.
</P>
<P>
   Health on the Net, a consortium of health-care providers, says
readers should look for the following information on any credible
Internet health page: the author's credentials, the date the
information was last modified, whether any personal medical
information they are collecting will remain confidential,
attribution for all sources, and a statement on the advertising or
funding policy for the page.
</P>
<P>
   As for the e-junk that arrives unsolicited in your in-box, be
careful. For one thing, those e-mailings use way too many capital
letters and exclamation points. To me, messages such as ``NO SIDE
EFFECTS!!!!!'' or ``QUICK WEIGHT LOSS,'' suggest a digital snake
oil salesman, so I delete them right away. Any message without a
name, address and telephone number should be considered suspect,
says Quackwatch, a nonprofit Internet site that offers consumer
advice on medical Web sites. And the Mayo Clinic warns against
sites that promise cures, put down other sites or insist that you
buy a special product.  &QL; 
Reliable Web sites
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of Web sites with a reputation for reliability:
</P>
<P>
   www.hon.ch _ This site, sponsored by the Swiss-based Health on
the Net Foundation, screens Web sites for reliability of
information. Surfers can use the foundation's Web site to search
for other reliable sites.
</P>
<P>
   www.mayohealth.org _ This Mayo Clinic site includes screening
tests and consumer news.
</P>
<P>
   www.nlm.nih.gov _ The National Library of Medicine, the National
Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human
Services operate this site, which offers searches of 4,300
biomedical journals.
</P>
<P>
   www.healthfinder.gov _ This Department of Health and Human
Services site provides links to a broad selection of health-related
sites on the Web, as well as publications.

<P>
   The ancient technique of acupuncture is now being used for
cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   `` Needles unblock pathways through which the vital energy
called Qi flows,'' says acupuncturist Henry Woo, Ph.D., of Newport
Beach, Calif. ``Traditional Chinese Medicine treats a wide variety
of conditions this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Best known for relieving pain, acupuncture's uses in the West
keep expanding. Inserting needles into pressure points throughout
the body to increase well-being goes back more than 2,5000 years.
</P>
<P>
   But using the hair-thin needles to accentuate beauty represents
a whole new concept in cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needles stimulate circulation and tone the muscles
underneath the skin,'' says Woo. ``Stimulating energy centers
restores the Yin/Yang, or balance of energy in the body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased,'' says Sandy Ridout of Huntington Beach,
California. ``I can see that the fine lines under my eyes lessened,
and my smile lines diminished a lot. I'm most pleased about that.''
</P>
<P>
   COSMETIC ACUPUNCTURE
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners assert that lines around the eyes, and wrinkles
that form around the mouth respond quickly to acupuncture
treatments. But inviting as the treatment seems, not many
acupuncturists offer it, says Woo, because of the time involved.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cosmetic therapy, Woo treats a host of disorders
with acupuncture, including addictions, weight problems, pain,
adult acne, bedwetting and even infertility. ``It opens the
channels through which energy flows, and rejuvenates the body's
cells. The improvement shows in the face by relaxing and
strengthening the muscles below the skin, which helps eliminate
wrinkles.''
</P>
<P>
   Since people often fear needles, Woo uses techniques to ease
their anxiety. ``I help patients overcome their fear of needles by
first showing them that I use very fine, disposable needles made of
steel. They don't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Background music and dim lighting further the relaxed
atmosphere. The number of needles that Woo uses can vary from
patient to patient. Some require as few as nine, and others need 16
or so placed strategically around their face. ``The needles bring
more circulation to the area where they are inserted,'' says Woo,
``which brings more rejuvenating oxygen to the cells. The needles
activate the fiber under the skin too, and give it more
elasticity.''
</P>
<P>
   NEEDLE PLACEMENT
</P>
<P>
   After Woo cleans the patient's face with alcohol, he uses tape
to put pressure on the muscles. Anesthesia cream is applied to the
sensitive lip area to avoid discomfort. Then he inserts the needles
at angles of less than 15 degrees, mostly pointing toward the top
of the head. This takes about 15 minutes, and the needles remain in
place for about a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   Woo also inserts two needles into the hand to stimulate
circulation to the face. ``It's the same pressure point used to
stop a toothache or a headache,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Woo cleanses the face again with alcohol after removing the
needles, and massages the patient's face for about five minutes. A
Chinese cream restores moisture and nourishes the skin. Ten
treatments usually do the job. Then, maintenance visits once or
twice a month renew the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   EASY TO KEEP UP
</P>
<P>
   Much cheaper than a surgical facelift, patients pay about $45
for each acupuncture treatment. Woo explains that restoring the
essential energy, or Qi, (pronounced chee) improves mood and
increases a sense of well being. This shows in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes patients experience a momentary stinging or tingling
sensation when needles are inserted,'' he says. ``That is then
followed by a complete sense of relaxation and ease.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up energy stagnation and restoring a balanced flow of
Qi through the body represents a radically different approach to
achieving beauty than a surgical facelift. The focus on the whole
person and improving energy flow appeals to many.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, surgical facelifts last 10 or 12 years
even if you have good skin tone,'' says Sandy Ridout, ``which I do.
Eventually, I'll probably have a facelift like that. But if I can
put it off, that's a good idea, I think. Acupuncture seems like a
better way to get rid of wrinkles right now because it's easy to
keep up. And there's no pain involved, or recuperation time. I
enjoy the procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   ACUPUNCTURE USED WIDELY
</P>
<P>
   A consensus statement from the National Institutes of Health
states that acupuncture has been used by millions of Americans.
Thousands of physicians, dentists, and other practitioners have
used acupuncture for the relief of pain, and many other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the field still remains relatively new to the public,
issues such as training, licensure, and insurance coverage need
further clarification. The majority of states offer licensure or
registration for acupuncturists, but not all states recognize the
same credentialing exam. A nationally recognized exam has been
established, however, for physicians who become acupuncturists.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Food and Drug Administration recently removed
acupuncture needles from the category of ``experimental medical
devices,'' and now regulates them just like surgical scalpels and
hypodermic syringes. This ensures good manufacturing practices and
high standards of sterility. The FDA recommends that the needles be
used only once.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH consensus statement lists many health problems that
acupuncture may help mitigate including addiction, rehabilitation
after stoke, headaches, menstrual cramps, myofascial pain, back
pain, asthma, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome and
fibromyalgia. The consensus panel concluded that further research
is likely to uncover additional areas where acupuncture
interventions will be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture's positive effects seem to radiate in an all
encompassing way for some patients. ``I feel like I'm brighter,''
says Sandy Ridout. ``It gives me a better feeling just to know I
don't have wrinkles. ``I'm a preventive type person, and my
appearance and my mood are important to me. I needed a perker-upper
and this is it.''

   Mademoiselle magazine, breathless and buoyant, says that men are
turned on by images of women and balloons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cheryl Frazier &LR; , producer of a series of ``Bare Balloon Babe''
videos, says ``Some guys are Inflators _ they like to watch women
blowing up balloons _ while Poppers have more particular tastes:
Some like balloons popped by hand; others prefer high heels.''

<P>
   ``I know she's going to pop it,'' said one fan of the genre,
``but not when or how. It's thrilling.''

   &UR; _ Boy George  &LR; has made a series of TV ads for an Irish
insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Randall Koll &LR; , just back from New Orleans, reports that mega
successful novelist  &UR; Anne Rice  &LR; has opened a store that sells
``vampire-inspired novelties'' and ``wigs, shoes and jewelry that
Anne herself has worn _ all signed.'' Koll says that tags on the
wigs read ``worn by Novelist Anne Rice.''
</P>
<P>
   The store's  &UR; Esther Beeson &LR;  told us that the clothes include
items ``she wore on her book tours,'' for example, three wedding
dresses priced between $800 and $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Catherine Zeta-Jones &LR; , engaged to  &UR; Michael Douglas &LR;  and
pregnant by him, is apparently enthusiastic about his politics,
too. Douglas is a major supporter of Ploughshares, the San
Francisco Foundation that works for disarmament. The Times of
London says that Zeta-Jones has promised to join her fiance,
Archbishop  &UR; Desmond Tutu &LR;  and former President  &UR; Jimmy Carter &LR;  at a
disarmament conference in Atlanta later this month.

   _ The Barbie PC, released by Mattel last fall, contains about
half the educational software packed into the company's similar
computer for boys, the Hot Wheels PC. A Mattel spokeswoman told the
New York Times that programs such as Barbie Fashion Designer and
Detective Barbie used so much space that there wasn't room enough
for more educational software.
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers at University of California at Irvine have
determined that right nostrils are able more than left to perceive
smells as more pleasant, but left nostrils are better at
identifying scents. The probable reason, says  &UR; Larry Cahill &LR;  in a
study published in New Scientist, is that one side of the brain
controls emotional processing, the other is logical and
calculating.
</P>
<P>
   _ New wrist devices are serving as cell phones, pagers, e-mail
readers, cameras, music players, TV sets, voice recorders, games,
compasses, weather stations and more. ``Timex is interest in the
real estate of the wrist,'' the watch company's  &UR; Susie &LR; 
 &UR; Watson &LR;  said. It's location, location, location. The wrist is the
most exciting and accessible place on the body.''
</P>
<P>
   _ But what about toes? ``The biggest unspoken fear men have when
it comes to footwear can be summed up in a word,'' says P.O.V.
magazine, in a story forwarded by  &UR; Ken Maley &LR; . ``Sandals. Brash in
the boardroom and brazen with women, men time and again find
themselves intimidated by the thought of actually buying a dress
sandal and using it as a weapon in the fashion arsenal. Fight on,
brothers.''

<P>
   _ For a romantic dinner, says Bon Appetit, start with artichoke
petals, have pumpkin pie for dessert and use tall candles, because
``low votive candles make you look like Dracula.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The donkey population of Italy is dropping, so Milan ass
breeder  &UR; Eugenio Milonis &LR; , who presides over the Web site
www.asinomania.cjb.net, is using the Internet to find eligible sex
partners for his donkeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your donkey is lonely,'' says the banner on the site,
quoted in the Australian newspaper, ``send him to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When taken care of,'' says the site, ``the donkey is quick,
docile and hard-working. If not, it can become lazy, narrow-minded
and hard-headed. It will always take after its owner.''

   ``Putting on lipstick next to Milla Jovovich works for me. It
was like standing on a fashion set of all your favorite models.
There were two levels of women: those that were seven feet tall and
the rest of us. But I tell you, the taller lovelies have immense
feet. It made me feel much better about my height.''

   ALLIED _ Allied Holdings is North America's leading car-hauler,
delivering more than 12 million new vehicles a year to dealerships
under contract to auto-makers. The problem with rising demand for
SUVs and trucks is that fewer of the bulky vehicles fit on a
trailer, cutting Allied's average load about 20 percent over the
last few years. That helped push the company's earnings into the
ditch for much of 1999 while Allied tried to adjust its pricing
structure, as well as recover from a mid-1998 strike at its biggest

   TECH-CHIPMEMORY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ If computer users are going to
harness the latest whiz-bang processing performance, their
computers had better have memory chips that are running lickety

expensive new processor chips will be sitting idle most of the time
and not earning their keep. Memory chip makers have created a
series of faster memory technologies throughout the 1990s. Usually,
after a short period of time, the new standard dominates and all
the world's memory makers shift their production to the new
technology. But this year and next year, things could go
differently. Two competing standards could emerge, and, if they do,
then life gets a little more complicated for the companies that
make computers and for PC buyers as well. (Ladendorf, Austin

PRIEST SERIES, DAY III 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eds. please note: EMBARGOED FOR TUESDAY AMs FEB. 1; HOLD FOR
RELEASE
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thom Savage was a beloved man, an energetic, fun-loving
soul who made an impression on Catholics and non-Catholics alike.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, when he was chosen to lead Rockhurst College in Kansas
City, Mo., at age 41, Savage was the nation's youngest Jesuit
college president. Over the next eight years, he became a highly
respected community leader.
</P>
<P>
   When he unexpectedly died last May at age 51, he was eulogized
as ``a meteor that burned itself out in the service of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone says Savage was all of those things. He also was a
priest who died of AIDS. Yet he kept his illness so quiet that he
didn't even tell his family until weeks before his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard,'' said the Rev. James Savage, one of Thom
Savage's older brothers and a priest in Cambridge, Mass. ``It's
particularly difficult to think that he would have gone through all
of this by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   As Savage's death illustrates, a priest with AIDS is still a
matter so sensitive that it has yet to be fully addressed by the
church, by priests' families _ or even by the priests themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that until the church starts encouraging a more
healthy understanding of sexuality, priests will continue to die of
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's depressing,'' said the Rev. Thomas Gumbleton, auxiliary
bishop of the Archdiocese of Detroit. ``The bishops just won't face
the fact that there's a problem and that they should be doing
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders say they are now searching for ways to prevent
the spread of AIDS, including more sex education in the seminaries
and HIV tests for priest applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more radical suggestions are eliminating the
requirement that priests be celibate, changing church doctrine on
homosexuality and banning gays from the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dennis Rausch, a Florida priest who has AIDS, says
those with the disease don't have to hide it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is more open, there's less judgmentalism and
there's more support,'' Rausch said. ``(Priests) don't have to be
as afraid as they once were.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the church in some ways is still in denial. And
many priests with AIDS continue to suffer in silence.
</P>
<P>
   The day Savage died, Rockhurst officials issued a news release
attributing the death to severe respiratory problems. His death
certificate, however, names AIDS as the only cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``For such a public person...his final going forth from life was
a very private experience,'' James Savage said. ``I just think that
he must have been terribly, terribly isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   BREAKER HED: Little progress
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, at the first national gathering to address HIV and AIDS
in the priesthood, the spectacle shocked conference participants:
Three priests with AIDS entered the auditorium wearing bags on
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were deathly afraid,'' said the Rev. Rodney DeMartini,
executive director of the National Catholic AIDS Network, a
church-sanctioned group that focuses on AIDS education. ``Not only
of the virus living in their bodies. They were deathly afraid of
being recognized, deathly afraid of any consequence to them, to
their community, to their diocese, because they were living with
HIV and AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, DeMartini said, little has changed in the last 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still people today, they may not wear bags over
their heads, but they are not wanting to know their own (HIV)
status, or, if they do, they are not wanting to say anything to
anybody until they have to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church has no policy on dealing with priests
who have HIV or AIDS. Some dioceses and religious orders have
developed their own guidelines, DeMartini said, but many have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other reality is that a lot of clergy just don't want to
be out as people with AIDS,'' DeMartini said. ``What we're trying
to do is, as much as possible, encourage support, resourcing and
less shame and blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who counsel and treat priests with AIDS say the church
must start talking more openly about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   At their fall convention in November, U.S. bishops addressed
everything from a decline in prayerful silence before Mass to
church architecture.
</P>
<P>
   They did not, however, discuss sexuality issues.
</P>
<P>
   Requests by /{The Kansas City Star/} to interview Roman Catholic
cardinals in the United States and high-ranking church officials in
Rome about the newspaper's findings were declined.
</P>
<P>
   That perplexes Gumbleton, who has been critical of how the
church has handled the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ready within the institutional church to look at
these hard issues and confront them the way we should,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKER HED: Education and discussion
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Rev. James J. Gill watched as priests came to him
for treatment of sexual problems long after the ``acting out'' had
begun. The priests told Gill they were scared to talk about their
sexual inclinations while in the seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid they'd get thrown out if they brought up
something sexual, or else they said there was nobody they could
talk with,'' said Gill, a senior consultant at the Institute of
Living in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   For Gill, a Jesuit priest and psychiatrist, that raised a
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who trains, who educates the faculty members, the spiritual
directors, the teachers, to be able to deal with the sexuality of
the young people who come under their care?''

   In 1994, Gill started The Christian Institute for the Study of
Human Sexuality. Gill and his 10-member faculty train those who
teach prospective priests.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Silver Spring, Md., the program runs 30 days and costs
$3,000. Students participate in role-playing to gain experience in
counseling priests about sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
   To date, about 400 have been through Gill's program. What
baffles him is that more haven't attended.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Mary Ann Walsh, spokeswoman for the United States
Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the church holds Gill's
program in ``very high regard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't say, `Everybody go see Jim Gill.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Also working to curb AIDS in the priesthood is the National
Catholic AIDS Network.

   ALLIED _ Allied Holdings is North America's leading car-hauler,
delivering more than 12 million new vehicles a year to dealerships
under contract to auto-makers. The problem with rising demand for
SUVs and trucks is that fewer of the bulky vehicles fit on a
trailer, cutting Allied's average load about 20 percent over the
last few years. That helped push the company's earnings into the
ditch for much of 1999 while Allied tried to adjust its pricing
structure, as well as recover from a mid-1998 strike at its biggest
customer, General Motors. fact box. (Thurston, Atlanta

   TECH-CHIPMEMORY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ If computer users are going to
harness the latest whiz-bang processing performance, their
computers had better have memory chips that are running lickety

expensive new processor chips will be sitting idle most of the time
and not earning their keep. Memory chip makers have created a
series of faster memory technologies throughout the 1990s. Usually,
after a short period of time, the new standard dominates and all
the world's memory makers shift their production to the new
technology. But this year and next year, things could go
differently. Two competing standards could emerge, and, if they do,
then life gets a little more complicated for the companies that

   Eds. please note: EMBARGOED FOR TUESDAY AMs FEB. 1; HOLD FOR
RELEASE
</P>
<P>
   ...the National Catholic AIDS Network.
</P>
<P>
   As its director, DeMartini conducts workshops for dioceses and
religious orders. He says priests need to learn to address issues
of ``nonconsolidated sexual identity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That means I act different than I speak,'' DeMartini
explained. ``It's what happens when the collar comes off....It's
what happens when I find myself taking risks, even though I
understand in my head fully how HIV is transmitted.''
</P>
<P>
   BREAKER HED: AIDS testing
</P>
<P>
   Most dioceses and orders now require priest applicants to
undergo HIV-antibody tests, according to the National Catholic AIDS
Network and church officials.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say testing is a safeguard against escalating medical
costs and a means of ensuring that the priests can perform their
duties. Others, however, fear that it's a way to exclude gays from
the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   Each diocese or order decides whether to reject a priest
applicant who tests HIV-positive. Some say that a positive test
shouldn't disqualify an applicant. Others argue that the means of
contraction is an important issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was sexually transmitted and if the person has a
sexually active background, well, that should be taken into
consideration,'' said the Rev. John Keenan, a priest and
psychologist who runs Trinity House in Chicago, a church-sponsored
outpatient clinic for priests.
</P>
<P>
   The Diocese of Oakland, Calif., does not require testing. The
Rev. Jim Schexnayder, executive director of the National
Association of Catholic Diocesan Lesbian and Gay Ministries, who
developed the Oakland policy, said several factors went into the
decision not to test.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was that it's limited in terms of what it's trying to
communicate,'' Schexnayder said. ``You'd have to test regularly,
because one test at one time would not necessarily resolve the
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor, he said, was that ``money that had been spent
relative to HIV medical treatment from the policy provider
indicated that the larger costs were not for HIV, but for other
kinds of issues, like cardiac problems and cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   BREAKER HED: Homosexuality and celibacy
</P>
<P>
   The number of priests with HIV or AIDS may force the church to
examine more closely its doctrine on homosexuality, which has been
a divisive issue for years.
</P>
<P>
   Even among priests, there is little room for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dan McCarthy, for example, marches in New York City's
Gay Pride Parade dressed in his clerical clothing. ``I am quite
proud to identify myself as a gay man,'' the priest and
psychotherapist said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Charles Fiore, however, thinks openly gay priests
should leave the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am damned mad at those people who accept the power and the
glory and the honor of the priesthood and then foul the nest,'' the
Wisconsin priest said.
</P>
<P>
   Some priests and liberal Catholics think the church needs to
rescind its doctrine that considers homosexual relations a sin and
calls for all homosexuals to be chaste.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Catholics say the church has no authority to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Church's teaching on homosexuality is based on the Bible,
the word of God,'' wrote one priest who responded to /{The Kansas
City Star's/} confidential nationwide survey of 3,000 priests.
``What is needed is greater fidelity to the Catholic Church, to
Christ, to the Gospel and Word of God.''
</P>
<P>
   BREAKER HED: Recommendations
</P>
<P>
   Many priests who have died of AIDS _ including the Rev. Thom
Savage and some of those who attended St. Stanislaus seminary in
the turbulent 1960s _ got caught in the crossfire of the culture
and of the times.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it would have been different had AIDS struck today
instead of two decades ago, as the social pendulum swings toward a
new conservatism and powerful new drugs are suppressing the deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths are down sharply since the introduction of AIDS drugs. In
1998, AIDS killed 17,047 persons in the United States _ a decline
of 20 percent from 1997. From 1996 to 1997, the drop in deaths was
a more dramatic 42 percent. The difference in those percentages
raises questions about whether the medications already are losing
their punch or whether some AIDS patients are failing to take them
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials now fear that the drugs may be encouraging
those at risk to let down their guards. At the first National HIV
Prevention Conference in August, researchers said AIDS patients may
become less likely to use a condom or to abstain from risky
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors, researchers worry, could cause the death rate to
shoot up again.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent that, many priests think the church needs to provide
more education about sexuality issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rausch, the Florida priest who has AIDS and ministers to others
with the disease, said seminaries also need to provide more AIDS
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several of us priests who are HIV-positive who would
love to go and talk as a panel, for example, to the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, and let them hear from us
first-hand what it's like to...live with this disease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing two of his best friends and many acquaintances to
AIDS, the Rev. William Hart McNichols, a Jesuit priest and noted
iconographer, believes there is hope _ for gays, for priests with
AIDS, and for the Catholic Church's struggle to deal with those
issues.
</P>
<P>
   McNichols thinks, however, that the ultimate challenge is for
the church to discover why God created gay people. He thinks gays
have many gifts to offer and have been major contributors to the
image of the church, citing as examples two men who many art
historians agree were homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michelangelo made the Sistine Chapel. St. Peter's Basilica was
designed by him, too,'' McNichols noted. ``Leonardo da Vinci, who
did the Last Supper, was gay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jon Fuller, a Boston priest and physician who
specializes in AIDS, doesn't believe the hundreds of priests'
deaths from AIDS-related illnesses were in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it has made us look at the issue of homosexuality
more closely,'' Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths also show the need for more open and honest
discussion about sexual issues within the church, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Savage wishes his brother had been more open
about his illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he could have kept his spirits up as well as
he did, because to me, to be without personal support, human
support, I just find that to be very, very sad.''

   INDEPENDENTS _ NEW HAMPSHIRE _ New Hampshire independents,
famous for making up their minds the week before the primary, cast
ballots today. With the polls narrowing for weeks, who knows if
they'll go for Gov. George W. Bush, whose camp admits he could

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ Independents comprise about 37 percent of New
Hampshire's electorate, and an even larger share of its political
lore. But are they really the persnickity old New Englanders of
political stereotype, who vote regularly and steer their own
course? On closer inspection, it turns out the majority of New
Hampshire's independents are younger people who moved here recently
and don't care much about politics. The independents of legend do
exist, but overall New Hampshire's electorate may not be so unique.

UNDER ECUADOR'S DEMOCRATIC PATINA IS THE MILITARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAVIER ALDAPE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The military, again, reigns supreme.
</P>
<P>
   Newly installed Ecuadorean leaders and the U.S. State Department
tried to characterize Ecuador's recent political turmoil as a
constitutional transfer of power. Not quite. The constitution's
remaining shreds are so smudged by the military's fingerprints that
they're practically illegible.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, the military staged a coup, toppling the democratically
elected president, Jamil Mahuad. After all but inviting indigenous
protesters to take over the Congress building in Quito on Jan. 21,
Defense Minister Carlos Mendoza stripped Mahuad of all military
protection and asked for his resignation. Mahuad fled the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   Moving swiftly to fill the power vacuum he instigated, Mendoza
that same day announced the creation of a new ruling triumvirate
made up of him, an indigenous leader and a former supreme court
justice.
</P>
<P>
   A mere eight hours later, Mendoza dissolved that council and
installed the vice president as the nation's ruler. U.S. pressure
and equivocation from several military leaders prompted the return
to civilian authority.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, a country mired in the throes of economic collapse
has now installed its sixth president in four years and earned
itself the dubious distinction of being the home of the ``First
Coup of the 2000s.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarmingly, the Ecuadorean military's most recent assault on
democracy was not an aberrant act but rather the culmination of its
increasing involvement in civilian life. As in Venezuela, the
military and its standards of order and discipline have become the
country's de facto political compass, serving as a check on
civilian mismanagement and corruption. Paraguay has seen a similar
trend in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   A shift toward greater military interference in this
hemisphere's civilian governments is of grave concern. U.S. policy
has discarded the ideological litmus test of the Cold War. For now,
the United States continues to reject overt military involvement in
governments, but it appears willing to accept the more insidious
behind-the-scenes control.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, that may help guarantee some stability; in
the long term, it fortifies the military's role in Latin American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the return of democratic rule in 1979, a military
triumvirate ruled Ecuador. In the years since, corruption,
mismanagement and political stasis have plagued the country.
</P>
<P>
   Vast regional differences _ particularly between the insulated,
mountain bureaucrats in Quito and the tropical, entrepreneurial
bankers and traders in Guayaquil _ only served to further striate
the country's political legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   This latent regionalism was both assuaged and then ignited by a
singularly decisive event: the war with Peru and subsequent peace
agreement, ending 150 years of territorial disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador occasionally fought skirmishes along its southern border
with Peru over a remote, sparsely populated part of the rain
forest. These periodic moments of nationalist fervor were
buttressed by an absurd claim to Amazonian lands printed on state
letterhead and reflected in national maps. This helped political
leaders gloss over the country's intractable poverty and regional
schism.
</P>
<P>
   In January and February 1995, the two countries again fought a
limited war. The military emerged re-energized and highly
respected.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that a delicate cease-fire was implemented,
then-President Sixto Duran-Ballen's tenure was virtually over. An
aging, statesmanlike figure, he lacked the political capital to
initiate meaningful change, and his coalition government was
grossly fractured. Amid signs of economic deterioration, the
country looked to the 1996 presidential election for answers.
</P>
<P>
   The answer provided was the wrong one.
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo-populist Abdala Bucaram was best known by his nickname,
``El Loco (The Crazy One),'' which he reveled in.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuadorean presidential elections have long been dictated by
regional politics. The July 1996 runoff pitted two Guayaquil
politicians, though: Bucaram, adored by the poor and reviled by the
monied, and Jaime Nebot, Social Christian party leader. Nebot's
party was anathema to much of the population outside the coast.
Privately, some hoped for a Bucaram victory, believing it would
lead to a military coup.
</P>
<P>
   Though often suggested in jest, it was a telling quip in a
country with few national figures of authority. Power and respect
resided with both the military and the Roman Catholic Church _ the
military still glowed in the aura of its war with Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Bucaram did win, but ratcheted corruption and a deadlocked
Congress led to a massive national strike. Congress took advantage
of this and deposed Bucaram in February 1997 for ``mental
incapacity.'' Though the hoped-for coup did not materialize, a
late-night TV interview with a high-ranking general who voiced
support for the congressional action effectively ended Bucaram's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The military did not openly oppose Bucaram, but the removal of
its support was crucial to his fall. That same month, Bucaram went
into exile in Panama, and the military manipulated the subsequent
transfer of power. Vice President Rosal!a Arteaga was president for
a weekend before ceding control to the president of the Congress,
Fabi n Alarc''n.
</P>
<P>
   Though Western governments applauded the peaceful transfer, left
unsaid was the fact that the military was now a political enforcer
of sorts. Though officially apolitical, the military reasserted
itself as a political power of great authority.
</P>
<P>
   Jamil Mahuad, 51, was elected president in July 1998 after an
extremely successful term as mayor of Quito, including the
installation of a new trolley bus line that helped ease congestion
in the highly polluted mountain capital.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the candidates, Mahuad was the most promising. His
Harvard education suggested that the United States would be apt to
smile on his election, and his significant electoral bloc in a
historically fractured Congress gave many at least a glimmer of
hope.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the lack of congressional consensus, the
continued fall of the monetary unit _ the sucre _ and the growing
instability in the local financial markets engulfed Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
   He did sign a peace agreement with Peru in October 1998, ending
the long-simmering dispute. Unwittingly, that merely accelerated
the country's downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   After a short period of celebration, the country quickly
realized that it faced no external enemy. The deeply held regional
differences were exacerbated, as the yoke of nationalism, which the
conflict with Peru helped to maintain, had been gravely
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The military suddenly found itself with no rival and with no
definable purpose. The military's stated goal was to ensure
stability for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As 1999 progressed, that became increasingly difficult. The
economy steadily declined and civil unrest continued to grow.
Ecuador defaulted on some public debt and closed many major
national banks, and then Mahuad all but erased the sucre. It will
remain only in coins; U.S. dollars will be the de facto national
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Many looked to the military for a way out.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, military leaders took pains to assert their support
for the government and the democratic process, but their importance
within the political landscape continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the year, the military saw a country with no
national currency, a looming debt burden, widespread civil unrest,
a diminishing economy and political paralysis. They also faced a
contentious regionalist issue: an impending nonbinding vote for
autonomy in the coastal province of Guayas, which includes
Guayaquil.
</P>
<P>
   The old specter of regionalism threatened to overtake political
discourse.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, then, that Gen. Mendoza took action to
avert what he feared would be a ``social explosion.'' The
self-styled defender of peace, order and national unity, the
military thought it was compelled to act.
</P>
<P>
   The end result, however, is an inevitably weaker democracy than
before. Subject to the whims of the military and lacking in any
representational authority, the new president, Gustavo Noboa, is
hopelessly disabled. He's not even the member of a political party.
</P>
<P>
   Allies may applaud the continuation of democracy in Ecuador, but
it belies the broader point. Though it may be democracy in name, it
furnishes none of the things such a government should provide:
political freedoms, due process, an orderly transfer of power, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, if such overt manipulation continues, Ecuador
has little chance of ever developing such a government. With scant
political legitimacy, a shaky historical foundation, and the
specter of past military interference, Ecuador is a perfect example
of a puppet democracy _ manipulated and cajoled until things turn
out the right way.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. foreign policy standard of the new decade may be that.
No longer will we demand the ideological purity of anti-communism;
the new criterion is merely a patina of democracy.

<P>
   In an era when religious identity competes with race, sex and
ethnicity as a way in which Americans define themselves, it seems
discriminatory to forbid the expression of spiritual beliefs in the
public sphere. And far from threatening public life or liberty, the
revived cooperation between church and state may be a healthy
result of treating religion as just another aspect of self-identity
politics in a multicultural age.

   In an era when religious identity competes with race, sex and
ethnicity as a way in which Americans define themselves, it seems
discriminatory to forbid the expression of spiritual beliefs in the

revived cooperation between church and state may be a healthy
result of treating religion as just another aspect of self-identity
politics in a multicultural age.

TV PROGRAMMING FOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS MORE BALANCED THIS YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's one television program airing this month that I'd
recommend without reservation, it's ``Freedom Song,'' a startling,
exceptionally well-acted examination of what happens when the civil
rights movement parachutes into a sleepy little Southern town and
engulfs it.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by real-life events and airing Feb. 27 on the cable
network TNT, ``Freedom Song'' is remarkable for what it is and
isn't _ meaning, for a production shoehorned into the Black History
Month celebration, it isn't two hours of white-on-black
victimization or a production devoted explicitly to racist violence
and black rage.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the production is noteworthy for its straightforward,
even gentle, storytelling, a coming-of-age declaration told through
the eyes of a teen-ager who can't comprehend or accept the
nonviolent techniques of his elders, particularly when they seem to
stiffen in the face of white oppressive danger.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't surprised to hear that ``Freedom Song'' was first
conceived as a feature film; nor was it shocking to learn that
executive producer, actor and activist Danny Glover, was turned
away from every major studio leery of this story's odds of
attracting not only a white audience but a sizable black one.
Networks couldn't fathom such a project, either.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, even African-Americans, weary from watching
lynchings and the psychological torture of a race that was once
deemed subhuman, have for the most part stayed away from movies
centering on the civil rights movement and even more so from slave
period pieces. (Which helps explain the box office crash and burn
of Oprah Winfrey's ``Beloved''; well, that, and a convoluted story
line.)
</P>
<P>
   Part of the blame goes to the filmmakers. Let's face it:
Television, from the big networks to the tiny cable channels, is so
hungry for black history product during February it seems that
almost anything passes the black heritage litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings often go up anyway, driven by promotions and provocative
subject matter (the Sally Hemings-Thomas Jefferson
was-it-love-or-rape? project should do just fine), so it's a
win-win situation in attracting a few more viewers than usual and
earning brownie points from that picky NAACP. Unfortunately, in the
past, most of the stuff was bad.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that some of the best TV movies with
African-American themes have aired during months other than
February and on cable _ ``Miss Evers' Boys,'' ``Dorothy
Dandridge,'' ``A Lesson Before Dying,'' for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's cable's growth or the suggestion that racial
matters are being discussed openly again (the 1998 dragging death
of James Byrd in Jasper certainly got things going here), this is
one of the more balanced months of black history progamming in
years. And it got that way without much help from the major
networks, which are increasingly concentrating on more important
sweeps battles.
</P>
<P>
   Even CBS' ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal'' (the fact that
``scandal'' is used in the title suggests the kind of viewers CBS
wants to attract) as a four-hour miniseries exploring the origins
of the controversial 38-year relationship between Thomas Jefferson
(Sam Neill) and his slave is more a dramatic serial than historical
examination.
</P>
<P>
   Sally is played by a strikingly beautiful Carmen Ejogo (every
Sally I've seen so far has been enormously gorgeous, which points
to the creators' theories that Jefferson simply couldn't help
himself), who falls for the rich and influential statesman while
working as Jefferson's maid in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Sally Hemings'' shifts back to America, Sally, now a slave,
continues the affair, giving birth to Jefferson's children, which
threatens Jefferson's presidency and wealth. The miniseries airs at
8 p.m. CST Sunday, Feb. 13, and Wednesday, Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   On cable, I recommend ``The Color of Friendship,'' about a white
South African exchange student and her black American family. The
scenes are woefully telegraphed, but it manages to sidestep a
number of cliches to deliver a subtle lecture on prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1977, ``The Color of Friendship'' is based on the true
story of U.S. Rep. Ron V. Dellums and his family, who were shocked
when a white South African showed up on their doorstep. (Director
Kevin Hooks says this actually happened twice to the family; the
first girl adapted well. The second was more entrenched in the
apartheid system, so sparks flew.)
</P>
<P>
   There are other notable programs that are listed below. Does
this signal the television industry's willingness to deal with past
injustices candidly? We'll see. No matter how painful it is to
watch TLC's ``Civil Rights Martyrs: Free at Last,'' which is about
the personal stories of those who gave their lives for the civil
rights movement, it's these cinematic efforts that will ensure that
this American Holocaust is not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs this month (all times CST):
</P>
<P>
   ``Sidney Poitier: One Bright Light, An American Masters
Special'' (8 p.m. Wednesday, PBS) _ How amazing is it that Poitier
remains the only black American to receive a Best Actor or Best
Actress Oscar? His career is defined and documented here through
interviews with Quincy Jones, James Earl Jones and Denzel
Washington, the current best bet to match Poitier in Best Actor
honors. (Washington has a Best Supporting Actor Oscar and just won
a Golden Globe for Best Actor.) Most impressive about ``One Bright
Light'' is how it uses the modern history of blacks in American
film as a nice backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Color of Friendship'' (6:30 p.m. Feb. 5, Disney) _
Inspired by true events in the life of black congressman Dellums,
this is the touching story of a friendship between two teen-age
girls _ a white South African exchange student and the black
American girl whose family has taken her in for the summer. The
South African (Lindsay Haun) is a product of the apartheid system
and views blacks as second-class citizens. The Disney film, which
is set in 1977 and targets young viewers, is moving and effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color Me Dark'' (6:30 p.m. Feb. 7, HBO) _ Fictional story of
Nellie Lee Love, a young Southern girl who moves to Chicago to
learn that even in a place where black Americans can own
businesses, shops and restaurants, racism is just below the
surface. This is part of the terrific ``Dear America'' series of
Scholastic's bestselling book series. (MORE)

MANDOLIN PICKER, HAILED AS A MASTER, KEEPS HIS DAY JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va., Tenn.)  (mk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, W.Va. _ Johnny Staats slid open the door of his United
Parcel Service truck and crept cautiously through the snow toward
the door of a dilapidated red house, carefully inspecting the yard
for clues indicating the presence of a dog. ``These kind of calls
right here are where you have to watch out for Fido,'' he said,
hiding a package behind a shovel on the porch and jogging back to
the safety of his truck.
</P>
<P>
   For 11 years Staats has worked for UPS here. And few of his
co-workers can understand why. Not only has he proved in
competition after competition that he is the best mandolin picker
in the state and beyond, but this year he accomplished something
extremely rare for a bluegrass musician: He signed a record deal
with a major label, the Time Warner subsidiary Giant Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd sure hate to lose him as a driver,'' said Doug Adams,
Staats' supervisor at UPS. ``But I don't know why a man with those
talents continues working here. I guess it's the security.''
</P>
<P>
   Staats, 30, who has a wife and two children to support, is
emblematic of a changing attitude toward the music business, molded
in recent years by layoffs, consolidation and canceled contracts
with musicians. No longer is signing to a major label a means of
making it or a meal ticket for life. With the unpredictability of
the business and the difficulty of breaking even on any release
that sells less than half a million copies, signing to a major
label may not make one much richer than performing in the street.
</P>
<P>
   So for now Staats is keeping his day job, especially since he
became a full-time driver only recently, too late to take advantage
of the UPS employee stock plan that made a few of his managers into
millionaires overnight when the company went public last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place,'' he said.
``This job is real good money. And the music business is shaky. One
minute you're living on steak, the next minute you're living on
beans.'' (UPS drivers here earn about $1,500 a week.)
</P>
<P>
   Some like to say that Staats' music is bewitching: Everyone who
hears it falls under its spell. He is one of those rare musicians
who appears out of nowhere with his style honed from years of
nonstop practice but who has not been jaded by the music business.
</P>
<P>
   His playing is dazzlingly fast but always precise and never
showy. His voice is sweet and warm and lends itself to easy
harmonies. He has a classical-music ear for arranging pieces and
varying the theme; and he composes his own instrumentals,
programmatic pieces that tell stories of traveling and hunting.
</P>
<P>
   When Staats began visiting Nashville to try his luck in a
studio, word quickly spread that there was an uncommonly talented
unknown in town. Some of the most popular bluegrass and country
stars began stopping by to record with him, including Kathy Mattea,
Sara Evans, John Cowan, Tim O'Brien, Jon Randall, Jerry Douglas and
Sam Bush. Suddenly Staats' recording sessions became known as the
Johnny Staats Project.
</P>
<P>
   When his producers dropped off copies of the CD (a demo not even
released through any sort of record label) to Tower Records in
Nashville last year, it began selling as many as 21 copies a week,
placing it between Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys in the
store's sales ranking.
</P>
<P>
   That sales success was largely thanks to an employee at Tower,
Jen Gies, who said she fell in love with the CD the moment she
heard it. She played it constantly on the store's sound system,
prompting even customers unfamiliar with bluegrass to pick up a
copy. On her birthday the album's three producers _ as obsessed
with the project as she is _ sent her yellow roses.
</P>
<P>
   Such a warm tale may be uncommon in the music business, but this
kind of response seems to occur frequently around Staats. Others
who have been drawn in by his playing include Roger Hunt, an
eccentric millionaire from Charleston, W.Va., who not only helped
finance his music but also has volunteered to be his roadie; Scott
Hill, a local pet store owner who, during an epiphany while selling
his umpteenth can of flea powder, decided to quit the family
business and signed on as Staats' manager; Derek O'Brien, a potter
from Atlanta who volunteered to sell T-shirts; and John Van Meter,
Jon Ely and Ron Sowell, three country-music veterans with very
little production experience who decided to become his producers.
</P>
<P>
   It is very rare for an unknown bluegrass musician to attract any
type of entourage, let alone one as motley and dedicated, and more
willing than Staats to set aside their jobs. ``That's the magic of
Johnny, and I have no idea how to explain that,'' said Van Meter, a
Sony Music Publishing executive who works with many of Nashville's
top singers and songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, a former miner who made tens of millions by manufacturing
a newer, better roof bolt, said: ``I've never heard anybody like
him. He is as pure as the driven snow. I'd give him the shirt off
my back.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Staats, as sincere, hard-working and good-natured a
country boy as there ever was, he is dumbfounded by all this
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before all this, I really struggled to try and do something in
Nashville,'' he said as he motored down icy side streets on his UPS
route. ``I was at the point where I was just going to play contests
for the rest of my life and give up on my dream. I knocked on every
door. But when I wasn't looking for it anymore, that's when it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Staats is, by nature, a man whose energy level is always on
high. He delivers his packages the way he practices: quickly,
accurately and with a diligence bordering on obsession. On a
typical day he spends 10 to 11 hours delivering packages, often
picking his mandolin in the back of the truck during his lunch
break. Returning home, he practices for another hour or two before
dinner, sometimes unwinding with a little Mozart or Beethoven.
(``Them's what I call geniuses,'' he explained.) Then he takes his
dog to hunt raccoons for three to four hours. Every now and then he
gets a little sleep.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He was born into a musical family in West Virginia: His sister
played banjo, his mother was a pianist, and his father, a foreman
at a gravel company, played guitar. His uncle, a fiddler, took him
to bluegrass festivals as a child, but it was his father who first
urged him to take up the mandolin at age 7. Once he began learning
chords and songs, he was hooked: He'd fall asleep and let the
eight-track play until he woke up in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school the only thing I wanted to do was to play
music,'' he said. ``I'd practice seven to eight hours a day. I
wasn't interested in a football, basketball, nothing. I've played
so long before, I've seen blood come out from under my
fingernails.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation he began loading trucks for UPS, slowly working
himself up to the rank of driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked part time at first,'' he recalled. ``And the way I
made extra money was in music contests. I learned to play
everything I could find: mandolin, fiddle, guitar. At Vandalia, I
came in first on guitar, first in mandolin, and third in fiddle.
That was a good payday. I made $1,200 just in contest money.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at the Vandalia Gathering, West Virginia's annual
heritage festival, where the Johnny Staats Project was born. Ron
Sowell, the musical director for the National Public Radio show
``Mountain Stage,'' stood on the sidelines amazed by Staats'
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like seeing Mark O'Connor when he was 10 years old and
no one knew who he was,'' Sowell remembered, referring to the
virtuoso fiddler. ``I pride myself on knowing the West Virginia
scene, and I'd never heard of Johnny Staats before. It was like he
materialized.''
</P>
<P>
   Sowell booked Staats to play on ``Mountain Stage,'' his first
performance in an actual theater. ``Just to look up and see
everybody screaming and hollering was something else,'' Staats
said, recalling his standing ovation. ``I bet you they stood up and
clapped for a full five minutes. I mean, I'm just a guy used to
coon hunting and maybe playing a square dance on Saturday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Sowell is also a songwriter. He collaborates with another writer
in Nashville named Jon Ely, and the two of them work with Van Meter
at Sony Music. As Sowell played a tape of the ``Mountain Stage''
performance to his partners, they caught the fever as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one of Ron's visits, he said at the end of a meeting, `I
heard something the other day on ``Mountain Stage'' I thought you'd
like to hear,''' Van Meter remembered. ``And I was blown away. You
could hear the crowd responding to Johnny, and it was just
remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sowell brought Staats to Nashville, and Van Meter organized a
picking party at his house with bluegrass luminaries like John
Cowan, who was impressed enough to ask Staats to join his band.
Over the next two and a half years the two songwriters and their
publisher helped pay for Staats to visit Nashville and, in dribs
and drabs, record a demo album with some of the city's top singers
and pickers.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, independent labels like Sugar Hill and Rounder passed on
the record, but major labels were excited, even though Staats' job
prevented him from committing to long tours. With visions of Grammy
Awards dancing in her head, Debbie Zavitson at Giant Records signed
him to the label on the basis of the demo recordings alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even met Johnny,'' she said. ``He's never even set
foot in the offices. I don't know if I've ever heard of something
like that happening before in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Back here in Vienna, Staats continued on his route. By day's end
he had handled more than 200 packages, made more than 100 stops,
flirted with two receptionists and managed not to get bitten by one
dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know how I'd react if I ever made enough money as
a musician to leave this job, because I'm so used to going to
work,'' he said at dinner later that night, still wearing his UPS
cap. ``It would be a weird way of life, when you're not told to be
here or deliver this package.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    GORE ENDS N.H. CAMPAIGN FIGHTING ON THREE FRONTS
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore closed out his New
Hampshire primary campaign Monday fighting on three fronts _
promoting the administration's economic record, preparing to take
on the Republican candidates, and defending his own character
against attacks from Democratic rival Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   His message, delivered in 30-second TV spots throughout the day
and in person at a diner, an Italian restaurant and a senior
citizens center, sought to convince the state's Democrats that he,
not Bradley, is the candidate best prepared to ``fight'' the
Republicans this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a contest,'' he said as he shook hands outside a
Nashua electronics firm at dawn Monday. ``The real fight is for our
future,'' he added, alluding to the fall campaign against the
Republican Party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore strategists are hoping that a convincing win in New
Hampshire on Tuesday, coupled with the one-sided victory in Iowa
last week, will persuade Bradley to withdraw from the contest,
allowing the vice president to start concentrating on the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, with campaign coffers exceeding those of Gore, has
indicated he intends to continue his quest for the Democratic
nomination and the ``old politics'' that he says Gore represents.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the final full day of campaigning, Gore sought to
strike a positive note, in contrast to the harsh exchanges between
him and Bradley over the last three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to confine my campaign to the issues, as I have from
the beginning,'' Gore told a diner breakfast crowd, emphasizing the
issue of ``how we keep our prosperity going.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as he mingled with a lunchtime restaurant crowd in
Concord, he asserted that responsibility for the negative tone of
the campaign rests with Bradley. ``Personal attacks, no, I have not
engaged in them and I won't.''
</P>
<P>
   But gone from Gore's standard stump remarks was the often
repeated comment that Bradley is ``a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Although CNN's tracking polls showed him with a lead of six
percentage points among likely Democratic voters, Gore campaigned
as if he continued to trail Bradley in the Granite State, as he did
just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be campaigning full blast every minute of every
hour between now and (when the polls close Tuesday), leaving off a
few hours for sleep tonight,'' Gore said in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   With harsh weather conditions forcing his campaign aides to
improvise his schedule, Gore visited his campaign headquarters in
Manchester and joined the phone bank that is trying to reach
150,000 Democratic voters before the polls close at 8 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He ended the day with an open meeting with undecided voters in
Amherst.

AUSTRALIA HIGHLIGHTS ABORIGINAL TOURISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Feb. 6) 
(jt) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a half-century ago the Australian Unesco Committee for
Museums put together a traveling exhibition of the country's
Aboriginal culture, which toured the United States and Canada. The
accompanying catalog extolled the rich heritage of the Aborigines,
the indigenous people who came to Australia more than 30,000 years
ago, and it concluded with the hope that the exhibit would
``engender a curiosity about Aboriginal life.''
</P>
<P>
   That curiosity took a long time to awaken, but a growing recent
interest in other cultures is beginning to pay off for Australia's
Aborigines. The most recent figures from the Australian Tourist
Commission show that in 1997 the 200 tourism businesses operated by
Aborigines generated $20 million a year, while the sale of
indigenous arts and crafts brought in another $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   While small compared with overall tourist revenues in Australia,
about $10 billion, it is a start for a people who number only about
400,000, or just over 2 percent of Australia's population of almost
19 million. And it is all the more impressive in that most
Aboriginal villages, cultural centers and tour operations are far
from big cities and their amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Aboriginal tourism has stirred some resentment against
tourists _ particularly for what the Aboriginal people regard as
tourists' cultural insensitivity and their failure to respect mores
and traditions. Perhaps the best known example is that of the
visitors who climb Uluru (formerly Ayers Rock), even though they
are asked at the cultural center at the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National
Park not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   For related reasons, in 1998 the Queensland government issued a
code of conduct with suggestions such as these: That visitors learn
a few words of the Aboriginal language, and be aware that avoiding
eye contact is a sign of respect. But with many more visitors
expected this year for the Olympic Summer Games in Sydney, and with
almost 5 million projected in 2001 (compared with 4.2 million
visitors in 1998), the chance to satisfy that ``curiosity about
Aboriginal life'' is greater than ever _ and so is the likelihood
of offending Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore the Australian Tourist Commission is drawing up
another _ and presumably more detailed _ code of conduct for
visitors, to be issued within a few months. It will counsel them to
respect Aboriginal sacred sites, ceremonies and traditions. In the
United States, some Indian tribes have also adopted codes of
conduct for visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian government wants Aboriginal tourism to succeed
for several reasons. Some of them were detailed in a speech at the
National Press Club in Canberra three months ago by John Morse,
managing director of the tourist commission. Describing Aboriginal
tourism as a ``win, win, win'' situation, he said it can help
Aborigines achieve economic independence and help the wider
Australian population ``discover more of this rich and diverse
culture.'' And it can appeal to ``people in countries around the
world, over 80 percent of whom want to experience culture in some
form or another.'' And, of course, it adds to the national
treasury.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Morse mentioned two particularly successful
examples of Aboriginal tourism. The Aboriginal Cultural Park in
Cairns, created by the Tjapukai people, last year won the Gold
Award for Culture, given by the Pacific Asia Travel Association.
With five theaters, an art gallery, a museum and a cultural show,
the park _ in the city that is a tropical gateway to the Great
Barrier Reef _ is already a major tourist attraction. And there is
the Sydney Aboriginal Discovery Tour, whose Aboriginal owner,
Margaret Muragun Campbell, has arranged tours for some 10,000
visitors not only to the landmark Sydney Opera House and the city's
harbor, but also to the outback and Aboriginal communities.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other examples of successful Aboriginal tourism,
as well as a popular tourist site partly on Aborigine land _ Kakadu
National Park in the Northern Territory, 100 miles southeast of
Darwin. It is a trove of archaeological treasures that is on
Unesco's World Heritage list; its 8,000 square miles include
hundreds of plant and bird species and more than 5,000 rock-art
sites, most of them consisting of paintings but some with
engravings or designs in wax. Yet while Aborigines have lived in
Kakadu for at least 25,000 years, it is not technically an
Aboriginal park, since the native people leased their half of the
land within the park to the government about 20 years ago. In
return, they own concessions in the park and participate in its
planning, management and conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Other Aboriginal tourism operations include Native Guide Safari
Tours in Mossman, Queensland. Founded by Hazel Douglas, it operates
a variety of tours including visits to the Daintree rain forest, a
World Heritage site, and catamaran cruises off the beaches of
Cairns. Harry Nanya Tours in Wentworth, 60 miles from Sydney, also
specializes in tours conducted by Aboriginal guides. And in Alice
Springs, in the Red Center desert of central Australia, a Southern
Arrernte Aboriginal tribal group owns and operates the Aboriginal
Art and Cultural Center, which sells art, crafts, books, CD's,
tapes and didgeridoos, the haunting Aboriginal wooden wind
instruments. Its Web site, aboriginalart.com.au, sells these items,
too _ and if a didgeridoo strikes a browser's fancy, the site also
offers lessons in how to play it.

ENTERTAINING CHILDREN ON CRUISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Feb. 6)  
(jt) 
 By BETSY WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What does a child think is the most fun on a cruise? For Bill
Driscoll of Wilmington, N.C., who has sailed more than most third
graders, it is ``going where you can't usually go.'' Specifically,
he said, last month it was getting into the casino aboard
Carnival's Ecstasy, where a scavenger-hunt clue was taped to the
side of a slot machine.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, two of my granddaughters were of a similar mind
aboard the American Adventure: They enjoyed the in-line skating
program, but returned again and again to the whirlpool tubs, mainly
because health clubs on shore barred them.
</P>
<P>
   What was the down side? Bill said he was not big enough for the
Ecstasy's water slide. Always some rule.
</P>
<P>
   So, for kids on a cruise, a lot of fun comes from passing
through the normally adult world, under the aegis of an authorized
and supervised on-board recreation program.
</P>
<P>
   Most cruise lines now have activities tailored to children; some
provide baby-sitting. ``Cruise Vacations With Kids'' a fat book by
Candyce H. Stapen, published by Prima Publishing ($16), lists 18
lines as providing ``top family cruises.'' And the number is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   How extensive a line's program is, and how many counselors are
on board to lead the activities, particularly sports like
basketball, often depends on the season. At vacation times,
counselor corps swell, but travel agents should be pressed on which
ships post ``closed today'' signs on activity rooms in off periods.
Bill Driscoll, who is 10 and goes on a lot of cruises because his
father, Michael, writes a newsletter, Cruise Week, recalled that
once, water activities were limited to a kiddie pool and it was
``really crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents who crave a meal alone may find it possible often or
only on pizza party night, depending on the ship. Children's rates
also vary by line and season; third and fourth passengers in a
cabin can be cheap, but in the off season, an adjoining cabin may
be in the same range.
</P>
<P>
   Two lines go all out for children: Disney, with its new ships,
the Magic and the Wonder, and Premier, with its Big Red Boats. Two
Premier vessels, the Oceanic and the Rembrandt, are being renamed
Big Red Boat I and Big Red Boat IV, and two more are in conversion.
Here is information on these lines' children's programs, and those
at Carnival, the biggest line, and at Princess, whose Love Boat
Kids program is popular.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Big Red Boats
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Bruce Nierenberg, who now heads Premier
Cruise Lines, created American Family Cruises, which operated the
ship my granddaughters enjoyed. American Family lasted less than a
year, but Nierenberg has transferred a number of his concepts to
the Cruisin' Kids program at Premier.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if skating would be offered aboard, Nierenberg said that
the jogging track was available but that the space was a little
tight. ``Kids can bring their in-line skates and be able to use
them on shore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet cafes and television production rooms will be provided,
as well as a separate children's pool, but most sports activities
will be planned for shore excursions.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Red Boats, children 2 to 17 are divided into five age
groups for activities: 2 to 4 (they must be toilet-trained); 5 to
7; 8 to 10, 11 to 13 and 14 and over. On busy cruises, group
baby-sitting in the evening costs $5 an hour, and $3 for each
family's additional child.
</P>
<P>
   Cruises average 500 children, less than half the capacity.
Thirty-two counselors are aboard, Nierenberg said, but the younger
children get a higher ratio of adults.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Disney Cruise Line &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Disney does diapers,'' said Kiersten Murnane, a
spokeswoman for the company's cruise line. Babies 12 weeks to 3
years are watched over in the Flounder's Reef Nursery for $6 an
hour, and $5 for a second child. This service is provided 2 to 4
p.m. and 7 p.m. to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Older children are split into four groups, with the 3- to
5-year-olds getting one counselor to each 15 children and the 6 to
8's and the 9 to 12's getting one to every 25. The teen-agers have
a coffee bar with tabletop games, computers, music and Disney
professionals teaching improv skills. Basketball, shuffleboard and
team contests are organized, but not pool activities. There are
lifeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Younger groups make costumes and milk shakes, search for lost
treasures and participate in quiz shows. Ashore at Disney's island
in the Bahamas, treasures or ``fossils'' are dug up and pizza is
prepared in an oven made by the children.
</P>
<P>
   One sure draw: ``Discover the Magic: Your children are featured
stage performers in this Walt Disney Theater presentation.'' Only a
parent who has experienced 17 dance recitals in five years could
resist that.
</P>
<P>
   Disney takes 50 counselors on each vessel, and also gets an
average of 500 children a sailing, about a quarter of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Carnival Cruises  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Carnival expects 250,000 children on its dozen ships this year.
Carnival's activity groups are for 2- to-5-year-olds,
toilet-training not required, then those 6 to 8, 9 to 12 and 13 to
15. Activities for older teen-agers are also available.
Sing-alongs, puppet shows, pizza parties and face-painting are
offered for the younger children, Ping-Pong, video games,
computers, scavenger hunts and backstage tours for the older ones.
</P>
<P>
   An average of 10 counselors are aboard. Baby-sitting for
children under 2 is provided in the evening and, on days in port,
in the morning. The cost is $5 an hour, $3 each for additional
children. Carnival ships have three pools each and a water slide.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Princess Cruises &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Princess has no youth or teen centers aboard the Royal or
Pacific Princesses, but when at least 15 children ages 2 to 17 are
aboard, kids' programs are offered. In port, all the ships offer
group baby-sitting or supervised activities in daytime for $4 an
hour each child. Princess does not do diapers.
</P>
<P>
   On ships with children's centers, those 2 to 12 are in the
Pelicans group, and those 12 to 17 join the Princess Teen Club. The
Pelicans work at arts and crafts, go on scavenger hunts, hold
parties, tour the bridge and galley, and watch videos and
Nickelodeon programs. The teen-agers have a disco, engage in
shipboard Olympics, murder-mystery games, karaoke and lip-synching,
and have a movie fest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Costly Soft Drinks &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The cruise lines have heard an outcry from parents about the
cost of the sodas that fuel the young. Whether the wine flowed free
or not, the final bill on a cruise often sagged with pricey Cokes
and Pepsis. The lines are now responding.
</P>
<P>
   Premier provides free sodas in a glass to anyone under 17 at the
soda fountain; if it must be a can, the charge is $1.75. Disney has
a new package for children 12 and under: unlimited sodas for $12
for three days or $16 for four days. Sodas at meals are free for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival has unlimited soft drinks for anyone under 21, for $8
for three days and $18 for seven days. Princess, for now, is
sticking with $1.50 a can.

ORCHESTRA FALLS SILENT AS SOUTH AFRICA STRUGGLES ON 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ South Africa's National Symphony
Orchestra is silent, maybe for a few weeks, maybe for a few years,
maybe forever.
</P>
<P>
   The 76-year-old symphony orchestra was still searching for money
and for its place in the national landscape when funds ran out last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Since losing its annual support from the national broadcasting
company a few years ago, the orchestra had been living pretty much
month to month, check to check, dependent on the continued
beneficence of big corporations to meet its $2.4 million annual
budget.
</P>
<P>
   So when the orchestra took the stage recently, only moments
after each of the musicians had been handed a ``retrenchment''
letter, it was to say goodbye. There was no charge for the patrons
and there was no pay for the performers. There was no conductor, no
soloist, not even air conditioning. Some of the audience came in
jeans, and many of the performers played in their shirt-sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   It was to be about making music and nothing else. It was Bach's
Air soothing the sore hearts that filled Linder Auditorium that
night. It was the intermezzo of Mascagni's ``Cavalliera Rusticana''
tugging at those same hearts. Many were close to tears.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people, almost all of them white, watched an
orchestra, itself almost entirely white, in a country whose black
majority was effectively excluded from such cultural indulgences
until a decade ago and whose own artistic avocations were until
even more recently largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   So the final concert was a small window into how change is
reaching into every corner of this society. If classical music is
to make it in the new South Africa, it will have to find a way to
survive alongside a multitude of musical forms, all competing for
scarce resources in a country rich in artistic talent but too poor
to nurture it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the government's priorities,'' said Donald Ezard,
the general manager of the orchestra. ``They are trying to bring
water and electricity into people's home and trying to feed people
and make life more livable. But we've got to feed the soul of the
people, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra's members understand that need, which is why they
returned for a last encore. ``For me, as a music lover, this is an
essential part of my life,'' Maeve Jacobs, a season subscriber for
25 years, said. ``Musicians are precious people. It's a gift that
they give us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a gift that people like Mrs. Jacobs and her husband, Gil,
who has been going to the orchestra since 1954, when he was 10, are
not prepared to give up. ``As a South African in a new South
Africa, if you want something you have to fight,'' Jacobs said.
``And if they take away our culture from us, we are destroyed, so
we have to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the evening seemed to redouble the resolve of many
present to save the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let this go,'' Robin Finlay, the principal trumpeter
and an 11-year veteran of the orchestra, said moments after walking
off the stage for what he hopes will not be the last time. ``It's
too good to let go.''
</P>
<P>
   The country's minister of arts, culture, science and technology,
Dr. Ben Ngubane, is the man who has to make sure that none of those
souls starve, that all of them are fed at least a morsel or two.
And contrary to what some critics might argue, Ngubane said that
he, too, wanted to see classical music thrive in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed and so must the orchestras.
``Essentially, they must undergo very far-reaching transformation,
which they haven't done by and large,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   For most of their lives, the country's principal orchestras,
based in Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town and until last week
Johannesburg, depended on the government for most of their money.
</P>
<P>
   The National Symphony received the bulk of its budget from the
state-supported South African Broadcasting Corp. For the other
orchestras, opera houses and ballet theaters, there were the
Performing Arts Councils, which controlled nearly 70 percent of the
country's arts budget and existed essentially to support the
artistic interests of the white minority.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of apartheid and the establishment of majority
rule, such largess soon became untenable. Long neglected, the
artistic interests of the black majority finally would be
supported. With little additional money available, however, this
has meant radically reducing the allocations for historically white
cultural interests, which means that today those Performing Arts
Councils control just under a third of the country's total arts
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The change, Ngubane told Parliament last year in his budget
speech, has allowed projects unthinkable not long ago to at least
have a chance today, projects like the Soweto Community Dance
project, the Hennie Joubert Piano Competition and the Madimba
Institute of African Culture and Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country's many cultures and forms of artistic expression
are, at last, given equal opportunity,'' Ngubane said in his
speech.
</P>
<P>
   For the orchestras this has meant looking down new avenues for
money and turning away from their long-held expectations of
significant government support, expectations that did little to
prepare them for the pressures they have encountered. ``There was a
laissez-faire attitude among administrators,'' Kenneth Marcus,
chairman of the Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra, said. ``You
didn't have to be innovative.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two long-established orchestras that merged a few
years ago to become the Cape Town Philharmonic drew as much as half
of their funds just from the local city council, Marcus said. Today
the Philharmonic receives modest subsidies from the national and
provincial governments but is otherwise dependent on its own fund
raising, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, expanding the audience is necessary to save the
orchestra, and the only way do that is to bring blacks into the
fold, in particular children, who are just starting to develop
their tastes and interests. That process is under way, with
orchestra programs venturing into the townships for concerts and
workshops.

</P>
<P>
   Ezard, a Briton who joined the National Symphony as general
manager just last August, said that he understood Ngubane's
intentions and his limitations. ``He is obviously concerned, but he
doesn't have a shed full of money,'' Ezard said. ``What I think he
wants is for us to come up with some sensible, proactive
suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the nation's orchestras have been meeting to try
to plot their collective future. Their efforts promise hard,
sometimes painful decisions that are likely to worsen some of the
tensions that have already been voiced by those who say the
government now cares only about the art and culture of the black
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always this fear that any nation that is majority
black is going to renege on Western culture, and that's not true,''
Ngubane said. ``In this country we are very keen on it. We are
supporting it.''
</P>
<P>
   But orchestra supporters worry that if the National Symphony is
allowed to die, its efforts to reach the blacks will die with it.
Certainly, to look around Linder Auditorium, the results of the
orchestra's efforts have been modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've come a long way, and I don't want to see it
end,'' said Susan Harrop-Allin, who runs the orchestra's outreach
efforts. ``We're building something, and if we stop, we'll be going
backward, and I don't want to see that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If it does, she said, it will be young people like Alex
Hitzeroth who suffer. An 18-year-old trombonist from Port
Elizabeth, he is one of the orchestra's two black musicians.
Devoted to his trombone since he was 10 years old, Hitzeroth joined
the orchestra last month on the very day word arrived that the
money had run out, that the season would be canceled and that the
orchestra was closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you wonder why you did all that practicing, what was
it all for,'' Hitzeroth said in between warm-ups in the dressing
room backstage. ``It will make young people across the country
wonder: If there's nothing to aspire to, is it worth all the
practicing?
</P>
<P>
   Eager as he is to see more black faces onstage, Hitzeroth is not
one to criticize the orchestra's efforts. It has been trying, he
said, to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a process to get people into the orchestra, and I think
the orchestra is doing quite well,'' he said. ``It's not like you
can throw 10 million rand into development and you'll have 10 black
guys in the orchestra. It takes time. I think they are doing well.
It may not look that way, but they are.''

JAPAN SECT TO BE KEPT UNDER SURVEILLANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A public commission ruled Monday that Aum Shinrikyo, the
religious group that killed 12 people in a nerve-gas attack on the
Tokyo subway in 1995, continues to pose a threat to society. It
instructed security authorities to put the sect under surveillance
for up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Security Examination Commission, which is technically
an independent panel but is heavily influenced by the government,
invoked a law enacted last year that will allow the police and
Justice Ministry officials to enter the sect's property for
inspections without a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Under the surveillance law _ specifically directed at the group,
which recently changed its name to Aleph from Aum Shinrikyo _ the
sect must report the names of its members, and details of its
assets and activities, to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Tuesday, when the commission's decision will be
published in a government gazette, the group's every move will be
monitored by the authorities, a security official said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates and civil libertarians denounced the
decision as a violation of the group's basic rights and warned that
the action could have broad implications for democracy in Japan.

A TWO-BEATLE REUNION, BUT IT'S JUST IMAGINATION
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 1976, six years after the breakup of the Beatles and four
years before the death of John Lennon. Paul McCartney, whose band,
Wings, has the No. 1 record in both the United States and Britain,
has come to New York for some concerts. He decides to drop in on
John unannounced. They get together and talk. And talk. And talk.
They sing briefly. And talk. They take a walk. They stop for
coffee. And ... you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   This imaginary encounter between these two indelibly familiar
figures is portrayed in ``Two of Us,'' a film that VH1 is unveiling
on Tuesday night. Although it drips with sincerity, the exercise
falters as both iconography and drama. If you carry cherished
images of these men, as Beatles and beyond, you may well be
uncomfortable with the imitations before you.
</P>
<P>
   The two featured actors, Aidan Quinn as Paul and Jared Harris as
John, have a virtually impossible assignment here. On screen, just
the two of them, for nearly the whole film, they do manage to
connect emotionally with each other and with the viewer. Onstage,
where conventions of acting and expectations of verisimilitude are
different, this encounter might have worked better. But here, in a
medium that depends on the seamless illusion of reality and that
relies heavily on the close-up, the trick doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is too beefy to play the wiry John, and his snarling
portrayal smears the character's pain all over his surface. This
doesn't jibe with the memory of a man whose essence seemed securely
locked away, even, one suspected, from himself.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn looks more like the Paul of that time, but neither actor
has the body movements or vocal cadences that you recall from
interviews, feature films and recordings. Perhaps a different
script could have helped, but Mark Stanfield has written his
characters too many cryptic exchanges that begin to sound like
deadpan Monty Python routines as rewritten by Harold Pinter. Take
this encounter at John's apartment door:
</P>
<P>
   PAUL: Hi, John.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN: The Ghost of Christmas Past.
</P>
<P>
   PAUL: You gonna let me in?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN: Aren't you one of them?
</P>
<P>
   PAUL: Well, I used to be. Now I'm one of me.
</P>
<P>
   Once the talking gets going in earnest, you learn that John
isn't performing or writing and that he's a bit contemptuous of
Paul's continuing drive to please the public. But John quickly
confesses that he's still carrying around a bellyful of childhood
fears. Paul says, ``That's heavy, John.''
</P>
<P>
   So is this film, leavened only by a brief sequence in which the
men don false mustaches, both looking like a cross between Ringo
and Groucho, for a walk in Central Park. Later, as tears glisten in
their eyes, Paul tells John that he mustn't be a slave to those
fears, that the world isn't really such a dangerous place. Under
Michael Lindsay-Hogg's direction, this uplifting scene works
dramatically until you remember that Lennon was gunned down right
in front of his apartment house. Pretty dangerous, that.
</P>
<P>
   The film keeps playing with the notion of a Beatles reunion
performance, which never took place. The four Beatles did get
together in 1979, not to make music but to discuss legal strategy.
They were determined to block a film version of ``Beatlemania,''
the stage show in which they were all impersonated. When the
current film was proposed, once again someone should have spoken
words of wisdom: Let it be.

 &HT;    Indepentents to have last say
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Independents comprise about 37 percent of
this state's voters, but as a component of New Hampshire primary
lore, they play an even larger role.
</P>
<P>
   They evoke the image of crusty old sixth-generation New
Englanders, certain to vote in any weather and unswayed by party
label or the tide of national opinion. The reality, it turns out,
is somewhat different.
</P>
<P>
   Some independents tend to be older, have lived in the state more
than 20 years, are fairly politically sophisticated and make up
their minds late about which primary to vote in, depending on where
the action is, said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New
Hampshire Survey Center.
</P>
<P>
   But a slightly larger number are voters who have lived in the
state less than five years and don't fit the stereotype of the New
Hampshire independent at all.
</P>
<P>
   Their numbers have increased as the state's economy has bounced
back. New Hampshire was losing population at the beginning of the
`90s, but is rapidly gaining today, drawing new residents primarily
from neighboring New England states as the high-tech corridor grows
northward from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Often on talk radio, you hear New Hampshire Republicans
disparage them as Massachusetts liberals. And it's true these
voters helped elect the state's Democratic governor, Jeanne
Shaheen. But the newcomers who register as independents don't fit
neatly under either party's banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically they're younger people who don't have much interest
in politics. They just don't vote,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   It's somewhat misleading, he said, to describe these voters as
independents, since more than two-thirds lean pretty consistently
toward one party or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be more accurate to describe them as undeclared
voters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat more people register as independents here than in other
states, but that's in part because they have an extra incentive
here. The state allows nonaligned voters to pick up either party's
ballot on primary day, which is not true of those who register as
either Democrats or Republicans. So by registering as independents,
voters get to keep their options open.
</P>
<P>
   All this has important implications for Republican John McCain
and Democrat Bill Bradley, both of whom have fashioned campaigns
based on their appeal to independent-minded voters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leaners, McCain has the definite advantage. About 40
percent of New Hampshire's independents generally pick up
Republican ballots, compared to about 30 percent who tend to vote
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   What about those who could go to either McCain or Bradley, or
for that matter, to Vice President Al Gore or Gov. George W. Bush?
When you boil down the numbers, that turns out to be a group which
may not number many more than 10,000 voters, according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   How many of these truly independent voters actually show up at
the polls could depend a lot on the weather, which was precarious
Monday as the latest winter storm moved toward the state.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, with both the Democratic and Republican primaries
tightening in the closing days before the vote, this small group
could spell the difference for either McCain or Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   And for a few more hours Tuesday, they will be the most
intensely fought-over voters in America.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: McCain still leading in N.H.
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)

<P>
   SUPER BOWL OVER _ NOW FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidates are doing some last-minute
campaigning in New Hampshire, which holds its primary Tuesday,
Cox's Tom Baxter reports. The voting actually begins at midnight,
when little Dixville Notch weighs in. John McCain says he is
``confident of victory,'' over George W. Bush. Bill Bradley asked
voters to support him as ``something that is new and fresh.'' Al
Gore got up before dawn to visit a defense plant in the freezing
rain and said, ``The real fight is for our future.'' Most polls
show McCain with a slight lead or tied with Bush, and Gore with a
slight edge over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST THE PANCAKE, THEN FLIP YOURSELF
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer was flipping pancakes at a campaign event in
Manchester, N.H., today when he fell off the 3-foot riser. He's OK,
though. It happened as he stepped back to try to catch one of the
flapjacks. Bauer disappeared off the back of the stage, but popped
right back up _ beet red _ with the pancake in the pan. ``I'm a
fighter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH COFFERS BURSTING ...
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush reported today that he raised $11 million during
the last three months of 1999, bringing his total to a record $68.7
million. Bush had $31.4 million in the bank as of Dec. 31,
according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission.
That's four times the estimated $7.7 million of John McCain, who
had around $1.5 million and expected an additional $6.2 million in
federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   ... AND BRADLEY PICKING UP THE PACE
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Al Gore reported raising $28.2 million, plus
$2.9 million to pay legal and accounting costs in the general
election. Bill Bradley reported raising more than $27 million, but
twice as much money as Gore during the last quarter 1999: $8
million to $4 million. Bradley had $8.3 million in the bank at the
end of the year, and expected $11.4 million in federal funds.
Gore's bank account balance stood at $5.7 million, plus an expected
$12.4 million in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A DRUG HABIT
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer has complained that he needs $25,000 a day to keep
campaigning, and that unless he does well in New Hampshire he will
be running out of money.
</P>
<P>
   THE EFFECTS OF MOBILITY
</P>
<P>
   Independents comprise about 37 percent of New Hampshire's
electorate, and an even larger share of its political lore. But are
they really the persnickity old New Englanders of political
stereotype, who vote regularly and steer their own course? On
closer inspection, Cox's Tom Baxter reports, it turns out the
majority of New Hampshire's independents are younger people who
moved there recently and don't care much about politics. The
independents of legend do exist, but the overall state electorate
may not be so unique.
</P>
<P>
   THE HEART OF THE MATTER
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley said he might put his vice president in charge of
running the country if treatment for his non-life-threatening heart
condition forced him under anesthesia. ``I think that that's
probably appropriate,'' Bradley told ABC yesterday. ``I'll make the
decision at the time ... if I decided to'' undergo a course of
treatment that incapacitated him. Bradley, 56, acknowledged that
treatment for his irregular heartbeat has required him to be
unconscious three times since 1996. Said Bradley adviser Anita
Dunn, ``We've got a healthy candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   WOOING FEMALES WITH INTENSITY
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley has not been able to overcome a gender gap that has
plagued his campaign from the start. And polls conducted in the
past week show Bradley trailing Al Gore by as much as 21 percent
among women in New Hampshire. So Bradley's accusations that Gore
has flip-flopped on abortion may reflect not only his passion
concerning a volatile issue, but the harsh reality of weak support
among women, the Democratic Party's largest group of voters.
</P>
<P>
   `DROPPING OUT' NOT IN THE VOCABULARY
</P>
<P>
   As if to ward off any more negative chatter about Bill Bradley's
future if he loses New Hampshire, his staff sent out his
post-primary schedule days early and the words ``dropping out'' did
not appear. Instead, his camp announced a wild swing across the
country and back, including stops in Hartford, Conn.; New York
City; San Francisco; College Park, Md.; and Tampa. With plenty of
money in the bank, Bradley's aides say he will stay in the race,
regardless of whether the news from New Hampshire matches that in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUL OF CONSERVATISM
</P>
<P>
   David Schippers, the Republican lawyer and ex-Democrat who
authored that devastating narrative for the House Judiciary
Committee during President Clinton's impeachment hearings, has
endorsed Alan Keyes for president. Some polls show Keyes gaining on
Steve Forbes in a race as to which Republican will be the
conservative alternative to the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ENOUGH, ALREADY!
</P>
<P>
   James Siglio of Manchester, N.H., is a prime target for
presidential campaigns looking for young workers. Siglio, 18, a
senior at Manchester Central High School, was a volunteer for the
local political group Democracy in Practice last fall. Since then
he's been a marked man, and now wishes they'd stop calling. ``These
people call every day,'' said Siglio, 18. ``I'm sick of the
election and it's only January.''
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF JOHN Q.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush knows his family name is a political asset and it
gives him a chance to make his case. But he says he stands where he
does, as national Republican front-runner, on the basis of his
record, his programs and his proposals. The only son ever elected
president after his father held the office was John Quincy Adams,
in 1824. John Adams was elected in 1796. Each served one term.
</P>
<P>
   HOPING SOME OF THAT OLD MAGIC RUBS OFF
</P>
<P>
   He's got Alzheimer's now and can't speak for himself, but he's
in John McCain's campaign ad, Gary Bauer's campaign literature and
George W. Bush's campaign rhetoric. And he's in Steve Forbes'
campaign book and Alan Keyes' campaign Web site. ``Ronald Reagan is
the most popular president certainly in our lifetime, and everybody
wants to campaign as the heir to the Reagan legacy. It's smart,''
says Steve Duprey, the New Hampshire GOP chairman.
</P>
<P>
   THEY REALLY WANT TO BE WHERE THE REDSKINS ARE
</P>
<P>
   To Al Gore, they are the Tennessee Titans, but George W. Bush
insisted on thinking of them still as as the Houston Oilers. ``If
he's rooting for the Houston Oilers, that is typical of living in
the past,'' said Gore with a chuckle, sporting a Titan cap at his
Super Bowl party at a Nashua, N.H., eatery. John McCain and Alan
Keyes bowed to tradition and attended a couple of Super Bowl
parties, but admitted they weren't paying much attention to the
game. Gary Bauer, originally from Kentucky, tilted toward
neighboring Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   CHOICE MEANS NOT HAVING TO TALK ABOUT IT
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, whose big campaign issue is opposition to abortion,
encountered a few college students sporting ``Choice'' buttons the
other day. Initially, Bauer finessed the moment, telling them,
``I'd rather have people with `choice' buttons on'' than young
folks uninvolved in politics. ``At least we can have a
discussion.'' One student tried to take him up on it. ``My question
is ...'' he began. ``I'm sorry,'' Bauer said, cutting off the
question and walking away. ``We're late.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOK, KID, THIS IS REAL LIFE
</P>
<P>
   John McCain gave 11-year-old Jonathan Hutchings a lesson in
bluntness during a town hall meeting in Hampton, N.H. Little
Jonathan gathered up his courage, stood directly in front of the
candidate and asked him: ``Will you take some of the large military
money and put it into school education for children like me?''
After a pause, McCain replied, ``No. We should take care of
education separate from our obligations to the military and
national security.''
</P>
<P>
   NEXT TIME, TRY PICKING UP HIS CHECK
</P>
<P>
   Some New Hampshire eateries thrive on the politics. At the busy
Puritan Backroom in Manchester, for instance, the sign outside
boasts, ``The candidates say this is the primary place to eat.''
But when George W. Bush burst into the Golden Egg diner in
Portsmouth with his sunny side up, the fellow at the end of the
counter just wanted to be left alone with his coffee, his food and
his newspaper. ``I came here to eat breakfast,'' the customer
grumbled, ``not to shake hands.''
</P>
<P>
   SICK JOKE ACTED OUT
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer says he's saddened by an article that details the
first-person, undercover exploits of an openly gay columnist who
secretly joined his Iowa campaign to give him a contagious virus.
In the online magazine Salon, sex columnist Dan Savage chronicled
how he tried to give Bauer his flu bug by licking objects Bauer
would come in contact with, such as door knobs. ``I'm not
particularly feeling anger,'' Bauer said. ``I just feel kinda sad
for the guy that he's so consumed with hate that he would not only
do something like this, but actually brag about it.'' Savage said
he was trying to get back at Bauer for opposing gay marriage.

 &HT;    Tobacco farmers try to keep livelilhood from going up in smoke
 &HT;    By Gene Metrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Uncertainty about the future is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   But for North Carolina tobacco farmers, uncertainty has been the
only constant, as they have watched the tobacco industry come under
repeated assault from a series of lawsuits, tax increases and
public health campaigns that have combined to produce a seeming
all-out war against the one commodity they have generally been able
to rely upon to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Cuts in the federal tobacco quota have decreased the amount of
leaf they are allowed to grow by nearly half during the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers have floated the idea of abandoning the
warehouse auction marketing system for direct production
contracting with individual farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for an end to the price supports maintained under the
federal tobacco quota system rattle the already-besieged producers,
threatening to remove forever the income that has kept most Tarheel
family farms alive while their counterparts in the Midwest have
tumbled into bankruptcy and have been replaced by large corporate
farming operations.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing competition from tobacco grown overseas has
contributed to a plunge in U.S. leaf exports while U.S. cigarette
manufacturers have steadily increased their imports of the cheaper
foreign leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Can the end of American tobacco farming as we know it be close
at hand?
</P>
<P>
   Strategies for reversing the bleak outlook facing American
tobacco farmers are numerous - it all depends on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to the long-term survival of domestic tobacco
production is to become more competitive on the world market,''
said Jim Starkey, a senior vice president with the Richmond-based
Universal Leaf Tobacco Co., an independent dealer, processor and
exporter of tobacco. ``And if we're going to increase exports,
we're going to have to make some changes in the (federal tobacco
quota) program.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasing exports is probably the suggestion most often raised
as a vehicle for rescuing domestic leaf production. Exports account
for the sale of nearly half of all flue-cured tobacco produced in
the United States. But although the global demand for tobacco
remains strong, most overseas markets have yet to recover from the
economic downturn caused by the financial crises in Asia and Latin
America during the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economies in our primary buying markets are going to have
to improve so they can buy our tobacco in the volumes that they
used to,'' said Tommy Bunn, executive vice president of the
Raleigh-based Leaf Tobacco Exporters Association. ``It has been
lean over the short term, and we're in a situation right now where
we're smaller - and the question is whether we'll continue to
shrink or get back to positive growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake Brown, a professor of agricultural economics at N.C. State
University, said declining leaf exports have played a big part in
the problems being felt by Tarheel leaf growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The global supply will probably change some and,
unfortunately, cigarette and leaf exports will probably not recover
_ certainly not to their previous levels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   International buyers have long been willing to pay higher prices
for the superior quality of American-grown leaf. But there are
limits to not only how much foreign manufacturers are willing to
pay, but how much of the higher-grade tobacco they need to
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can demand a higher price because of the higher quality,
but not all manufacturers require the higher quality leaf,'' Bunn
said. ``There is a trade-off - people are willing to pay more for
higher quality, but the question is how much and in what
quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowering the price of American leaf to increase its
competitiveness on the world market would mean tinkering with the
federal quota system. Such a strategy would be likely to ignite a
political firestorm. But it also would place the very farmers
supposedly helped by increased exports into a dangerous Catch-22 of
having to accept lower prices in order to grow more leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy makers have a very difficult time when they look at
adjusting the program,'' Brown said. ``Changes are very difficult
to negotiate because some people are going to be winners and some
are going to be losers.''
</P>
<P>
   Starkey said the federal tobacco program has been considered
nearly sacrosanct for as long as he has been in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for the leader of a tobacco institution to
stand up in front of his constituents and say, 'Here's what we've
got to do to survive, and some of you are going to go out of
business,''' he said. ``But the whole industry is going down the
tubes.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal Leaf already has been forced to close two of its
extruder operations as well as its processing plant in Smithfield,
Starkey said. The company's flood-damaged Rocky Mount warehouse
facility remains closed, and Starkey said its future has yet to be
decided by company officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the crop continues to decline, we'll have to size our
operations to match what's there,'' he said. ``And that will
probably mean more plant closings.''
</P>
<P>
   William Upchurch, who heads the tobacco affairs office at the
N.C. Department of Agriculture, said simply ending the tobacco
program and leaving farmers to the mercy of the free market is sure
to hurt many more farm families than it could possibly help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there's not going to be as many people growing
tobacco in North Carolina as there has been in the past,'' he said.
``But as long as the tobacco program continues, it's up to everyone
in the industry to be constantly looking at adjusting it to make it
work better for farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal tobacco quota is determined by the U.S. Agriculture
Department by totaling the announced buying intentions of the
country's cigarette manufacturers for the upcoming year, the
three-year average of leaf exports and the amount of surplus leaf
held in reserve by the grower-owned Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative
Stabilization Corporation, which acts as a buyer of last resort for
leaf receiving auction bids below the price support level.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-1st District, said that ending the
federal tobacco price support system would spell the end for
Tarheel family farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to protect the program - we would have had a total
price collapse in tobacco without it,'' he said. ``Lord knows, the
farmers have had several tough years with all of their commodities
- and tobacco is still the only thing that's keeping them going.''
</P>
<P>
   And supporters of the tobacco program have recently received new
allies in any potential fight to dismantle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole political scenario has changed in the last few
years,'' Brown said. ``Health advocates have decided that they like
the program because it restricts the supply and keeps prices higher
for the cigarette manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge said he believes increasing exports and working
through the mechanisms of the tobacco program to increase quota
levels is the best way to help U.S. growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must continue to work to reduce the stocks in stabilization
and encourage the (cigarette) companies to buy more domestic
tobacco,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge, a Harnett County tobacco farmer and member of the
House Agriculture Committee, was part of a recent congressional
delegation that traveled to China to meet with trade officials in
that country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the keys is expanding trade opportunities,
especially in emerging markets such as China,'' he said. ``Opening
Chinese markets alone could increase exports by 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese market is closed to U.S. tobacco, ostensibly because
Chinese government officials say they fear the introduction of the
blue mold tobacco disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a non-tariff trade barrier that uses faulty science - but
it's been successful in keeping out U.S. tobacco,'' Bunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Bunn said the United States could use the Chinese government's
desire for admittance into the World Trade Organization as leverage
to get it to drop its blue mold trade barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do become a part of the WTO, China will have to comply
with the accepted scientific evidence that blue mold poses no
threat,'' he said. ``It would be a real opportunity for us if we
had access to their market - there are more people who smoke in
China than there are people in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Starkey agreed that entrance into the Chinese market presents
the possibility for increased exports, but warns that such access
will not automatically translate into increased sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the price levels go down, there is the potential for a big
market there,'' he said. ``But if the current situation continues,
I can't imagine that we'll move great quantities of tobacco to
China.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount of tobacco a farmer can grow under the quota system
is known as an allotment, which is a growing right that was once
tied to the land but is now owned by individual growers and
non-growers. Each season, non-farming allotment holders rent their
allotment rights to growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To save the program, we've got to eliminate the rental
system,'' said R.J. Raynor, owner of Raynor's Warehouse in Rocky
Mount. ``In my opinion, the quota needs to be in the hands of the
producers - I would like to see the allotment holders bought out
and the quota placed in the hands of the growers.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a proposal, Raynor said, would be difficult to accomplish
fairly because many non-farming allotment holders are retirees or
farm widows who depend on the rental income. But such a move would
reduce the cost of production for growers, possibly enabling some
price reductions to make U.S. leaf more competitive in the
international marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers are having to pay higher and higher rent on the
allotments, and until that changes, it will be hard for us to
compete,'' Raynor said. ``We can't sell for what Brazil does
because their labor and production costs are so much lower than
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Another proposed change in the quota system to help lower
growers' costs is to allow allotment rentals to be conducted across
county lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quota cuts are causing allotment rents to go up,'' Upchurch
said. ``So if you could rent allotments from a county that doesn't
grow much tobacco into one that does, it could help to lower the
(allotment) costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Raynor said such a change could help growers in some counties
but hurt those in others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could concentrate tobacco in certain areas, sending the
quota to fewer counties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties of the past several years and the
uncertainty ahead, Raynor remains optimistic that the fortunes of
the tobacco industry could be poised to change for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that everything comes in cycles, and I think the
tobacco industry is in a stage where we could be bottoming out,''
he said. ``We could see increases in the quota coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown shared that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current quota is probably below what can be sustained,''
he said. ``We could certainly see some recovery in the flue-cured
tobacco quota - maybe up to about 600 million pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco quota for the 2000 growing season is 543 million
pounds, down from nearly 1 billion pounds only four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge also said he's far from ready to write off the North
Carolina tradition of tobacco farming to the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that the worst is behind us and we're at a
point where the market will stabilize,'' he said. ``There have
always been ups and downs in tobacco over the past 200 years. We've
been through some tough times, but I think the future will be
brighter.''

 &HT;    Abernathy receives just punishment
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlantans should derive no pleasure from the
sentencing of convicted chiseler Ralph David Abernathy III to four
years in prison. What a comedown for the son and namesake of one of
the civil rights movement's foremost leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the punishment was appropriate considering the younger
Abernathy's offenses. True, the amount of state money the former
state lawmaker was convicted of pocketing, $5,700, may seem paltry
by the standards of big-league rogues. Just the same, he violated a
public trust in helping himself to unauthorized state funds, and he
made matters worse by pressuring an assistant to lie on his behalf
to officials investigating financial irregularities in his office.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Abernathy should be relieved that his witness-tampering
gambit, which was caught on tape and played at his trial, didn't
earn him an even harsher sentence. Give L.A. McConnell Jr., the
visiting judge who presided over Abernathy's case, credit for
adhering to probation office sentencing guidelines. That way,
McConnell hoped, he could avoid the appearance of taking a
supposedly hard-nosed downstate attitude toward a case tried in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, McConnell went out of his way to treat the Abernathy
family with dignity and respect. He paid tribute to Abernathy's
father as one of the most admired men of the last century and noted
the defendant has talents that could benefit his community _ once
he pays his debt to society.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Abernathy's supporters continue to maintain this
wasn't a prosecution, but rather a persecution on the basis of
race. For instance, Hosea Williams, a longtime friend of the
Abernathy family, takes the tack that the defendant only did what
other legislators do.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams has evidence of wrongdoing by other lawmakers,
whatever their color, he ought to present it to appropriate
authorities. In any event, his rationale for Abernathy's
transgressions is no defense.

 &HT;    Teacher shortage won't be solved by turning away older
applicants
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service

   EDs: The following is designed to run as the first of two
consecutive columns on the same subject or be merged into one op-ed
or perspective section piece by merely deleting the dateline and
lede of the second section. Either piece also could stand alone.
Both are available on the Cox and New York Times wires. Since this
is the hiring season for next fall's crop of teachers, a local
situationer is suggested.
</P>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``This country is facing an extensive teacher
shortage
</P>
<P>
   and will need to hire more than 2 million instructors over the
next 10 years. But the recruitment effort will be wasted unless the
states raise standards for what teachers need to know, commit
themselves to hiring only qualified teachers and revamp schools of
education that are often no more than diploma mills, offering
watered-down courses and marginal preparation.'' _ Editorial, The
New York Times, Sunday, Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I wrote of the plight of my friend Gail, a dedicated
lady who found the schoolhouse locked when she tried to realize her
dream of teaching high school history. After completing her
education (cum laude and post-kids), she has been unable to land a
job in anybody's school system because she has two strikes against
her: a master's degree, and her age.
</P>
<P>
   Gail's advanced degree would cost the school a few more bucks,
and education is not known for putting its money where its mouth
is. And as for age, a 53-year-old is not going to die (or retire on
a pittance) any quicker than a 25-year-old is going to apply for
maternity leave or quit to follow her boyfriend to Myrtle Beach,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the volume of mail from all over the country, Gail
is far from alone in her under-employed state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read with great interest (and understanding) your article in
The Dayton Daily News this morning. I am 49, have a master's and
experience to compound the predicament. I am constantly receiving
substitute positions and accolades, but not a permanent position.
Comments I have received include, 'I don't want any more your age
in my building.' and 'I'm proud
</P>
<P>
   not to honor loyalty and dedication. That's not important in
education.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed,'' she adds, ``when I decided to return to
teaching, went back to school to become current and meet the state
standards, that I would
</P>
<P>
   have difficulty. I won't get pregnant, I have the maturity from
raising my own children, I'm stable in the community, and most
importantly, I know what I want to do with my life. I have even
offered to start at base pay. I truly love teaching, so money is
not my sole objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Ohio reader thanked me for trying to show the public
what she believes really fuels teacher shortages (money and age
bias). ``Our short-sighted superintendent hired a 26-year-old with
no experience as principal at our elementary.''
</P>
<P>
   A 34-year-old subbed for two years but gave up teaching after
watching 23-year-olds finding positions in the same systems where
she had applied.
</P>
<P>
   Another feels lucky to have a job, but watches as colleagues
continue to sub while children of neighboring school
administrators, school board members, or ministers are hired. And
as for minorities in her community, forget it. ``They recruit,
interview, but never hire.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hingham, Mass., a concerned parent admits she has no respect
for public education because budget is their biggest concern. She
suggests Gail go into private tutoring where she could be making up
to $40 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   On an up-note, the principal of a Dayton Catholic high school
admits it's quite a commute from Boston, but he values life
experience as a qualification for teaching, and would welcome
Gail's resume. He even includes his address.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT: Readers are still talking about it.

   &UR; In the Footsteps of the Impressionists &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Paris, always a city for browsers, is even more so if you have
in hand ``Impressionist Paris: The Essential Guide to the City of
Light.'' Written by Julian More and published by Pavilion/Trafalgar
Square ($19.95 for the paperback), the book provides detailed
itineraries for 30 walks and drives in and around the city, along
routes well worn by Monet, Manet, Cezanne, Pissarro, Sisley and
their artistic brethren. It provides a way to see, or at least
imagine, the charm and elegance of late 19th-century Paris through
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The book begins with a brief introduction to Impressionism, from
its early days in the Fontainebleau forest to its final days in
Paris and southern France. Organized geographically, the chapters _
on Montmartre, the Seine River valley, both banks of the Seine in
Paris and the River Oise, to name a few _ are full of information,
both historical and practical (like public transportation, hotels
and restaurants).
</P>
<P>
   Say you would like to visit Auvers-sur-Oise, Cezanne and van
Gogh country, which More advises is a 90-minute train ride from
Gare St.-Lazare. He recommends two restaurants and a B&AMP;B, then
suggests a half-day walk that takes you past the church made famous
by van Gogh, the cemetery where he is buried and the Rue
Francois-Coppee, where Cezanne loved to paint.
</P>
<P>
   The book, illustrated with reproductions and photographs,
includes a who's who of the artists, brief sketches of the museums
whose holdings are discussed and a bibliography for those who want
to know more about what they have seen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Crude Oil Prices Cause Air Fare Surcharges &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil prices have soared, and air passengers are paying for
it. All of the major domestic airlines are imposing a fuel
surcharge on domestic tickets. The charge is $10 on one-way tickets
and $20 on round trips, except for Alaska Airlines, a mostly
short-haul carrier on the West Coast that is charging half as much,
and US Airways, which is limiting the surcharge to advance-purchase
fares.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest, which has both low fares and short flights, is
imposing a charge of $2 on flights up to 600 miles, $6 for 600 to
900 miles and $8 for longer flights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fuel surcharge is the equivalent of about a 3-4 percent
increase in overall domestic fares, according to Brian D. Harris,
the airline industry analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Harris said
the flat surcharge was unfair to people who took short flights
because the fee was the same whether one flew the 200 miles between
New York and Washington or across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines, the first to add the surcharge, put it in
effect last month. Other airlines quickly followed after Delta
imposed the fee. Delta's decision was key because it has contracts
that allow it to buy most of its fuel at last year's prices. But as
world crude oil prices have gone up, the cost of jet fuel has
doubled in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In Montreal, a Multimedia Festival &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Montreal loves festivals, and is starting a new one Friday: the
Montreal High Lights Festival. Through March 4, the city will
celebrate the culinary arts, performing arts and museums and
lighting arts, with more than 2,000 artists participating.
</P>
<P>
   The opening performance on Friday will feature Jessye Norman,
who will sing spirituals and a new piece by the French jazz
composer and pianist Michel Legrand at the Wilfrid-Pelletier
Theater in Place des Arts (tickets $25 to $104, at 1.5 Canadian to
the dollar). The festival will close with a multimedia homage to
the music from the film ``The Red Violin'' with the violinist
Joshua Bell at the Molson Center ($18 to $54). A Bach mini-festival
at the Centre Pierre-Peladeau from Feb. 26 to 28 honors the 250th
anniversary of Bach' death; $12 for the 7:30 p.m. concert, $15 for
the 10:30 p.m. performance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first Montreal International Symposium on Lighting will
feature displays by lighting specialists at six parks throughout
the city. A multimedia show titled ``This Is a Sphere'' will be
shown free each evening at 5:30 and 7:15 by the Place des Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of the French chef Paul Bocuse, the festival
also showcases the city's cuisine. Montreal chefs have invited
chefs from Europe and the United States to join them in producing
special menus at 50 restaurants; visitors with festival passports
will be given a 15 percent discount. There will also be workshops
and tasting events ($20 to $110), with some lectures and events
free. Information: (514) 288-9955, (888) 477-9955 or
www.montrealhighlights.com.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A New View of the Firmament &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Manhattan, earthbound since the old-fashioned but
beloved Hayden Planetarium closed in 1997, will once again be able
to scan the galaxies beginning this month. The $210 million
Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space
at the American Museum of Natural History in New York opens two
major spaces on Feb. 19: The new Hayden Planetarium and the Dorothy
and Lewis B. Cullman Hall of the Universe. The center's third hall,
the David S. and Ruth L. Gottesman Hall of Planet Earth, opened in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic spherical planetarium soars 87 feet into the air
and from the outside appears suspended inside a 95-foot-high glass
cube. It has been divided into hemispheres. The visit begins with
an elevator ride to the darkened anteroom of the planetarium, where
visitors are given a video introduction to the Rose Center. They
proceed to the Space Theater, the top section of the sphere, where
they take seats to watch ``Passport to the Universe,'' a 23-minute
journey though space narrated by Tom Hanks. The presentation, based
on data collected from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratories and the
Hubble Space Telescope, is not limited to Earth-based observations
as the old planetarium show was. Visitors inside the Digital Dome
will feel as though they are soaring through space as they travel
beyond the Milky Way, stopping at the rings of Saturn, supernovas,
the Orion nebula, the Andromeda Galaxy and a black hole. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lower hemisphere houses the Big Bang Theater. Visitors stand
on a glass floor and look down into a simulation of the dawn of the
Universe. The Harriet and Robert Heilbrunn Cosmic Pathway, a curved
ramp that winds around the exterior of the planetarium, leads from
the Big Bang through 13 billion years of cosmic evolution, at the

N-RELOCATE (Undated) - Some Navajos lost their homes to loan
sharks, some to tax liens. Others could not keep up with monthly
payments for water and electricity. But some, especially the young,
educated and culturally mobile, are flourishing away from the land
of their ancestors. By JERRY KAMMER. Story will move in the `A`
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
1918FLU (Phoenix) - Phoenix thought it could escape the devastation
of the 1918 flu pandemic, believing its balmy climate and habit of
sleeping in the fresh air would protect it from the worst of the
disease. Instead, the city was one of the few urban areas to suffer
two waves of influenza, which devastated its population. By BARBARA
YOST. Story moved in the `A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TV-GOODY (Phoenix) - Two of Us, a VH1 movie about a fictional
meeting between John Lennon and Paul McCartney, might just as well
have been called ``Two Ex-Beatles Sittin' Around Talkin' '' because
by and large that's what it's about _ rock's greatest songwriters
hashing out (over a bit of hash or more likely, knowing McCartney's
tastes, marijuana) their differences. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story
will move in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PIMENTEL-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Arizona Sen. John McCain has answered
the abortion question several times. We know he doesn't favor
abortion except in cases of rape or incest. From a public policy
standpoint, I have no difficulty discerning where he stands. McCain
was right both times when he said it would be his daughter's
decision and again when he said it would be the family's. It is her
decision, but it is not a decision she must make alone. Let's be
less enamored of ``gotcha'' journalism and more concerned with the
real question. I don't care what McCain would do with his own
daughter. I care what he would do with mine and yours. That's why
they call it public policy. &QL; 
By O. RICARDO PIMENTEL. Column will move in the ``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - It was clear to me as long as I was
looking at it through the ninth floor windows of `The Arizona
Republic's` newsroom. A couple of Phoenix cops stopped a guy for
not having a headlamp on his bicycle and wound up shooting him
three times in the chest. Are you kiddin' me? If only I hadn't
gotten the idiotic notion to take the elevator to the ground floor,
get in my car and drive to 22nd Avenue and Monroe, where the
incident happened. By EJ MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and
``K'' categories. &QL;

   &UR; Vienna Performances &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Several couples will be in Vienna the last weekend in May and
would like to see performances of the Vienna Boys Choir and the
Lipizzaner horses. Is this possible? _ H.C., Upper Saddle River,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are opportunities to see both of these Vienna
traditions on the last weekend in May, but you may have to act
quickly to get tickets
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Riding School's Lipizzaners will prance in a regular
80-minute performance on Sunday, May 28, at 10:45 a.m. At this
writing, only standing-room tickets are left, the director's office
said. These cost about $14.50, at 13.7 schillings to the dollar,
and can be ordered from Spanish Riding School, Michaelerplatz 1,
A-1010 Vienna, Austria; (43-1) 533-9031, fax (43-1) 535-0186; or at
www.spanische-reitschule.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you are unlucky in getting these tickets (or prefer to sit),
it may be possible to see the slightly shorter Saturday ``Classical
Art of Riding With Music'' show. Tickets for these 10 a.m. events,
essentially training sessions with music, must be obtained from one
of about two dozen travel agencies in Vienna. The tickets cost
about $25, including a service charge. These seats in the
classically Baroque arena are not assigned.
</P>
<P>
   The school's Web site lists the agents, but among them is
American Express Reiseburo, Kaerntnerstrasse 21-23, A 1015 Vienna;
(43-1) 515-400, fax (43-1) 5154-0777.
</P>
<P>
   For 502 years, the Vienna Boys Choir has performed at Sunday
morning Mass at the Burgkapelle at the Hofburg, and it is to
continue that tradition on May 28 at 9:15. Tickets (about $30) are
obtained through the Imperial Chapel at (43-1) 533-9927, fax (43-1)
533-9927-75 and by e-mail at Hofmusikkapelle(at)asnwien.ac.at. Ask
for seats with a view of the choir.
</P>
<P>
   The choir also sings on Fridays at Musikverien, the concert hall
on Karlsplatz. Tickets, $28 to $40, are available from Mondial
Destination Management in Vienna, (43-1) 588-040, fax (43-1)
587-1268.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Irish Golf Outing &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My siblings and I are planning to visit Ireland and we'd like
to hold our annual family golf tournament there, probably near
Dublin or in Galway. Who could help us organize such an outing for
12 to 15 people who would want to rent clubs? _ Robert Powers, Des
Moines
</P>
<P>
   A. The equivalent of the United States Golf Association in
Ireland _ albeit much smaller _ is the Golfing Union of Ireland.
According to Pat Finn, assistant to the general secretary, the
union does not make arrangements for playing, or handle golf
packages, but it can provide a list of courses and of companies
that put together packages.
</P>
<P>
   You can address such inquiries to Seamus Smith, General
Secretary, Golfing Union of Ireland, Glencar House, 81 Eglinton
Rd., Donnybrook, Dublin 4; or call (353-1) 269-4111 or fax (353-1)
269-5368.
</P>
<P>
   Finn noted that the courses in Galway were likely to be less
busy than those near Dublin, though he said there were more than
enough in any region to handle your family. He cautioned that some
courses might not have as many sets of clubs for rent as your party
would need.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of his personal suggestions were Galway Bay Golf and Hotel
Resort, Renville, Oranmore, Galway, (353-91) 790-500; Galway Golf
Club, Blackrock, Salthill, Galway, (553-91) 522-033, and Connemara
Golf Club, Ballyconneely, Clifden, Galway, (353-95) 23502. (But
Connemara says it does not have enough rental clubs for your
group.) Greens fees and club rental would be about $24 at Galway,
and about $44 at Galway Bay, at $1.25 to the Irish pound. More
information about these and other golf courses is available on the
union's Web site, www.gui.ie.
</P>
<P>
   Among companies that handle golf packages, with or without
travel and lodging, is Golfing Ireland, 18 Parnell Square, Dublin
1, (353-1) 872-6711, fax (353-1) 6632; www.golfing &QC; -ireland.com.
For reservations, call (353-66) 979-2022. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To simply learn about courses, www.uk-golf.com has information
on many by region.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Elephants in Amboseli &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We'd like a guided tour of three to five days in Amboseli
National Park in Kenya, with an emphasis on the elephants studied
by Cynthia Moss. Are such tours available in English? _ M.S., New
York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Safaris are big business in Kenya, where English is widely
spoken. The Kenya Association of Tour Operators alone lists more
than 200 members, and how to contact them, at www.gorp.com/kato; or
you can contact the association at Post Office Box 48461, Nairobi,
Kenya; (254-2) 225570, fax (254-2) 218402. The association said
that the park itself does not have guides but that many of its
members offered drivers and guides.
</P>
<P>
   So finding a guide is not difficult; finding one right for you
may be. Probably the best way is to deal with a travel consultant
in the United States who is familiar with Kenya. Two experienced
ones are Bruce Baum and Mackey Arnstein, and either can arrange as
much or as little of your excursion as you want.
</P>
<P>
   Baum, who runs Kenya Consultants, 4 Miller Road, Mount Tremper,
N.Y. 12457, (914) 688-5951, fax (914) 688-2438, has been going to
Kenya for 19 years. His recommendation, depending on your budget,
is to hire Tony Archer, a former hunter who, he said, is a friend
of Ms. Moss, who is known for her pictures of Amboseli elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Baum said Archer charged $250 a person a day and could arrange
for all your needs, including a car and driver, which would be
extra. (A private tour for two could easily cost $700 a person a
day.) He suggested staying at Tortilis, a tent camp bordering the
park, which both he and Ms. Arnstein called comfortable and well
maintained. Baum, whose e-mail address is
brucebaum(at)earthlink.net, asserted that his 15 percent commission
was less than that of Kenyan operators.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arnstein, who has been handling tours to Kenya since 1972,
said there were probably better areas to study elephants than in
Amboseli, which is relatively easy to reach. Its popularity has
resulted in limits on travel within the park, and a private guide
might not get you close to many more animals than a group tour
would, she said. So unless you are more interested in Ms. Moss than
in elephants, she might suggest other destinations, like Tarangire
National Park in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of where you choose to go, her East Africa Safari
Co., 1500 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10036, (800) 772-3274, (212)
840-7800 in New York City, fax (212) 840-9411, can arrange for a
guide, lodging and travel _ or any of those elements.

 &HT;    Another week, another 100-year storm
 &HT;    By Jeff Herrin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Locusts, anyone? Boils? Hives? Horrible
lesions?
</P>
<P>
   Wanna rent some garments?
</P>
<P>
   It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel cold.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain part of me that's sure I'll turn on the tube
tomorrow morning and find one of the Storm Team Men With Deep
Voices pointing to an Accu-Trac model of a poxes-upon-these-houses
system.
</P>
<P>
   He'll make sweeping arm gestures toward doomsday icons and tell
us in his friendly let's-not-be-alarmed-but-for-God's-sakes-run
kinda voice that quite frankly we're all gonna die. Then we'll flip
off the tube, go outside and play in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's it going?'' my brother in Florida asked last week over
the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you know, I said. Another week, another storm of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said. ``We might get some rain here.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll freely admit it. I could enjoy the snow a lot more if it
weren't for people like ... well, like myself. We in the media seem
determined to chart the landing of every snowflake in the state. I
think we feel better about ourselves for informing the public, even
when our latest cause for alarm can be summed up in two words:
</P>
<P>
   It snowed.
</P>
<P>
   I worked once for a young, professional city editor who spent an
entire February morning checking in an authoritative voice with
everyone who trudged into the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim,'' he asked as one of the veteran reporters began taking
off wraps. ``What's the scene today in Davidson County?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's damn cold,'' Jim said. ``What'd you think?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a pain, all of this. We have to figure out who owns trucks
that can make it through the stuff, then map out ways to get copy
editors here. And I can't even begin to comprehend the nightmares
that Circulation's having.
</P>
<P>
   But every once in a while we catch sight of our real selves. The
phones don't ring as much in weeks like this. I can gaze out my
office window at the brilliant majesty of it all.
</P>
<P>
   The folks in Creative Services built a structure of twigs and
snow on top of a trash can just outside the door. Granted, it
looked like something out of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' but at
least it captured the spirit of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The coffee somehow tastes better. Spirits are higher. Our sense
of purpose is larger.
</P>
<P>
   I drove home at lunch one day to find a broken snowman lying in
three pieces in my yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rise and fall of Snowbodan Milosevic,'' I told the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the jokes aren't any better.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I remember the reckless winter of 1981 when we spent
every weekend sliding off mountainsides to be with each other. I
was in my first newspaper job. She was a senior at Appalachian
State.
</P>
<P>
   Snow didn't seem such an apocalypse then. Just a beautiful
backdrop to something bigger.
</P>
<P>
   It's something to think about as I grumble my way to the car
each morning for another half-hour of championship windshield
scraping.
</P>
<P>
   It's damn cold. But it's improving.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Herrin is the editor of the Rocky Mount Telegram, Rocky
Mount, N.C.

 &HT;     McCAIN, BRADLEY LOOK BEYOND NEW HAMPSHIRE  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H.  &Cx1f; _ Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill
Bradley, who will wrap up insurgent campaigns against front-runners
in the New Hampshire presidential primary on Tuesday, face
dramatically different challenges in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is banking that a strong showing in the nation's first
presidential primary will enable his populist crusade to make
inroads against Texas Gov. George W. Bush in South Carolina,
Arizona and Michigan over the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, bracing for a setback at the hands of Vice President Al
Gore in their rivalry for the Democratic nomination, is looking to
the next contests to help rescue a faltering bid to succeed
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The latest public opinion surveys showed McCain leading Bush
while Bradley trailed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's strength nationally, 10 of 11 surveys in the
final days of the New Hampshire contest showed McCain ahead of Bush
by margins that ranged from 1 percentage point to 15 percentage
points. The 11 surveys showed Gore leading Bradley, with margins of
victory ranging from 3 percentage points to 14 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dear friends, young and old, rich and poor, from all over
the state of New Hampshire, all I can do is ask you to get out our
vote tomorrow,'' McCain, the senior senator from Arizona, told
several hundred supporters in front of the New Hampshire state
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident we will achieve victory if you do that,''
McCain added. ``I am not afraid of losing, my dear friends, and I'm
very confident of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, addressing dozens of employees of the Oracle Corp.'s
computer software development operation in Nashua, made a pitch for
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask for your vote tomorrow,'' said Bradley, who represented
New Jersey in the Senate for 18 years. ``And I hope you will feel
if you cast that vote, that you're part of something that is new
and fresh and that we're at a time of a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley already were casting their eyes down the
campaign trail, with plans to depart New Hampshire within hours of
the returns coming in on Tuesday night. McCain, joined in Concord
by Republican Reps. Lindsay Graham and Mark Sanford of South
Carolina, said his expected success in New Hampshire would
strengthen his hand in South Carolina's GOP primary on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to win the state of South Carolina,'' McCain told
the crowd, as he stood in front of a mountain of snow bedecked with
his campaign signs.
</P>
<P>
   McCain still faces an uphill struggle in South Carolina, with
the latest CNN-Time survey in that state showing McCain trailing
Bush by 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, hoping to underscore what spokesman Eric Hauser
described as a long-term challenge to Gore, mapped plans for
campaign appearances in Connecticut, New York City, San Francisco,
Baltimore and Tampa, Fla., by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley were preparing to leave New Hampshire with
the centerpieces of their challenges well established. Both made
town hall-style question-and-answer sessions the hallmark of their
campaigns. Both vowed to reform the way political campaigns are
financed by restricting donations that are largely unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley hit their populist theme on the final day on
the hustings here in New Hampshire, where an overnight snowstorm
lifted by midday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow night, we will send a message to America and the
world that the American people feel that they want someone who is
fully prepared to be president of United States, (someone) who
needs no on-the-job training,'' McCain declared. ``There will be
the message that the American people want to get the government out
of the hands of the special interests and the big money and be
represented again.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has criticized Bush's fund-raising, adding that ``the
corruption that characterized the campaign of 1996 by Clinton and
Gore will not be tolerated in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley echoed the theme. ``I hope that the independent-minded
people of New Hampshire will send a message to this country that
the old ways are over and the new politics has arrived,'' Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley have courted independents _ the largest bloc
of voters in the Granite State's electorate. Independents are
permitted to cast ballots in either party's presidential primary
and then re-register as independents. Of the state's 738,422
registered voters, 37 percent are independents, 36 percent are
Republicans and 27 percent are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Secretary of State William Gardner forecast that
independents would account for nearly one-quarter of the vote,
casting an expected 80,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   But two independent voters said on Monday that they would cast
ballots in the GOP primary for McCain rather than voting in the
Democratic primary for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Davison, 37, a software developer with Oracle living in
Amherst, said he wanted to hear Bradley speak before making up his
mind. But Davison said afterwards that he would vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my vote to make a difference,'' Davison said, noting
that Bradley is far behind Gore in the latest polls. ``I think we
can send a message with McCain that we can't send by voting for
Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul De Angelis, 64, of Concord, a retired printing press
operator, said that he would vote for McCain because ``he tells it
like it is, he doesn't lie.'' De Angelis, who said that he was so
inspired by President John F. Kennedy that he named his first born
son after the slain president, said that McCain commands the same
kind of devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What scares me about Bush is all that campaign money,'' De
Angelis said. ``It makes me afraid that if he gets in, all he'll do
is help big business.''
</P>
<P>
   De Angelis said that even if McCain wins on Tuesday, he faces
immense challenges in follow-on primaries. ``New Hampshire could be
a good stepping stone for him,'' De Angelis said. ``But he'll have
a tough road ahead against all Bush's money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign announced Monday that the Texas governor has
raised $68.7 million. McCain has raised $15.6 million, including $2
million transferred from his Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed with the Federal Election Commission showed that
Bush had $31.4 million in the bank as of Dec. 31 _ four times the
estimated $7.7 million that McCain has available to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley remain more closely matched. Bradley has raised
more than $27 million; Gore has raised $28.2 million. Bradley has
$19.7 million available from donations and federal matching funds
compared to Gore, who has $18.1 million.

<P>
   Both McCain and Bradley are banking on New Hampshire voters to
help upset the well-laid plans of party front-runners, as has
happened in the past.
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush's quest for a second term ran into trouble
in the primary here in 1992 when the incumbent eked out victory
over populist GOP challenger Patrick Buchanan. Buchanan's 37
percent against Bush's 52 percent revealed vulnerabilities that
contributed to Bush's subsequent loss to Democrat Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Jimmy Carter's bid for a second term encountered
trouble here in the 1980 primary, where he managed to win 47
percent of the Democratic vote compared to 37 percent rolled up by
his liberal challenger, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.
Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in the November election.

 &HT;    For new Coke CEO, headaches come with job
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Less than two months ago, few people outside of
Coca-Cola would recognize Doug Daft's name.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company's new president and chairman-designate has had
his picture and comments in newspapers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could do without it,'' Daft said Monday in an interview. ``I
could assure you.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows it's human nature to enjoy the sudden notoriety that
comes with achieving a top position in the corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to see themselves in print,'' Daft said. But,
he added, all the attention has gotten old fairly quickly,
especially with the issues he now has to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Daft announced a major reorganization of the world's
largest soft-drink company, just 53 days after he was named
president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   He said the reorganization, which involves cutting 6,000 jobs,
including 2,500 in Atlanta, was the most ``difficult and
devastating'' decision he has made.
</P>
<P>
   While the 56-year-old executive may not like all the publicity,
he knows it goes with the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize it's part of the role, a critical part of the
role,'' Daft said. ``I want to build relationships with the media
and the community.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Atlanta investors should understand that his recent
moves are being made to strengthen the company over the long-term.
If the company becomes stronger, he said, Atlanta will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to be an integral and important part of the
Atlanta community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the overall direction of the company has been decided,
Daft said, he will be spending more time talking with his top
management team about how to implement the strategy, which includes
decentralizing the company.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, he said, ``We'll be putting some real meat
around the strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft said he has been putting in his normal 12-hour workdays,
but there's one key difference from his former job heading Coke's
Middle East, Far East and African operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days are much more pressured, because the decisions affect
many more people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To take some of the enormous pressure off, Daft said he spent
last weekend with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did some cross-country skiing,'' he said. ``It tends to
clear the mind.''

`MOM, DADDY, I'M PREGNANT' _ IT'S DECISION TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By O. RICARDO PIMENTEL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - (begin ital) A fictional account of an important chat
with a 15-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Background: I have one. So does Arizona Sen. John McCain. I
suspect most of the press corps on McCain's bus do not. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Daughter: Mom, Daddy, I need to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: OK, sweetie, what's on your mind?
</P>
<P>
   Dad: Uh, OK. (Dread, dread, dread. Puts down the remote control.
Knows it's trouble when he gets called ``Daddy.'')
</P>
<P>
   Daughter (tears and sobs): I know . . . I mean . . . What I'm
trying to say . . .
</P>
<P>
   Mom: (hugging daughter): Go ahead, sweetie. You can tell us
anything. (Looks at Dad.)
</P>
<P>
   Dad: Anything, honey.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter: I'm pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   (Dumbfounded silence. Mom looks at Dad, tears in her eyes. Dad
tries to unclench his jaw. Unclenches when he suddenly remembers
daughter as 3-year-old in pigtails with bright red fat cheeks, who
giggles and smiles while playing silly games with him. Anger at
first. Then, as daughter continues crying, anger softens to
concern. Mom hugs daughter harder, looks at Dad.)
</P>
<P>
   Dad: Who? I'm sorry. I know who. What do you want to do? Do you
want to have the baby (he asks hopefully)? I mean, you know we'll
help, right? You know, you and the baby can be with us.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter: I don't know, Daddy. I think . . . Oh, God, I know how
disappointed you are . . . I mean, what if . . . I don't know if
I'm ready to have a baby. We've been talking about . . . about . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Dad: You mean an abortion?
</P>
<P>
   Daughter (head nods): It's just that . . . God, I'm still in
high school. I want to go to college. I know we're Catholic and
we're not supposed to believe in abortion, but . . . (tears start
again).
</P>
<P>
   (Mom and Dad resist temptation to say, ``You should have thought
of all of that before.'' Both suddenly remember being 15.)
</P>
<P>
   Mom: What's he want to do? You're too young to be married. I
mean, it takes two to tango. What's he want to do?
</P>
<P>
   Dad: I don't care what he wants to do. He's not having the baby
(angry now).
</P>
<P>
   Mom: I just mean he has responsibilities here, too, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Dad (unclenching jaw again): What's he going to do? Quit high
school? Work at McDonald's? Try to support our daughter on minimum
wage and no health insurance?
</P>
<P>
   Daughter: We don't want to get married.
</P>
<P>
   Dad (hands go to head): It feels like the right thing to do is
to have the baby. God, but (exasperated now) you're just 15! You
know how we feel about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter: Like you said, I'm the one who's pregnant. This is my
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Dad (considers telling her that Arizona is a parental-consent
state. Reconsiders. Deep sigh.): Sweetie, I know. But this is a
decision, no matter which way we go (emphasizing the ``we''), that
will have lasting consequences. If you have the baby, we'll help.
If you don't have the baby, I think you'll always wonder . . . was
it the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter (nodding): I know. I've thought this through. I think I
need to have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Dad (considers telling her he won't have anything to do with
this. Looks at Mom. He wonders, how do you force someone who
doesn't want a baby to have one?): How about adoption?
</P>
<P>
   Daughter (shakes head emphatically): I know I've done wrong,
Daddy. I know you maybe think abortion is murder.
</P>
<P>
   Dad (realizes he can't think of his daughter as a murderer under
any circumstances, even with abortion): It looks like you've
thought this through. I guess my choice is to help or not. (Pause)
</P>
<P>
   Put your own ending on this story. I've got mine and I'm keeping
it to myself because, frankly, it's none of your business. And,
it's also none of your business what McCain would do in this
fictional episode.
</P>
<P>
   He's answered the abortion question several times. We know he
doesn't favor abortion except in cases of rape or incest. From a
public policy standpoint, I have no difficulty discerning where he
stands.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was right both times, when he said it would be his
daughter's decision and again when he said it would be the
family's. It is her decision, but it is not a decision she must
make alone.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be less enamored of ``gotcha'' journalism and more
concerned with the real question. I don't care what McCain would do
with his own daughter. I care what he would do with mine and yours.
That's why they call it public policy. &QL;

RESTORING TRUST IN PROVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shooting death of Providence police officer Cornel Young Jr.
will severely test that city's public institutions in the coming
days and weeks. Incomplete or evasive answers could ignite
smoldering suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Young, the son of the department's highest-ranking black
officer, was shot by fellow officers Friday when he rushed from a
restaurant to assist police in the arrest of a gunman. Young was
off duty and in street clothes; he was mistaken for a suspect and _
according to police _ was shot when he failed to drop his weapon as
ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Early reaction suggests that Providence officials lack trust in
the average citizen. The city's mayor and police chief quickly
dismissed questions of whether race or racial profiling might have
contributed to the shooting. As of  &UR; yesterday &LR; , officials were
still refusing to identify the race or races of the police officers
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The citizenry, in turn, suspect the police. One city councilor
said his constituents were ``offended'' and ``in disbelief'' that
officials did not consider the role of race. Another councilor said
her constituents believe that ``Cornel Young Jr. was
assassinated.''
</P>
<P>
   The split-second nature of police work sometimes ends in
gruesome error. Forward-looking departments consider this when they
form ongoing partnerships with church groups and neighborhood
associations. Those community policing partnerships yield crime
tips and public cooperation. But they also yield the most precious
commodity in police work _ forgiveness when things fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Now city officials must act quickly to restore trust. The
investigation by Providence police and the state attorney general
would benefit from outside observers. The presence of a respected
organization, such as the National Organization of Black Law
Enforcement Executives, would help to assure the public that all
investigative options are explored and explained to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Without such resolve, forgiveness will be far away in
Providence.

COMMENTARY: RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE? WHY, YES, DON'T MIND IF I
DO 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're in the midst of what promises to be the most expensive
presidential primary season in history, and I think we'd all have
to agree it's been money well-spent. Sure, bloated, sybaritic rock
stars tour the world on smaller budgets, but they don't entertain
us nearly as much.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets and schools and greasy spoons of Iowa and New
Hampshire, no hand has gone unshaken, no rock unturned (oh, lookie,
another Pat Buchanan supporter!), no issue unkicked.
</P>
<P>
   It's still early in the campaign, but those of us watching on TV
at home already have learned many valuable things about the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   We know, for instance, that John McCain is simultaneously for
and against abortion, Confederate flags, and a slew of other stuff;
that Al Gore and at least one old friend can't agree on when Gore
quit smoking marijuana; and that George W. Bush has seen a
grocery-store scanner and knows what it's used for. (We have
established that, right?)
</P>
<P>
   The scanner question, of course, is not trivial. Every campaign
has to have at least one defining moment, whether it's a candidate
forgetting where he last found Poland on a map (Ford), or taking an
ill-timed look at his watch (Bush the Elder), or climbing atop a
tank and posing for a goofy photo (Dukakis).
</P>
<P>
   Such things may seem silly in retrospect, but they help us
decide whether the candidates really know what our lives are like,
or whether they're hopelessly out of touch, like some bloated,
sybaritic rock star.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea when or where the defining moments of the 2000
campaign will occur, but I'm pretty sure one just happened in a
mosh pit.
</P>
<P>
   You may have missed it, but the subject of moshing _ a youthful
art that, among other things, involves passing youthful bodies
overhead, usually to the accompaniment of youthful music _ arose
unexpectedly during last week's presidential debate in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   If you're wobbly on this issue, now may be the time to study up
on it and take a firm stand. (I've never moshed myself, although I
once had a co-worker who insisted the phrase was ``gnosh'' pit,
which prompted me to daydream about franchising a chain of highly
profitable gnosh-and-mosh pits. Alas, an investor has yet to step
forward.)
</P>
<P>
   This is complicated, so please bear with me. The way I
understand it, Republican candidate Alan Keyes emerged from a rally
in Iowa recently and was hoisted in the air by folks outside. He
was then passed from person to person as a song by the rock group
Rage Against the Machine played in the background.
</P>
<P>
   This apparently irked fellow GOP candidate Gary Bauer to no end.
Bauer, who is emerging as one of the premier scolds of our day,
declared during the debate that he was ``a little surprised'' at
Keyes' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   As George W. Bush no doubt looked on anxiously (``Josh Pitts? Is
he prime minister of some place?''), Bauer proceeded to chide Keyes
at length for being anywhere within earshot of tunes put out by, as
Bauer called it, ``The Machine Rages On.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said those ``killers in Columbine'' listened to music like
that and engaged in such hooliganism. ``Do you think that's
consistent with the dignity of the president?'' he asked,
witheringly.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, apparently taken off guard, said he was ``not morally
responsible for the music that was playing'' and began blathering
as if he were being questioned as part of an impeachment trial. ``I
had nothing to do with that music, disclaim any knowledge of it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed further, Keyes defiantly said he'd had fun in the mosh
pit and noted with pride that he'd kept his tie straight the whole
time. ``The real test of dignity is how you carry yourself in hard
times,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, you said it, pal. And we voters are finding our ties all
askew.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, neither Bauer nor Keyes has a chance of winning the
GOP nomination. But when they drop out, which could be any day now,
I'll miss them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I think the United States should be more like
countries where the winners _ say, Prime Minister Josh Pitts _ are
forced to serve with some of the also-rans in a coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
   With a stage of presidential candidates this thoughtful and this
talented, it seems a pity to throw any of them into the pit just
yet.

A BRAVE CUBAN'S MANIFESTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS GAGEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cubans can gripe about the oppressive reality of daily life to
themselves and to foreigners, but if they try to put their
complaints into organized political activity, they invariably get
into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fate of Oswaldo Paya, one of the most respected
Cuban dissidents, whom I interviewed in Havana last month. ``Cuba
is in a very dangerous moment,'' he said, `The new wealthy (class)
is gaining control of all the assets. The United States is playing
the stability card. It wants no exodus.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Soviet Union collapsed, Fidel Castro has transformed
Cuba's economy. It now relies on European and Canadian investment,
money from tourists, and remittances from Cuban-Americans, all in
US dollars. Castro divvies up the money, with much going to the
military-security complex.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which ought to be making plans for a
long-term transition to democracy, is preoccupied with the
complexities of an imperfect trade embargo and management of the
refugee problem, as personified by Elian Gonzalez. Paya's analysis
was right on target, and he outlined a plan to transform the
country:
</P>
<P>
   --Cubans alone must define the process of change, but Cuban
exiles, ``an inseparable part of the Cuban people,'' should take an
active part in solving Cuban problems.
</P>
<P>
   --The United States should end the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   --Foreigners should not invest in Cuba until Cubans are allowed
to exercise economic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   --``Project Varela'' should be implemented. This is Paya's plan
to gather 10,000 signatures so that a bill could be presented to
the Cuban assembly to allow freedom of association and the press
and the establishment of small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba and the United States are so closely intertwined that a
cutoff of economic activity is impossible. And Cuban-Americans pour
hundreds of millions of dollars in each year to help friends and
relatives. The embargo has failed to promote Castro's overthrow or
cause him to change his ways. Paya is right that it should be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has long derided the exile community as ``gusanos'' or
worms. Yet they love their country of birth and are sustaining it
with their donations. Paya was vague as to how he would involve
them in Cuba's future, but their active support would do much to
ease the transition to a new Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Castro makes much of the damages supposedly inflicted by the
embargo, but Soviet subsidies and now foreign investment, mostly
from Europe and Canada, have done much to mitigate its effects.
</P>
<P>
   However, the lives of most people are made difficult by a
two-tier economy. Those with dollars do well, but those who depend
only on earnings in Cuban pesos cannot make ends meet. Physicians
in the state health service make the equivalent of $15 to $16 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Food is available, but it is plain fare for those without
dollars. Public transit in Havana consists of a few buses and
trucks pulling trailers, called ``camels,'' that hold 300 people.
Automobiles are few and creaky (those famous American '50s relics
are still running) but there are enough new sub-subcompact Subarus
and Fiats darting about to suggest that the government is rewarding
favored people with reliable transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Varela project, named after a famous Cuban priest, is
intended to begin a process of great change. Working within the
constitution, Paya wants to improve the economy quickly by
promoting the growth of small businesses, then begin an
unrestricted dialogue about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Castro is 73, and although he is looking remarkably hale, change
is coming when he dies. The worst scenarios have the country riven
by civil strife and US troops intervening. More likely, the army,
security forces, and the Communist Party will coalesce around an
individual or junta to maintain their grip on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans, repressed and impoverished for 40 years under Castro,
deserve better. They need an opportunity to open the economic and
political life of the country while sustaining the education and
health-care systems that are the strong points of the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want violent change,'' Paya said. ``We don't want the
strongest to be in charge.'' Even in an hour's interview, he seemed
to exhibit the compelling presence, conviction, and intelligence
that would make him a leader in a transformed Cuba. Unfortunately,
the Christian Liberation Movement, his political group, has only
400 members and is unlikely to get many more.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, he and several other dissidents were arrested as
they were about to discuss a human-rights initiative. They were
released after a few hours, but they did not hold their meeting.
The security services are adept at preventing dissidents from
coalescing into a formidable faction.
</P>
<P>
   I left Cuba the next day, impressed by the endurance of the
people in coping with everyday difficulties and Paya's courage in
seeking to get his message to Americans. Cuba is a lush island,
with a distinctive Afro-Latin culture and great potential for
economic and political growth, but when Castro's government thwarts
the aspiration of Paya and people like him, it becomes little more
than East Germany with palm trees.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Parcel Service reported better-than-expected
fourth-quarter earnings on Monday, but saw its stock drop more than
8 percent _ by $5.43 3/4 to $59.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the reason'' for the slump on Wall Street, said
spokesman Norman Black.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one analyst blamed it on unrealistic expectations
about how much and how fast Internet-related sales would add
noticeably to UPS's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started to get excited about the big Internet sales and
strong Christmas,'' said analyst Peter V. Coleman of Banc of
America Securities. ``They see online shopping doubled this year...
and they look for 20 percent'' increase in package volume from UPS,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take a while for Internet shopping to have a major
impact on a company that delivered more than 14 million packages a
day in the fourth quarter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the rising cost of fuel, Coleman said, the Sandy Springs
package delivery company ``knocked the cover off the ball'' in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, UPS reported a 37 percent increase in fourth-quarter
net income, while revenue grew just under 12 percent. Growth in
higher-margin services, an increase in international profit, and
results from its excess insurance business were behind the climb in
earnings, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Net income was $661 million, or 56 cents a share, in the latest
quarter, the first since UPS went public in November. The company
earned $482 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose to $7.45 billion from $6.66 billion. Wall Street had forecast
UPS would earn 55 cents in the 1999 fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Airborne Freight on Monday announced a 62 percent
fall in fourth-quarter profit, and blamed a decline in domestic
shipments and higher fuel costs. In December, FedEx reported a 6.6
percent dip in quarterly profit. FedEx cited fuel costs and
slower-than-expected growth in domestic shipments.
</P>
<P>
   For the full year, UPS reported revenue of $27.05 billion.
Excluding a $1.44 billion tax assessment, the company would have
earned $2.33 billion, or $2.04 a share, last year.
</P>
<P>
   UPS, which held a conference call with analysts after announcing
its results, did not offer a specific forecast for this year. But
analyst Coleman, who says he is on the high side of the range of
forecasts, looks for UPS to earn $2.40 a share in 2000, and $2.75
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   During the conference call, UPS said it will not add a surcharge
to help offset rising fuel prices. The company traditionally
adjusts shipping rates early in the year, and the cost of fuel is
one factor.
</P>
<P>
   Late in December, UPS announced average rate hikes of 2.9
percent for international shipments, 3.1 percent for ground
shipments, and 3.5 percent for those that go by air. The increases
are effective Monday.

ARIZONA'S `IRON LADY' ANSWERS HER CRITICS WITH WIT _ AND VETOS 
</HEADLINE>

 EDITORS: RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MIGH HAVE MISSED IT 
 
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It's a scene straight out of the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   A young mother looks out over the barren high desert, her three
small children huddled behind her skirts. Horses graze out front as
a wagon rolls by.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Hull, you're not in Kansas anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Arizona's present governor was a 26-year-old
schoolteacher who left a comfortable Kansas City suburb and moved
to Chinle, a remote town on the Navajo Reservation in northern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real culture shock,'' Hull recalled. ``We were there
in the days when the wagons pulled up for commodities at the
boarding school.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Terry, a doctor, had been assigned to Chinle by the
U.S. Public Health Service.
</P>
<P>
   There was no theater, no library; only a few trading posts.
There was no supermarket, so Hull did her shopping in Albuquerque,
planning family meals six weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first year, there was no TV . . . we had to make our own
fun,'' Hull said. ``We had more time to really enjoy each other, I
think, than I ever had, before or since.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull's time in Chinle offers a striking image of the governor as
a gritty frontier woman. But it doesn't square with the portrait
being painted by some detractors in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, they say that Hull is out of touch and over her head,
and being led around by her staff. As evidence, they point to an
excessive number of vetoes (21) last session and a breakdown in
communication with the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   As Hull, 64, begins her third year as governor, lawmakers are
grumbling that the real power is held by Hull's chief of staff,
Rick Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she got sick last year . . . you saw a change,'' said
state Rep. Sue Gerard, R-north central Phoenix. ``Rick did gain
more power, and she did become more isolated. It became harder for
us to talk to her independent of Rick.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the capitol, the whispers have started. Has the Iron Lady
started to rust?
</P>
<P>
   Hull and her staff laugh off such claims. She says Collins takes
most of the flak, because that's his role as chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually too involved in too many things,'' Hull said. ``I
micromanage around here more than we would like. Everybody blames
it on Rick. It's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the office, Hull doesn't stand on ceremony. She sometimes
answers her own phone and gets her own coffee and is still
embarrassed when staff members rise when she enters a room.
</P>
<P>
   She's not much of a public speaker, actually more of a public
reader, as evidenced by her recent State of the State speech, which
was described by one catty observer as ``almost lifelike.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that Hull was speaking to a somewhat hostile
Legislature, including people who want to teach gun safety in
public schools, but don't care whether kids fall out of the back of
pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hull tried to entertain them a little, with a tame joke
or two. The speech's solitary attempt at statesmanship _ a Latin
phrase _ fell flat when Hull mangled it.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the spotlight, Hull is quick-witted and engaging. She
reminds one of former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole,
whose singular wit never translated in big rooms.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Hull met with the media after her state
address, she ribbed one reporter for appearing to sleep through the
speech. &QL; 
A parent's patience Hull also exhibits the patience of someone who
has raised four children and taught thousands more. After 21 years
in public office, she boasts, ``I usually can get along with
everybody and anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor gently notes that she has turned the emphasis back
to helping people. She's proud of programs such as KidsCare, which
provides health insurance for the children of the working poor, and
Students FIRST, a plan to fix dilapidated school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   And Hull has another advantage over her predecessor, Fife
Symington. Her staff members aren't preoccupied with keeping their
boss out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   As for her dust-ups with the Legislature and House Speaker Jeff
Groscost, R-Mesa, Hull is puzzled. She spent 14 years in the House,
including two terms as speaker, so she knows how the Legislature
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem understanding why they just don't pick up the
phone and call me, at night or at home or whatever,'' Hull said.
``Because I've known a lot of them for a long time. And some of
them have said, `But you understand, you're now the governor, and
we can't do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Hull remains immersed in affairs of state,
attending meetings, taking work home, even e-mailing staffers in
the wee hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does her homework,'' said Collins, waving a handful of
bureaucratic minutiae that Hull will inevitably want to see. ``I
guess that's the schoolteacher in her.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both the governor and Collins acknowledge that Hull's
hospital stay in March started tongues wagging. Was Hull gravely
ill? Could she still govern? Would she serve out her term?
</P>
<P>
   The illness gave an opening to Hull's enemies to undermine her
in a way that goes far beyond making fun of the governor's big hair
or knocking her for talking about curlers.
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad that at one point, Collins was denying rumors that
Hull had a fatal liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   Hull admits she is sick _ sick of hearing about the issue. To
muzzle the gossip, Hull granted a reporter an interview with her
physician, Dr. Anita Murcko.
</P>
<P>
   Murcko said Hull was hospitalized with a serious kidney
infection. It started in the urinary tract and reached Hull's
bloodstream, but it did not advance to the more serious condition
of toxic shock.
</P>
<P>
   In typical Hull fashion, she tried not to create a fuss, walking
the short distance from her doctor's office to Good Samaritan
Regional Medical Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked over because she didn't want to alarm her security
guards,'' Murcko said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was treated with intravenous antibiotics and suffers no
lasting effects. She takes medication for arthritis and a thyroid
condition, and Murcko describes her as very healthy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rumors, Hull cracked, ``I keep saying they're jealous
because I've lost weight.''
</P>
<P>
   They also might be jealous of Hull's knack for always being in
the right place at the right time. Hull never has to run that hard.
The ball always comes right to her.
</P>
<P>
   She's the Silver Surfer of Arizona politics, riding a wave of
serendipity to the top of state government.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to the House in 1979, Hull made headlines in 1982 by
suggesting that the state could save money by allowing the swamp
coolers at the Perryville prison to fall into disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the swamp coolers will break down,'' she said. ``That
might get rid of some of our prison population.''
</P>
<P>
   As majority whip in 1987-88, Hull became the de facto majority
leader, filling in for an ailing Jim Ratliff. In 1989, she landed
in the speaker's chair after Joe Lane was ousted by voters angry
over Lane's role in the impeachment of former Gov. Evan Mecham.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was known as a no-nonsense speaker who kept her fellow
Republicans in line, never hesitating to bonk a fews heads if need
be. While speaker, she earned two nicknames _ ``Iron Lady'' from
her supporters and ``Dragon Lady'' from her enemies _ and weathered
the AzScam public corruption scandal, which led to criminal charges
against several legislators.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Hull inherited the Governor's Office from Symington,
who was forced out after being convicted of bank fraud. Symington's
conviction has since been overturned. Hull ran for re-election in
1998 and won by a wide margin. &QL; 
Shaky public relations
</P>
<P>
   Despite her long experience in state government, Hull is off to
a shaky start, at least as far as public relations go.
</P>
<P>
   When news leaked last year that the state was ordering a
14-year-old to have an abortion, Hull appeared to waffle.
</P>
<P>
   First, she said there was little the state could do. But as
public pressure mounted, Hull reversed field, calling on state
Attorney General Janet Napolitano to appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Hull took a bum rap in that case, which would be
clear when the records are made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was going this path until a document was set down in front
of her face, from a psychiatrist, that was contradictory to the
route she was going,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull also got some bad press for her push to install cable
barriers on Valley freeways. After several people were killed in
head-on collisions, Hull told the state Department of
Transportation to study the barriers.
</P>
<P>
   After a friend, former state legislator Polly Getzwiller, was
seriously injured in a similar crash, Hull cut the study short and
ordered the department to install the barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said her decision was not linked to the accident involving
Getzwiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a nice lady, and I know her . . . and some day we have
to find out if she's ever gotten out of the hospital,'' Hull said. &QL; 
Power struggleWhether Hull blows with the wind or not, one thing is
certain: She faces a Legislature that borders on insurrection. Some
lawmakers are upset because they didn't see Hull's vetoes coming
last session.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first I heard of it, a reporter called me,'' said Sen. Tom
Freestone, R-Mesa, an amiable ex-wrestler and fixture in Maricopa
County politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Guess what, Freestone. Your bill just got
slaughtered' . . . I was caught flat-footed.''
</P>
<P>
   Freestone, whose open-meetings bill should survive this session,
said he understands why legislators bristled at the vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like working through the whole season raising
crops, then you find out you had a tornado come through and destroy
everything,'' Freestone said.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, lawmakers may take the fight with Hull a step
further. In a move that smacks of bravado, they have hinted about a
``veto session'' _ reconvening to revive any bill struck down by
Hull.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about power, says Groscost, who believes Hull vetoed a
number of bills to re-establish control of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure some of it was aimed at making sure she sent a
message to legislators who disagreed with her,'' Groscost said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In her mind, she tried to show that she was in charge and in
fact people better listen to what she had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Marc Spitzer, R-north-central Phoenix, said Hull had
good reasons behind her vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she vetoed bills for fun,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Hull says the vetoes were all about policy, not
payback. Most of them involved bills that called for spending
beyond the current budget, or bills that cut into the power of
state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Hull's disagreements have been with Groscost, who
clearly loves stirring the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Although they hail from the same party, Hull and Groscost
couldn't be more different. Hull is a member of the old guard, a
moderate, a grandmother and a Catholic. Groscost is a young turk, a
staunch conservative and a Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost sometimes sports the demeanor of a used car salesman,
but he's no dummy. He understands how to consolidate power and hold
it, and he lives for political gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Widening the rift, Hull chose to back Texas Gov. George W. Bush
for president, while Groscost and most other state Republicans are
pushing Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Groscost has baited Hull at every turn. He invited
National Rifle Association President Charlton Heston to address the
House, despite the governor's moderate position on guns.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, he held a downtown fund-raiser featuring skits
lampooning Hull.
</P>
<P>
   In a tribute to understatement, Hull said she was
``disappointed'' in the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you respect the governor or not, respect the office,''
Hull said. ``The fund-raiser and the singing, those things are not
a respect for the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull has also taken criticism for letting her various policy
experts lobby the Legislature, meaning her office doesn't speak
with one voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problem is, all of her staff people are real technocrats . . .
they don't know politics,'' Gerard said. ``Because Rick (Collins)
is so authoritarian or totalitarian, they can come down and talk to
us, but they have no authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Last session, Gerard and Collins stopped playing nice and
started kicking sand in each other's faces.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the session, Gerard sent Collins a box of
chocolates as a make-up present. Collins sent it back. So there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had accused me of not being truthful and questioning my
integrity . . . that's the kind of thing that happens in the heat
of battle,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little out of line in sending it back.''
</P>
<P>
   This session, Hull has taken steps to open the lines of
communication between her office and the Legislature, in part by
naming aide Jaime Molera as chief lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the governor smiles when legislators say they want a
return to the Symington administration, when one lobbyist, Barry
Aarons, did most of the governor's talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all want Barry Aarons back . . . every one of those
people had said, `Get Barry Aarons out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull admits she takes a different tack with lawmakers than
Symington did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like that style of having one person go down there and
twist their arms, twist their necks,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull also ran into trouble with the Legislature during
December's special session to replace the dilapidated state mental
hospital. Hull called the session, only to watch her proposal die
in a committee. &QL; 
A new session
</P>
<P>
   But things improved when the regular session started. One of the
first acts was passage of a bill to provide $80 million for a new
state mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Hull's legislative troubles have to do with term limits
and the current leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In another environment, Senate President Brenda Burns,
R-Glendale, might be able to play peacemaker between Groscost and
Hull, but Burns has troubles of her own.
</P>
<P>
   For one, she faces the challenge of running the Senate with a
one-seat (16-14) Republican majority. On top of that, she may not
be able to hold on to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Due to term limits, Groscost must leave the House next year and
probably will run for the Senate, where he and pal Rusty Bowers, a
Republican senator from Mesa, could form a cabal to oust Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the hubbub, Hull probably will find a way to
survive, just as she did in Chinle years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Allen, a Navajo registered nurse who befriended the Hulls,
said there's just something about Jane.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very resourceful to find things to do, and get
acquainted,'' Allen said. ``That's what Jane did . . . She was a
very easygoing person, very outgoing. She doesn't just sit back and
wait for people to come to her.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Hull will not write off the Legislature. She will not give
up. She'll crack her jokes, make her phone calls, do her homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing to me is that I leave a legacy that
says the state of Arizona is better for my five years of being
governor,'' Hull said. &QL;

LSU SCIENTISTS COOKING UP A SUPER RICE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(Attn: La, Ark., Mo., Texas, Calif.)  By CATHERINE HOLLINGSWORTH   
 New York Times Regional Newspapers   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To hear a rice researcher tell it, the latest
breakthroughs in genetically engineered rice could offer a kind of
cure-all for crop disease, pests, weeds and a host of other
problems outside the realm of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be able to tailor rice to do a lot of things,''
said Steve Linscombe, a scientist at Louisiana State University's
Rice Station in Crowley. ``It's going to be a plus for farmers as
well as consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, crop scientists have figured out a way to add vitamin A
and beta carotene to rice, offering more nutrition to nations where
rice is a staple.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, researchers at the LSU Rice Station hope to market a rice
that is resistant to six different herbicides. This development
could reduce herbicide use in U.S. rice farming by 98 percent, LSU
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic effects of this new strain of rice may
be on planting methods, which are centered around a stubborn weed
known as red rice.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, farmers where red rice is a problem must rotate crops
between rice and soybeans, a less profitable crop. The rotation is
necessary to stop the red rice from taking over the rice paddy. In
the future, growers will be able to stick with a rice crop
year-to-year.
</P>
<P>
   They will finally have a mild herbicide that can kill red rice,
a close cousin of white rice, without killing some of the main
crop. They can cut down on water costs, too, since the new rice
will not require as much flooding. That in turn will reduce
infestations of the rice water weevil.
</P>
<P>
   Linscombe called this advance a ``very important mechanism for
increasing agriculture production.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, though is enthusiastic about genetically enhanced
crops.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Federation of America is especially leery of
enhancements that provide more direct benefits for farmers than the
general public. In addition, it wants tougher standards for
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Tucker Foreman, head of the federation's Food Policy
Institute and former assistant secretary of agriculture, said the
federal approval process for these products needs to be revamped in
this emerging field of science.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these products will continue to be suspect until there
is a rigorous approval process to ensure human safety,'' she said.
Part of the federal process is voluntary, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   But, she does not doubt the potential benefits of some of these
products. ``I happen to be one of these people who wants to see
these products move ahead,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The LSU researchers said the herbicide-resistant rice could be
ready for market as early as 2001 if it is approved.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hensgens, president of the Southern Seedsmen's
Association and vice president of G &AMP; H Seed Co. in Crowley, La.,
said he is comfortable with the advances in genetically altered
rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is changing our business and it's changing our business
rapidly,'' he said. He looks forward to the day when genetically
enhanced food will be the ``norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Hensgens said, however, he could understand why the public might
be concerned: ``It's been altered and you're giving it to me?,'' he
said, playing the role of consumer. He advocates more carefully
worded labeling.
</P>
<P>
   Similar genetic enhancements have been present in milk and corn
products for years. With rice grown only on 3.5 million acres
nationally, the investment in genetic research has reached this
crop more slowly. Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Missouri and
California are the main producers.
</P>
<P>
   By splicing genes into food to enhance quality and yield
scientists can customize products according to consumer demand or
production needs. This field, known as biotechnology, is taking
agriculture into the 21st century, and rice farmers don't want to
be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Rice farmers in the United States have been suffering from a
slump in prices and are eager for ways to invigorate the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm doing, on the short term, is to help the U.S. rice
farmers get competitive,'' Linscombe said. ``But when you look at
the broad-based benefits of genetic engineering, it goes way beyond
that. We're doing this for a lot of reasons.''

</P>
<P>
   Wallraff, who was born and raised in Tucson, now lives in
Massachusetts, where she is a senior editor at ``The Atlantic
Monthly.'' In addition to reading nearly every word that goes into
nearly every issue of the magazine, she writes ``The Atlantic's''
``Word Court'' column, a clearinghouse, of sorts, for questions
about grammar, punctuation, word usage and the general health of
the English language. Her new book is based primarily on
reader-submitted questions, which she answers with an appealing mix
of common sense, research, wit and an occasional foray into
improvisation (although she would not emphasize this _ most of her
``rulings'' are based on solid advice from her dictionaries). She
also includes a ``Grammarian's Dozen,'' in which she addresses
recurring troubles such as the split infinitive or a preposition
left at the end of a clause. This is an engaging book for people
who love language and want to see it treated, if not with
reverence, at least with a little common courtesy.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MY GOODNESS'' &QL; 
By Joe Queenan (Hyperion, $21.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The word ``curmudgeon'' has been used to describe Joe Queenan
(``Red Lobster, White Trash''), but we think it is too kind. More
appropriate, perhaps, would be ``curmudgeon with fangs,'' or
``curmudgeon with occasional bouts of virulent malice.'' Either
way, he's a funny guy, except, we are sorry to say, in this book,
where he makes a tedious show of stifling his mean streak and
embracing goodness. He tries to make his newfound virtue
entertaining, but we'll bare our own fangs and say we didn't laugh
much. Far funnier is the paperback ``Confessions of a Cineplex
Heckler'' (Hyperion, $12.95), a collection of previously published
essays in which Queenan, among other exploits, shouts comments in a
dark movie theater just to see how other patrons will react, or
jumps fully clothed into the Atlantic to prove that Leonardo
DiCaprio could not have lived as long or talked as much as he did
at the end of ``Titanic.''Queenan might be hostile, but which book
do you want to read? &QL; 
 &QL; 
``ON THE REZ'' &QL; 
By Ian Frazier (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's something edgy _ dangerous, even _ about the premise of
this book: A middle-age, middle-class White man with a ponytail and
no particular leg to stand on writes about Indians, specifically
the Oglala Sioux of the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.
Indeed, Frazier begins by announcing his affinity for things
Indian, by confessing his admiration for historic Indian leaders
and wishing something ``Indian'' for himself, something traditional
``but harder to pin down.'' It's enough to make you squirm, were it
not for the immediate, disarming quality of Frazier's voice. By the
third page, you know you are not in for worshipful romance, but for
a story _ many stories _ told in a scattered but engaging way,
devoid of judgment or condescension, attentive to virtues but
unflinching in the face of trouble, all of it lifted by Frazier's
descriptive style (in winter, he says, cottonwood trees look ``as
if they had decided never to grow leaves again and were tormented
by the decision''). &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE TOP 10 OF EVERYTHING 2000'' &QL; 
By Russell Ash (DK, $17.95)
</P>
<P>
   Every year, we swear we will not do this, every year we resolve
to banish Russell Ash from our thoughts, and every year we find
ourselves sitting for an irrational amount of time with his new
book of trivia clutched in our hot little hands. This time, we
learned that the pope who served the shortest term was Urban VII
(12 days in 1590). That the first American singer to have a No. 1
hit single in the United Kingdom was Al Martino. That the longest
word in the English language is the name of an enzyme and has no
less than 1,909 letters (this sounded familiar, giving rise to the
suspicion that Ash is cribbing from his earlier books, but we
refuse to go back and check). That the world's greatest population
of pigs can be found, thankfully, in China. That the country with
the highest life expectancy for males and females is Japan (the
United States is not in the Top 10). None of this information has
staying power, of course. By the time you read it, we will have
moved on. See you next year. &QL;

 &HT;    Candidates targeting independents in New Hampshire
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERRIMACK, N.H. _ Tonight Gov. George W. Bush finds out if the
people he calls New Hampshire's ``tire kickers'' have planted both
feet on the ground, sized up the merchandise and decided to buy.
</P>
<P>
   To close the deal, Bush has been rolling from town to town in
his campaign bus, squeezing hands and gripping shoulders at
coat-and-tie Republican dinners, the occasional diner or bowling
alley and on the hushed plant floors of the high-tech companies
that are transforming the southern part of this tiny New England
state. Neck-in-neck with U.S. Sen. John McCain in most polls, he
has kept up a steady drum beat of attacks, casting McCain as a Bill
Clinton-Al Gore softy and even hauling out the big ammo _ his dad,
the former president, and his mom, the pearl-wearing,
straight-talking former First Lady, before cheering fans at a rally
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits, pollsters and political aides are predicting a tight
race, too close to call despite Bush's improved performance in
recent days. And much of the speculation is focusing on New
Hampshire's famous independents, always tough to figure out but
always important because of their numbers. They make up about 37
percent of the registered voters, outnumbering both Republicans and
Democrats, and they are free to vote in either primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley, casting themselves as
iconoclasts, have been fighting over the independents, a fight that
could work to Bush's advantage if these voters choose Bradley. But
polls show they're leaning toward McCain, while Bush is also
scrambling to win over voters in his own party _ many of whom, like
the independents, won't make up their minds until they step into
the voting booth tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is picking up undecided Republicans,'' said pollster John
Zogby, whose firm, Zogby International, is nonpartisan. ``McCain is
picking up Bradley independents. ... (Bush) should have an edge
because of organization. But McCain has passion and he's got a lot
of first-time voters and so I think, ultimately, we're looking at a
pretty close race.''
</P>
<P>
   The hand-shaking, the polls, even the family bit won't help
Cyndi Kiernan make up her mind. The 27-year-old student attends New
Hampshire Community Technical College where she is learning to
``take computers apart and put them back together again.'' She also
works at Gold's Gym in tiny Merrimack, N.H. and counts herself
among the state's approximately 275,000 independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican-leaning independent, Kiernan is trying to decide
between McCain and former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley. And Bush? She
grilled him about something that means a lot to her when he came by
the gym to work out last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that ... he would pass a law that the military could
not practice Wicca, and I'm not willing to give up my rights of
religious freedom,'' said Kiernan, who lived in Austin until 1993
while her husband, Michael, was stationed at nearby Fort Hood. `` I
like Bush. He's a very nice man. The time I spoke with him he told
me was not informed for making that statement. He still has until
November to redeem himself.''
</P>
<P>
   With Kiernan, at least, Bush is still paying for a statement he
made last year that Wicca _ whose practitioners call themselves
witches and believe in the dual deity of god and goddess _ is not a
religion and should not be practiced on military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Baker, 52, telecommunications consultant and an independent,
likes Bradley but prefers McCain because of his calls for campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little bit tougher,'' Baker said. `` It seems like he's
really going to push.''
</P>
<P>
   As is so often true in politics, the fight is also as much about
style as it is about substance. Will Bush, the party-backed
candidate with the revered parents stomp McCain, the almost
painfully direct Vietnam POW who has raised a fraction of Bush's
$68.7 million but appeals to New Hampshire's feisty streak?
</P>
<P>
   At a McCain town hall meeting in Exeter, Republican Joan Dacy,
62, said she considered Bush but changed her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just smug and too perfectly put-out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smug,'' nodded Alma Ripel, 58, also a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't seem like a people person,'' Dacy continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I love his parents,'' Ripel said, with a broad smile.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Boulton, a truck driver and Vietnam veteran and an
independent, said he's a McCain man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a conservative strangely enough, but I like him
because he says what he believes,'' he said at a town hall meeting
in Portsmouth. ``He's more conservative than I am, especially on
abortion. I'm pro-choice. ... What really turns me off is for the
Republican Party operation to shove George Bush down my throat.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg has been a near-permanent fixture
at Bush's side, scads of Republican governors and legislators have
endorsed Bush and even former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, the
man Bush helped oust from his father's administration, gave him the
nod last week. That kind of heft has persuaded Republican Kevin
Johnston, 53, to go for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain commands a lot of respect for what he stands
for and what he's been through,'' Johnston said. ``In the long run,
I think Governor. Bush would be a better leader. You just can't
overlook the backing. You've got to vote for somebody who can get
the message to Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Bill Ayer, 72, was torn between McCain and Bush. But
the retired insurance man and substance abuse counselor said he
thinks Bush has improved since his initially uncertain performance
in debates and the slow start campaigning here. That delay got Bush
the cold shoulder in a state where voters expect politicians to
show up early and often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was initially for McCain, `` Ayer said at a 1,000-person
breakfast thrown for Bush by Republican activist John Dagostino.
``I think voting for ``W'' is more pragmatic. He sounds much more
in charge than he did initially. His reactions weren't that sharp.
He looked sort of like he was feeling his way. My projection into
his mind was that he began to realize, 'Hey, I could take these
guys.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but anything is possible in New Hampshire. Pat Buchanan
won here and is still trying to become president. Clinton lost here
and did become president. In the 11th hour, Bush's New Hampshire
fate remains in the hands of people like Gunnar and Sharon
Trenoweth, independents deciding between Bush and McCain. And with
people like Raymond Ambrogi, an undecided Republican in the same
muddle. He worries about McCain, especially the stories he's heard
about his hot temper, but he hasn't ruled him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line, I'm pretty impressed with this guy,'' Ambrogi
said after hearing McCain at a town hall meeting. ``I think he has
the edge.''

 &HT;    The good times keep rolling
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Congratulations, America, you've spent your way to
another record: the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the first day of the 108th month of an expansion that
started in March 1991, as determined by the National Bureau of
Economic Research _ official keeper of business cycle data.
</P>
<P>
   The previous record of growth without a recession was the
expansion in the 1960s, which lasted 106 months and was pumped up
in large part by spending for the Vietnam War and President Lyndon
Johnson's Great Society program.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no mainstream economist thinks the current expansion will
end in a recession any time soon. However, many believe the economy
will grow this year at a pace slower than the 4 percent recorded in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is a better than even chance that real GDP
(gross domestic product) will moderate to 3.5 percent or less, and
the unemployment rate will level out, allaying the Fed's and the
bond market's worst inflation fears,'' said chief economist David
Orr of First Union.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this outlook is because the main engine of
economic growth _ consumer spending _ shows no signs of ebbing.
Consumer spending rose 0.8 percent in December on top of a 0.7
percent November rise, even as income growth cooled from a month
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1999, personal spending rose 6.9 percent _ the
largest increase in 10 years _ after increasing 5.9 percent during
1998, the government said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are out there spending, and why shouldn't they be?''
asked Richard Yamarone, senior economist at Argus Research in New
York. ``We're at full employment and people have amassed a large
amount of money through stock market gains.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion, far from running out of steam the way most
lengthy expansions have done, has speeded up in an almost
exponential manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since mid-1995, the economy has grown at an exceptional rate,
above 4 percent per year, far outpacing its normal trend of
growth,'' said Robert E. Hall, director of the National Bureau of
Economic Research's Economic Fluctuations and Growth Program.
``Normal growth is a little over 2.5 percent per year.''
</P>
<P>
   The length of the expansion has become a puzzle for economic
theorists. According to traditional textbooks, when unemployment
drops enough, inflation starts to build, because economic demand is
exceeds supply.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in the 1990s, when the unemployment rate dropped to the
lowest point in 30 years _ 4.1 percent. Inflation, as measured by
the Consumer Price Index, remains below 2 percent, on an annual
basis.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hall, this situation has ``perplexed the Federal
Reserve Board,'' which is responsible for monetary policy and has
by all accounts been the most effective economic regulator during
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's role in controlling the economy is to regulate
interest rates, which it does indirectly by buying or selling
securities.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe the Fed is about to raise interest rates
again, possibly at a two-day meeting that begins today, because Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan has detected early signs of rising prices
on the horizon. Slowing the rate of growth by raising interest
rates would take some of the inflationary pressure off the economy,
in this view.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle for economists is two-fold: why has the expansion
lasted so long, and how much longer is it likely to last?
</P>
<P>
   Jack Guynn, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta,
attributes the expansion and accompanying low inflation to four
principal causes: consumer spending, which is by far the biggest
source of growth; business investment in computers and other
productivity enhancing equipment; the relative balance of supply
and demand factors within the economy; and, to some extent,
``old-fashioned luck.''
</P>
<P>
   The last item, which appears to have run out, included the Asian
economic crunch that flooded U.S. markets with cheap imports,
helping to keep a lid on consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
   Economists wonder how much longer the productivity factor can
continue at the present rate, and what will happen when and if it
drops back to a more normal growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   There are several recession scenarios, each of which envisions
some shock that would trigger an economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   One, which Greenspan has repeatedly talked about, is the fear
that a stock market crash, or prolonged sell-off, would take the
wind out of consumer spending, causing a recession.
</P>
<P>
   In another scenario, the Fed is so determined to keep a lid on
inflation that it raises interest rates enough to send the economy,
into a recession, or period of declining output and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these is a part of mainstream forecasts for 2000 and
early 2001, even though the Fed is expected to raise short-term
rates by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.75 percent, at the
end of its meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   According to Orr, this increase _ the fourth since June _ will
be enough to restrain the economy.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he said, ``We think it's a case of `too hot not to
cool down.''
</P>

Ga.

TV PROGRAMMING FOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS MORE BALANCED THIS YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (Resending for all needing) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's one television program airing this month that I'd
recommend without reservation, it's ``Freedom Song,'' a startling,
exceptionally well-acted examination of what happens when the civil
rights movement parachutes into a sleepy little Southern town and
engulfs it.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by real-life events and airing Feb. 27 on the cable
network TNT, ``Freedom Song'' is remarkable for what it is and
isn't _ meaning, for a production shoehorned into the Black History
Month celebration, it isn't two hours of white-on-black
victimization or a production devoted explicitly to racist violence
and black rage.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the production is noteworthy for its straightforward,
even gentle, storytelling, a coming-of-age declaration told through
the eyes of a teen-ager who can't comprehend or accept the
nonviolent techniques of his elders, particularly when they seem to
stiffen in the face of white oppressive danger.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't surprised to hear that ``Freedom Song'' was first
conceived as a feature film; nor was it shocking to learn that
executive producer, actor and activist Danny Glover, was turned
away from every major studio leery of this story's odds of
attracting not only a white audience but a sizable black one.
Networks couldn't fathom such a project, either.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, even African-Americans, weary from watching
lynchings and the psychological torture of a race that was once
deemed subhuman, have for the most part stayed away from movies
centering on the civil rights movement and even more so from slave
period pieces. (Which helps explain the box office crash and burn
of Oprah Winfrey's ``Beloved''; well, that, and a convoluted story
line.)
</P>
<P>
   Part of the blame goes to the filmmakers. Let's face it:
Television, from the big networks to the tiny cable channels, is so
hungry for black history product during February it seems that
almost anything passes the black heritage litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings often go up anyway, driven by promotions and provocative
subject matter (the Sally Hemings-Thomas Jefferson
was-it-love-or-rape? project should do just fine), so it's a
win-win situation in attracting a few more viewers than usual and
earning brownie points from that picky NAACP. Unfortunately, in the
past, most of the stuff was bad.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that some of the best TV movies with
African-American themes have aired during months other than
February and on cable _ ``Miss Evers' Boys,'' ``Dorothy
Dandridge,'' ``A Lesson Before Dying,'' for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's cable's growth or the suggestion that racial
matters are being discussed openly again (the 1998 dragging death
of James Byrd in Jasper certainly got things going here), this is
one of the more balanced months of black history progamming in
years. And it got that way without much help from the major
networks, which are increasingly concentrating on more important
sweeps battles.
</P>
<P>
   Even CBS' ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal'' (the fact that
``scandal'' is used in the title suggests the kind of viewers CBS
wants to attract) as a four-hour miniseries exploring the origins
of the controversial 38-year relationship between Thomas Jefferson
(Sam Neill) and his slave is more a dramatic serial than historical
examination.
</P>
<P>
   Sally is played by a strikingly beautiful Carmen Ejogo (every
Sally I've seen so far has been enormously gorgeous, which points
to the creators' theories that Jefferson simply couldn't help
himself), who falls for the rich and influential statesman while
working as Jefferson's maid in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Sally Hemings'' shifts back to America, Sally, now a slave,
continues the affair, giving birth to Jefferson's children, which
threatens Jefferson's presidency and wealth. The miniseries airs at
8 p.m. CST Sunday, Feb. 13, and Wednesday, Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   On cable, I recommend ``The Color of Friendship,'' about a white
South African exchange student and her black American family. The
scenes are woefully telegraphed, but it manages to sidestep a
number of cliches to deliver a subtle lecture on prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1977, ``The Color of Friendship'' is based on the true
story of U.S. Rep. Ron V. Dellums and his family, who were shocked
when a white South African showed up on their doorstep. (Director
Kevin Hooks says this actually happened twice to the family; the
first girl adapted well. The second was more entrenched in the
apartheid system, so sparks flew.)
</P>
<P>
   There are other notable programs that are listed below. Does
this signal the television industry's willingness to deal with past
injustices candidly? We'll see. No matter how painful it is to
watch TLC's ``Civil Rights Martyrs: Free at Last,'' which is about
the personal stories of those who gave their lives for the civil
rights movement, it's these cinematic efforts that will ensure that
this American Holocaust is not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs this month (all times CST):
</P>
<P>
   ``Sidney Poitier: One Bright Light, An American Masters
Special'' (8 p.m. Wednesday, PBS) _ How amazing is it that Poitier
remains the only black American to receive a Best Actor or Best
Actress Oscar? His career is defined and documented here through
interviews with Quincy Jones, James Earl Jones and Denzel
Washington, the current best bet to match Poitier in Best Actor
honors. (Washington has a Best Supporting Actor Oscar and just won
a Golden Globe for Best Actor.) Most impressive about ``One Bright
Light'' is how it uses the modern history of blacks in American
film as a nice backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Color of Friendship'' (6:30 p.m. Feb. 5, Disney) _
Inspired by true events in the life of black congressman Dellums,
this is the touching story of a friendship between two teen-age
girls _ a white South African exchange student and the black
American girl whose family has taken her in for the summer. The
South African (Lindsay Haun) is a product of the apartheid system
and views blacks as second-class citizens. The Disney film, which
is set in 1977 and targets young viewers, is moving and effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color Me Dark'' (6:30 p.m. Feb. 7, HBO) _ Fictional story of
Nellie Lee Love, a young Southern girl who moves to Chicago to
learn that even in a place where black Americans can own
businesses, shops and restaurants, racism is just below the
surface. This is part of the terrific ``Dear America'' series of
Scholastic's bestselling book series. (MORE)
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``A Storm in Summer'' (7 p.m. Feb. 6, Showtime) _ Sweet and
sentimental story about an embittered Jewish deli owner (Peter Falk
at his crusty best) who finds new hope through an unlikely
friendship with an African-American boy, played by Aaron Meeks.
Meeks plays a character who meets the deli owner through a program
for underprivileged children. Both learn about tolerance and coping
with their current stations in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civil Rights Martyrs: Free at Last'' (8 p.m. Feb. 10, TLC) _
More than two hours long, this documentary focuses on those who
gave their lives during the civil rights movement. Featured are
Medgar Evers, the Birmingham church bombing victims, Emmett Till,
and Jimmy Lee Jackson, the 26-year-old shot to death by an Alabama
state trooper while trying to protect his mother and grandfather
from state troopers during a peaceful civil rights demonstration.
His death resulted in Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous march to
Montgomery from Selma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delroy Lindo in Conversation With Charles Burnett'' (8:30 p.m.
Feb. 13, Showtime) _ Last year, Lindo interviewed Spike Lee. This
time he takes on a filmmaker just as talented but less known.
Burnett uses the African-American experience as a backdrop for his
films, but they always embrace humankind. His most mainstream
American release was ``To Sleep With Anger,'' and that was because
Danny Glover started as a storyteller/trickster who permeates the
lives of various members of a family. Illuminating, if only to get
a feel for a historical perspective on black filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Black Entertainment'' (7 p.m. Feb. 13, Showtime) _ The
struggles and triumphs of black entertainers. With Vanessa L.
Williams as host, ``It's Black Entertainment'' is segmented into
categories: dancers, divas, rock and soul, male singers, jazz and
swing, and hip-hop. What it does best, though, is show how greats
like Quincy Jones and Smokey Robinson benefited from the
experiences of legends such as Bill ``Bojangles'' Robinson and Paul
Robeson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wishing Tree'' (7 p.m. Feb. 20, Showtime) _ Alfre Woodard
stars in this production about a woman who gets to know the white
family for whom her mother worked. Effective movie with subtle
messages about racial friendship and understanding, ``The Wishing
Tree'' also stars Helen Shaver and Blair Underwood.

   ``John Brown's Holy War'' (8 p.m. Feb. 28, PBS) _ Madman,
murderer, martyr, hero? The life of one of American history's most
colorful and controversial figures is documented. Taking a ragtag
guerrilla outfit on a crusade against slavery (born out of
religious conviction, it appears), Brown led a bloody battle to end
slavery. Arguably, his execution at Harper's Ferry, Va., at the age
of 57 set off a chain of events that led to the Civil War.

   DRUGS-MEDICARE (Los Angeles) -- Medicare patients in California
who live on tight budgets complain they can't afford the
prescription drugs their doctors say they need.
</P>
<P>
   But starting Tuesday, their prescriptions will be covered by
Medi-Cal thanks to a new state law that should save millions of

   COMPUTER-STUDENTS (Los Angeles) -- Big Brother is watching CSUN
students. With classes at Cal State Northridge starting today,
students are discovering something new they'll have to buy in
addition to textbooks and notepads. General Education students are
being told they have to buy $50 hand-held computers from the campus
bookstore; the devices can keep track of their grades, their
attendance and even allow them to take multiple-choice tests. The
new technology will be a boon for instructors, but are students
concerned about being saddled with the additional cost, or the Big
Brother possibilities of the devices? By Steve Carney. (Will move

<P>
   Q -- I received an e-mail joke that was not in the best of
taste, but I wanted to forward it to a few select friends who work
here. I got distracted and somehow sent it to almost everyone. I
apologized and was reprimanded by management, but I feel like my
future here is wrecked. Is there anything that might help? C.H.
</P>
<P>
   A -- It is amazing how many e-mail jokes end up with rather
unfunny punch lines. You are fortunate that you were only
reprimanded, as the reaction in some companies to such joking
around is termination.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way of knowing for sure if you have derailed your
chances for success in this company, short of letting some time
pass and seeing what happens. It may be tempting to go to your
manager, put your cards on the table and ask if you still have a
future in the company. The problem is that doing so will keep the
incident in your manager's mind, indicate that you are still
distracted by it, and generate information of questionable value.
The odds are that he or she will not tell you if you are toast, and
even if you are told that your career with the company is still
promising, you probably will not believe it. And, importantly, if
you expect your career to go nowhere, that is precisely where it
will go.
</P>
<P>
   The best approach at this point for you is to do all in your
power to be a truly excellent employee and that is no joke.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- We were just given extremely detailed job descriptions from
the human resources director. She said that there is too much
overlap and confusion of job responsibilities, and this is the way
to end it. Most of us feel the new descriptions are too structured,
and although we have expressed this to her and to our manager, we
feel stuck. What can you suggest? R.A.
</P>
<P>
   A -- It is normal to feel stuck when dealing with a human
resources program that is stuck somewhere in the Industrial
Revolution. Although job descriptions still play a role, the whole
notion of a job is undergoing many changes in today's work place.
</P>
<P>
   Growing numbers of companies are focusing less on structured
jobs and more on the best way to organize in order to complete the
work that has to be done. Rather than designing highly detailed job
descriptions, there is more emphasis placed upon the individual
employee's knowledge, skills and abilities, and the best way to
match them with the work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Many studies are finding that this trend originated less from
the leadership of an organization, and more from large numbers of
employees who seek more flexibility, variety, and challenge in
their work, and it sounds like you are part of this group. This
means that you should meet again with management, but instead of
expressing dissatisfaction about current job descriptions, your
``job'' is to try to let them see the widespread advantages of
flexibility and increased focus on work rather than on jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- I worked on a project with one of my co-workers, and I just
heard that he has been telling people that he did all the work and
I did practically nothing. The truth is that we both worked hard,
and I am very disappointed that he is saying this. Should I
confront him or is that just lowering myself to his level? L.C.
</P>
<P>
   A -- Before diving into the mud with this individual, the first
step is to remember that at this point you are operating on
hearsay. Perhaps his comments were taken out of context, perhaps
the story was exaggerated, or perhaps nothing was said at all. In a
word, you should initially gather as much factual data as possible.
If you find that this person has been bashing you, then it is time
to say something.
</P>
<P>
   Your approach should be a conversation, not a confrontation.
Give him the facts of what you heard, and then ask him what
happened. Perhaps there is some explanation or clarification that
can put the matter to rest. However, if the first words out of his
mouth are ``Who told you that?'' the odds are that he engaged in
precisely what he is being accused of doing.
</P>
<P>
   If you determine that you were indeed a target of his
mudslinging, you should indicate that you not only want an apology
for yourself, you want it delivered to anyone who heard his
malicious comments as well. If he refuses to do so, the next stop
is your manager's office.
</P>
<P>
   Slinging mud about your co-worker is lowering yourself to his
level, but defending yourself is not.

RUSSIANS REJECT U.S. ARGUMENT FOR MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright came here Monday
to try to convince Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, whom she has often
called her good friend, of the wisdom of a new missile defense
system for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a lengthy session of talks, she conceded she had
made little headway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can testify to the fact that it is not easy to come to a
common ground on this,'' she said, sitting beside Ivanov at a news
conference. ``We do have a different view.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Albright's senior aides was even blunter: ``We're not at
the stage where we and the Russians agree on the nature of the
threat, or what to do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright was once again explaining to the Russians that the
Clinton administration believes that the threat of missiles able to
hit the United States _ and Russia _ from North Korea, Iraq and
Iran, justifies amending the basic arms control treaty of the Cold
War and constructing a limited national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed the system a year ago. For the last six months,
administration officials _ in particular Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott _ have been trying to convince Russia that the
threat from the other countries is real and that the new defense
system is not intended to defend the United States against Russia.
</P>
<P>
   To put such a system into operation, the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty, which prohibits national missile defense systems,
would have to be modified.
</P>
<P>
   But as on past occasions, Ivanov was not buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been telling our American partners that the
modification of the ABM treaty might undermine the agreement,'' he
said. ``We are sure that we together could find other answers to
those threats from third countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The real test for Albright will come Wednesday when she is
scheduled to meet Acting President Vladimir Putin. It will be the
first meeting between a high-level American official and Putin
since he succeeded Boris Yeltsin, who resigned on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been plenty of speculation _ though not much
evidence _ about where Putin stands on economic issues and internal
security matters, little is known about what he thinks about arms
control _ and in particular the proposed national missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is considered likely to win the Russian presidential
election on March 26, but Clinton administration officials have
acknowledged that they do not expect any serious negotiations on
the missile defense system until after that date.
</P>
<P>
   The ``crunch time'' is likely to come between March and the
summer, when Clinton has said he will make a final decision on
whether to deploy the system, a senior administration official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the missile defense proposal is caught up
in election year politics, as the administration seeks to ensure
that the Democratic presidential nominee is not outflanked by the
Republicans on the issue of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also discussed the war in Chechnya with Ivanov, another
issue on which Americans have made little headway with the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   She repeated her arguments, she said, that the conduct of the
war against the breakaway republic is costing Russia its reputation
and isolating it from the international community. She said that
Russia's military campaign in Chechnya has had a ``tragic cost in
human lives and a high cost to Russia's world standing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the very presence of Albright on the podium with Ivanov,
after six hours of talks on a broad list of subjects, did not
appear to buttress the idea that the United States is keeping its
distance from Russia because of Chechnya.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the news conference, Albright said she had encouraged Ivanov
to reinvigorate Russia's ties with NATO, which have been basically
frozen since the war in Kosovo. At NATO's headquarters in Brussels,
Belgium, where a Permanent Joint Council was established for NATO
and Russia to discuss issues of mutual interest, the Russians have
refused since the Kosovo war to discuss matters other than Kosovo,
Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov shrugged off the argument that Russia is being hurt in
the eyes of other countries by the war in Chechnya. ``If there is
any isolation, we consider it only temporary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov gave short shrift at the news conference to a question
about whether archival records on the case of the missing Swedish
diplomat, Raoul Wallenberg, would be released.
</P>
<P>
   Wallenberg, who worked in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, for
the U.S. War Refugee Board toward the end of World War II, saved
thousands of Hungarian Jews from the Nazis. He was taken into
custody by the invading Soviet troops in January 1945 and has not
been heard of since.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and historians have pressed successive governments in
Moscow for the records that would show what happened to Wallenberg.
The case has been in the public focus once again because January
was the 55th anniversary of his disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   In a curt reply, Ivanov said that Russia had legislation
concerning archives, an apparent reference to a 1993 law making it
difficult to declassify national security materials. ``We follow
the legislation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue that Albright raised but found unresolved was the
condition and whereabouts of a Russian reporter, Andrei Babitskiy,
who has been reporting from Chechnya for Radio Liberty, a radio
station sponsored by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Babitskiy's reports have been critical of the Russian military
and have given much higher numbers of Russian casualties than the
government has acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian authorities announced several days ago that
Babitskiy had been arrested in Chechnya by the Russian military for
participating in ``illegal armed formations.'' This was an apparent
reference to Babitskiy's contacts with Chechen fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov complained at the news conference about what he called
the lack of objectivity by foreign reporters covering the war and
said that Babitskiy's case was in the hands of Putin. He added that
a decision on the reporter would be made soon.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had been informed that
Babitskiy, who was not carrying official Russian government
accreditation when he was arrested, was being held in a Russian
jail somewhere in Chechnya. Monday night, there were indications
that Babitskiy would be brought to Moscow, an administration
official said.

DRAWING ATTENTION: LEWITT'S GIANT PAINTINGS ADD A SPLASH OF
COLOR  TO MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Art being sent to NYT photo clients.)  
 By JESSE HAMLIN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Somebody once asked Sol LeWitt, the conceptual
artist who began making wall drawings in the 1960s, who started the
wall-drawing thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be those cave people,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's how Joe Watanabe tells the story. He's the guy
directing the draftsmen now painting a pair of giant LeWitt
drawings on the atrium walls at the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art, where ``Sol LeWitt: A Retrospective,'' opens February 19.
</P>
<P>
   It pleases Watanabe that they're using an acrylic paint called
Lascaux _ named for the French caves where Cro-Magnon painters made
potent images of animals. It's just a coincidence that LeWitt
picked Lascaux, a Swiss paint whose rich color and pigment he
preferred to the other brands he and his crew experimented with.
But it's a coincidence Watanabe finds ``very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   A printmaker by training, Watanabe has overseen the physical
creation of many LeWitt works since the 1970s. At SFMOMA, he's
directing the work of some 20 artists and art students making 46
LeWitt wall drawings in paint, ink or pencil. The artist's first
major retrospective since 1978, the show will also include
structures, photographs, books and works on paper.
</P>
<P>
   The museum commissioned LeWitt to create two 29-by-32-foot works
in the vast, light-filled atrium, one on either side of the central
black-granite stairway. They're huge, but not LeWitt's biggest: At
Atlanta's High Museum of Art, he created a six-panel piece that was
nearly 80 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Here, working on 40-foot scaffolding that was erected at 3 a.m.
a few Sundays ago, four painters are executing LeWitt's giant
rainbow-colored drawings. The pieces, which the artist conceived
after visiting the museum a few months ago, are adaptations of the
gouaches LeWitt painted for the cover of the exhibition catalog.
</P>
<P>
   One side consists of four black-framed panels filled with arcs,
each set running in a different direction; the other has four
black-framed panels of stripes _ one vertical, one horizontal and
two panels of diagonals in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer of conceptual art, LeWitt has always focused on the
idea; the physical object is the manifestation of the idea, and who
actually makes it is unimportant as long as it's done right. That's
the job of Watanabe and the artists LeWitt hires to produce the
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not an artist. I am basically an extension of Sol's
hands,'' says Watanabe, 53, a Tokyo native who owns a print shop in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has only two hands. If he has me to do certain things, then
he can do more things at the same time. Then I always have
extensions,'' he says, motioning to the crew, ``and they have
extensions, too, people from San Francisco to help them. So Sol's
hands are, let's say, 20 feet in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Taped to the wall are photocopies of LeWitt's schematic
drawings, simple pencil sketches showing the design of the pieces
and the color of each band: ``P'' for purple, ``G'' for green,
``O'' for orange and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The painters _ Dutch artist Wim Starkenburg, the New York-based
Norwegian painter Thomas Ramberg and San Francisco artists Andy Cox
and Susan Dopp _ have translated LeWitt's little hand-drawn lines
into 15-foot red, blue and yellow stripes.
</P>
<P>
   But before they could begin, the walls needed a coat of
oil-based primer, then three coats of white latex paint. ``The
walls have to be really smooth,'' says Kent Roberts, the museum's
director of exhibition design. His staff also also prepped walls on
the fourth and fifth floors where LeWitt's work will be installed.
``They had to be painted cross-hatched, because (LeWitt) doesn't
want any lines to show through.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve the uniform look LeWitt wants, the painters often
switch position on the scaffolding. The goal is to create bands of
pure color with no gestural marks, ``very bright and very
plastic,'' Watanabe says, ``like a brand-new car body.''
</P>
<P>
   LeWitt usually likes the finished pieces when he sees them,
Watanabe says, but sometimes he doesn't. When that happened at a
museum in the Midwest, LeWitt hired a new crew and redid the whole
piece.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it's working very nicely here,'' says Watanabe. ``It's
satisfying that Sol LeWitt formula.''
</P>
<P>
   That formula for making art, as Watanabe calls it, derives from
LeWitt's way of ``bringing up the essence of the visual world,
seeing the world as lines _ straight lines, broken lines, and the
directions of those lines. (Then) there's the color and the
location in space. The combination of all that, somehow, attracts
the human mind very strong ly.''
</P>
<P>
   The genius of LeWitt, Watanabe adds, is that in ``using one
idea, he comes up with so many different results as individual
works. ... I like this piece very much. It delights me.''
</P>
<P>
   Starkenburg, who lives outside Amsterdam, is an abstract painter
who has worked on several major LeWitt installations, the first in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I compare it often to music,'' says Starkenburg, 53. ``Sol is
the the composer and we are the musicians. We're playing with
colors.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ramberg, 26, the job depends on his ability to conceive the
piece in his mind and focus on drafting it precisely.
</P>
<P>
   He takes pleasure in ``how simple it is in its essence,
(although) it's a complex piece. There are different coherences,
reminiscences of different kinds of systems, different levels of
logic. It's a play; it's like a puzzle. But it doesn't go one way,
it's sort of circular. There are always surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   He also likes the way these LeWitts play off the architecture,
the visual rhythm of the color bands in counterpoint with the
various striped forms throughout the atrium: the granite stairway,
the wooden walls and ceiling, the steel framing in the huge
elliptical skylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in a very interesting dialogue with this room,'' Ramberg
says. ``It's very musical in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will have plenty of time to check out the groove. The
LeWitts will stay on the atrium walls indefinitely.

TEN PASSENGERS SURVIVE KENYA AIRWAYS CRASH IN THE IVORY COAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By IAN FISHER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Ten of the 179 people aboard survived the crash
of a Kenya Airways flight on Sunday night in the Ivory Coast,
airline officials said Monday as friends and relatives waited for
word with a mix of hope and dread.
</P>
<P>
   Ousmane Niangadou, a boutique owner here, went to a hotel that
is the airline's crisis center with a piece of paper that had three
names written in pencil. One, Hadji Kamara, a business partner of
Niangadou from Gambia, survived. But there was no news on
Niangadou's two brothers, Kaddde, 32, and Mamadou, 30, whom he
dropped off at the airport here, where the flight began, on Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their names are not on the list of survivors,'' Niangadou
said, skeptical about whether they might have survived but not
completely giving up hope.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was much the same in Lagos, the destination of the
plane in Nigeria, where many of the passengers lived, news reports
said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members wept after airline executives read a list of
survivors. A U.S. Embassy official here confirmed that at least one
American had been killed, an agronomist based in Nairobi who was
originally from Boston. The official said it was possible that a
second American man might have died.
</P>
<P>
   Monday in the Ivory Coast, rescue workers trawling the swift
currents off the capital, Abidjan, nearly 3,000 miles west of
Kenya, said that they had found 74 bodies. Airline officials said
they had recovered pieces of the Airbus A310 that crashed into the
Atlantic shortly after takeoff from Abidjan, just after 9 p.m. on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The technical director for Kenya Airways, Steve Clarke, said the
black box and cockpit flight recorder had not been found. Those
could provide vital clues about what caused the crash, which Clarke
said remained a mystery. It was the first crash for Kenya Airways
since its founding in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comment on what happened at this stage,'' he said at a
news conference here late Monday afternoon. ``We must let the
investigation take its rightful course.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 survivors, he said, one was reported to be in
intensive care. But Clarke warned that airline executives
themselves were having trouble obtaining information because of
Kenya's limited telephone system. Apart from the names of the 11
crew members, all of whom were killed, the line has not released
the names of the dead, except to say that they were from more than
20 countries, most in Africa and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 431 took off about noon. But it could not land because of
haze and poor visibility, Clarke said. The conditions were caused
by the ``harmattan,'' a seasonal wind from the deserts of North
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed in Abidjan instead, and took on several
passengers bound for Nairobi, putting the total on board at 168
passengers and 11 crew members. The plane took off at 9:05 to try
again to land in Lagos. Airport officials said the plane was
airborne for not much longer than a minute when it crashed,
breaking into many pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't quite balanced, and the next thing we knew we were
in the water,'' a survivor, Samuel Ogabade Adje, a Nigerian, told
The Associated Press in Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
   It was only on Friday that Kenya Airways announced that it would
invest $750 million over five years to improve its operations and
would replace its four Airbus jets with Boeing 737s. Clarke said
the reason was not that the Airbuses were too old, but that newer
jets have better entertainment systems and are more comfortable. He
said the jet that crashed was in good shape and had undergone a
routine but rigorous service check three days before the crash. The
airline bought it new in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, Kenya Airways set up a crisis center at the
Hotel Intercontinental in Nairobi and staffed it with psychiatrists
and counselors. Those experts have had considerable experience in
dealing with crises in recent years. Some also tended to victims'
families and survivors of the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in August
1998 and to families of people aboard an Ethiopian Airlines jet
that was hijacked and crashed in 1996.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The paranoia is right there, on tape, in the voice of
a young woman about to be interviewed by a writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to do something,'' she says apologetically. Then she
rattles off a series of clipped questions: ``Do you work for the
government? Are you a police officer? Are you in the military? Are
you, let's see, FBI? CIA?''
</P>
<P>
   She is the first of many voices in ``Another American: Asking
and Telling,'' Marc Wolf's one-man play at the Theater at St.
Clement's about gays in the military, which opened to positive
reviews in December.
</P>
<P>
   There are 18 characters, all performed and written by Wolf.
Reviewing the show in The New York Times, Sarah Boxer called Wolf
``a brilliant sketch artist'' whose play ``offers long sad stories,
wild rants and sensual narratives.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Wolf didn't so much write the play as construct it.
Working in the style of the monologuist Anna Deavere Smith, author
of ``Fires in the Mirror'' and ``Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992,''
which were taken verbatim from interviews, Wolf spent three years
interviewing more than 150 current and former servicemen, military
officials, family members of slain servicemen, politicians and
academics.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews yielded some 400 hours of tape, a maxed-out
credit card and something close to a psychiatric obsession. He
slowly chipped away at his ``big piece of rock'' until he had an
hour and 45 minutes of remarkably topical theater in both dramatic
style and subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   Several documentary-style plays will be staged this spring. In
March Ms. Smith's latest piece, ``House Arrest,'' culled from four
years of interviews and observations of characters associated with
the Clinton administration, opens at the Public Theater. Next month
Moises Kaufman will direct the world premiere of ``The Laramie
Project'' in Denver, a result of his ensemble's interviews of
citizens of Laramie, Wyo., where Matthew Shepard, a gay college
student, was beaten to death in 1998. It is expected to get a New
York production this year.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its dramaturgical technique, ``Another American'' has a
lucky sense of political timing, opening and playing just as the
issue of gays in the military emerged from a long hibernation to
become a presidential campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf vows he did not plan it this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started this, people were like, `Why are you working on
this now?''' he said with a laugh. ``They were saying, `Why didn't
you write this in '93?'''
</P>
<P>
   The piece's news sense is especially keen considering that Wolf,
an actor who had never written a play before, began the project in
1996, when few wanted to talk about it. The impetus came from a
role Wolf had performed the year before, that of Peter Bergson,
whose personal mission during World War II was to draw attention to
the Nazi massacre of European Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to compare this to the Holocaust, but what I learned from
that character was that when you silence people, you create an
environment where they can be destroyed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though his spirit was willing, Wolf said, his method was weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what questions to ask, what was the best tape
recorder to use, how should I transcribe it,'' he said. ``So I had
to make all of that up myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had to overcome a sense that he was on a quixotic
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first drove down to Washington, D.C., I was thinking,
`This is the dumbest thing I've ever done in my life,''' he said.
``Nobody knows what I'm working on yet. I was spending my own
money. And I was going to talk to a guy at the Brookings
Institution.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling persisted and intensified when he began to invest
in airplane tickets. ``Then I felt really dumb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What he found, however, was an enormous reservoir of untapped
stories, both funny and solemn. Many are told in ``Another
American,'' including the story of a mother whose enlisted son was
beaten to death in Japan, and a Vietnam recruit nicknamed Mary
Alice whose combat skills included a knack for sprucing up his
unit's bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said he was immediately confronted with the intense
paranoia that the issue of gays in the military inspires. Scores of
his interviewees refused to allow Wolf to tape them despite the
promise of anonymity, and several retracted their permission to use
the stories for fear their identities would be discovered even with
no names attached.
</P>
<P>
   He also found intense fear of discovery, a fear, he says, that
rubbed off. To protect his subject's location, he said he would
often use his parent's car to travel and paid for many transactions
in cash. He sometimes left without telling anybody where he was
headed, and on his return would be vague about where he had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought I was becoming a little crazy,'' Wolf said.
``But people had to trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the need for secrecy, Wolf says, he was also struck by
the enormous patriotism of his subjects. ``The people I interviewed
love their country,'' he said. ``And they love the military. That's
why it's a complicated thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That complexity is reflected in the play's approach to its
subject. While certainly sympathetic to the plight of gay
servicemen, ``Another American'' also fleshes out the rationale and
passions behind those who oppose a military that openly accepts
gays.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf says his play is about ``how America stereotypes the
military community as much as it does the gay community.'' He
added, ``You don't have to be a bigot or a terrible person to have
some rational reasons'' for opposing gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf says he has yet to be confronted by an audience member who
feels the play does a disservice to the military, but he says he
has been scolded by several gay activists who feel he's ``not
hitting the military hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf performed a slender version of the play in early 1998, just
five monologues, at Dixon Place, then on the Lower East Side _
``the most nervous I've ever been'' _ and later mounted a workshop
production at the Provincetown Repertory Theater in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In New York the piece is being presented by the New Group in
association with David Marshall Grant, another actor who has
recently tried his hand at play writing, scoring a critical hit
with ``Snakebit.''
</P>
<P>
   Having used so little of his reams of material, Wolf is
pondering what to do with it all. A book is a possibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of secrecy also persists. He was careful with his
subject's identities in an interview, offering only as many details
as the play itself provides.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf was even more protective with his dramatic secrets: the
only time he turned off a reporter's tape recorder was when he
revealed his play's ending.

BRITISH COURT UPHOLDS DECISION TO RELEASE PINOCHET
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A High Court judge issued a tough-worded judgment
Monday supporting the British government's decision to release Gen.
Augusto Pinochet and let him return home to Chile, but Belgium held
up any final action by lodging an appeal against the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw had said on Jan. 11 that he was
inclined to set the 84-year-old former Chilean dictator free
immediately because of his deteriorating health but would await the
outcome of any legal objections before issuing a definitive order.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's ruling, Judge Maurice Kay turned down appeals from
six human rights groups and the Belgian government contesting the
British government's finding that Pinochet is medically unfit to
stand trial on torture charges.
</P>
<P>
   But the hopes of Pinochet supporters that Kay's verdict
constituted the end of legal moves in the 15-month-old case were
dashed by Belgium, which filed its appeal Monday afternoon. It will
be heard by a panel of three High Court judges on Monday and
Tuesday of next week. Amnesty International and the five other
rights groups have until noon Tuesday to file any appeals of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Office withheld all comment on Monday's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Kay was emphatic in rejecting the arguments presented in two
days of hearings last week, saying they were ``inappropriate'' and
``utterly without merit.'' The groups had jointly protested Straw's
refusal to make public records of a medical examination of Pinochet
conducted by four British doctors that was the basis for the
findings on the general's infirm physical state.
</P>
<P>
   Kay found that Straw acted ``lawfully, fairly and rationally''
in not disclosing the medical documents. Straw had argued that to
do so would violate a pledge of doctor-patient confidentiality made
to the general before the Jan. 5 examination. ``In legal, if
somewhat peremptory terms,'' the judge said of the complainants'
request, ``it is none of their business.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge added that he was ``conscious that my decision is
unavoidably adverse to, on the one hand, people who have suffered
greatly in Chile's recent history, and, in the case of Belgium, to
a friendly state and its judicial authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's pursuers denounced Monday's ruling but did so in a
way that suggested they realized chances of judicial relief might
now be slim. Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch,
said: ``We are dismayed by Monday's decision, which is a setback
for Pinochet's thousands of victims in their quest for justice. It
is a shame that the attempt to prosecute General Pinochet for the
worst international crimes may be halted on the basis of secret
medical evidence examined behind closed doors.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its conclusion, the case has already resulted in a
fundamental change in concepts of international law to allow the
prosecution of dictators and leaders of repressive regimes by
courts in countries where the alleged abuses did not occur.
</P>
<P>
   This came about when Britain's highest court, the Law Lords of
the House of Lords, turned aside the general's claim that, under
the principle of sovereign immunity, he could not be tried for acts
committed while he was Chile's head of state, from 1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has been under house arrest in England for more than 15
months while complicated legal moves unfolded around a Spanish
judge's request that he be extradited to Madrid to stand trial on
charges of genocide, torture, kidnapping and murder in connection
with the disappearance of more than 3,000 people in the years after
he seized power in the 1973 coup that ousted President Salvador
Allende.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Baltasa Garzon, considered something of a maverick in
the Spanish judiciary, had gathered his evidence during an
investigation into the so-called dirty wars in Latin America in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 16, 1998, the general was arrested as he lay in a London
clinic recuperating from back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days later, Pinochet won his first legal battle in a
ruling by the High Court that upheld his claim to sovereign
immunity. But in the judgment that was to create the case's legacy,
on Nov. 25, 1998, the Law Lords overturned that decision, saying
that being head of state did not excuse crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The case returned to the House of Lords after one of the
original judges was found to have had an association with Amnesty
International, a party to the case. But the second Lords' decision,
on March 24, 1999, was even more assertive on the principle than
the first one, though it drastically reduced the number of charges
and narrowed their scope to torture and conspiracy to torture.
</P>
<P>
   The case then moved on to the validity of the actual extradition
order itself, which was upheld by a London magistrate last October
and is under an appeal from Pinochet's lawyers that is likely to
become moot because of Straw's expected intervention.
</P>
<P>
   In Pinochet's one court appearance, on Dec. 11, 1998, he
maintained the defiant attitude he has adopted from the beginning,
saying that he did not recognize the jurisdiction of any court
outside Chile to try him and that he was innocent of ``all the lies
of Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since Pinochet's arrest, there have been boisterous gatherings
outside the House of Lords and the downtown magistrate's court,
with supporters and opponents behind barricades angrily facing one
another down, hurling taunts and jeers and holding aloft flags and
placards with accusatory slogans and pictures of missing friends
and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For the past 14 months, the general has been living under house
arrest with his wife, Lucia, in a rented mansion in one of London's
exclusive southern suburbs. He has had periodic visits from Chilean
supporters and from backers in Britain, the most outspoken of whom
has been former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. She has argued
that, far from holding him in custody, Britain instead owes him its
gratitude for the support he provided during the 1982 Falkland
Islands war with Argentina.

&HT;     EDUCATORS FEAR MALES BECOMING AN ENDANGERED SPECIES IN
COLLEGE

   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CECILIA BALLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   High school males are increasingly less likely than females to
take college entrance exams, creating an unusual gender gap that
puts fewer men in the pipeline to college, according to recent
testing data.
</P>
<P>
   While the trend is true for all income groups, statistics show
fewer low-income males take the tests than any other group and have
fallen behind their female counterparts by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one level, that's good news that more women are going to
college, and that's partly because of more opportunities,'' said
Richard Butler, an economics professor at Trinity University in San
Antonio. ``But the real problem here is that increasingly, the
really good jobs are going to require more than a minimal high
school education.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Scholastic Assessment Test, the most widely used college
entrance exam, 52 percent of senior test-takers last year whose
parents earned $80,000 to $100,000 were female, a difference that
reflects the percentage of women in the population. But the gap
widened significantly _ 61 percent female to 39 percent male _
among students from families who earned $10,000 to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The same relationship between gender participation and
socioeconomic status appears on the American College Test, the
nation's second-most popular entrance exam.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has grown progressively worse for all income groups.
But the testing gap favoring females has widened as much as 10
percentage points for the lowest-income students in just the past
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in Texas mirrors the national numbers and cuts
across racial and ethnic lines, although African-Americans and
Hispanics are more likely to make up the lower economic groups.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reversal of the well-known gender gap. Society has come
to assume that in cases of inequality, females get shortchanged. In
some respects, that remains true.
</P>
<P>
   SAT scores, for example, continue to be significantly higher for
males than for females _ currently by 43 points _ even though girls
leave high school with higher grade-point averages.
</P>
<P>
   But the smaller percentage of males following the college track
has raised almost no eyebrows among education researchers and
received scant public attention.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the ACT and the College Board, which administers
the SAT, cannot explain the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Bolles, whose sole job is to prepare students in the
inner-city San Antonio School District for college entrance exams,
suggested this: ``It is attributable to that `cool' factor _ that
if you do well in school, it's because you kiss up and play by the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Boys, she said, don't want to be seen in that light. Yet the
explanation provides just a hint of the larger social and
educational problems that may be afflicting low-income males.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the boys? Bolles doesn't always see more females in
her SAT preparation classes. But, she said, she sees ``more who are
willing to work.''
</P>
<P>
   To Thomas Mortenson, the issue is dead serious.
</P>
<P>
   An independent researcher in Iowa, Mortenson has declared
himself a boys' crusader of sorts, trying to generate national
attention for what he feels is the ultimate casualty of the deep
educational problem highlighted by jagged SAT participation between
genders.
</P>
<P>
   Men, he notes, are now outnumbered by women in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only at the end of the educational pipeline where the
cumulative magnitude of all these differences really shows up in a
dramatic way,'' Mortenson said.
</P>
<P>
   His numbers, taken from government sources, show that in 1970,
men received 56.9 percent of the bachelor's degrees awarded by U.S.
colleges and universities. But by 1996, that figure had dropped to
44.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The National Center for Education Statistics expects that number
to plummet to 41.7 percent by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Women outnumbered men in college attendance for the first time
in 1976. And by 1982, they received more bachelor's degrees than
men.
</P>
<P>
   Of the one-fourth of U.S. high school students who don't make it
to college today, two of three are males, said Clifford Adelman, a
senior research analyst for the U.S. Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the shift reflects the gradual opening of educational
doors to women and their personal enfranchisement, an improvement
even teen-age males have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls think they have something to prove,'' said Edmund
Pedraza, 18, a senior at Jefferson High School in San Antonio.
``They didn't go through what their moms went through, but women
were discriminated against a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet women's gains don't explain the fewer men in colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``More women doesn't necessarily mean less men; however, that
started to happen,'' Adelman said. ``So you've got to ask: Where is
the decline coming from? And the analysis by income really tells
you the story. The (lower-income) guys are out doing other
things.''
</P>
<P>
   People should care, Mortenson said, because men without
education have a lower earning potential, are more likely to end up
in prison and sometimes are violent in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Census data shows workers with bachelor's degrees earned
an average of $41,579 in 1997, compared with $27,005 for those who
held only a high school diploma. Dropouts made just half what the
college-educated population earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think of what that adds up to over a lifetime,'' Butler
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the durability and longevity of spacecraft have counted
most, on long voyages to the outer planets of the sun, fortune has
smiled on American space scientists.
</P>
<P>
   There was plucky Pioneer 10, the first to reach Jupiter and then
Saturn in the early 1970s. Its five-watt radio signal could still
be heard, a decade later, as Pioneer became the first machine of
human design to leave the sun's planetary system.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Voyager 2. Cruising beyond Jupiter and Saturn, the
spacecraft survived the creakiness of old age to swing by the other
two outer giants, Uranus and Neptune, in the 1980s. Looking back,
Voyager 2 was still able to take a family portrait of the planets,
specks of light dancing around a stellar maypole.
</P>
<P>
   In the same tradition of hardihood, the Galileo spacecraft has
defied engineering's actuarial tables to complete more than four
years of orbiting Jupiter and taking in the sights of its four
major moons, each one a spectacle to the eye and a surprise to the
scientific mind.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo has transmitted stunning pictures of the more than 100
erupting volcanoes on Io, and clear evidence that Ganymede is the
only moon in the solar system to have its own magnetic field, and
data showing that an ocean may lurk below Callisto's surface ice
and, even more likely, in the depths of Europa.
</P>
<P>
   In an especially close encounter with Europa last month, the
spacecraft picked up strong signals of peculiar changes in
Jupiter's magnetic field at Europa.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most compelling evidence so far, scientists said last
week, of an electrically conducting material in Europa's
subsurface, like an ocean of salty water. Since liquid water is an
essential ingredient of life, these intriguing clues have
encouraged speculation that the first extraterrestrial life,
however simple, may be found in the seas of Europa.
</P>
<P>
   A report in the current issue of the journal Nature describes
how Jupiter's intense radiation could provide all the energy
necessary for chemical reactions to create and maintain living
organisms in a subsurface ocean, if one exists at Europa.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christopher Chyba of Stanford University proposed that in
the absence of sunlight for photosynthesis, the radiation
bombardment ``should produce organic and oxidant molecules
sufficient to fuel a substantial Europan biosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Galileo's enduring successes have been a happy surprise in view
of its early prospects, which were none too bright.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1989, Galileo took six years getting to Jupiter by a
circuitous route dictated by the power limitations at its sendoff.
The spacecraft's full capability has been hobbled by the failure of
the main antenna to unfurl and the erratic behavior of a tape
recorder. In the last year, repeated zappings from Jupiter's
intense radiation belts have damaged some spacecraft instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the spacecraft is reasonably healthy,'' said James
K. Erickson, the project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Pasadena, Calif. ``We've survived much longer than anyone
thought we would.''
</P>
<P>
   As its engineers like to say, Galileo has kept going ``well past
its warranty.'' Designed to operate two years around Jupiter, the
spacecraft was cleared in December 1997 for a mission extension of
two more years. It has now been given another lease on life,
beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the lease is problematic. Fuel for maneuvering the
craft is running low. Its gyroscopes for navigating are on their
last legs. And officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration are debating the cost-effectiveness of operating
Galileo for the full 14 additional months of operations requested
by scientists and engineers of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Their eagerness to keep Galileo going has been fed by its most
recent observations, especially those revealing the four largest
Jovian moons to be spectacularly diverse worlds. They were
discovered in 1610 by the spacecraft's namesake, Galileo Galilei,
who recognized in their orbits a kind of solar system in miniature
but had no inkling of what they looked like.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the target of most of the Galileo
spacecraft's close encounters has been Europa. Scientists wanted a
better look at this ice-covered moon, about the size of Earth's
moon. They were intrigued by the many cracks running for a thousand
miles or more across an otherwise fairly smooth crater-free
surface. The cracked landscape reminded them of broken glass
repaired by an icy glue oozing up from below.
</P>
<P>
   This and other aspects of the surface geology suggested that a
layer of liquid water could lie beneath the outer shell of ice.
Scientists reasoned that the strong tidal forces of Jupiter caused
regular expansions and contractions of Europa. The flexing is the
most likely source of the heat in the moon's interior needed to
melt a layer of water between its outer icy surface and its rocky
interior, at a depth of perhaps 60 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Such conjecture has stirred wide interest among scientists
because liquid water is one of the essential ingredients of life.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 3, Galileo flew within 218 miles of Europa, about the
altitude that space shuttles often maintain above Earth and close
enough for detailed observations by the spacecraft's magnetometer.
</P>
<P>
   Europa lies within Jupiter's magnetic field, which changes
direction in the vicinity of Europa every five and a half hours.
This fluctuation can drive electrical currents in a conductor, like
an ocean of salt water.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo, scientists reported, detected the kind of magnetic
disturbances that would be predicted if the Jovian magnetic-field
variations had produced an electric current through a conductor on
Europa. Rock and solid ice are poor electrical conductors, but a
salt-water ocean would be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these findings tell us that there is indeed a layer of
liquid water beneath Europa's surface,'' Dr. Margaret G. Kivelson,
a geophysicist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said
two weeks ago. ``I'm cautious by nature, but this new evidence
certainly makes the argument for the presence of an ocean far more
persuasive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Kivelson stood by her statement.
``Nobody I've talked to has come up with a challenge to this
interpretation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kivelson said that if the full Galileo mission extension was
approved, the magnetometer would be looking to see whether this
same type of phenomenon occurred on Ganymede, which is the largest
moon in the solar system and is even larger than the planet
Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the spacecraft discovered that Ganymede has its own
strong magnetic field, indicating that its core is a fluid metal,
which boils in a way that generates the magnetism and also heats
other parts of its interior.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising to scientists are the hints that Callisto, the
outermost of the largest Jovian moons, may also have a subsurface
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Callisto does not appear to have an undifferentiated interior
with a dense core and other distinct layers. Nor is it subject to
the same flexing tidal forces that heat up the closer moons. But
the Galileo magnetometer has observed that Callisto seems to cause
the same kind of changes in the Jovian magnetic field as those
detected at Europa.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the current issue of Scientific American, Dr.
Torrence V. Johnson, the Galileo chief scientist, wrote: ``Somehow
Callisto must be hot enough to support an ocean but not so hot that
light and heavy materials separate. The water layer might be
sandwiched between a radioactively heated interior, where
convection keeps the material mixed, and a thin icy shell, where a
different convection cycle cools the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Flight controllers did not dare send Galileo into the blizzard
of Jovian radiation surrounding Io, the innermost of the major
moons, until all other mission objectives had been accomplished.
For all they knew, the radiation bombardment would disable or
destroy the spacecraft. But scientists had to get a closer look at
the churning forces of Io, which the two Voyagers had discovered to
be the most volcanically active body in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo's first flyby, at a distance of 380 miles in October,
produced sharp pictures of Io's pizza-pie surface of brown, red and
yellow minerals; red-hot flows of lava at temperatures of 2,700
degrees; collapsing mountains, and fulminating volcanoes, more than
100 of them spewing lava and venting vapor plumes miles into space.
Scientists found Io to be an even more explosive fire-and-brimstone
place than they previously suspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Io makes Dante's Inferno seem like another day in paradise,''
said Dr. Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona in Tucson, a
member of the Galileo photo analysis team.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo survived the encounter, but not without some radiation
hits causing erratic performance of spacecraft electronics. More
than a month later, on Thanksgiving Day, the spacecraft was sent
even closer to Io, 186 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Blasted even harder by radiation, Galileo automatically turned
off its cameras and science instruments to protect them. Flight
engineers quickly radioed commands to take the craft out of this
safe mode and give it new operating instructions, including
software ``patches'' to work around damaged components and
unscramble garbled picture data.
</P>
<P>
   One spectacular picture caught a fiery fountain of lava shooting
more than a mile above the surface. The erupting lava was so hot
and bright, the project scientist Johnson said, that it blinded
part of the camera's electronic sensors and created a white blur in
the middle of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   While the volcanoes of Io sometimes reminded scientists of the
lava flows and pools at Kilauea in Hawaii, they are really like
nothing existing on Earth and in much of the solar system since its
formative period over four billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Io is the next-best thing to traveling back in time to Earth's
earlier years,'' Johnson said. ``It gives us an opportunity to
watch in action phenomena long dead in the rest of the solar
system.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 22, Galileo is scheduled to make one more close flyby of
Io. Two encounters with Ganymede are being planned for May and
December. Otherwise, Galileo's agenda is not clear, pending a NASA
decision on whether to go ahead with a full 14-month extension
called the Galileo Millennium Mission.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are still puzzled by the wide variations in radiation
levels in Jupiter's neighborhood. Engineers would like to fly
Galileo longer as a test of its performance in this harsh
environment. The spacecraft has already been exposed to twice the
radiation levels it was designed to withstand, and continuing study
could yield clues to improve the durability of future spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   On the drawing boards at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are plans
for a spacecraft to orbit Europa, perhaps as early as 2008, and to
use radar to probe for the ocean that may lie deep in the icy moon.

SOVERIGN BANCORP PLANS INVESTMENT BANKING GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In its latest effort to refashion itself into a
mainstream bank, Sovereign Bancorp, the Eastern Pennsylvania thrift
moving into New England, plans to launch an investment banking
group focused on capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   The move, unusual for a thrift, reflects Sovereign's desire to
be viewed as a serious competitor to FleetBoston Financial, the
region's dominant bank, and to Citizens Financial Group, the
smaller, Providence, R.I. institution.
</P>
<P>
   Under its plan, Sovereign will focus on asset securitization, or
the conversion of corporate loans and other assets into securities
that are then sold to investors. It will also offer derivatives,
hedging, and foreign exchange services. While Sovereign has no
plans to offer securities underwriting, it is considering launching
financial advisory services and a bond-trading department.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, such sophisticated services were rarely offered
by smaller banks, let alone thrifts. Typically part of larger
commercial banks, including FleetBoston, capital markets units have
become increasingly common at mid-sized banks, including Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign's expansion comes as the Wyomissing, Pa. company works
to shed further its thrift image and prove it can functionally
replace the old BankBoston as a lender to mid-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
   Following Fleet's acquisition of BankBoston last year, Sovereign
raised $1.7 billion in financing to buy nearly 300 branches from
the two banks. Sovereign, now with assets of $25 billion, will
swell to $35 billion in assets once the deal is completed later
this year, but it will still be less than one-fifth the size of
FleetBoston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of being a full-service lender these days involves having
a capital markets business,'' said James Ackor, who covers
Sovereign for Tucker Cleary. ``If you buy into what they're trying
to create, it's something that in theory would allow them to
capture more business from their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hodes, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, called 125-year-old
Sovereign's latest step ``completely consistent with their ambition
to change their profile.'' Sovereign also plans to use its new
capital markets group to help manage its own balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   A Sovereign spokeswoman said she was unable to comment on the
new group, and several Sovereign executives, including Joseph
Campanelli, who heads the bank's New England franchise, did not
return telephone calls requesting details. James J. Calla, who will
head Sovereign's capital markets unit, was not available for
immediate comment. Calla oversaw similar operations at Core States,
a regional bank now part of First Union.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign's plans were outlined in a recent company earnings
statement and detailed Monday by Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign is technically a thrift, with a large home-lending
operation, but it has broadened its portfolio in recent years to
include consumer and commercial loans. The company, which has grown
rapidly through acquisitions, has also worked to shed its thrift
image by announcing plans for an Internet bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Sovereign has also run into troubles.
</P>
<P>
   While the bank is well capitalized, its holding company, under
which the company's stock trades, has far more assets than common
stock. A lower equity-to-assets ratio can leave a company with a
thin buffer against downturns in credit cycles. With the debt
financing Sovereign used to raise money to buy the Fleet and
BankBoston branches, and the premium it paid for the outlets,
Sovereign's holding company ``has no tangible capital,'' Ackor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting some investors' doubts, the company's stock has been
on a steady decline since its high of $15.462 last April. Now at
$6.843, it has lost more than half its value.
</P>
<P>
   John Kline, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill &AMP; Partners, said the
market ``is taking a wait-and-see attitude with Sovereign.'' The
bank's New England acquisition will prove somewhat costlier than
expected. Having originally planned to close its purchase of the
Fleet-BankBoston branches this April, Sovereign has instead opted
to assimilate the outlets in three stages over spring and summer _
a move that will raise its costs by prolonging the payments on the
noninvestment-grade bonds it sold to finance its purchase of the
branches. The new schedule, reported by The Boston Globe last
month, is designed to make things operationally smoother for
Sovereign, which must integrate branches with two different
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   For its capital markets group, which will eventually include
around 15 people, Sovereign has hired a Morgan Stanley banker,
Charles Clark, to handle its securitization business.

BELGIUM APPEALING RULING RETURNING PINOCHET TO CHILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A judge cleared the way Monday for the return to Chile
of former dictator Augusto Pinochet, ruling that the Belgian
government and six human rights organizations had no right to the
medical records that the British government cited in deeming
Pinochet too ill to be extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Although a Chilean jet waited at a British airbase 20 miles
outside London to take the 84-year-old Pinochet home, his legal
odyssey may not be over. Belgium said it would appeal the ruling by
High Court Justice Maurice Kay.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has been under house arrest in a mansion just outside
London for 15 months while a Spanish judge sought to have him
extradited to face charges of torturing and killing political
opponents during his 17-year military rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the British home secretary, Jack Straw, who
last month announced he was leaning toward letting Pinochet return
to Chile on medical grounds, said Straw would not make a final
decision while there was legal action pending. Straw, who is
Britain's top law enforcement official, refused to release the
conclusions of a team of doctors who examined Pinochet, citing
patient confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Belgian government said he expected the appeal
before a three-judge panel to be heard next week, and one of
Pinochet's lawyers, Fernando Barros, said the legal process could
drag on for at least three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Belgian officials' quick announcement of their plan to
appeal, the chief lawyer for one of the six human rights
organizations that joined in seeking the medical records said he
saw little chance of a successful appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Wilder Tayler, general counsel for Human Rights
Watch, said he disagreed with Kay's ruling that neither Belgium nor
the human rights groups had any standing to demand to see the
medical records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a direct interest,'' said Tayler, who nonetheless
concluded that an appeal would likely be fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tayler and other human rights activists insisted that
Monday's ruling, and Pinochet's likely return to Chile, does not
change the legal precedent set by the case. British courts ruled
that Pinochet could not claim immunity from charges of murder and
torture because on the grounds that he was head of state at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision will not detract from the huge progress in
human rights law we've made in the last 15 months,'' said Tayler.
``It is a setback, because it allows a highly political decision to
be made in a legal process. But the principle of immunity has been
wiped away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed because we'll never know whether he is
really as ill as the home secretary says he is. But no dictator, no
torturer, will ever be able to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Tayler insisted the human rights groups were not being
vindictive. Even if extradited and convicted, Pinochet would not
face prison, because Spain does not incarcerate anyone over 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to put a sick man on trial, we want the right to
know whether he's really that sick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch was joined in the legal challenge by Amnesty
International, Justicia, the Redress Trust, the Medical Foundation
for the Care of Victims of Torture, and the Association of the
Relatives of Disappeared Persons. They argued that the medical
examination was cursory and was not carried out by specialists, and
that there was a public interest in disclosing the results.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium, which like Spain, France, and Switzerland, is seeking
Pinochet's extradition, wants to try the former dictator on behalf
of Chilean exiles who were tortured after he seized power in a
bloody coup in 1973. Spain, however, would have first crack at
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   But Kay ruled that Straw acted ``lawfully, fairly and
rationally'' by refusing to release the medical records on privacy
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Kay said he made his ruling ``conscious that my decision is
unavoidably adverse to, on the one hand, people who have suffered
greatly in Chile's recent history, and, in the case of Belgium, to
a friendly state and its judicial authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bunting, a spokesman for Amnesty International, said his
organization had not yet decided whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's too ill, he's too ill,'' said Bunting. ``We still
believe there is an issue of transparency that needs to be
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was arrested in October 1998 as he recuperated from
back surgery at a London clinic. He suffered two minor strokes last
fall and has diabetes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Eggers' new book, ``A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering
Genius,'' is part autobiography, part postmodern collage, a
novelistic ``memoir-y kind of thing'' that tells the sad, awful,
tragic story of how the author's mother and father died within
weeks of each other and how he became a surrogate parent to his
8-year-old brother, and tells it with such style and
hyperventilated, self-conscious energy, such coy, Lettermanesque
shtick and such genuine, heartfelt emotion, that the story is at
once funny, tender, annoying and heartbreaking _ an epic, in the
end, not of woe, though there's plenty of that too, but an epic
about family and how families fracture and fragment and somehow,
through all the tumult and upset, manage to endure.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of book David Foster Wallace, Frank McCourt and
Tom Wolfe might have written together if Wallace had never heard of
Thomas Pynchon, if McCourt did not grow up poor in Ireland but
middle-class in the suburbs of Chicago, if Tom Wolfe weren't the
sort of writer who wears white suits and ice-cream colored shirts
but were a 20-something slacker with a taste for shorts and
T-shirts and lots of postmodern pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   There is a self-conscious knowingness to ``Staggering Genius''
that announces itself in the book's opening pages: the story is
prefaced with ``Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of this Book,''
an extended discussion of ``the major themes of this book,'' ``an
incomplete guide'' to the book's metaphors and symbols, and a flow
chart detailing the emotional consequences of the deaths of Eggers'
parents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the book's narrative is peppered with asides that
pre-empt, in a Rothian sort of way, any criticisms the reader might
have, asides chastising Eggers for being self-absorbed and
self-pitying, for milking his family tragedy for sympathy and
attention, for cannibalizing others' lives for a book.
</P>
<P>
   Although Eggers' eagerness to continually footnote his narrative
_ like a smart-aleck kid telling you why he knows he's going to get
into trouble, so you can give him points for being clever and cute
_ can be intensely irritating, his use of pomo gimmickry does not
undercut the emotion of his story but somehow heightens it by
throwing the passages of earnest sentiment into high relief.
</P>
<P>
   We become aware that Eggers is not simply wielding high-tech
devices to create a hip, experimental narrative, but that these
self-annotating mechanisms are part of his sensibility, that they
are defensive survival tactics, like his love of hyperbole, invoked
to deal with his chaotic childhood and the horror of losing his
parents. They are part of his constitution as a writer, enabling
him to stand apart from his experiences and turn them into art.
</P>
<P>
   This is why his mother's long, slow, agonizing death elicits not
only fear and grief but also a grisly, stream-of-consciousness riff
on cancer: ``The tumor is a light tumor, empty, a balloon. The
tumor is rotten fruit, graying at the edges. Or an insects' hive,
something festering and black and alive, fuzzy on its sides.'' This
is why sickness in this book is so often made to yield sick jokes;
death, swatted away with irony and black humor.
</P>
<P>
   As Eggers lets us know through a Q-and-A session shoehorned into
the middle of the book, he grew up in Lake Forest, the monied
Chicago suburb depicted in ``Ordinary People.'' His family never
really fit in: ``We were always so oddly white-trashy for our town,
with our gruesome problems, and our ugly used cars, our Pintos and
Malibus and Camaros, and our '70s wallpaper and plaid couches and
acne and state schools.''
</P>
<P>
   His father was an alcoholic given to terrifying rages, his
mother a long-suffering martyr. Both of them were dying of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our house sits on a sinkhole,'' Eggers writes. ``Our house is
the one being swept up in the tornado, the little train-set model
house floating helplessly, pathetically around in the howling black
funnel. We're weak and tiny. We're Grenada. There are men
parachuting from the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   After the death of his parents, the 21-year-old Eggers and his
little brother, Toph, move out to Berkeley, Calif., to be near
their elder sister, Beth. The two orphans set up housekeeping as
father and son. Eggers attends Toph's Little League games with all
the other boys' parents; he fantasizes about picking up women at
the school's open house. On the odd occasion that he leaves the
house for a date, he worries that the baby sitter will murder his
brother, that something terrible _ basically whatever his ``wild,
horror-infested imagination'' can concoct _ will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Of Toph, he writes: ``His brain is my laboratory, my depository.
Into it I can stuff the books I choose, the television shows, the
movies, my opinion about elected officials, historical events,
neighbors, passers-by. He is my 24-hour classroom, my captive
audience, forced to ingest everything I deem worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   He reads his brother ``Hiroshima'' (leaving out the grisly
parts), ``Maus'' and ``Catch 22''; teaches him tricks with the
Frisbee, and instructs him in the fine art of sock-sliding down
their apartment's hallway. ``To not have Toph,'' he writes, ``would
be to not have a life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the book, Eggers devotes more and more
space to chronicling his and his Bay Area friends' efforts to found
a Gen X magazine called Might. Although his accounts of their
antics (like persuading a former child star to pretend that he is
dead) can grow tiresome _ like watching too many Conan O'Brien
shows in a row _ his writing is so tactile, so hot-wired to his
subconscious, that the reader breezes even through these parts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Eggers demonstrates in this book that he can pretty
much write about anything. He can turn a Frisbee game with his
brother into an existential meditation on life. He can convey the
wild, caffeinated joy he feels after seeing a friend wake up from a
coma. He can turn his efforts to scatter his mother's ashes in Lake
Michigan into a story that's both a lyrical tribute to her passing
and a crude, slapstick account of his ineptitude as a mourner,
lugging about a canister of ashes that reminds him, creepily, of
the Ark of the Covenant in the Spielberg movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius'' may start off
sounding like one of those coy, solipsistic exercises that put
everything in little ironic quote marks, but it quickly becomes a
virtuosic piece of writing, a big, daring, manic-depressive stew of
book that noisily announces the debut of a talented _ yes,
staggeringly talented new writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Three Israeli soldiers were killed in southern
Lebanon Monday as Iranian-backed guerrillas continued to escalate
their attacks during a lull in peace negotiations between Israel
and Syria, Lebanon's power broker.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli planes responded with artillery attacks and airstrikes
on Hezbollah guerrilla targets in Lebanon. By early evening, all
was relatively quiet in the conflict zone, a 9-mile-wide territory
that Israel has occupied since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The morning attack on an Israeli army post came as the strong
emotions of the Lebanon issue had begun to resurface in Israel,
causing bereaved parents to call in to radio programs and
politicians to debate what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   This latest attack by Hezbollah, or Party of God, also came as
the deputy commander of the Israeli-backed South Lebanese army was
being buried after his assassination by the guerrillas on Sunday.
The commander, Akl Hashem, died in an ambush by Hezbollah a week
after the funeral of the first Israeli soldier to have been killed
in Lebanon in six months.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel Monday, politicians suggested to Prime Minister Ehud
Barak that he consider everything from complete restraint to a
massive retaliatory bombardment similar to the one last June by
Benjamin Netanyahu, then the outgoing prime minister. Several
political figures on the left and right called for an immediate,
unilateral withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was considered reluctant to order a harsh military
response that could further escalate the violence, cause more
Israeli casualties and jeopardize the fragile Israeli-Syrian
negotiations. He was also considered unwilling to demand that the
Syrians enforce a cease-fire because such a demand would probably
be costly for Israel during the negotiations. And he has never
wanted to conduct a unilateral withdrawal, believing that a
withdrawal would be most safely performed as part of an agreement
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting with his security Cabinet and with military
officials, Barak vaguely promised some kind of ``punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever is responsible for the severe attacks on Israeli and
South Lebanese soldiers in Lebanon _ we will make sure that he is
punished,'' Barak said. ``Hezbollah activity is ongoing, and we
will not accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, his office issued a statement in which
Barak warned that Israel would not be able to carry on with the
peace effort if Syria did not rein in the Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak very much wants to return to the negotiating table.
The Israeli-Syrian peace effort resumed in December after a nearly
four-year stalemate only to grind to a halt again earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts believe that Syria tries to manipulate the peace
effort by either restraining or failing to restrain Hezbollah
activity in southern Lebanon. Historically, greater calm prevails
at times of active negotiations, experts say, and the peace talks
with Syria are based partly on the premise that Syria uses its
control over Lebanon as a bargaining chip.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the anguished voices of soldiers' parents revived
the feeling of many that the conflict has become senseless. In
addition to the three who were killed Monday, four soldiers were
wounded, one gravely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that they would pull back from that cursed place,
Lebanon,'' said Avi Azulai, the father of an injured soldier, Roni.
``Enough, enough. If it didn't happen to me, it would happen to the
next guy, or the next.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack came at 11:15 Monday morning when guerrillas hit an
Israeli patrol near its outpost at a Crusades-era castle close to
the northern Israeli border. With rocket-launched grenades and
machine guns, the Hezbollah forces staged what their spokesmen
proudly called ``a daring attack deep in the occupied zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't you who strikes when you strike but it is Allah who
does it,'' Hezbollah's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, many feared an Israeli retaliation to rival that of
last June, when Israel responded to the Hezbollah attacks on
civilians in northern Israel with airstrikes throughout Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope they don't bomb the infrastructure facilities like
last time because it was really bad,'' said Nicole Choueiry, a
Lebanese journalist in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, Hezbollah struck Israeli military targets
within the zone of conflict. Under the internationally monitored
rules of the conflict, Israel is not supposed to strike back
outside the zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In June, the targets were Israeli civilians in Israeli
territory,'' said Timur Goksel, a spokesman for the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon. ``It was a case that could be justified. In this
case, they were Israeli soldiers in the wrong country.''

AOL, AMERICAN TO OFFER LOYALTY AIR-TRAVEL PLAN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online Inc. and American Airlines will combine their
rewards program to create the largest on-line customer loyalty
program in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year agreement between the nation's largest on-line
service provider and the second-largest airline will create AOL
AAdvantage and allow members to redeem points earned for air
travel, AOL membership fees and consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are essentially creating a whole new currency for the
on-line generation,'' said Don Carty, chairman and chief executive
of American Airlines. ``By teaming the first and largest
frequent-flier program with the world leader in interactive
services, we're establishing a powerful new brand that we think
will change the face of e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the contract, first discussed last summer, the airline AOL
AAdvantage will be operated by a joint management team from
American Airlines and AOL's digital marketing services division.
</P>
<P>
   American's frequent-flier program, AAdvantage, has about 38
million members. America Online and its subsidiaries have some 22
million members.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Engel, an airline analyst with Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., said
the program will benefit American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selling frequent-flier miles is a very profitable exercise for
the airlines. If you can increase the usage of the program, not
only is that good because it is profitable traffic to carry, it
also increases loyalty, which is what frequent-flier programs
started for.''
</P>
<P>
   By adding consumer products including books, CDs, and
appliances, the program also will take some pressure off American
to redeem the miles, Engel said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gunn, American's executive vice president for marketing and
planning, said America Online has bought a pool of miles from
American for promotional offerings and both companies will be
involved in selling miles to other companies, such as retailers,
that want to be involved in the reward program. The revenue from
sold miles and advertising on the site will be shared.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope the program will be up and running by May.

ALBRIGHT, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER, TRADE OPINIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In her first visit to Moscow since Boris N. Yeltsin
resigned on New Year's Eve, Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright played a little game of ``she said, he said'' with the
Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   After three hours of talks Monday, the main issues were Russia's
four-month war against separatist rebels in Chechnya and the US
desire to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   She said Russia was inflicting ``an incredible amount of misery
on Chechnya's civilians.'' He said Russia's ``battle with
international terrorists was not a battle against the Chechen
people.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that while ``many in Russia view Chechnya as an
internal affair,'' the conflict is ``casting a long international
shadow'' and Moscow risks becoming ``increasingly isolated'' over
the war. He said that Russia ``understands the concerns of those
abroad and it's therefore open to consultations'' on the situation
in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   On the ABM treaty, the differences were no less serious. The
1972 treaty, considered a cornerstone of the detente-era US-Soviet
arms control pacts, bans defensive missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Washington sought to amend the treaty to allow
deployment of a limited space-based antimissile system to protect
the United States against missile attacks from ``third states.''
President Clinton is set to decide this spring whether to move
forward with a $6.6 billion missile defense program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seek to maintain the long-term benefits of ABM while
allowing both our countries security against missile attacks,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov retorted that amending ABM would be ``a serious mistake''
that would undermine ``the architecture of security'' between
Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went on the first day of Albright's three-day working
visit to Russia. The open debate at a joint news conference
underscored the deterioration in US-Russian relations following
NATO's expansion to include three of Moscow's former Cold War
allies in Eastern Europe and the alliance's bombing of Yugoslavia
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street at the United States Embassy, more than 100
demonstrators gathered to protest Albright's visit. They carried
signs accusing her of backing the Chechen rebels and of being party
to war crimes in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their obvious differences, both Albright and Ivanov did
their best to maintain an upbeat tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather in Moscow may be frozen but the ability of the
United States and Russia to work together on important issues is
not,'' Albright said, adding that such complex issues ``are
unlikely subjects for one-day miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Ivanov both said they hoped that Russia's
parliament would ratify the 1993 START II missile reduction treaty
that would cut both sides' long-range nuclear arsenals to between
3,000 and 3,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Once START II is ratified, the Clinton administration has said,
it plans to propose a START III treaty reducing each side's nuclear
arsenal to 2,000 to 2,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Albright is scheduled to participate in talks to foster
regional cooperation in the Middle East. The talks, jointly
sponsored by the Washington and Moscow, will focus on the
environment, economic cooperation, arms control, and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Albright is set to hold her first official meeting
with the Kremlin leader, Vladimir V. Putin, who became Russia's
acting president after Yeltsin's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that her meeting with Putin would be substantive,
but she declined to predict the outcome. She also said that
President Clinton was prepared to make a visit to Moscow to meet
with Putin, but did not specify when. The Associated Press, citing
sources in Washington, reported that Clinton is unlikely to go to
Moscow before Russia's March 26 presidential election, which Putin
is heavily favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Ivanov also signed an agreement tightening controls
on technology used in launching US satellites from Russian space
stations.

TRUDEAUMANIA LIVES, BUT THE POLICIES ARE DYING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ To newcomers thronging a busy food court at lunch
time here, there is something familiar about the elderly lawyer
standing patiently in line at the Lebanese food counter.
</P>
<P>
   Watching him dine alone with his usual chicken-in-pita sandwich,
it dawns that this elegantly dressed gentleman is Pierre Elliott
Trudeau, the man ranked recently by Canadians in a poll as ``the
best prime minister of the century.'' The man emptying his plastic
lunch tray is the same one who ranked fourth in another Canadian
poll, for ``the person of the millennium,'' after Gutenberg,
Einstein and Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of mostly English and mostly gray prime
ministers, Trudeau took the stage in Canada some 30 years ago and
captivated the world with his dapper style, his expansive
liberalism and his fast-paced bachelor life, which culminated with
his storied _ and ill-fated _ marriage to a woman nearly 30 years
younger.
</P>
<P>
   Today, three decades after Trudeaumania swept Canada, his
mystique remains strong, fed partly by the celebrations for his
80th birthday last fall, his reclusiveness _ he steadfastly
declines interviews _ and sympathy over the loss of his youngest
son in an avalanche 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   All that has produced a season of Trudeau appreciation here that
is recalling a bright but bygone age. On October 15, three days
before his birthday, a Canadian TV documentary swept Canadian
television ratings, drawing 1.4 million viewers. Earlier, the
surprise Canadian hit at the Toronto International Film Festival
was Catherine Annau's documentary ``Just Watch Me: Trudeau and the
'70s Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In bookstores, a best-selling anthology of analyses of the
Trudeau era, ``Trudeau's Shadow'' (Vintage Canada), has come out in
paperback.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians' fascination with the Trudeau personal drama is a
measure of how much people connected with him. While his
big-government economic policies are in retreat and his bilingual
policy has failed to blunt Quebec separatism, today's preoccupation
reflects how much Trudeaumania stamped the two generations that
will lead Canada into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this has to do with his style. In 1968, a large part of
Canada's female population developed a crush on this dashing,
self-confident man. His coat lapel sported a fresh rose, his hat
was set at a rakish angle, and his accent was seductively French.
Girls filled scrapbooks with clippings from his 1971 marriage to
Margaret Joan Sinclair, a 22-year-old flower child. Women named
their babies Pierrette and Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   After the Trudeau marriage broke up six years later, he dated
Barbra Streisand and Margot Kidder. Once, when he drove up to his
official residence in a British sports car, a reporter asked him
about his Mercedes. Speaking decades before Austin Powers
popularized such lines, he responded, ``The car _ or the girl?''
</P>
<P>
   The sexual magnetism has proved enduring. At age 71, he fathered
his latest child, Sarah Elisabeth, with Deborah Coyne, who was then
37 and from whom he is now divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Winsor, the political editor of The Globe and Mail in
Toronto, wrote recently that ``with an originality and elan
atypical of Canadian politicians'' Trudeau ``almost single-handedly
dispelled the myth of Canada as dull, wind-swept and boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of this nostalgia also has to do with Canadians who grew up
under Trudeau's spell, attending summer language camps and buying
into his vision of a bilingual nation.
</P>
<P>
   And some of it has to do with the death that shocked Canadians
the way the death of John F. Kennedy Jr. shocked Americans last
summer. Michel Trudeau, 23, an experienced mountaineer, was swept
by an avalanche into an alpine lake on Nov. 13, 1998, in British
Columbia. Burdened with a pack and cross-country skis, he
disappeared into the icy water. His body has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pierre hasn't really recovered from it,'' Margaret Trudeau,
51, his former wife and the mother of Michel, told The Ottawa
Citizen recently. In the months before his son's death, the former
prime minister was skiing, canoeing and climbing pyramids in
Guatemala. Now he appears increasingly frail. He was in a hospital
for pneumonia in early January.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging briefly from her own life of guarded privacy, Margaret
Trudeau gave a news conference on a mountainside in British
Columbia recently to raise awareness of avalanche dangers. Speaking
beside her oldest son, Justin, a 28-year-old English teacher and a
snowboard instructor, she said, ``It was like a nuclear bomb went
off in our family, and nothing could put it together again the way
it was before.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Trudeau lives alone in his austere art-deco house here.
``He's a very distant man,'' Sacha Trudeau, his 25-year-old son,
said in the television documentary. ``He's private, even from our
perspective. I guess he's had kind of a lonely life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Trudeau declines to take part, conferences are
sprouting up to assess his liberal legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Saying in 1967 that ``there's no place for the state in the
bedrooms of the nation,'' Trudeau, then justice minister, helped
ease laws on abortion and homosexual acts. Later, as prime
minister, he appointed the first women to be speakers of the House
of Commons and Senate, and then the first woman to be governor
general.
</P>
<P>
   He introduced a constitutional bill of rights that dramatically
expanded individual freedoms in a nation that was politely
authoritarian.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he persuaded Parliament to enact a bill making Canada
officially bilingual as a way to heal French-English division.
</P>
<P>
   But separatism remains a strong political force, and bitter
memories linger of Trudeau's brief imposition of martial law on his
native Quebec after a wave of separatist kidnappings in 1970. In a
national survey of news media editors last year, English speakers
chose Trudeau as ``the top Canadian newsmaker of the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years after he left political life, it is remarkable
how Pierre Trudeau continues to be a central figure in political
thinking in English Canada, and how his ideas have practically
disappeared from radar screens in Quebec,'' Michel C. Auger, a
newspaper columnist for Journal de Montreal, wrote, skeptical of
the Trudeau-era national unity effort.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   On economic policy, his nationalist, big-government policies
have been toned down. The state oil company that Trudeau formed was
privatized long ago. The foreign investment review agency was
discarded when Canada adopted a free trade pact with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Serge Joyal, a Quebec senator who is a friend of Trudeau, said
the former prime minister lets the critics go unanswered because
``he doesn't want to be dragged into the public debate, into the
public limelight.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joyal reminisced briefly on one difference between a Trudeau
Cabinet in the 1970s and a Jean Chretien Cabinet in the 1990s: ``In
Trudeau's time, the Cabinet would meet and we would say, `What do
we create this week?' In Chretien Cabinet meetings, ``we would say,
`What do we cut this week?'''
</P>
<P>
   On Trudeau's 80th birthday, Chretien gave a dinner at his
official residence in Ottawa for 30 friends of the former prime
minister. With attendants at the all-male gathering dressed in dark
suits, Trudeau displayed his old flair, wearing a gray suit, with
his trademark red rose in the lapel.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the gathering around a long banquet table, the
Canadian news magazine Maclean's ventured that it would be
remembered as ``the last supper'' of the Trudeau era.

 &HT;    AOL, American create joint reward program
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ America Online and American Airlines will combine
resources to launch AOL AAdvantage, a combined rewards program for
AOL users and for members of American's frequent flier program.
</P>
<P>
   The exclusive deal matches one of the country's largest
airlines, which has 38 million frequent flier members, with the
nation's largest online service, which has more than 22 million
members.
</P>
<P>
   Users who register with AOL AAdvantage will be able to earn
American frequent flier miles when they purchase products online
from AOL AAdvantage partners.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms were not disclosed, but the three-year deal also
calls for the two companies to launch a multimillion-dollar
cross-marketing campaign. The program is to start May 1.
</P>
<P>
   A joint management team from American Airlines and AOL will
operate AOL AAdvantage. Netcentives, a developer of electronic
marketing software, will create and operate the infrastructure for
the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AOL AAdvantage program allows users to get up in the
morning and use the advantage miles they currently have, see them
and spend them,'' says AOL Senior Vice President Dennis Gonier.
</P>
<P>
   Although American has its own Web site (www.AA.com), Gonier says
it will be much easier and convenient to check miles and earn miles
using the AOL AAdvantage program. He also said the AOL AAdvantage
program involves more than just earning travel awards. Members can
earn miles that can be applied to America Online's monthly service
plan. (For example, 5,000 miles will earn three months of AOL
service.)
</P>
<P>
   Gonier said that when the AOL and Time Warner merger is
complete, rewards members will have more options. ``When you look
down the road to a time when we are affiliated with (Time Warner),
you can spend the money on magazine subscriptions, music, movies,
HBO service and more. It's a large landscape,'' he said. ``It's a
very large landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chemel, president of American's advantage marketing
program, says the airline has been talking with AOL for some time.
He said American has made its frequent flier program attractive to
infrequent fliers and to non-fliers by offering credit cards and
long-distance services as an alternative way to earn miles.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks offering online rewards opportunities through AOL is
an idea whose time has come.

SHARES OF BLUE CIRCLE INDUSTRIES RISE ON REPORTS OF OFFER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Shares in Blue Circle Industries, a British cement
company, rose more than 20 percent Monday on reports that the
world's No. 1 building materials group, Lafarge SA of France, was
about to bid as much as $5.7 billion for Blue Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Investors began buying Blue Circle shares after the company said
it had rejected an offer from Lafarge and the French company
responded by announcing it might make a formal bid. On the London
Stock Exchange, Blue Circle shares rose 70.50 pence, or about
$11.42, to close at 414 pence, or about $6.71.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in Blue Circle's share price at least temporarily
reversed the trend of last year, when it had declined from a high
of 485 pence in June to about 258 pence in October after
disappointing results in Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   A report in The Daily Telegraph said Lafarge was considering a
hostile $5.7 billion bid for Blue Circle, if Blue Circle refused an
amicable Lafarge offer. If successful, such a hostile bid would
give Lafarge control of roughly half of the British cement market.
</P>
<P>
   Lafarge's expansion would be the latest step in the
consolidation of the European building materials market, especially
in Britain, where rough-and-tumble merger and acquisition activity
is more the rule than on the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   RMC Group of Britain, the world's biggest maker of ready-mix
concrete, agreed in November to pay $1.4 billion for a British
cement maker, Rugby Group. At the same time, Hanson PLC, a British
building materials group that does about half its business in North
America, bid $2.5 billion for another cement producer, Pioneer
International Ltd. of Australia, strengthening Hanson's position in
Asia and North America. Cement is the main ingredient in ready-mix
concrete and mortar. Demand is highly dependent on economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   For Lafarge, which had revenue last year of about $11 billion, a
bid would be the next step in a strategy of expanding globally,
and, most notably in Asia, to tap into an economic recovery there.
Lafarge's last major acquisition was in 1997, when it paid $3.5
billion to purchase Redland PLC of Britain, an acquisition that
made Lafarge the biggest building material supplier. Earlier this
month, Blue Circle said it expected net profit of $421 million for
1999, benefiting from cost savings and improved sales in North
America, where it generates about one-third of its $3.7 billion
annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Lafarge has spent about $3.1 billion on
acquisitions, including almost a dozen small and midsize companies
in North America. In recent weeks, Lafarge linked with a Greek
partner to bid for Egypt's biggest cement maker, the Amereyah
Cement Co.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, thechief executive of Lafarge, Bertrand
Collomb, has expressed interest in further expansion, most notably
in Asia. In a statement Monday, Lafarge said it was ``contemplating
making a cash offer'' for Blue Circle and would make a formal
announcement ``as soon as is practicable.''

 &HT;    Allied Holdings ready for haul with new deals, management
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mitchell Poole doesn't sound happy about America's
love affair with sport-utilities and pickups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're heavier, they're bigger, they're boxier,'' Poole said.
``They're just harder to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Poole's frustration isn't rooted in environmentalism or
annoyance at eye-level headlights in his rearview mirror. As a top
executive at Decatur, Ga.-based Allied Holdings Inc., he has more
practical cause for frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Allied is North America's leading car hauler, delivering more
than 12 million new vehicles a year to dealerships under contract
to automakers. It is a vital link in the auto supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with rising demand for SUVs and trucks is that fewer
of the bulky vehicles fit on a trailer, cutting Allied's average
load about 20 percent over the last few years. That helped push the
company's earnings into the ditch for much of 1999 while Allied
tried to adjust its pricing structure to the new reality, as well
as recover from a mid-1998 strike at its biggest customer, General
Motors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shift in the vehicle mix really put them on their rear,''
said Peter Coleman, transportation analyst at Banc of America
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Now Allied is attempting a U-turn with a reshuffled management
team. Poole, who had been president and chief operating officer,
two months ago became chief executive, succeeding Robert Rutland.
</P>
<P>
   The change was a milestone: Rutland was the grandson of Guy
Rutland Sr., who bought the company in 1934 for $15,000. Robert
Rutland's move out of the CEO spot ended six decades of hands-on
control by the Rutland family, although he remains chairman and the
family is still Allied's biggest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Randall West, former head of Allied's Axis Group logistics
services unit, took the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   Allied hired Hugh Sawyer to run Allied Automotive Group, the
company's core business unit. Sawyer was lured away from
Atlanta-based National Linen Service, where he was credited with
fashioning a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Poole said a turnaround is already under way at Allied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly had some financial issues last year, but we are
over those,'' Poole said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied has renegotiated contracts with its top three customers,
General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler, with new pricing formulas
to offset the changed mix of vehicles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations took time and weren't always easy.
DaimlerChrysler, which provides 15 percent of Allied's revenue, put
its contracts with the company out for bid but wound up keeping 91
percent of that business with Allied, Poole said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied posted a $3.7 million net loss in the first nine months
of 1999, vs. a $3.4 million profit a year earlier. But it recently
told Wall Street that fourth-quarter earnings _ due out Feb. 15 _
will exceed estimates, and Poole said they will give the company a
full-year profit.
</P>
<P>
   Allied stock, which tumbled from a high of $23 in early 1998 to
a low of $5 last October, is showing signs of life. Shares are up
47 percent this month, closing Monday at $9.18 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have huge year-over-year growth this year,'' said
analyst Coleman, who for the time being is keeping a ``market
perform'' rating on Allied stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond that, after the comparisons wash through you're left
with a good company that already dominates a slow-growth
industry,'' Coleman added. ``So the future question is, where does
the (longer-term) growth occur?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, he said, lies in overseas business, logistics
services and being positioned to capitalize on changes in
distribution wrought by e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Poole, who joined Allied in 1988 as chief financial officer,
said the company is gearing up in all three of those areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is an industry that is going to be changing
dramatically in the next few years,'' he said. ``In five years we
will probably be delivering vehicles to your house, not just to
dealers. The consumer may or may not even go through a dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied already is testing smaller, nimbler, quick-loading
trailers for in-city deliveries _ a precursor, perhaps, to home
delivery of made-to-order cars purchased over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer, who spent his first week at Allied attending the Detroit
auto show, came back convinced that automakers will use the
distribution power of the Internet to the hilt. But someone will
still have to deliver vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I was attracted to Allied is that I think
it's going to become a low-tech e-commerce player,'' Sawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Home delivery would change the economics of vehicle delivery,
but Sawyer said companies with the infrastructure in place will be
in the best position to capitalize on the potential trend.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, his task is to make the current model _ in which large
numbers of vehicles are gathered at terminals and then grouped for
delivery to dealers _ as efficient as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers want damage-free delivery, reduced transit times
and good problem resolution,'' said Sawyer, ``and we have to keep
focusing on those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Poole said Allied will continue an international expansion begun
two years ago. It now has a strong presence in Britain and Brazil.
An Asian strategy is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Poole said an overseas presence is necessary not just for growth
but to be a player in global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old delivery chain was Detroit to Columbus, Ohio,'' he
said. ``Now it's Stuttgart (Germany) to Phoenix. We have to be in a
position to be part of that from end-to-end.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied's competition is fragmented. Allied Automotive Group
claims about 65 percent of the North American car-hauling market
and is five times bigger than its closest rival.
</P>
<P>
   That size is largely the result of a 1997 buyout of Ryder
Automotive Carrier Services, which greatly expanded Allied's
presence in the western United States and made General Motors its
biggest account, followed by Ford and DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Poole said the end of the Rutlands' day-to-day control won't
significantly change the company or its culture. He said he plans
to keep one notable aspect of that culture, a chaplaincy program
that offers non-denominational counseling for workers.
</P>
<P>
   Poole also said the family has given no indication it might sell
its stake to a new owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still involved,'' he said, noting that Robert
Rutland's nephew is a senior vice president in the auto-hauling
unit. ``We had been planning a transition at the top for a couple
of years now and felt this was the right time.''

TRYING TO REPRODUCE ENGINEERING FEATS OF LONG AGO
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a five-part series beginning Tuesday night, ``Nova'' applies
a technological spin to some celebrated engineering accomplishments
of centuries long past. The ingenuity of engineers well before
their profession had been accredited is brought back with
explorations, explanations and demonstrations of what the program
calls ``Secrets of Lost Empires.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's opener, ``Medieval Siege,'' looks into how an
early 14th-century English army captured Stirling Castle in
Scotland with the help of a powerful catapult nicknamed Wolfwar. On
succeeding Tuesdays are an effort (a second by ``Nova'') to figure
out how ancient Egyptians erected a famed granite obelisk; how, for
still mysterious reasons, the inhabitants of tiny Easter Island in
the South Pacific moved gigantic stone statues here and there; how
the Romans went about creating their salubrious baths; and how
Chinese bridge-builders of 900 years ago produced their remarkable
``rainbow bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Nova'' consultants, inspired by a Sung dynasty painting of
a rainbow bridge and using techniques that the Chinese might have
used, manage to make an elegant and sturdy arch. Near Rome, they
recreate a model bath, with its temperature-regulated tepidarium
(warm room), caldarium (hot room) and frigidarium (cold room), an
accomplishment of the Roman plumbing fraternity. The ``Nova'' team
also casts a 15-ton concrete replica of an Easter Island monolith.
And they figure out a plausible way for how the ancient Egyptians
managed to lug a 30-ton shaft of granite into an upright position.
</P>
<P>
   Their ventures begin Tuesday night as experts in medieval
warfare join 40 carpenters specializing in timber framing (without
the help of heavy machinery) to test competing theories of how the
formidable Wolfwar, also known as a trebuchet, was built. ``We've
got all the trades going at once,'' a planner says. ``We have the
stone masons busy; we've got the carpenters and the axes flying and
the chips and smoke and the mud. If it weren't for the jets flying
overhead occasionally, you'd think you're in the 12th century.''
</P>
<P>
   One device, credited to a design by Leonardo da Vinci, is an
enormous seesaw-like catapult, suitable for throwing dead horses at
the enemy. Another is a sort of swinging box loaded with tons of
loose rock and dirt put together by a contemporary French
architect. Whatever version of a missile launcher was actually used
seems to have worked: The Scots gave up at the first strike on
their theretofore impregnable walls.

   MERRIMACK, N.H. _ From an Iowa mosh pit to a New Hampshire
Lincoln Day brunch, Alan Keyes has spread his message of personal
responsibility, lower taxes, gun-ownership rights and abhorrence of
abortion during this primary season.
</P>
<P>
   And while polls suggest he may wind up the fourth-place finisher
in Tuesday's Republican presidential primary, New Hampshire has
loaned Keyes a national platform from which to make his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message needs to be gotten to the people,'' said Kathleen
Burger of Chesterfield, who had come to Merrimack Monday to hear
Keyes speak. ``And he is a most eloquent means of getting it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, a former UN ambassador and radio talk-show host, spoke
Monday on the Don Imus radio show live from the Lebanon, N.H.,
Opera House, then addressed a luncheon in Merrimack, spoke on
WMUR-TV and attended a party with supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must return to the concept that it is the citizens'
responsibility to lead,'' Keyes said Monday. ``The citizens'
responsibility to decide, the citizens' responsibility to defend,
the citizens' responsibility to stand in the breach and do what is
necessary in order to secure the integrity of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   By Keyes's reckoning, beating Steve Forbes, who holds third
place in most polls, would constitute success. A good showing, he
said, would be to come ``within a reasonable distance'' of Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, he fully intends to carry his message to South
Carolina before that state's Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This depends entirely on people,'' Keyes said of his campaign.
``As long as there are folks willing to work, we'll continue to
present what I think is the right choice to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But while many voters said they like Keyes's message, and are
left invigorated by his oratory, they also may shy from marking an
``X'' next to his name when they go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's between him and John McCain,'' said Greg
D'Arbonne, an independent voter from Brookline, a town near the
Massachusetts border. ``Mr. Keyes probably won't win, but I see
some of the same type of ideals in McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   And Burger, who also praised Keyes's platform and his passion,
said she will vote for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes offered a tongue-lashing Monday to Republicans who would
vote for Texas Governor George W. Bush simply because they perceive
him as the ``winner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I call them lemmings,'' Keyes told reporters Monday.
``Remember lemmings? They're that animal that periodically gets
overtaken by a desire to commit suicide, and they all gather
together in big bunches and march off the cliff together. I think
that Bush supporters are lemmings. They're the same lemmings who
handed us Bob Dole last time and marched us off the cliff of
defeat,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Bush has exactly the same characteristics. A decent guy.
Not as effective as others at articulating the issues, but what the
heck? He's got a big name.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, in Keyes's view, doesn't have the skills or strength
of character to press the conservative case and ``promote the
ideals of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The right man for that job, he says, is Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if people look honestly at the debates _ agree with me
or not _ and just ask themselves who is the most effective
spokesman in terms of articulating the sort of moral challenge that
has to be met in this country, I think the answer has been obvious
for quite some time. . . . So why not choose the right tool for the
job?''

BAUER OFFER FLIP REMARKS AFTER STAGE DIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ One lightning quick change of position _ from
vertical to nearly horizontal _ won Gary Bauer's struggling
presidential campaign more attention Monday than scores of speeches
decrying abortion and the collapse of American values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can almost guarantee you that I will be on all three
networks . . . tonight,'' Bauer said, after his fall off the stage
during a morning event. ``No it's not my China position. It's not
my strong stand in favor of the sanctity of life. I went to the
pancake flipoff this morning with Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's un-balletic bit of political theater came during a
breakfast campaign rally at the city's National Guard Armory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Bush gets to go first. He goes out there _ the guy already
has all the money, right? So you would think maybe on this I could
beat him,'' Bauer said. ``He goes out there, he flips the pancake
about 20 feet in the air and catches it and I have to go out and
beat this, so I go out and flip the pancake but unfortunately the
angle is not quite right, it's going over the back of my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer followed the flying pancake with his griddle held aloft,
and fell backward past a giant blue and yellow Bisquick banner and
off the 4-foot-riser to the concrete floor. He reappeared seconds
later with the help of aides, grinning like the kid who saved the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught the pancake. You are looking at the Ken Griffey of
American politics. I may not be able to flip a pancake but I will
never waffle,'' Bauer said later to a chorus of Rotarian groans.
</P>
<P>
   With his poll numbers still in the low single digits, Bauer
spent the last day before the primary preaching not to his natural
constituency of Christian conservatives but to businesspeople and
law students at Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer has wearied of questions about his dearth of supporters,
and whether he is running to win points for conservative values
rather than votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This process is just too arduous, too grinding to be in it for
any other reason but to win the nomination,'' said Richard Lessner,
a Bauer adviser and former editorial page editor of the Union
Leader of Manchester, the conservative daily that backed Steve
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's speech to the Rotarians stressed his family history and
the values he would bring to office.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get down to five guys left and one of them being the son of
a janitor is just incredible,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   His short speech traversed some of the grimmest highlights of
recent American history _ the 1998 dragging death of a black man in
Texas, the Columbine High School killings _ before making his
audience a promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civilization is about reliable standards of right and wrong.
The founding fathers gave us a country based on one ideal, that
only a virtuous people could remain free,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One nation under God. Ordered liberty. Liberty used for good,
not just for anything. This is the central issue facing our nation.
I will make the case for ordered liberty, the only kind that
matters,'' Bauer pledged.
</P>
<P>
   His speech won nods of agreement, but apparently, few votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one at this table who is undecided and no one at
this table who is for Bauer,'' Michael Bornstein, an accountant,
said of his seven lunch companions. ``I thought Bauer did an
excellent job in the debates but I don't think he has enough
support to be elected,'' he said. Bornstein is voting for John
McCain.

 &HT;    Eager Georgians get sneak preview
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.H. _ The local American Legion hall is about the
last place a reporter for this newspaper would expect to run into a
half-dozen Georgians.
</P>
<P>
   But Will Claiborne and his cohorts wanted a taste of
presidential politics in New Hampshire. And there was no better
place for that one recent night than in Rochester, at Republican
John McCain's 112th town hall meeting in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the center of the political world at the moment,''
said Claiborne, 22, president of Emory University's student
government.
</P>
<P>
   He and Phil Smith, the director of the Concord Coalition in
Georgia, were interested in getting all candidates to endorse the
coalition's platform of paying down the national debt before
offering tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain says some things that are very good for deficit
hawks,'' Smith said, stressing that the coalition does not endorse
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the deficit were the business part of the trip.
But this latter-day Peanut Brigade was made up of political
junkies, Democrats and Republicans, who surmised that they would
get better looks at Gov. George W. Bush, Vice President Al Gore and
the others in New Hampshire than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The other travelers included Emory Fiveash of Statesboro, vice
chairman of the Bulloch County Republican Party, and Lawton Jordan,
a University of Georgia law student. Jordan's first taste of
politics came from his uncle, Hamilton Jordan, and adviser to
former President Jimmy Carter and a Senate candidate in his own
right in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamilton took us to Camp David a few times,'' Jordan recalled.
Jordan and Smith also campaigned for President Clinton in New
Hampshire in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne, an Emory senior from Atlanta, said the visit could
not have been better. The group attended a Super Bowl party Sunday
at the home of McCain supporters, where the candidate signed photos
for the Georgians. ``There were 75 people and six of us yahoos from
Georgia,'' Claiborne said.
</P>
<P>
   On the cold night in Rochester, Fiveash displayed some political
savvy. He wore a tan down jacket, zipped to his chin, presumably to
keep him warm. But as McCain shook hands elsewhere in the room,
Fiveash unzipped the jacket just enough to reveal a Bush for
president logo on his T-shirt.

FORBES UNDETERRED DESPITE POLL READINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EXETER, N.H. _ His poll numbers are unspectacular, he is
overshadowed by his more popular rivals, and his aides complain of
an unfair ``national media blackout.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he surveyed the lobster tank at the Fresh Fish Daley
market Monday, Steve Forbes displayed no signs of discouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do to the Washington politicians what you do to
those lobsters,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Forbes' campaign has remained defiantly optimistic in
the final days before Tuesday's presidential primary, despite the
fact that the GOP race has been almost entirely defined by the
competition between the two front-runners, Governor George W. Bush
of Texas and Senator John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The self-described ``true conservative'' in the Republican race
kept up his criticism of Bush and McCain as timid moderates whose
tax-cut proposals are too small and whose opposition to abortion is
weak.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Forbes said his campaign is gaining momentum, and he
expects to ``surprise a lot of people'' in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes' campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, backed away from his
earlier talk that Forbes could finish ahead of Bush and leave the
governor with a humiliating third-place total.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dal Col insisted Forbes would exceed expectations, saying
that internal campaign polls show Forbes doing much better than
national surveys suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important than Forbes' showing, Dal Col said, was what
happens to Bush. Dal Col said if McCain were to defeat Bush, the
Texan's conservative supporters would flock to Forbes. That, he
said, would set up Forbes for strong showings later this month in
Delaware and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain beats him decently in New Hampshire, the vote in
South Carolina starts to splinter,'' Dal Col said. ``The
conservatives will not go to John McCain. The place to come home is
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Between get-out-the-vote calls from his Manchester phone bank
headquarters Monday, Forbes said he would not drop out of the race
regardless of his showing here. ``We're in it for the duration,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As other candidates trekked through snow from one event to
another Monday, Forbes substituted retail politicking for a frenzy
of media appearances. Aides estimated that in the final 72 hours,
Forbes would sit for more than 30 radio and television interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes aides see local media outlets, particularly conservative
talk radio programs, as an effective way to spread his message.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has become a master at conducting an interview on his own
terms. He shrugs off the best efforts of one host after another to
flummox him, repeating his mantra that he is ``the most pro-life,
anti-tax candidate in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col said Forbes has conducted at least as much retail
campaigning over the past year than any other candidate. But, he
added, ``when you've got a national media blackout . . . there's no
sense in putting together a town hall event when the likelihood of
making the national news is very slim.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Forbes aides often gripe about the media, one newspaper
has kept them buoyed. Since the Manchester Union Leader endorsed
Forbes several weeks ago, the paper, with a circulation of 63,000,
has been running regular editorials supportive of him and sharply
critical of Bush, whom the paper deems too moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Forbes was praised by the paper in an editorial and an
op-ed column, a full page ad purchased by a national Catholic
group, and another full-page ad purchased by Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also ran a half-page ad seeking to refute
Forbes' charges that Bush's record as governor has been weak. The
ad said Forbes was hurting the party's chances at winning the White
House with his attacks.

 &HT;    Story still sweet the day after Rams fairy tale
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kurt Warner's NFL odyssey started nearly two years ago
on a practice field at the Falcons' complex in Suwanee, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Warner's long, winding and improbable journey
culminated when the NFL MVP led the Rams to a 23-16 victory over
the Titans in the 34th Super Bowl in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, Warner was a 26-year-old rookie with the
Amsterdam Admirals. He had been allotted to NFL Europe by St.
Louis, which signed the former Arena League star to a free-agent
contract during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was miserable,'' Warner said about his first visit to
Atlanta. ``I never wanted to come back here and practice in the
cold and snow again. But I always knew that if I was going to get a
chance to get (to the NFL) that it would be through NFL Europe. It
was ironic when we came out last week and it was cold with the icy
rain. That was exactly how it was when I was here for training camp
(in 1998).''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the stakes were much higher. Warner threw for a Super
Bowl-record 414 yards, breaking Joe Montana's 1989 mark of 357.
Warner, who completed 24 of 45 passes and threw two touchdowns, was
named the game's MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who only five years ago was stocking groceries
in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt Warner reinforces our faith in dreams and fairy tales,''
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``Many people were wondering
whether the dream or the fairy tale would end. Well, it hasn't
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' success doesn't figure to end soon, unless they turn
into a post-Super Bowl toad, as the Falcons and Broncos did.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has only three starters _ cornerback Todd Lyght,
offensive tackle Fred Miller and center Mike Gruttadauria _
eligible for unrestricted free-agency. The Rams, who will be about
$15.7 million under the projected $62.5 million salary cap this
year, probably will keep Lyght by designating him their
``franchise'' player.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the talent and young players that we have on this team,
it looks like things could be in place for a long time,'' Warner
said. ``But again, you never know what tomorrow may bring.
Hopefully, the guys will want to stay together, and we can keep
this thing going for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The most serious offseason issues are the futures of coach Dick
Vermeil and backup quarterback Trent Green, the expected 1999
starter who suffered a season-ending knee injury in an exhibition
game.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil, 63, has two years remaining on his contract, which he
signed in 1997 after a 14-year respite from coaching. Earlier this
month, the Rams signed offensive coordinator Mike Martz to an
extension, which includes a clause declaring him to be Vermeil's
eventual successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I am going to do is give some thought to
getting home and getting myself reorganized,'' Vermeil said Monday.
``I'm going to spend some time with my wife and talk about a lot of
things. It is much better to be talking about (retirement) than
answering the questions about getting fired, which I have done for
two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner said Vermeil didn't tell the team what he might do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I heard,'' Warner said. ``He didn't give any
indications in front of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Rams players say they won't be surprised if Vermeil decides
to retire. Vermeil won only nine games in his first two seasons
with the Rams, who often complained about his long practices and
grueling workload.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the utmost respect for Dick Vermeil,'' St. Louis free
safety Keith Lyle said. ``You know, a lot of times they say an old
dog can't change his habits. Well, he changed his habits. He
changed his ways. And it got us all the way to Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, the former Washington Redskins starter who signed a
four-year, $16 million contract with the Rams in February, might
not have a future in St. Louis. Warner is an ``exclusive-rights''
free agent, and the team can sign him to a one-year contract worth
about $2 million to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams could trade Green, but his signing bonus would be
accelerated against the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got to work hard and get back to being a starter
again,'' Green said. ``I'd love to be back with St. Louis. It's a
very family-oriented organization, very sound. But I do want to be
a starter.''

LAST-MINUTE DECISIONS EXPECTED TO WEIGH HEAVILY ON N.H. OUTCOME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. - With two tight races and an influence greater
than ever, New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary unfolds
across a snowy landscape filled with independent-minded voters _
many of whom say they are making their decision in the final hours.
</P>
<P>
   Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley have pinned
their futures largely on upending their respective party's national
frontrunners, Texas Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Al
Gore. The vote could determine whether one of both of the
presidential nomination races effectively ends here, or whether the
insurgent candidates march forward with renewed vigor to the South
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great ride,'' McCain told a New Hampshire radio
audience Monday, adding: ``I'm looking forward to a victory
(Tuesday) night.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Bush: ``There's something going on out there. It's
called energy and enthusiasm and excitement. And I like my chances
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also conducted a furious final round of
campaigning across the state. ``I'm going to be campaigning
full-blast every minute of every hour,'' Gore told diners at the
Tilt'n Diner in Tilton. In Hollis, Bradley declared that he was
closing in fast: ``I hope independent-minded people in New
Hampshire will send a message to this country that the old politics
is over and the new politics have arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   The day began with a scene that combined the nostalgia of
Currier and Ives with the high-tech wizardy of a modern media
campaign. As New Hampshire-ites shoveled a fresh five inches of
snow from their walkways, an army of satellite trucks moved into
position, transforming this little state of 1.1 million people into
the nation's temporary media headquarters. On many street corners,
young campaign workers could be seen carrying the brightly colored
signs of their favorite candidates; here and there, a scrum of
media surrounded a candidate, a bevy of boom microphones bristling
above the pack.
</P>
<P>
   While the candidates dashed about Monday for a final flurry of
photo opportunities from Derry to Concord and points in between,
some of the most important action was taking place behind the
scenes as an army of volunteers worked to get out the vote on what
is forecast to be a sunny day, with a high of 36 degrees expected
in the state capital of Concord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pushing and we're going to keep pushing all the way
through to the end,'' said Bradley field director Kevin Keefe, who
is providing 2,500 supporters with mountain climbing ``hot pads''
to warm their feet and hands while knocking on doors Monday and
monitoring the 299 polling sites around the state Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign Monday was distributing 55,000 ``door
hanger'' notices to homes that say, ``You can change history in the
next 12 hours, vote for Bill Bradley. It's time for honesty and
integrity to win for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign team estimated that they called 100,000 voters
over the weekend and expected to call another 160,000 voters
through Tuesday. Since Saturday, canvassers delivered 120,000
pieces of literature throughout the state and placed 30,000
door-hangers in targeted precincts reminding people to vote. About
1,800 volunteers will be on hand to give voters' rides to the polls
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The final organizational push is essential in this state, where
a relatively small number of votes can make a major difference in
whether a candidate lives to see another primary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, Patrick J. Buchanan beat Bob Dole by 2,136
votes. Though the number was relatively small, the embarrassing
second place finish hobbled Dole with the look of a loser as he
went on to claim the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turnout is always crucial when you have a tight contest, and
you have a tight contest in the Republican race and a potentially
tight contest in the Democratic race,'' said Linda L. Fowler, a
government professor at Dartmouth College.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Texas Governor George W. Bush and his
wife, Laura, made a tape recording urging people to vote; the
automated calls were left on voters' answering machines.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign plans to have poll-watchers at each of the
voting places, checking off names of supporters who come in to cast
a ballot. Those who have not showed up by about 4:30 p.m. will
receive a phone call reminding them that it is critical to vote,
said Mike Dennehy, McCain's New England director.
</P>
<P>
   In some past campaigns, a strong second-place showing has been
considered a victory. But this year seemed different, with
insurgents McCain and Bradley at or near the top of the polls for
much of the winter. A decisive victory by Gore or Bush could give
either nearly unstoppable momentum to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who boldy predicted last week that Bush would come in
third place in New Hampshire, now apparently has no such illusions.
Instead, Forbes' hope is that Bush will be bruised enough here to
be vulnerable in the upcoming primaries in Delaware, South
Carolina, Arizona and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is crucial that McCain beats Bush,'' said Greg Mueller, a
senior adviser to Steve Forbes. ``We fulfilled our responsibility
of questioning the inevitability of Bush with our showing in Iowa,
and now we need McCain to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is counting on a hard core of support from Republican Party
members to win the primary. Dartmouth College professor of
government Dean Spiliotes thinks the Republican race will turn on
two factors: how many independents turn out to support McCain, and
how many votes Bush loses to Keyes and Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether Bush will get sandwiched between
independents who go for McCain and conservatives who go for Forbes
and Keyes,'' Spiliotes said.
</P>
<P>
   By New Hampshire lore, if not the polls, many voters go through
a last-minute period of decision-making. In some years, the outcome
of the race confounds pollsters due to a final movement toward a
particular candidate. In a random sampling of interviews at recent
campaign events, a sizable number of voters said they would make up
their minds on Election Day after pondering the campaign over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, most of the candidates posed for the
television cameras and kept away from reporters asking intrusive
questions that might push them off their message.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for example, went sledding backward down a 150-yard hill
in Bedford with 13 year-old twins, Laura and Lizzy Saggau of
Merrimack. The night before, he spoke for just six minutes and 32
seconds at a Superbowl rally in Portsmouth before shaking hands and
going home.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made stops in Keene, Hanover, Concord and Portsmouth,
delivered a short outdoor speech in each town, and absorbed loud
adulation from volunteers and supporters. At each stop, he
emphasized his role as the anti-establishment candidate and
crusader for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   He then moved straight on to the handshakes without the
customary, and sometimes interminable, question and answer session
which has typified his candidacy here. McCain allowed that this was
a little disorienting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like going cold turkey,'' he said at the start of the
jam-packed day. ``It'll be an incredible shock to my system.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, mimicking his strategy in the days leading up to
the Iowa caucuses, devoted more time Monday to radio and television
interviews than in-the-flesh campaigning. By mid-afternoon, the
magazine publisher had conducted close to a dozen interviews but
shaken the hands of only a handful of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore kept to the campaign trail _ but away from reporters _ as
he made a final swing around the southern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his blistering attack Sunday on rival Bill
Bradley, Gore took the high road Monday, dismissing the few
questions reporters were able to ask the well-sequestered
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into any particular characterization of
him,'' Gore said when asked if Bradley's attacks represented
desperation on Bradley's part.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley generally suspended his offensive after a five-day
assault on Gore's honesty and integrity. He returned to his
inspirational theme of making ``'big dreams'' _ comprehensive
health coverage, stricter gun control, and public financing of
elections _ come true. And he stepped up his appeal to independent
voters, in part by renewing his characterization of Gore has
emblematic of the ``old politics'' that is impeding bold progress.

 &HT;    Oxygen takes its first breath on Wednesday
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the new cable network Oxygen, women are going online and
shopping, stretching to yoga instructors and kvetching about bad
dates, delivering the news and having pajama parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a bunch of rowdy girls,'' says Caryn Mandabach, one of
Oxygen's founder-programmers. Actually, they're a bunch of smart,
ambitious women marketing themselves as rowdy girls.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen, a cable network run and programmed by women and aimed at
women, debuts Wednesday. (The launch date _ 02/02/00 _ is a pun on
the chemical symbol for oxygen.)
</P>
<P>
   The channel's unusual name came from Geraldine Laybourne, who
says she woke up one night gasping for breath and decided that what
women need is a little breathing room, a little oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The network provided advance tapes of only a tiny fraction of
programming, but here's how Oxygen's schedule will run at first.
Some shows are repeated several times a day, which is how Oxygen
can fill a 168-hour week with 55 hours of original programming.
</P>
<P>
   Monday-Friday:
</P>
<P>
   _ 7 a.m. ``Inhale.'' _ ``When you wake up in the morning, what
do you want to do?'' asks Mandabach. ``You want to stretch.'' Well,
maybe not everyone does, but those who do can watch an hour of
yoga.
</P>
<P>
   _ 8 a.m., 12 noon and 8 p.m. ``Pure Oxygen.'' _ A two-hour block
of news and features, considered the channel's signature show even
though it lacks the star power of a Bergen or Winfrey. Details are
sketchy. The two-hour block repeats three times a day.
</P>
<P>
   _ 10 a.m., 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. ``Exhale.'' _ Candice Bergen talks
to celebrities (Jodie Foster and Helen Hunt are booked) and a mix
of artists, politicians, sex experts, you name it. The set is very
cozy (there's even a candle burning on the coffee table the guests
gather 'round), and Bergen makes it feel more like a conversation
than a formal interview.
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 p.m. ``As She Sees It'' _ Documentaries about women.
</P>
<P>
   _ 4 p.m. and 11 p.m. ``Trackers'' _ A two-hour block aimed at
teens. Details are sketchy, but it will feature one of the
channel's few male faces, Dr. Mike Riera, a counselor and author of
``Surviving High School.''
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, Oxygen will look significantly different.
</P>
<P>
   The big show will be ``Oprah Goes Online'' at 8 p.m. Sundays.
Winfrey, one of the founding investors in Oxygen, says she was
``completely illiterate'' about computers before she started taping
this series of cyber how-tos. The first one starts with the basics:
This is a screen, a keyboard, a mouse. Oxygen's programmers know
that many women will be way beyond Winfrey's baby steps _ women's
online use exploded after the shows started taping _ but hope that
Oprah will draw them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Also scheduled for weekends:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``X Chromosome'' (10:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday), a
laboratory for animation. Lots of quick hits zip in and out,
including ``Bitchy Bits,'' about the agony of trying on bathing
suits, and some material that is pretty risque for TV.
</P>
<P>
   _``SheCommerce'' (8 a.m. Saturday and Sunday), four hours of
shopping tips.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Girl in the Picture'' (8 p.m. Saturday), the only
non-original show on Oxygen: reruns of classic old movies with
stars like Joan Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   _``Pajama Party'' (11 p.m. Saturday) _ An audience and guest
celebs hang out in their PJs and indulge in ``taboo topics,
mind-bending trends and far-out music,'' according to Oxygen's
press release. Hosted by Katie Puckrik, whom Oxygen has dubbed the
``new millennium It Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing certain about Oxygen's cable schedule is that it
will probably be very different in a few months. The learning curve
is steep on any new show, and Oxygen is launching a bunch at once.
Plus the network will be monitoring chat rooms and message boards
on its Website, www.oxygen.com, to gauge what's working and what
isn't with viewers.

 &HT;    Super Bowl team bigger thrill than Super Bowl host
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The difference between having your team in the Super
Bowl and having the Super Bowl in your town is the difference
between heart and head. When it's your team playing, the emotions
are engaged 24/7. When it's your town serving as host, you keep a
clinical distance.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons played in Super Bowl XXXIII. Atlanta staged
Super Bowl XXXIV. The latter was the better spectacle by far, but
to those of us who live here it was almost a game in a bubble _ fun
to watch, riveting in the final quarter, somehow weightless a day
later. It happened downtown, yes, but it had little effect on us.
With the last visitors headed home, what do we locals recall about
the final weekend of the first month of 2000? The ice.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was something else. A bad game capped a fortnight of
utter frenzy. Remember the team buses looping through the throngs
at Centennial Olympic Park en route to Hartsfield International
Airport? Remember how every utterance seemed fraught with meaning?
Remember how we parsed Dan Reeves' ``I-have-hurt-feelings''
address, directed at Mike Shanahan and John Elway? Remember the
back and forth over Ray Buchanan's semi-guarantee of victory? Over
his Media Day dog collar? Over Shannon Sharpe's rejoinder?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about Super XXXIV registered in that way and not just
because the weather turned frigid and the NFL Hype Machine got
ratcheted down. To us, it was a football game that just happened to
be played here. Luck of the draw. Super XXXIII, by way of contrast,
could have been a day of deliverance for a franchise that had spent
33 years tripping over itself. For all the Braves' great October
work in the '90s, last year's Super Bowl promised to be the biggest
event in Atlanta sports history. That it wound up a dud only
deepened the hurt.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if Titans fans feel as lousy today as Falcons fans did
a year ago. I doubt it. Tennessee played hard and well. Tennessee
trailed 16-0 and tied the score. The Falcons trailed 17-6 after
three quarters, 31-6 five minutes later. Tennessee lost because
Kevin Dyson's arms aren't telescopic. The Falcons lost without
giving themselves a chance. I've lived and worked here 16 years,
and no morning-after has been so glum as that Monday, when all the
talk was of Eugene Robinson, when the Falcons' welcome-home rally
was as spirited as a Bill Bradley stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   When you're the host city, you want things to go smoothly but
won't agonize over much if they don't. After the fallout over the
Olympics, we Atlantans have become somewhat less sensitive about
what others think of us. But when it's your team, sensitivity gets
heightened to the max. You want your guys to win the game, to lift
the Lombardi Trophy, to give you an excuse to spend $45 on a
sweatshirt that has ``Super Bowl champions'' on the front.
</P>
<P>
   Rams fans have that excuse. Falcons fans didn't get theirs. A
year later, it still hurts. Invest that much feeling in something,
even something as silly as a Super Bowl, and the investment carries
a surcharge. When it's your team playing, you can't stand on the
figurative sidelines. Like it or not, you're involved.

 &HT;    One part of next year's flu vaccine decided; two to go
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal advisers deciding the formula for next winter's flu
vaccine have agreed on one of its three components but deferred a
decision on the remaining two.
</P>
<P>
   In an annual meeting convened Friday outside Washington by the
Food and Drug Administration, representatives of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, joined by other influenza experts,
took the first stab at defining the best vaccine to offer during
the next flu season nine months from now.
</P>
<P>
   The final choices are to be made by March and will affect the 60
million to 80 million Americans who receive flu shots annually.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine recipe _ decided so far in advance of the next flu
season because the vaccine-manufacturing process is time-consuming
_ is based on the flu strains that have been most troublesome
during the current season, combined with scientific predictions of
ways in which the viruses might change genetically by next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the vaccine is formulated to combat two strains
of influenza subtype A and one of influenza subtype B. On Friday,
those at the meeting agreed on one A strain, a subtype found
recently on the South Pacific island of New Caledonia. But they
agreed to wait for more data on this season's outbreaks before
selecting the remaining portions of the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Type A Sydney, the cause of widespread outbreaks this year,
continues to circulate worldwide, the scientists were told. The
lack of change in the Sydney strain is surprising given that it
first emerged three years ago, said Dr. Nancy Cox, chief of the
CDC's influenza branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really looking for a distinct new variant, and we
haven't seen one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The current vaccine formulation, decided this time last year,
was accurate despite higher rates of sickness and death this year,
said the CDC's Keiji Fukuda.
</P>
<P>
   In numbers released last week, the CDC said that this flu season
began earlier, and caused more deaths, than flu seasons in the past
two years. The season has peaked both nationwide and in Georgia,
according to federal and state health authorities. Flu in Georgia
has been downgraded to ``regional outbreaks'' after peaking between
Jan. 9 and 15.

NOT-COMS VS. THE DOT-COMS: THE SIDESHOW AT SUPERBOWL XXXIV 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: 2nd take assesses some of the 51 commercials shown.)  
(DW) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In Super Bowl XXXIV, newcomers delivered and
disappointed, favorites came through and fell short and the closely
fought action continued to the final moments. Oh, yeah, and some
guys played a football game.
</P>
<P>
   The Ad Bowl that took place on Sunday as the St. Louis Rams
edged the Tennessee Titans may be as emblematic of a new era for
Madison Avenue as the absence of mainstay teams like the Broncos,
Cowboys, Giants and 49ers was for the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there were more commercials aimed at women, for
products like Bud Light beer and Tropicana orange juice; the first
paid public service announcements, for the U.S. Census and the
National Heart Savers Association; and a larger presence for media
outlets like Dow Jones &AMP; Co. and Oxygen Media.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the most significant sign of change was the
proliferation of dot-com spots, as 17 of the 36 marketers buying
national commercial time during the game for a record average of
$2.2 million for each 30 seconds came from the Internet world. The
results of the high-stakes gamble by the dot-coms _ going for broke
to break through the clutter _ seemed mixed at best.
</P>
<P>
   Most preliminary opinion, buttressed by the results of some
polls, agreed that commercials for Web sites and E-commerce
marketers fared less well than spots for traditional Super Bowl
sponsors like beers, soft drinks and credit cards. Of course, the
not-coms have had decades to perfect their appearances during the
annual midwinter festival of commercialism; it looks as if Internet
companies are expected to get up to speed in Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional brands this year were much more developed and had
a more sophisticated core identity,'' said Gad Romann, executive
creative director at the Romann Group, an agency in New York. ``The
dot-coms have yet to be fully developed.''
</P>
<P>
   When SAA Research in Farmington Hills, Mich., asked viewers
after the game to name a commercial they recalled seeing, only one
of the five spots remembered most often was for a dot-com, the
ETrade Group. By comparison, in the survey SAA conducted last year,
two of the top five were dot-coms, a Webcast by Victoria's Secret,
a unit of Intimate Brands, and Monster.com.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring what SAA terms ``advertising brand impact,'' which
refers to positive feelings about a brand generated among those who
recalled it being advertised, all the commercials that scored the
highest were for traditional marketers, while six of the eight
scoring the lowest were for dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2 of the 10 most popular commercials in the annual USA
Today Ad Meter survey published Monday _ asking consumers to rate
the spots as they watched the game _ were for dot-coms: Pets.com
and Oxygen, which counts as both a dot-com and a media company
because it is a cable network and a Web site. At the same time,
dot-coms earned the dubious distinction of landing 7 spots among
the 10 least popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any dot-coms are still under the illusion that advertising
was the simple solution to building brands, then the Super Bowl
will have put an end to that,'' said Simon Williams, chairman of
the Sterling Group, in New York, a brand consulting company.
``Meaningless names, meaningless messages and a serious lack of
stature were the major leave-behinds.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet not every dot-com was dashed by the outcome of Ad Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones, another media/dot.com, declared success for its
commercial for WSJ.com, the interactive edition of The Wall Street
Journal. The spot helped double traffic to the WSJ.com Web site,
said Neil Budde, editor and publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Lastminutetravel.com, which ran a humorous spot by Burkhardt &AMP;
Hillman in New York immediately after the game ended, was pleased,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our gamble paid off,'' said David Miranda, chief executive at
Lastminutetravel.com in Atlanta. ``As the ad ran, we started to get
5,000 people per second coming to our site.''
</P>
<P>
   Dot-com commercials were among the top finishers in an online
survey of 650 viewers by Insight Express in Greenwich, Conn. Of the
14 spots listed as most liked (there were 3 ties among the top 10),
5 were for dot-coms: two ETrade spots, Pets.com, Oxygen and
Lifeminders.com.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto in a survey by Iwin.com, which asked visitors to its Web
site to vote on Super Bowl spots in six categories. Of the 10
commercials that were deemed most effective, 5 were for dot-coms:
ETrade, Autotrader.com, Pets.com, Britannica.com and Hotjobs.com.

 &HT;    CDC experts put prevention first, in their careers and their
lives
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christine Branche and Michael Pratt work hard at their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   They spend weeks designing programs that affect thousands of
people. They have invested years doing research and developing
their specialties: Pratt is a physician with two master's degrees,
and Branche has a Ph.D.
</P>
<P>
   And if they do their jobs very, very well ... nothing happens.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what they hope for.
</P>
<P>
   Branche, 38, and Pratt, 43, are living exemplars _
professionally and personally _ of one of the knottiest problems
facing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That would
be the last word in the Atlanta-based agency's name, the one that
doesn't make it into the well-known abbreviation CDC: prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Prevention is the science of reducing the risks that health
problems will happen, so that adults won't develop avoidable
cancers, members of minority groups won't be at greater risk of
diabetes or high blood pressure, and children won't die from
vaccine-preventable diseases. It takes a tremendous amount of
effort to produce a negative result: no colon cancer, no diphtheria
deaths, no strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being a good umpire in a baseball game,'' Pratt
said. ``If you go unnoticed, you've done your job well.''
</P>
<P>
   Prevention is a hard sell. One month ago today, when the world
woke up to find that civilization hadn't ended at midnight, Y2K
suddenly looked like ``Why did we bother?'' Computers weren't
crashing, banks weren't failing, and airplanes weren't falling from
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, of course, that Y2K would have been Yawn2K all
along _ that the billions of dollars invested in millennial
planning were a waste. But it's also possible that nothing happened
precisely because those advance efforts prevented it.
</P>
<P>
   The derision that accompanied the Y2K non-meltdown demonstrates
how difficult that concept can be. For many Americans, it's equally
difficult to believe that taking the stairs today can help fend off
a heart attack 30 years in the future. The task of Branche and
Pratt and hundreds of their CDC colleagues is developing that
trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inactivity itself doesn't kill people,'' explained Pratt, a
researcher in the CDC's division of nutrition and physical
activity. ``It increases the risks for diseases that usually take
place a long time down the line. People don't tend to get excited
about possibilities that far in the future; they're not much of a
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Not trusting that prevention can work is a problem even for
experts. Not long ago, Branche, director of the CDC's injury
prevention division, addressed a group of infectious-disease
specialists. Within 20 years, she told them, research suggests that
the top three causes of death worldwide will be pregnancy-related
problems, mental illness and accidental injuries. Disease deaths
won't make the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if I shot their dog,'' Branche recalled. ``These
were people closely identified with all kinds of infectious agents,
working in all kinds of international settings. What did I mean,
disease wouldn't be a problem? And I said, Well, I think you should
be glad. If you are doing your jobs right, it shouldn't be on the
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of World War II, scientific research has shown
that eating well, using vaccines, sleeping enough, getting
exercise, wearing seat belts and stopping smoking all confer health
benefits. But it's a long leap from scientific research to personal
action. Almost everyone has a story of some friend or relative who
loathed vegetables, disdained vitamins, got their exercise walking
to the corner store for cigarettes and outlived doctors and
doomsayers alike. Faced with the choice between a bacon
cheeseburger and broccoli, we want to believe we have luck _ or
genetics _ on our side.
</P>
<P>
   CDC's prevention warriors make no such assumptions. To spend
time with them is to step into a world where you do not get points
for luck.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt works in a CDC satellite location, a smoked-glass tower
off Chamblee Tucker Road. There are two elevators serving the upper
floors of the building. There's also a colorful sign posted next to
the elevator buttons: ``Next door to the left, no waiting.'' The
next door to the left is the entrance to the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the stairwell project,'' Pratt said. ``They have
been carpeted and painted and there are pictures at each landing.
The idea is that, if you make the stairs much more attractive,
people will choose to take them. There have been several research
projects showing that this does, in fact, work.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt is the principal investigator for a joint project shared
by the CDC and 11 nations in the World Health Organization. Its
goal is measuring how much physical activity different national
groups engage in, and finding ways to encourage each to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a society we have been phenomenally successful at
engineering activity out of people's lives,'' Pratt said. ``Now we
are trying to turn the tables, to see whether there are things we
can do that put activity back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoehorning exercise into a long workday is a challenge for
almost anyone, even scientists whose job is physical-activity
research. In Pratt's office, the answer has been to make lunch do
double duty, sometimes even triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a fair amount of running at lunchtime here,'' he said.
``There are probably at least two dozen people in this center who
run pretty regularly. Sometimes we end up continuing meetings on
the run. It is definitely an office culture that is different from
other places.''
</P>
<P>
   Thought-out behaviors
</P>
<P>
   But taking personal lessons from data on preventive health isn't
unique to Pratt's office. Branche supervises researchers who gather
data on accidental deaths and injuries, from dog bites to backyard
drownings to car crashes. As a division chief, she travels
frequently, and she is famous agencywide for upbraiding taxi
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't get in a vehicle and allow it to move if I don't have
my seat belt fastened,'' Branche said. ``I have gotten into a
couple of tussles with cabdrivers in Washington, because if you are
coming out of an airport they want you to close the passenger-side
door as quickly as possible. But I learned that if you close the
door they'll start to move, and I am like, `No, we are not moving
until the seat belt's on.' So I leave the door open.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds picky. On the other hand, motor vehicle accidents
are the leading cause of death for Americans under age 25 _ and for
every such death, there are 19 hospitalizations, 233 trips to the
emergency room and 450 visits to doctors' offices. Living with
numbers like those might make anyone willing to sacrifice speedy
arrival for fastened seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Seat belt use hasn't been Branche's only take-home lesson. Her
personal expertise is in accidental drowning, the second leading
cause of death among young adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to structure my life to take into account the things
that I preach,'' she said. ``So, for instance, I have a young niece
and nephew, both under 5, who visit frequently. And I won't buy a
house with a pool _ would never think about buying a house with a
pool _ because of neighbors' children and because of my own family
members.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of thought-out behaviors goes on. She won't wear
stiletto heels. She is African-American but wears SPF 15 sunscreen.
She power-walks, but always facing traffic and never after dark.
</P>
<P>
   She also pokes fun at her own carefulness. ``I exercise four
times a week; I eat my vegetables; they say, `Drink one glass of
orange juice a day,' and guess who drinks two?
</P>
<P>
   ``My staff give me grief, affectionately. They are like,
`Christine, do you really do this stuff?' And I say, `Yes, I do. We
have to be our own best examples.'''

NEW YORK: Hotjobs.com.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What follows is an assessment of some of the 53 paid commercials
running nationally during the game _ 51 shown one time each plus 2
repeats _ that represent the new era for Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   BUDWEISER: A commercial spoofing classic ads for pet food, in
which a talking dog endorsed Budweiser beer for his owner, was the
best part of a menagerie unleashed by Anheuser-Busch that also
included horses and cats. Ads that parody other ads have become a
popular ploy for the new Madison Avenue because they give consumers
credit for being in on the joke. Agency: the Chicago office of DDB
Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER.COM: A humorous spot for Computer.com, a Web site
specializing in products for novice computer users, was emblematic
of the dot-com deluge that assaulted Super Bowl viewers. The
commercial, by Merkley Newman Harty in New York, part of Omnicom,
coyly assumed a faux naif pose by pretending to be a low-budget
home movie, as did a spot for Lifeminders.com, which was created
in-house. Both were cute but enough already!
</P>
<P>
   EDS: An inventive commercial for EDS effectively made its point
about the difficulty of technological tasks by celebrating cowboys
who herd cats rather than cattle. The humor and special effects
were outstanding. Agency: Fallon McElligott, Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ETRADE: Two hilarious commercials were among the game's best,
dot-com or otherwise, because the punch lines were linked to what
ETrade promises to achieve for online investors. One mocked the
lofty expectations for Super Sunday ads with a cheesy performing
monkey. The other, set in a hospital, reminded viewers of the
benefits of being rich. Agency: Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, San
Francisco, part of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   FEDERAL EXPRESS: This commercial, appropriating footage from
``The Wizard of Oz,'' was clever and memorable, but made it seem as
if Dorothy (Judy Garland) and the Wicked Witch of the West
(Margaret Hamilton) were endorsing Federal Express. Shilling and
pitching and peddling, oh my! Shades of the infamous Fred Astaire
vacuum cleaner campaign. Agency: BBDO New York, part of the BBDO
Worldwide unit of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   KFORCE.COM: A commercial for the Kforce.com job search Web site
owned by Romac International is indicative of a nascent trend:
comparative dot-com advertising. The spot, by Grey Advertising in
New York, showed a leering huckster who alluded to two competitors
of Kforce.com, Hotjobs.comand Monster.com, implicitly disparaging
both.
</P>
<P>
   MONSTER.COM: The sequel to last year's hugely popular Super Bowl
commercial, shown twice during the game, was more serious than its
predecessor, which perhaps accounted for its lesser popularity in
day-after ad polls. Still, the spot, focused on ``The Road Not
Taken'' by Robert Frost, was a standout, if for nothing more than
its novelty as perhaps the only game commercial ever based on a
poem. Agency: Mullen Advertising, Wenham, Mass., part of the Lowe
Group unit of Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN DEW: Two funny commercials for Mountain Dew, sold by
the Pepsi-Cola Co. unit of PepsiCo, were emblematic of a shift in
emphasis to noncola brands by the soft-drink giants. The spots, by
BBDO New York, featured parody and elaborate special effects, both
widespread trends. Another noncola Super Bowl player was Cadbury
Schweppes, which advertised 7Up in a punny spot by Young &AMP; Rubicam
Advertising in New York that was the least objectionable part of a
campaign centered on double entendres.
</P>
<P>
   NUVEEN: Special effects in a commercial for Nuveen Investments
made it seem as if the paralyzed actor Christopher Reeve could
walk. It would have been inspirational, rather than crass and more
than a little creepy, if the spot were selling increased research
for spinal-cord injuries. Agency: Fallon McElligott.
</P>
<P>
   WSJ.COM: By no means the sharpest knife in the drawer, this
spot, for the Web site of The Wall Street Journal, still made its
point with a hard-working ``product as hero'' approach. Agency:
Arnold Communications, Boston, part of Snyder Communications.

 &HT;    CDC's habits for healthy living
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEALTHY HABITS
</P>
<P>
   One of the CDC's goals is to persuade average people _ that
means you _ to weave healthy habits into their daily routines.
Among the most important:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Do the basics: Get enough sleep (eight hours nightly) and eat
right (at least five servings of vegetables and fruits a day, and
keep saturated fat low).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Look for opportunities to get even a little exercise: Walk
from the far end of the parking lot; take the stairs. Aim for 30
minutes of exercise each day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't smoke.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Review your vaccination records, and your children's. Get up
to date on any that have been missed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Buy sunscreen. Use it. Every day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Next year, get a flu shot.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wear your seat belt. Always.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Do not allow children in pools, or even bathtubs, unless an
alert adult is present.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Buy smoke alarms. Buy batteries for them. Change the batteries
twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep children in the back seat of the car until they're at
least 11 _ in an appropriate child seat, or in a seat belt when
they're older. This is not just because of potential risks from air
bags; overall, the CDC says, the back seat is safer.

 &HT;    Out of office, Gingrich aims to be man of ideas
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich may be out, but he's not down. In an update on the
former U.S. House speaker, U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($3.50) says
the new Newt is pulling down $50,000 a speech and has raised $1
million for his Committee for New American Leadership. Shunned by
his Republican political pals, Gingrich says he doubts he will ever
hold public office again. Instead, he wants to be a man of ideas.
His proposals include limiting the combined federal and state tax
load to 25 percent, repealing estate taxes, and using the Internet
as a vehicle for health care reform. ``There's no reason you can't
schedule a doctor's appointment the way you schedule an airline
ticket,'' he says. One thing Gingrich isn't talking about is the
sex scandal that derailed his political career and wrecked his
marriage.

   In what might be considered a related article, the magazine
examines the reasons we fall in love. Forget the candy and flowers.
It's all about biology and genetics and survival of the species.
Women look for healthy, tall men and men look for women with small
waists and nice legs. Sometimes they are drawn to mates who remind
them of their mothers or fathers. You can compensate for looks,
though, by showing you have a nurturing, caring side, according to
the experts.

   &QR;  The laughing game: Sometimes comedy can be tragic. In a
splendid profile of Jerry Lewis in The New Yorker ($3), James
Kaplan recounts the entertainer's roller-coaster career. ``In 1973,
with his career and his nearly thirty-year marriage sputtering,''
Kaplan writes, ``Lewis, in a Percodan haze ... put the muzzle of a
.38 revolver in his mouth.'' The sound of his young sons running
and laughing in the hall kept him from pulling the trigger. Now,
Kaplan says, Lewis is on the rebound, thanks to the popularity of
Jim Carrey and the return of physical comedy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wrestling mania: The matches are as carefully scripted as any
TV sitcom and the characters as outlandish as cartoon figures, but
apparently that doesn't bother the millions of fans who are hooked
on professional wrestling. Newsweek ($3.95) examines the boom that
has spawned best-selling books, merchandise, Web sites and
lucrative TV contracts. In a fun sidebar, Newsweek reporter Cliff
Compton spends four days at a wrestling school and lives (barely)
to tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Following the money: In a new investigative series on campaign
finance, Time ($3.95) reports on who wins and who loses. The
exhaustive investigation tells most of us what we already know: The
folks who contribute the most money to politicians get the most
benefits. One example is Chiquita Brands International, which
contributed $7 million in an effort to get Washington to pressure
Europe into allowing more Chiquita bananas into the food markets.
And Chiquita bananas are not even grown in the United States. So
who gets hurt? According to Time, small business people like Rick
Reinert of Summerville, S.C., whose German bath-product imports
were slapped with a 100 percent tariff.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tut, tut: The rumors about malevolent Egyptian spirits causing
the deaths of more than 25 people involved with the discovery of
King Tut's tomb in 1922 apparently are false. According to Details
($3), researchers have found dangerous levels of radon in several
ancient Egyptian structures, including tourist spots such as the
Sakhm Khat Pyramid at Saggara. Unlike determined archaeologists,
the average tourist isn't exposed long enough to be harmed, the
magazine reports, and officials plan to install improved
ventilation systems. Another article worth reading is U.S. poet
laureate Robert Pinsky's advice to lovers who want to pen a
Valentine's Day poem: Steal from a poem you like, pretend that
adjectives cost more than caviar, and don't rhyme.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLIS, N.H. _ Sen. Paul Wellstone, a former college wrestler
who knows a thing or two about cheerleading, got a crowd of nearly
1,000 Bill Bradley supporters here fired up Monday morning in his
high-energy style, pumping his arms and screaming at the top of his
lungs, ``We're gonna win in New Hampshire!'' over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd stood and cheered wildly. Then came Bradley. And for
the next 25 minutes, he calmed them back down with a speech that
was part lecture on the global economy and part sermon on human
goodness.
</P>
<P>
   So it went for Bradley on Monday. On the eve of New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary, a time when presidential candidates
typically dash from photo opportunity to photo opportunity,
rallying crowds with thundering stem winders, Bradley returned to
the relaxed, soft-edged, professorial approach he perfected in
front of small audiences months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if he was less than rousing on the day before the primary,
Bradley was clearly connecting with many people in his audiences,
all of which were large and enthusiastic. And it was precisely
Bradley's unwillingness, or inability, to deliver a tub-thumping,
end-of-the-campaign speech that made him seem appealing to many
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just straight, and that's what we like here,'' said
Barbara Schwartz, 60, who came to hear Bradley at the high school
here. ``We're New Hampshirites. We don't like the rah-rah stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest Bradley got to sounding like a conventional
candidate on the brink of a critical election was during a
late-afternoon speech before hundreds of charged up campaign
workers in Manchester. Yet even there, the most electrifying
speeches were delivered by his surrogates, particularly Cornell
West, the Harvard professor.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the day, Bradley's style and speech were reminiscent
of his campaign events of the fall. His voice rarely reached
Wellstone-like decibels. His sentences rambled through thickets of
complex clauses, only occasionally landing on punchy applause
lines. He dwelt on spiritual issues as much as bread-and-butter
ones. He seemed almost apologetic about asking people for their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   And after having spent nearly a week bashing his opponent, Vice
President Al Gore, as dishonest, he barely mentioned the vice
president on Monday, and usually it was part of a joke about a
rabidly anti-Knick sports announcer from Boston named Johnny Most.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say Al Gore has done a lot of negative campaigning, but
it doesn't compare to the 10 years of character assassination I
endured at the hands and words of Johnny Most,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had come under criticism in recent days from some voters
for his new, more combative style. But his aides asserted that
polls indicate that the attacks had been working. And they asserted
that Bradley had shifted tone Monday not because of concerns about
alienating undecided voters but because he wanted to finish with an
uplifting message.
</P>
<P>
   And there was inspirational oratory a plenty at every stop. ``I
want to be the president of the United States to use the power of
that office to do good,'' he told the audience at Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   After that speech, the audience gave Bradley a spirited ovation
that lasted nearly a minute. But rather than basking in the
applause, Bradley looked almost sheepish, stepping backward from
the podium and then trying to quiet the crowd like a father with a
noisy child, gently repeating, ``OK, OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was Bradley's low-key approach that Roy Swonger, 35, an
Oracle manager, found most attractive about the candidate. ``There
was no part in the speech when he was looking for applause,'' he
said. ``I'm happy to see that in a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Never comfortable with the scripted gestures of campaigning,
Bradley managed to missed several photo opportunities Monday. In
the morning, he bought a shovel in Concord and went to work
clearing part of a walkway. The display seemed aimed at
demonstrating that Bradley, who occasionally suffers from an
irregular heart beat, is in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   But no television camera crews were around to record the event.
Later, his bus stopped and an aide jumped off with the shovel. But
Bradley never got off the bus. He was concerned, apparently, about
getting to his next speech on time.

HOSPITAL SAYS IT TOLD FDA OF THREE GENE-STUDY DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ While conceding they failed to report three gene
therapy deaths to a government research agency, officials at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center emphasize that they did report
these ``adverse events'' to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
and received no response.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA ``has more experience with evaluating experimental
therapies than anyone else,'' said Dr. Michael Rosenblatt, interim
president of BIDMC, and who formerly did pharmaceutical industry
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if these things didn't get reported to a very
responsible expert organization in a timely fashion,'' Rosenblatt
said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   BIDMC officials said they felt unfairly singled out in a
Washington Post story Monday that focused on the Boston hospital's
failure to report on time the deaths to the National Institutes of
Health's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. But those
tardy reports were among a total of 652 nationwide that the RAC
received following news reports and reminders about the requirement
to report adverse events in gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The new disclosures about more deaths from patients receiving
experimental gene therapy comes as a U.S. Senate subcommittee is
holding a hearing, scheduled for Wednesday on whether federal
oversight of the research is adequate. The question has been raised
by the death of an Arizona youth in a University of Pennsylvania
gene therapy test last September. In the wake of that death, it has
been reported that a number of other deaths and illnesses in gene
therapy trials _ whether or not they were due to the experimental
treatment _ have gone unreported.
</P>
<P>
   The three deaths at BIDMC came in 1998 and 1999 as researchers
led by Dr. Richard Junghans, an oncologist at the medical center.
The test of the gene therapy, in which gene-altered immune cells
were given to terminally ill cancer patients, was suspended last
year as a result of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Leon Goldman, head of BIDMC's corporate compliance
organization, said that the physicians who looked into the deaths
felt that two of the three deaths were unrelated to the therapy and
the third was questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what the researchers concluded about the deaths,
they were required to report them to the RAC so the information
could be conveyed to other scientists carrying out gene therapy
trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody (at BIDMC) missed their reporting function,'' said
Goldman, ``but I don't think the system failed in terms of looking
after the patients' interests.''
</P>
<P>
   He said nurses caring for the patients, who were so ill they had
only weeks to live, were the first to question the three deaths in
the first six patients to get the treatment.

   WASHINGTON _ Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, one of the nation's
most prominent black Republicans, said Monday he would seek
re-election this fall, ending widespread speculation that he would
retire from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that ``there is important work left undone,'' Watts, a
42-year-old rising star in Republican circles, agreed to run for a
fourth term after House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other top
Republicans lobbied him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, the fourth-ranking House Republican, who is in charge of
the party's congressional message, had been dropping hints for
months that he and his family had tired of Washington's political
treadmill. He and his staff had clashed with aides to Rep. Tom
DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, over control of the party's
message.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Watts told supporters at a news conference in his
home state that he would stay in Congress to help shore up Social
Security and Medicare, fight for tax cuts and advocate more money
for the military.

MYSTERY SIGNAL MAY BE FROM MARS POLAR LANDER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Evidence is growing, albeit slowly, that the lost Mars Polar
Lander is the source of the mystery signal that NASA began
investigating last week, and the space agency plans to step up
efforts to talk to the craft in hopes that it is alive on the red
planet.
</P>
<P>
   Radio astronomers in England, Italy and the Netherlands are
adding dish antennas to the hunt, but the signal is exceptionally
weak _ about as strong as a cell-phone signal _ and even at the
speed of light would take 17 minutes to travel the 190 million
miles from Mars to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new hope, experts played down the chance that they
could resume communication with the wayward $165 million craft and
warned that even if communication with the lander could be
restored, its scientific mission would probably be impossible to
pursue or complete.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the craft is functioning, it may mean the mission
failed only because it had the bad luck to land in inhospitable
terrain. In that case, NASA's approach to exploring Mars would look
better than some critics had suggested after the mission failed.
The lander vanished on Dec. 3 and NASA announced on Jan. 17 that
the craft was probably dead.
</P>
<P>
   But last week the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
raced to re-establish contact with the vanished lander after
scientists at Stanford University reported that an analysis of data
gathered by their 150-foot dish antenna on Dec. 18 and Jan. 4
showed signs of an extremely weak signal from Mars.
</P>
<P>
   In Pasadena, Calif., NASA experts at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, which runs the Mars mission, warned that the signals
might be earthly interference, but this week scientists said a new
round of tests conducted at Stanford last Wednesday and Thursday
and analyzed over the weekend detected other signals that were
consistent with the tantalizing ones gathered earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a handful of candidates,'' Ivan R. Linscott, the
Stanford scientist in charge of the hunt, said in a telephone
interview on Sunday, adding that further analysis might determine
whether the putative signals were actually from the Mars craft.
</P>
<P>
   Although NASA has said it would need time to confirm that the
signals were from the lander, the Stanford team's analysis, based
on frequency shifts induced by planetary motions, is said to
strongly lessen the likelihood that the signal is terrestrial
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Murray, a former director of the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, said the scientists there ``are taking this quite
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a fluke,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the signal is coming from the lander, scientists say, it is
being transmitted through a small antenna at a frequency that was
designed for communications with the Mars Global Surveyor in orbit
a few hundred miles above the planet. NASA's antennas could not
pick up such a weak signal, but experts thought Stanford's large
dish antenna might.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has asked the Netherlands Foundation for Research in
Astronomy to add 14 highly sensitive radio antennas at its
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope center. And a spokeswoman at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Mary Harin, said the Jodrell Bank
Observatory in England and an observatory near Bologna, Italy,
would join the hunt this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Monday, NASA said the Stanford team had
detected no unambiguous signal from the data collected last week.
New commands will be sent to the lander on Tuesday and Wednesday,
with global antennas listening for a response on Friday, the agency
said.

CRITICS SAY FOR-PROFIT ROUTE NOT GOOD FOR AILING HMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three for-profit health care companies known to be
interested in buying Harvard Pilgrim Health Care generally score
lower on performance measures ranging from vaccinations to
mammography rates, according to data from a national
quality-monitoring group.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors who did the analysis said Monday the poorer scores
show that CIGNA HealthCare, Anthem Health Plans, and Oxford Health
Plans provide lower-quality care while spending more on overhead
costs such as marketing and executive salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is likely that turning over Harvard Pilgrim's 1.1 million
subscribers to any of these three for-profit companies would result
in a lowering of the quality of care, and an increase in the share
of premium dollars diverted to paperwork and profits,'' concluded
Dr. David U. Himmelstein and Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, who are
well-known for their opposition to stockholder-owned health care
companies.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brian Schilling, a spokesman for the National Committee
on Quality Assurance, which provided the HMO performance data for
the analysis, cautioned against comparing the Massachusetts health
plan with those in other regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woolhandler and Himmelstein have a lot of clout in the
industry. I'm not about to call their results spurious,'' Schilling
said. ``But it's probably premature to say for-profits are bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Himmelstein and Woolhandler asserted that deaths from breast
cancer and heart attacks would rise if Harvard Pilgrim switched to
for-profit status. They noted that nationally the three for-profit
plans had lower rates of mammography and appropriate post-heart
attack drug treatment than Harvard Pilgrim reported last year, the
most recent available data.
</P>
<P>
   For every 100,000 women enrolled in CIGNA, Himmelstein said,
there are 12,600 fewer mammograms every two years than among the
same number enrolled in Harvard Pilgrim. Judging by estimates of
mammography effectiveness, he said, that would translate into 66
more breast cancer deaths among every 100,000 middle-aged female
CIGNA subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   A CIGNA spokesman, Howard Drescher, took issue with the new
analysis, asserting that it ``significantly misrepresents CIGNA
HealthCare's performance in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to talk about Harvard Pilgrim, they need to
compare our performance in Massachusetts,'' Drescher said. ``Most
of our scores there approach those of Harvard Pilgrim.''
</P>
<P>
   Among CIGNA's 157,000 Massachusetts subscribers, 78 percent of
women between ages 52 and 69 receive mammograms every two years, as
recommended, compared to 83 percent of comparable Harvard Pilgrim
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing CIGNA's 27 plans nationally to Harvard Pilgrim, the
for-profit company's scores were often much lower on such measures
as immunization of toddlers and adolescents, mammography and Pap
smears, and obstetrical care.
</P>
<P>
   This was also true for Anthem and Oxford, although Athem
appeared to outperform Harvard Pilgrim on obstetrical care and
regular eye exams among diabetics. Attempts to reach officials at
those two companies were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Woolhandler and Himmelstein pointed out that Anthem did not
release data last year for five of its seven health plans, possibly
because scores in those plans were low. In fact, CIGNA did not
release data in 1998 because, its spokesman said, ``we needed to
get our numbers up.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, the National Committee on Quality Assurance
spokesman, acknowledged that plans' decisions not to release data
usually conceal unfavorable scores. ``Common sense would dictate
that,'' Schilling said. ``If I were their marketing person that's
what I would do.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that New England HMOs tend to perform better on
standard measures than others in regions ``that tend to have a lot
of different geographical, cultural, and other challenges you don't
have in New England.''
</P>
<P>
   But Himmelstein challenged that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regional effect is that so far we've managed to keep
for-profits out,'' he said. ``Really what it boils down to is we've
had a strong culture of not-for-profit care. Where those values
have taken a back seat, the quality has been lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolhandler and Himmelstein said the HMO industry's data show
that Harvard Pilgrim spent 8.5 percent of subscriber premium
dollars for administration compared to nearly 12 percent at CIGNA,
15 percent at Anthem, and 18 percent at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   In other Harvard Pilgrim action Monday, Massachusetts Attorney
General Thomas F. Reilly moved to block hospitals, social workers,
and mental health professionals from intervening legally in the
Harvard Pilgrim case. The Massachusetts Hospital Association, the
Massachusetts Psychiatric Association, the Massachusetts
Psychological Association and the National Association of Social
Workers filed motions to intervene with the court.
</P>
<P>
   If granted, the motions would allow the organizations special
status in the case, including the ability to question Harvard
Pilgrim and request documents. Reilly opposes the motion, partly
because he worries it will slow the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have a say in whatever happens,'' said First
Assistant Attorney General Dean Richlin. ``They need to move
quickly and have maximum flexibility. If you're trying to make stew
in six hours, and you have another six people you're consulting
with about how to make the stew, you can't make it in six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Dreyfus of the Massachusetts Hospital Association said
hospitals asked the organization to intervene. But ``we believe we
are getting the access and information we need from the attorney
general's office and the receiver,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general is not opposing petitions by the consumer
group Health Care for All and the Service Employees International
Union to act as ``friends of the court'' in the Harvard Pilgrim
case, which allows them to express opinions and share information
but not to make legal motions and ask questions in the courtroom.

 &HT;    Georgia decides to boot recruit after arrest
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ The Georgia Bulldogs on Monday withdrew their
scholarship offer from Jason Respert, the top-ranked prep offensive
lineman in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Respert, who also lost Florida's offer Sunday after his felony
arrest during a weekend recruiting trip there, probably will sign
with Tennessee on Wednesday's national signing day.
</P>
<P>
   The high school All-American from Northside High School in
Warner Robins, Ga., was arrested Saturday and charged with
attempted sexual battery and burglary. The 18-year-old Respert was
released Sunday from the Alachua County, Fla., Jail into his
mother's custody on a $50,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have discussed it with (football) coach (Jim) Donnan, and he
feels we should not continue recruiting (Respert) under the
conditions as we understand them,'' Georgia athletics director
Vince Dooley said. ``(Donnan) expressed that to me, and I was
pleased, because I feel the same way. We will not be recruiting him
any further.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Dooley also said that Georgia would ``re-evaluate'' its
stance if the charges against Respert were dropped or proved to be
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   But Respert probably would not be arraigned for four to five
weeks, according to the state attorney's office in Florida, and
then he would enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. His actual
court case could take much longer to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is national signing day, but the period extends until
April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know all the details, but there's enough that we do
know _ that is alleged _ that we believe this is a prudent stance
to take,'' Dooley said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials said Sunday and again Monday that they would
not be offering a grant-in-aid to the 6-foot-4, 301-pound Parade
Magazine All-American
</P>
<P>
   Respert could not be reached for comment on Monday. But Dawn
Sharp, who identified herself as a ``family friend,'' returned
telephone calls on the player's behalf. She said that Respert will
address the news media briefly at his house in Warner Robins at 7
a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason will read a statement about what his plans are and
address the charges,'' Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   While Georgia and Florida backed off Respert, the Vols'
scholarship offer apparently still stands. Respert apparently is
going to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still there,'' Sharp said about Tennessee's offer,
``waiting a response from Jason.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tennessee officials were guarded Monday in the
statements they made about Respert.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation the family has to deal with, and I don't
think it's appropriate to make any comments at this time,''
Tennessee AD Doug Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee sports information director Bud Ford said, ``The only
statement we're making is that (Respert) is a recruiting prospect
who made an official visit on Jan. 14.''
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports, a man entered the off-campus
apartment of a Florida freshman while she was sleeping about 6:10
a.m. Saturday. The victim claims the man removed the covers from
her bed, lifted her shirt up and put his hands down her pajama
pants before she woke up. The victim identified the man as Respert;
she said that she did not know him. He was arrested by Gainesville,
Fla., police Saturday afternoon at Florida Field.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged victim attended Respert's bond hearing Sunday in
Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Respert committed to Georgia during his Jan. 7-9 visit to
Athens. But after a visit to Tennessee the next weekend, he
reconsidered his decision and said it was ``50-50'' between the
Vols and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he said he was going to Florida ``just to be
certain'' of the decision he planned to make this week. He
apparently will make that decision public today.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of right now,'' Northside coach Conrad Nix said, ``he is
going to sign on Wednesday.''

SPORTS COLUMN: KURT WARNER GIVES HOPE TO OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Getting by on ``not a wink'' of sleep, Kurt Warner was
asked to supply a moral to his own story.
</P>
<P>
   He has been the most cooperative of athletes in this Super Bowl
of outsiders, perpetually going back over the fine points of the
$5.50-an-hour wage at the Hy-Vee grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Warner said, fidgeting a bit, suddenly out of
psychic gas. ``You tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Very well. Let's take a look at the saga of Kurt Warner, and
saga it is.
</P>
<P>
   Warner is living proof that dreams need not be put aside at an
early age. There may always be a second option, and a third option,
even when life's brutish linebackers come blitzing.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Warner never gave up. He knew what he loved, and he wanted
to keep doing it, and he might still be pitching footballs in the
Arena Football League if he had not just won a Super Bowl with the
St. Louis Rams, and that would have been all right, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting to the point of thinking how much longer am I
going to have before people say he is too old to give him an
opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of other quarterbacks who will never play in
a Super Bowl. Warner was saying he could have lived being one of
them, with the dream but not the assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been tough for us until last year, really,'' Warner
said. ``Even when I was playing arena football, we did all right,
but a lot of tough decisions, especially when you have kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started dating my wife, she was on food stamps,
and I was in between jobs. That is why I ended up stocking shelves;
I had to do something at nights so I could work out and keep my
chances in football.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner added: ``A lot of things like that have helped keep
things in perspective, even though we are not making millions of
dollars. We are very fortunate to be where we are at, in this
position, and don't look beyond that, don't take anything for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   In this dot-com world, companies have little loyalty, sacking
people on a whim, because of the erratic zigs and zags of the stock
market. There are no guarantees, but Warner's strength can be an
example.
</P>
<P>
   Monday he recalled the meat market for NFL Europe, with hordes
of hungry players shuttled to Atlanta in the winter to earn the
right to perform in those football hotbeds of Barcelona and
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was miserable,'' Warner said. ``Never want to come back here
and practice in the cold and snow again. But I knew that if I was
going to get a chance to get back here that it would be through NFL
Europe. It was ironic when we came out here last week and it was
cold and the icy rain and all that.'' He stuck it out in foul
weather early in 1998 and earned himself a trip to Amsterdam, where
he played his way back onto the Rams' squad.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he was a ``service quarterback'' as Dick Vermeil calls
it, somebody who pitches against the first-string defense, to save
the arm of the regular quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think from a quarterback's standpoint, it is easier to fall
through the cracks than maybe any other position,'' Vermeil said,
adding, ``Coaches spend a lot of time proving their decisions are
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Warner was allowed to mop up the last game, and was
exposed in the draft to stock the new Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Kurt Warner and told him exactly what we were
doing,'' Vermeil said recently. ``I didn't think anybody would take
a 27-year-old quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact was, Warner was expendable, like many people in this
fluctuating labor market. But the logic was right. The Browns did
not want a 27-year-old quarterback, so Warner was back in St. Louis
when Trent Green tore up his knee in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows what Warner has done since _ the 41 touchdown
passes, the most valuable player of the league and then of the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It is reasonable for the young in age, the young in soul, to
study Kurt Warner at this stage between obscurity and satiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just continue to follow my dreams, believe in the Lord and
live every day for what it is worth,'' Warner said. ``I don't know
if there is a moral in it. If somebody can find one and use it to
their benefit, then more power to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, for somebody operating on ``not a wink,'' living from
the energy of a fantastic and inspirational season.

ESTROGEN OFFERS HOPE AGAINST HIV 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Estrogen strongly protected against infection by
the simian AIDS virus in experiments with female monkeys, offering
hope that it might be used to protect against the human AIDS virus
in women, researchers reported here at a meeting on the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, estrogen injected into a small group of female
monkeys produced a thicker layer of cells in their vaginas. That
acted as a protective barrier against infection when SIV, the
simian AIDS virus, was squirted into the vagina to test the
effectiveness of the therapy. ``The results were striking,'' said
the head of the research team, Dr. Preston Marx of the Aaron
Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Marx and public health officials cautioned that much more
research was needed to prove that a topical estrogen cream applied
to the vagina could protect women against HIV. ``We can't assume
estrogen would have the same effect in women'' or that topical
application would be as effective as injected estrogen, Marx said
in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A reason for cautious optimism, though, is that SIV, which Marx
has been using in work with monkeys for more than 10 years, has
proved a valuable model for studying its human cousin, HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fred T. Valentine, an AIDS expert at New York University,
said that ``estrogen use might become a very important method by
which women could reduce their chances of becoming infected with
HIV through sexual intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is one of those attending this meeting, the Seventh
Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, where
scientists said that if estrogen protected in human studies, women
might be freed from having to rely on men to provide safety against
HIV through use of condoms. Further, estrogen could be particularly
useful as an inexpensive method of protection in Third World
countries, which are home to an overwhelming majority of HIV cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, Marx's team has used monkeys to study
the role of different sex hormones in vaginal transmission of SIV.
In 1996, the team reported that in a similar monkey experiment,
injection of progesterone had increased sevenfold the risk of
transmission of SIV, because that hormone thinned the layer of
vaginal cells, making it easier for the virus to reach the body's
supply of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Since progesterone and estrogen usually oppose each other's
effects in the body, ``the obvious prediction was that if one had
one effect, the other would have the opposite effect, and that
estrogen should protect,'' Marx said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the estrogen experiment, conducted at a primate center at
Tulane University, Marx worked with Dr. Stephen Smith, an
infectious-disease specialist from St. Michael's Hospital in
Newark, N.J. The monkeys' ovaries were removed to stop production
of both estrogen and progesterone, and the researchers tested three
groups of six monkeys each.
</P>
<P>
   One group received no hormone replacement, and all six became
infected after SIV was squirted into their vaginas. In a group that
received progesterone, five of six became infected. But in the
group receiving estrogen, none became infected. These six monkeys
have been repeatedly tested for SIV in the year since efforts were
made to infect them with the virus, and all have remained free of
infection.
</P>
<P>
   In the monkeys treated with estrogen, Marx said, the vaginal
layer became 25 to 50 cells thick; in those that did not get
estrogen, it was about two cells thick.
</P>
<P>
   The thickness of the vaginal layer varies with the menstrual
cycle and menopause status, Marx said, and premenopausal women
naturally produce estrogen and progesterone. But he said he assumed
that topical estrogen would increase the thickness of vaginal cells
at any given time in the menstrual cycle.

DEMOCRATIC ABORTION DEBATE MUSIC TO GOP EARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Abortion politics, which almost always agitates the
GOP, rarely causes Democratic primary candidates to squirm. No
wonder Republicans are reacting with glee _ and Democrats with a
little alarm _ to the dust-up between Al Gore and Bill Bradley over
who is more committed to a woman's right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it!'' said Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster who
spends a lot of time worrying about how the GOP can close the
gender gap. ``To have Democrats embroiled on abortion, even for a
couple of days, shows women voters that they, too, have divisions
on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights activists, who are attuned to every nuance on
the issue, say Bradley and Gore have the same position on abortion:
They support legalized abortion and are in the mainstream of the
Democratic Party, which in its 1996 platform endorsed a woman's
right to choose an abortion and to receive public funding to pay
for it, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Bradley and Gore are staunchly, solidly prochoice, and as
president each of them would ensure a woman's right to a legal
abortion,'' said Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion
and Reproductive Rights Action League. She says she's a little
exasperated that the heat of the Democratic primary in New
Hampshire has caused these candidates to shift the light from where
she believes it really belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue, and the threat they should be focusing on, is
that the Republicans _ even those who have toned down their
rhetoric on abortion in their campaigns _ are rabidly antichoice
and as president will deny women their legal rights,'' Michelman
said.
</P>
<P>
   But since polls show Bradley doing less well than Gore among
female voters, the New Jersey senator chose abortion as a way to
get women's attention and use it as a wedge issue to attack the
vice president's truthfulness and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   At a New Hampshire debate last week, Bradley challenged Gore's
credibility and credentials on abortion. The vice president said he
had never waivered in his support of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme
Court decision legalizing abortion. How then, Bradley questioned,
could Gore have opposed public funding of abortions for poor women
when he was a member of the US House in the late 1970s? As a
senator, Gore supported Medicaid funds for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, Gore also had to explain why, in letters he
wrote to constituents in 1983 and 1987, he called abortion
``arguably, the taking of a human life.'' By Saturday, Bradley was
airing a 30-second commericial accusing Gore of straddling the
abortion issue, and the vice president was admitting that ``my
position has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm puzzled; I don't understand why Gore wasn't more
forthcoming in the debate about his record on abortion,'' said
Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority and a longtime
activist for women's rights. ``In the Senate Gore was a more
forceful proponent of abortion rights than Bradley, and the Clinton
administration's record on abortion has been excellent. But that
isn't what Gore said.''
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Ferraro, the Democratic vice presidential candidate in
1984, served in the House with Gore and was troubled then by his
opposition to Medicaid funds for abortions. ``I have a problem with
Gore saying he has always been pro-choice, but I also believe that
he has grown and changed,'' Ferraro said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party doesn't welcome dissention on the abortion
issue. Since Roe v. Wade, all the party's presidential candidates
have been abortion-rights supporters. In 1992, Pennsylvania
Governor Bob Casey was refused a speaking slot at the party's
convention, reportedly because of his strong antiabortion views.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News
poll, 51 percent of all Americans support a woman's right to choose
an abortion. That's down from 60 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore isn't leaving the issue to chance. Saturday, his
campaign had Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat
who chairs the congressional women's caucus, fly to New Hampshire
and, along with Governor Jeanne Shaheen, defend the vice
president's record on abortion at a women's forum in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley is trying to create a difference where none exists,''
said Maloney, who last week got 33 other Democratic lawmakers to
sign a letter praising the Clinton-Gore administration's tough line
on abortion-clinic violence and vetoes of bills to outlaw certain
late-term abortions. ``When Bradley says he is the only pro-choice
candidate, that is unfair and untrue.''

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hard to believe that the U.S. Treasury would do anything
to make Alan Greenspan's job of effecting monetary policy more
difficult than it already is. But that is exactly what is happening
today.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's policy-makers are widely expected to vote
to raise short-term interest rates at the end of their two-day
meeting scheduled to begin in Washington on Tuesday. But some of
the tools that Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has
to cool the economy down in coming months have been dulled
considerably, thanks to the U.S. Treasury. As a result, the central
banker may have to be even more aggressive in raising rates than
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers at the central bank are in a highly unusual
situation today. The economy is strong by almost every measure and
in recent weeks, some inflation indicators have begun to stir. So
the Fed has tried to slow things down a bit by raising short-term
interest rates three times and signaling that further increases
were likely.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they have done so, yields on long-term bonds have
fallen, the opposite of what normally happens in an escalating-rate
environment. The move has created what is called an inverted yield
curve, where long-term yields fall below those on short-term
issues. Such an occurrence is atypical because investors who take
on additional risk by investing in long-term bonds are typically
paid more to do so than those who have taken on less risk by
investing in shorter-term issues.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond yield has dropped from around 6.75 percent on
Jan. 20 to 6.48 percent Monday. At the same time, the yield on the
2-year note has raced from 6.49 percent to 6.58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this oddity is the Treasury's aggressive plan to reduce
the nation's debt. Its two-pronged plan to cut back on issuing
long-term debt and to buy back as much as $45 billion in long-term
bonds has made institutions like insurance companies and pension
funds stampede into the long end of the bond market buying anything
they can. These companies need long-term bonds to offset their
extended obligations; the perception that there is going to be a
shortage of long-term U.S. Treasuries has brought these investors
into the market with a vengeance, causing yields on long-term bonds
to plunge.
</P>
<P>
   What worries some bond market participants is that this plunge
in yields will blunt the impact that the Fed's interest rate
increases will have on the economy. By raising rates, the Fed hopes
to curtail economic activity by making it more expensive to borrow.
But with long-term rates so low, shrewd borrowers who might
typically have tapped the short-term market for capital will simply
issue long-term debt. Easy access to cheap, long-term debt will
help to keep the economy hot, while the Fed wants it to cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising the Fed funds rate has a much more powerful impact
when the yield curve is steepening than when it is inverted,'' said
Timothy Irwin, principal at Irwin Capital Management in New York.
``And if it is the Treasury's actions that are causing the yield
curve to invert, these actions are effectively making Greenspan's
job more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed policy-makers consider many things, of course, when they
contemplate raising interest rates. They weigh economic data to
analyze the strength of the nation's output and scour the numbers
for evidence of inflation. But they also rely very heavily on the
behavior of the bond market to assay whether credit is too easily
available to companies issuing bonds or too tough to get.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market's moves have become a more critical
consideration for the Fed today than they had been to past central
bankers. That's because while banks once extended most of the
credit to issuers across the economy, now the capital markets are
responsible for the bulk of it. In 1975, banks accounted for 55
percent of total credit extended across the economy while capital
markets accounted for the rest. Now banks account for 30 percent,
while the capital markets dominate.
</P>
<P>
   So the Fed watches the bond market closely. In the late summer
of 1998, as Russia defaulted on its debt, the bond market's
seizures convinced the Fed to cut rates aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the inverted yield curve and the mixed signals that it is
sending to the Fed is troubling. ``It's a difficult situation
because the Fed has relied more upon capital markets to determine
how tight or tough credit terms are becoming,'' said David M. Jones
of Aubrey Lanston &AMP; Co. ``I would say anything north of 6.5 percent
on Treasury yield might have a chance of slowing down the economy.
Now suddenly we're back below 6.5 percent but you don't know what
that means.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as the Treasury's buyback of debt continues to distort
the bond market, the Fed will have to find other signals to monitor
whether credit is too lax or too tight.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to making current credit conditions more difficult
for the Fed to measure, the recent behavior of long-term bond
yields carries significant risk to financial institutions and
consumers if it continues. Anyone with an adjustable-rate mortgage
will suffer because short-term rates are high, for example. And
banks, which borrow in short-term credit markets and lend for
longer terms, will be badly hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real risk in the marketplace is a massive inverted curve
for a long time,'' said Stan Jonas of Fimat USA, a brokerage firm
in New York. By raising rates, he added, the Fed may invert the
yield curve even further with short-term rates escalating while
yields on longer-term issues continue to fall. ``This would be good
for pensioners, but bad for people with adjustable mortgages. And
it would kill the banks.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, many of the recent economic figures point to a growth
rate in the United States that is much hotter than Greenspan would
prefer. So short-term rates are expected to get a bump on
Wednesday, possible inverting the curve even more.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody said being a central banker was easy.

MICROSOFT GETS SOME SUPPORT IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft gained some prominent allies in its antitrust fight
Monday, as two former U.S. attorneys general and a pair of former
senior White House lawyers supported the software company's defense
in a court filing.
</P>
<P>
   They crafted a friend-of-the-court brief submitted by the
Association for Competitive Technology, a trade group that has
close ties to Microsoft Corp. and was founded in 1998 when the
government filed its antitrust suit against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's filing was the first of a handful of
friend-of-the-court briefs in the case, with the others scheduled
to be submitted to U.S. District Court in Washington on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Software and Information Industry Association, formerly the
Software Publishers Association, is expected to file a brief on
behalf of the government, according to a Washington lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group, whose members include the United States'
leading software companies _ including Microsoft _ is expected to
argue in its brief that Microsoft has a monopoly in the market for
personal-computer operating systems and that the company should not
be permitted to use its market power to protect its monopoly or to
give it an edge in new markets, according to the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry
Association, declined to comment on whether his group was filing a
brief on the government's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard University law professor, is also
scheduled to file a brief Tuesday. His brief is being filed at the
request of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who asked Lessig to
assess the technological ``tying'' arguments in the case. The
government charged that Microsoft illegally tied its Internet
browser, called Internet Explorer, to its industry-standard Windows
operating system, an allegation that Microsoft denies.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's brief is expected to be more a careful analysis of how
the law applies to the Internet software market than an endorsement
of either side's courtroom arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has scheduled final oral arguments for Feb. 22. At the
same time, both sides are talking with a mediator, Judge Richard
Posner, chief justice in the federal appeals court in Chicago, who
is trying to see if an out-of-court settlement can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's pro-Microsoft document was prepared by the Washington
law firm of Wilmer, Cutler &AMP; Pickering. Both Lloyd N. Cutler,
counsel to Presidents Clinton and Carter, and C. Boyden Gray,
counsel to President Bush, worked on the brief and signed it.
</P>
<P>
   Others who joined the brief supporting Microsoft include Griffin
Bell, attorney general in the Carter administration; Nicholas
Katzenbach, attorney general in the Johnson administration and
general counsel for IBM during its antitrust confrontation with the
government; and Howard J. Trienens, former general counsel for AT&AMP;T
during its court-ordered breakup.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-page document echoes Microsoft's courtroom argument that
it was an aggressive competitor but did not harm consumers and that
its conduct should not be declared illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states fought that defense in
court and continue to do so. ``Nothing in that brief can change the
facts or the law in the case,'' said a Justice Department official.
</P>
<P>
   After Jackson issued findings of fact in November that strongly
supported the government's version of the case, many legal scholars
said they expected that Microsoft would be found to have violated
the nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The brief supporting Microsoft made no mention of sanctions
against the company. But legal experts suggested that one goal
might be to give Jackson an opportunity to have second thoughts
before approving such sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message they are trying to send is that Washington
insiders and outsiders, Republicans and Democrats, can thoughtfully
conclude that this case is misguided,'' observed William Kovacic, a
professor at George Washington University law school.

A BRAVE CUBAN'S MANIFESTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS GAGEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cubans can gripe about the oppressive reality of daily life to
themselves and to foreigners, but if they try to put their
complaints into organized political activity, they invariably get
into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fate of Oswaldo Paya, one of the most respected
Cuban dissidents, whom I interviewed in Havana last month. ``Cuba
is in a very dangerous moment,'' he said, `The new wealthy (class)
is gaining control of all the assets. The United States is playing
the stability card. It wants no exodus.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Soviet Union collapsed, Fidel Castro has transformed
Cuba's economy. It now relies on European and Canadian investment,
money from tourists, and remittances from Cuban-Americans, all in
US dollars. Castro divvies up the money, with much going to the
military-security complex.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which ought to be making plans for a
long-term transition to democracy, is preoccupied with the
complexities of an imperfect trade embargo and management of the
refugee problem, as personified by Elian Gonzalez. Paya's analysis
was right on target, and he outlined a plan to transform the
country:
</P>
<P>
   --Cubans alone must define the process of change, but Cuban
exiles, ``an inseparable part of the Cuban people,'' should take an
active part in solving Cuban problems.
</P>
<P>
   --The United States should end the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   --Foreigners should not invest in Cuba until Cubans are allowed
to exercise economic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   --``Project Varela'' should be implemented. This is Paya's plan
to gather 10,000 signatures so that a bill could be presented to
the Cuban assembly to allow freedom of association and the press
and the establishment of small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba and the United States are so closely intertwined that a
cutoff of economic activity is impossible. And Cuban-Americans pour
hundreds of millions of dollars in each year to help friends and
relatives. The embargo has failed to promote Castro's overthrow or
cause him to change his ways. Paya is right that it should be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has long derided the exile community as ``gusanos'' or
worms. Yet they love their country of birth and are sustaining it
with their donations. Paya was vague as to how he would involve
them in Cuba's future, but their active support would do much to
ease the transition to a new Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Castro makes much of the damages supposedly inflicted by the
embargo, but Soviet subsidies and now foreign investment, mostly
from Europe and Canada, have done much to mitigate its effects.
</P>
<P>
   However, the lives of most people are made difficult by a
two-tier economy. Those with dollars do well, but those who depend
only on earnings in Cuban pesos cannot make ends meet. Physicians
in the state health service make the equivalent of $15 to $16 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Food is available, but it is plain fare for those without
dollars. Public transit in Havana consists of a few buses and
trucks pulling trailers, called ``camels,'' that hold 300 people.
Automobiles are few and creaky (those famous American '50s relics
are still running) but there are enough new sub-subcompact Subarus
and Fiats darting about to suggest that the government is rewarding
favored people with reliable transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Varela project, named after a famous Cuban priest, is
intended to begin a process of great change. Working within the
constitution, Paya wants to improve the economy quickly by
promoting the growth of small businesses, then begin an
unrestricted dialogue about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Castro is 73, and although he is looking remarkably hale, change
is coming when he dies. The worst scenarios have the country riven
by civil strife and US troops intervening. More likely, the army,
security forces, and the Communist Party will coalesce around an
individual or junta to maintain their grip on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans, repressed and impoverished for 40 years under Castro,
deserve better. They need an opportunity to open the economic and
political life of the country while sustaining the education and
health-care systems that are the strong points of the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want violent change,'' Paya said. ``We don't want the
strongest to be in charge.'' Even in an hour's interview, he seemed
to exhibit the compelling presence, conviction, and intelligence
that would make him a leader in a transformed Cuba. Unfortunately,
the Christian Liberation Movement, his political group, has only
400 members and is unlikely to get many more.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, he and several other dissidents were arrested as
they were about to discuss a human-rights initiative. They were
released after a few hours, but they did not hold their meeting.
The security services are adept at preventing dissidents from
coalescing into a formidable faction.
</P>
<P>
   I left Cuba the next day, impressed by the endurance of the
people in coping with everyday difficulties and Paya's courage in
seeking to get his message to Americans. Cuba is a lush island,
with a distinctive Afro-Latin culture and great potential for
economic and political growth, but when Castro's government thwarts
the aspiration of Paya and people like him, it becomes little more
than East Germany with palm trees.

RESTORING TRUST IN PROVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shooting death of Providence police officer Cornel Young Jr.
will severely test that city's public institutions in the coming
days and weeks. Incomplete or evasive answers could ignite
smoldering suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Young, the son of the department's highest-ranking black
officer, was shot by fellow officers Friday when he rushed from a
restaurant to assist police in the arrest of a gunman. Young was
off duty and in street clothes; he was mistaken for a suspect and _
according to police _ was shot when he failed to drop his weapon as
ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Early reaction suggests that Providence officials lack trust in
the average citizen. The city's mayor and police chief quickly
dismissed questions of whether race or racial profiling might have
contributed to the shooting. As of  &UR; yesterday &LR; , officials were
still refusing to identify the race or races of the police officers
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The citizenry, in turn, suspect the police. One city councilor
said his constituents were ``offended'' and ``in disbelief'' that
officials did not consider the role of race. Another councilor said
her constituents believe that ``Cornel Young Jr. was
assassinated.''
</P>
<P>
   The split-second nature of police work sometimes ends in
gruesome error. Forward-looking departments consider this when they
form ongoing partnerships with church groups and neighborhood
associations. Those community policing partnerships yield crime
tips and public cooperation. But they also yield the most precious
commodity in police work _ forgiveness when things fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Now city officials must act quickly to restore trust. The
investigation by Providence police and the state attorney general
would benefit from outside observers. The presence of a respected
organization, such as the National Organization of Black Law
Enforcement Executives, would help to assure the public that all
investigative options are explored and explained to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Without such resolve, forgiveness will be far away in
Providence.

 &HT;    Candidates court undecideds in last-minute campaigning
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The Democratic and Republican candidates
toned down their negative campaigning and romped through the snow
Monday in a final effort to win over voters in the nation's first
primary state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident of victory tomorrow night, although we might be
up a little late,'' said Arizona Sen. John McCain, buoyed by polls
showing him holding to a lead over Texas Gov. George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, seemingly unperturbed by McCain's lead, captured first
place in a pancake flip-off here. GOP rival Gary Bauer flipped
next. He watched his pancake fly overhead, lost his balance,
stumbled backward and then toppled off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   In Concord, Democrat Bill Bradley, who has sparred with the
press during this campaign, scooped up snow and tossed snowballs at
reporters and photographers. Bush strategist Karl Rove and media
advisor Mark McKinnon carried on their own snowball war with
reporters, while their candidate toured the New Hampshire
Department of Safety.
</P>
<P>
   These light-hearted moments eased the tension as the campaigns
waited for the tiny precinct of Dixville Notch to open at midnight,
the traditional beginning of the first primary day.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-charging to the end, Vice President Al Gore began his day
before dawn and made several stops, ending with a town meeting in
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a contest,'' he said as he shook hands outside a
Nashua electronics firm at dawn Monday. ''The real fight is for our
future,'' he added, alluding to the fall campaign against the
Republican Party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush revealed in documents filed with the Federal
Election Commission that he raised another $11 million in the last
quarter of 1999 bringing his total to $68.7 million, the highest
total of all the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor had $38.4 million left in the band at the end
of the year, compared to $7.7 million for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush already has spent almost as much money _ $37.3 million _ as
most of the other candidates will be allowed to spend for their
entire campaigns. Bush is not accepting federal matching funds so
he is not bound by spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, Bradley raised some $8 million in the
last quarter, twice that raised by Gore, who reported $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Gore has raised $29 million, plus $2.9 million to pay
legal and accounting costs in the general election. Bradley has
raised $27.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   After days of attacking Gore for distorting his record, Bradley
wound down his campaign on a more positive note. He described his
contest with Gore as a choice between the ``old politics'' of
distortion and the ``new politics'' of telling voters what you are
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that when the returns are announced tomorrow night that
independent voters in New Hampshire will have sent a message to the
country that we can create a new kind of politics,'' Bradley told
400 supporters in Hollis.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned Gore only briefly in his remarks to voters Monday,
telling crowds that he was forced to become more critical of the
vice president because of what he called ``months of distortions.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a choice in this campaign,'' Bradley told a packed crowd
in Derry. ``I'm not prepared to settle. Al Gore is prepared to
settle.''
</P>
<P>
   Two senators supporting Bradley, Bob Kerry and Paul Wellstone,
held a news conference to answer House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt's charge that Bradley had turned the Democratic contest
into a divisive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ``may not end up on Gore's short list, or even his
Christmas card list, but we're all going to be reunited after this
is over,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also sought to strike a positive note after days of sharp
exchanges between the two Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to confine my campaign to the issues, as I have from
the beginning,'' Gore told a diner breakfast crowd, emphasizing the
issue of ''how we keep our prosperity going.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as he mingled with a lunchtime restaurant crowd in
Concord, he asserted that responsibility for the negative tone of
the campaign rests with Bradley. ''Personal attacks, no, I have not
engaged in them and I won't.''
</P>
<P>
   But gone from Gore's standard stump remarks was the often
repeated comment that Bradley is ''a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore kept up a hectic pace throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to be campaigning full blast every minute of every
hour between now and (when the polls close Tuesday), leaving off a
few hours for sleep tonight,'' Gore said in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning with his wife and four of his children, held
five rallies across the state.
</P>
<P>
   The former POW stressed his experience as a Navy captain and a
foreign policy expert in the Senate, saying he would ``not need
on-the-job training'' as president and suggesting the same would
not be true of the other Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, McCain repeated the line that has become his
signature in the closing days of the New Hampshire campaign. ``I
will always tell you the truth, no matter what,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush kept things light after his pancake contest, sledding down
a 150-yard hill in Bedford with 13-year-old twins, Laura and Lizzy
Saggau, of Merrimack, along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   But his aides fired a shot at McCain, raising questions about
the senator's spending in New Hampshire and in South Carolina where
the GOP contenders will compete in that state's Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials said McCain, who has had made campaign
finance reform a central issue, has spent $2.1 million in New
Hampshire, much of it on television ads airing in Boston, Mass. and
far in excess of the $660,000
</P>
<P>
   spending cap. They said he spent $1.5 million in South Carolina,
approaching that state's $1.6 million cap.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has spent $3.3 million in New Hampshire and nearly $1.7
million in South Carolina. However, since he has declined federal
matching funds, Bush is not subject to the spending limits.

 &HT;    Nursing for dummies: Students get hands-on experience
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ She's been having trouble breathing, the patient
tells nurse Mindy Stamm in the emergency room. It's been going on
for a day or so. Her feet are swollen, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been coughing often?'' asks Joanne Crawford, the
respiratory therapist. All night, the patient says. She had to
sleep in her recliner. Another nurse, Stephanie Thompson, puts a
stethoscope to the patient's chest and hears her breathe with the
crackling sound of Rice Krispies in milk.
</P>
<P>
   Stamm asks if she's ever had heart trouble. She had a heart
attack about two years ago. Medication? Oh, what are those little
white pills called? The patient can't remember. And she used to
take another kind of pill, but it made her go to the bathroom too
often so she quit. Now that Stamm brings it up, though, it's been
about a day since the last time she went.
</P>
<P>
   Stamm props up the patient's head, and Crawford puts an oxygen
tube in her nostrils. It's clear by now that she has congestive
heart failure, her heart pumping so ineffectively that her lungs
are filling with fluid, so Stamm administers the diuretic drug
Lasix through her intravenous tube.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else are you going to give her?'' Louis Conn asks, and
the four discuss alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Conn is able to interrupt the patient's care and start this
discussion because the patient is just a lifeless dummy.
</P>
<P>
   The patient, named Pat for gender ambiguity, is the Human
Patient Simulator at Sinclair Community College, where Stamm and
Thompson are nursing students and Crawford is Conn's respiratory
care student. With plastic and microchips in place of skin and
bones, Pat can replicate the symptoms and vital signs of many
diseases and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   As patient simulators grow as commonplace as, say, flight
simulators, Conn expects them to change the way health-care
professionals are taught, evaluated and retrained on new
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   In the year that Sinclair has used Pat in its health-care
disciplines, students have been able to practice instead of
pretending. Rather than matching written responses to described
circumstances, the students have been interpreting wavy lines on
monitors, drawing conclusions from the sounds of breathing and
heartbeats, making quick decisions, working together with
colleagues and seeing for themselves what happens to a patient when
they do the right or wrong things with real machines and
medications.
</P>
<P>
   The three second-year students, who met Pat last fall, agree
that books and lectures can't begin to engender the confidence
they've developed from knowing they restored Pat's vital signs to
normal when the wrong actions would have stopped its heart and
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer always wants us to be more knowledgeable than
they are,'' Thompson said, ``but they don't want us to practice on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the patient with congestive heart failure, Conn and the
students agree that some morphine is a good idea not only to
relieve the gasping patient's anxiety but also for dilating the
blood vessels and taking pressure off the heart. As Stamm connects
the morphine IV, she hears the patient's bladder already emptying
from the Lasix.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make sure the student is actually assessing the
effects of the drug instead of just saying, `I would then check for
urine,''' says Wanda Jelus, the nursing instructor who provided
Pat's voice in the simulated ER while Conn operated the computer.
Thompson, who had the stethoscope, says she could hear Pat's
breathing sounds clear up as the Lasix had time to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Lasix and morphine aren't real, of course. They have bar
codes scanned into Pat's computer, programmed to respond to more
than 50 drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair's patient simulator is one of about 100 worldwide
manufactured by Medical Education Technologies Inc. only since
1997. While METI's simulators are better suited for teaching allied
health fields in community colleges, Sinclair nursing director
Gloria Goldman says another company makes simulators that are used
more for replicating the effects of anesthesia. The only two other
simulators in Ohio are at Columbus State Community College and
Case-Western Reserve University in Cleveland, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair bought the $225,000 mannequin two years ago, and the
school added METI's new pediatric model in December. It took more
than a year to program and prepare Pat for teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Talking with other schools that use simulators, Goldman says she
heard a story about a Florida nursing student in a hospital ER with
some doctors who couldn't figure out what was wrong with the
patient. ``I think this patient has a pulmonary embolism,'' the
student offered.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right, muttered the eye-rolling doctors as they continued
discussing what the patient's symptoms might add up to. Just like
in the movies, the student turned out to be right about the
embolism, an obstruction of a blood vessel in the lungs. She had
seem the same symptoms on the simulator just that week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really real,'' Crawford says. ``They have it fine-tuned
so that when it gets asthma, everything that goes with an asthma
attack actually happens.''
</P>
<P>
   As Pat's asthma attack develops, its pulse, breathing rate and
blood pressure go up and its oxygen level drops. Through a
stethoscope, wheezing is audible in the lungs. Its body temperature
can fluctuate, its eyes can blink or its pupils can become fixed
and dilated.
</P>
<P>
   Pat is a standard, conscious man in this case, but the
instructor's array of choices include a smoker with high blood
pressure, a wounded soldier, a pregnant woman undergoing
complications and an elderly patient. The asthma attack is one of
more than 50 afflictions programmed into Sinclair's simulator,
along with gastro-intestinal bleeding, insulin shock, a diabetic
coma and a variety of heart and lung problems and circumstances
under anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   Asthmatic Pat is getting worse and needs to be intubated, a tube
threaded through its throat to the lungs. As Crawford inserts the
tube, she runs into difficulty where Pat's vocal cords have
constricted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team effort,'' she says, squeezing oxygen through the
tube while Stamm listens to both of Pat's lungs. Intubating a
patient is tricky business. If the tube goes too far down, Stamm
will hear oxygen reaching only one lung. If the tube takes the
wrong path down the esophagus, the oxygen will gurgle into the
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were in a clinical setting, we couldn't let students
make mistakes,'' says Jelus, the nursing teacher. ``But this way
they can go ahead and kill it. We'll just back it up and do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the simulator in her freshman year, Crawford says, ``It
was scary to go out there and hook things up to a patient.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' says Stamm, ``you get that fear of making a mistake
out of the way before you see a patient. When you go into that
patient's room, you have to be confident.''
</P>
<P>
   When they learn something in class, she says, they can apply it
right away. The whole class can. Conn has more than once seen a
dicey scenario at the hospital, programmed it into Pat and had an
entire class experience it.
</P>
<P>
   Before Pat, the students would have pretended to treat each
other for the problem. But students are pretty healthy. Their lungs
all sound the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first things you do in the hospital is listen to
breathing sounds,'' Crawford says. That's how diagnoses are made
quickly. ``It would have been nice to hear actual breathing sounds
in class from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretending doesn't generate data on the monitors, either, and
somehow monitors never look like those textbook pictures a student
tries to memorize. ``There's a big difference between book
knowledge and how you apply your knowledge,'' Thompson says.
</P>
<P>
   In a word, that difference is speed. ``When we go through mock
situations, whatever works one time doesn't necessarily work
another,'' she says. ``We have to critically think and make quick
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   They also learn to manipulate medical devices in a hurry. A
respiratory therapist might have to guide a tube down a pneumonia
patient's airway to suction out fluids, Crawford says. ``You have
to do it quickly and you have to stay sterile. The only way to
learn it is to practice it time and time again.''
</P>
<P>
   The students will leave Sinclair next spring and start working
full time on patients within the next two years. But they plan to
keep in touch with Pat.
</P>
<P>
   Active nurses, respiratory therapists, paramedics and medical
and dental residents already are coming to Sinclair to use Pat in
continuing education. As Thompson says, ``There's not a patient out
there who's willing to let you experiment on them.''

POWER-SHARING IS IN PERIL, ULSTER UNIONIST WARNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Northern Ireland's new power-sharing government could
be indefinitely suspended if an imminent report on disarmament does
not disclose moves by the Irish Republican Army to scrap its
arsenal, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble warned on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble made the comment against a background of near certainty
that the report by Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada, head of an
independent disarmament panel, would offer little evidence of IRA
willingness to give up its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The keenly awaited document was delivered to the British and
Irish governments, the BBC reported early Tuesday, and they were
expected to spend some time examining it to see if there is
anything that could be construed as positive before making its
contents public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have the actions necessary to maintain confidence
in this process, then this process will go into abeyance _
temporarily, I hope,'' said Trimble, who is also first minister of
the Northern Ireland Assembly, which gained the power to govern
Ulster only two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the vexing problem of weapons emerging again as an obstacle
to political progress, there is a growing likelihood that, in order
to forestall a complete collapse of the fragile new government, a
coalition of Catholic republican and Protestant unionist parties,
Britain will have to reimpose the direct rule from London it
removed in December.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly and other new governmental bodies were set up under
the April 1998 settlement aimed at ending a conflict between rival
Catholic and Protestant paramilitary forces that led to the deaths
of more than 3,300 people in the past three decades. Putting the
terms of the accord into effect has become repeatedly deadlocked
over the issue of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has warned that though his party
is the political representative of the IRA, it cannot compel the
underground army to start turning over its weapons now. In response
to Trimble's warning, he said that if the government was suspended,
the IRA might never agree to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me that it would be very difficult to keep the IRA
in there if the institutions were removed,'' Adams said. IRA
representatives have been meeting with de Chastelain in what has
been the clandestine organization's first official involvement in
the political life of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Adams contended that this development and the fact that the IRA
has maintained a cease-fire for more than two years demonstrated
its commitment to peace. But Trimble said a ``clear promise'' for a
start to disarming by now had been given during the review
conducted last fall by George J. Mitchell, the former U.S. senator
and mediator of the Northern Ireland peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Trimble took the politically bold step of
persuading his Ulster Unionist party to drop its ``guns before
government'' insistence that the IRA must begin disarming before
the Ulster Unionists would enter government side by side with Sinn
Fein. To attract support for his decision to participate in the new
power-sharing administration, he vowed he would resign his
leadership of the assembly and his party if there were no
disarmament moves by the IRA by February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually jumped first and took a very substantial risk,''
Trimble said on Monday. ``It's time for other people to be as bold,
to take the same sort of risk we did, not to be hiding away.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble gained support from Seamus Mallon, the deputy first
minister of the assembly and a senior member of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, the province's largest Catholic
grouping. ``You have a responsibility to jump as well,'' he said,
speaking of Adams. ``You agreed to it, and the understanding was
clear in the Mitchell review. Decommissioning has got to be dealt
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble appears to be counting on the British to suspend the
Belfast government before a scheduled Feb. 12 meeting of the Ulster
Unionists' 860-member party council. Under present circumstances,
he could be forced to make good on his promise to step down. The
leading contenders to succeed him are opposed to the peace
settlement and would be less willing partners with Britain and
Ireland in trying to sustain the accord.

 &HT;    Man happens upon war flag he signed at Japanese surrender
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Old soldiers and their stories are
legion in Bill Muir's Palm Beach store, Grand Armee. Muir sells
military memorabilia, tin soldiers, uniforms from the Raj, swords,
books, all things military and historical. But the stories are
priceless.
</P>
<P>
   Like the old guy who came in wearing a baseball cap with a
military insignia. A lot of guys wear caps like that, says Muir,
maybe with a destroyer's or sub's name, a division or regiment,
Navy SEALS, that sort of thing. But this old guy's cap said French
Foreign Legion, 1st Paratroop Regiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the guy,'' says Muir, ``and I'm thinking, `Sure,
pal. Right, you were in the Legion. Sure.' I thought I could snare
him. So I asked him how long he was in for, because the minimum
Legion enlistment was five years, usually seven.
</P>
<P>
   Three years, says the guy. And Muir thinks, Gotcha.
</P>
<P>
   The old guy detects Muir's skepticism and says, ``My regiment
was disbanded in Algiers in the early '60s, when France gave
Algeria its independence. We were the infamous 1st para regiment,
disloyal to DeGaulle. You know, Day of the Jackal and all that? The
regiment was scrubbed from French military histories. That's why I
served only three years. We were so mad we blew up everything
before we left, blew up the barracks, trucks, weapons. The chaplain
even blew up his chapel.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow, thought Muir.
</P>
<P>
   Another time an old guy comes into the store. He has an East
European accent Muir can't quite place. They start talking about
the war. That's World War II. The old guy quietly says he spent the
last months of the war in Dachau.
</P>
<P>
   Another old guy is at the counter. He's listening to the story.
He turns to the other fellow and says he was with Patton's 4th
Armored Division, the one that liberated Dachau.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later the two old men exit the store, talking, on their
way to share a lunch. And memories.
</P>
<P>
   But Lester Peskin's story is one of the best, says Muir.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Peskin is 83, tall, fit, white hair combed back, sharp
eyes and quick of wit. After 50 years of practicing restaurant law
in New York, he moved to Boca Raton in 1996, two years after
Dorothy, his wife of almost 50 years, died. His two daughters and
four grandchildren live up north. He's alone, but not lonely. He
golfs, takes classes in the history of Judaism and the Old
Testament. He even had a second bar mitzvah last year _ he is,
after all, 13 years beyond the Bible's three score and ten.
</P>
<P>
   And, he browses stores, including Grand Armee.
</P>
<P>
   He was young once and believed he would die young, as a
lieutenant, a company commander in the 108th Regiment, 40th
Division. He thought he'd die in the invasion of Japan scheduled
for the fall of 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I'd come home. We just went from island to
island, battle to battle, and it seemed like it would last forever.
Guadalcanal, mopping up on New Britain, went ashore on Luzon with
MacArthur, Mindanao. Mopping up, now there's an expression. Snipers
and booby traps and sickness _ malaria, dysentery, you name it. I
became company commander because all the captains either got shot
or got sick. Or promoted out to someplace where they'd get shot or
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 1942 and 1943. And 1944. And 1945. A lifetime for a
23-year-old. For many in Peskin's anti-tank company, it was.
</P>
<P>
   But Peskin came home whole, married Dorothy and settled down to
law and family.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months ago, a New Jersey collector sent Muir a large
Japanese flag, on consignment. The flag had been taken at a
Japanese surrender ceremony in late August 1945, in Korea. It was
signed by more than 100 U.S. soldiers from the 108th Regiment, 40th
Division. It went home with a GI, then to his attic, then to his
nephew's attic after the old soldier died. Then to the collector.
And finally, to Grand Armee.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the flag arrived at Grand Armee, Lester Peskin and
one of his daughters wandered in. They browsed. Lester noticed the
flag, gazed at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, I signed a flag like that once,'' says Peskin.
``But a lot of Japanese flags were signed by a lot of U.S.
soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Then his daughter stopped short. ``Daddy,'' she said. ``There's
your name.''
</P>
<P>
   And there it is, in the lower left corner of the flag: Lt.
Peskin, New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wave of emotion came over me, a big one,'' says Peskin. ``It
was like the time some years ago I visited a GI cemetery on the
French-Belgian border, those crosses and stars stretching far into
the distance. I lived my whole life between the day I signed that
flag and the time I saw it again. Fifty-four years. So much time.
Gone so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester Peskin was more than just a signatory to the flag. He was
the commanding officer that day, the guy who took the flag from a
Japanese marine captain in a formal surrender ceremony at a small
air base at Pohang, on the east coast of Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war was over, but you never knew if word had got out to
all the Japanese,'' says Peskin. ``This Japanese captain outranked
me. He said he wouldn't surrender to me. I had my men behind me; he
had his. `You're gonna surrender,' I told him. The translators went
back and forth. I didn't know who was saying what. The captain and
I looked at each other. He surrendered.''
</P>
<P>
   Peskin gave the flag to one of his men.
</P>
<P>
   After the surrender, Peskin was promoted to captain and
appointed military governor of the region. Six months later he went
home. He never thought about the flag again for 54 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my daughters were little, they wanted to hear war
stories,'' he says. ``They loved the tales. But I never told them
how it really was. You had to be there. The horror, the heat, the
disease. The dead. The war.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandson is 24. He doesn't know anything about the war,''
he says. ``They don't teach it in school, you know. Maybe they will
someday. But we'll all be gone. Those guys on the flag? They're
probably all dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good outfit. They were good guys.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Lester Peskin is gone, heading to his Old Testament
history class.
</P>
<P>
   The flag is worn, fading to yellow, framed under glass. The
names scribbled in pen and pencil are still visible. But they too
are fading away.

 &HT;    Candidates court undecideds in last-minute campaigning
 &HT;    (EDS: CORRECTS FIGURES in 9th graf to $31.4 million; corrects

 &HT;    By Tom Baxter

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The Democratic and Republican candidates
toned down their negative campaigning and romped through the snow
Monday in a final effort to win over voters in the nation's first
primary state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident of victory tomorrow night, although we might be
up a little late,'' said Arizona Sen. John McCain, buoyed by polls
showing him holding to a lead over Texas Gov. George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, seemingly unperturbed by McCain's lead, captured first
place in a pancake flip-off here. GOP rival Gary Bauer flipped
next. He watched his pancake fly overhead, lost his balance,
stumbled backward and then toppled off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   In Concord, Democrat Bill Bradley, who has sparred with the
press during this campaign, scooped up snow and tossed snowballs at
reporters and photographers. Bush strategist Karl Rove and media
advisor Mark McKinnon carried on their own snowball war with
reporters, while their candidate toured the New Hampshire
Department of Safety.
</P>
<P>
   These light-hearted moments eased the tension as the campaigns
waited for the tiny precinct of Dixville Notch to open at midnight,
the traditional beginning of the first primary day.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-charging to the end, Vice President Al Gore began his day
before dawn and made several stops, ending with a town meeting in
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a contest,'' he said as he shook hands outside a
Nashua electronics firm at dawn Monday. ''The real fight is for our
future,'' he added, alluding to the fall campaign against the
Republican Party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush revealed in documents filed with the Federal
Election Commission that he raised another $11 million in the last
quarter of 1999 bringing his total to $68.7 million, the highest
total of all the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor had $31.4 million left in the bank at the end
of the year, compared to $7.7 million for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush already has spent almost as much money _ $37.3 million _ as
most of the other candidates will be allowed to spend for their
entire campaigns. Bush is not accepting federal matching funds so
he is not bound by spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, Bradley raised some $8 million in the
last quarter, twice that raised by Gore, who reported $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Gore has raised $29 million, plus $2.9 million to pay
legal and accounting costs in the general election. Bradley has
raised $27.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   After days of attacking Gore for distorting his record, Bradley
wound down his campaign on a more positive note. He described his
contest with Gore as a choice between the ``old politics'' of
distortion and the ``new politics'' of telling voters what you are
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that when the returns are announced tomorrow night that
independent voters in New Hampshire will have sent a message to the
country that we can create a new kind of politics,'' Bradley told
400 supporters in Hollis.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned Gore only briefly in his remarks to voters Monday,
telling crowds that he was forced to become more critical of the
vice president because of what he called ``months of distortions.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a choice in this campaign,'' Bradley told a packed crowd
in Derry. ``I'm not prepared to settle. Al Gore is prepared to
settle.''
</P>
<P>
   Two senators supporting Bradley, Bob Kerry and Paul Wellstone,
held a news conference to answer House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt's charge that Bradley had turned the Democratic contest
into a divisive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ``may not end up on Gore's short list, or even his
Christmas card list, but we're all going to be reunited after this
is over,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also sought to strike a positive note after days of sharp
exchanges between the two Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to confine my campaign to the issues, as I have from
the beginning,'' Gore told a diner breakfast crowd, emphasizing the
issue of ''how we keep our prosperity going.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as he mingled with a lunchtime restaurant crowd in
Concord, he asserted that responsibility for the negative tone of
the campaign rests with Bradley. ''Personal attacks, no, I have not

<P>
   But gone from Gore's standard stump remarks was the often
repeated comment that Bradley is ''a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore kept up a hectic pace throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to be campaigning full blast every minute of every
hour between now and (when the polls close Tuesday), leaving off a
few hours for sleep tonight,'' Gore said in Concord.

<P>
   McCain, campaigning with his wife and four of his children, held
five rallies across the state.
</P>
<P>
   The former POW stressed his experience as a Navy captain and a
foreign policy expert in the Senate, saying he would ``not need
on-the-job training'' as president and suggesting the same would
not be true of the other Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, McCain repeated the line that has become his
signature in the closing days of the New Hampshire campaign. ``I
will always tell you the truth, no matter what,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush kept things light after his pancake contest, sledding down
a 150-yard hill in Bedford with 13-year-old twins, Laura and Lizzy
Saggau, of Merrimack, along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   But his aides fired a shot at McCain, raising questions about
the senator's spending in New Hampshire and in South Carolina where
the GOP contenders will compete in that state's Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials said McCain, who has had made campaign
finance reform a central issue, has spent $2.1 million in New
Hampshire, much of it on television ads airing in Boston, Mass. and
far in excess of the $660,000
</P>
<P>
   spending cap. They said he spent $1.5 million in South Carolina,
approaching that state's $1.6 million cap.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has spent $3.3 million in New Hampshire and nearly $1.7
million in South Carolina. However, since he has declined federal
matching funds, Bush is not subject to the spending limits.

THERMO ELECTRON RESTRUCTURES TO MORE FOCUSED UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes new companies text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thermo Electron Corp., once a luminary of Massachusetts' ``Route
128'' economy, announced Monday a long-awaited restructuring that
closes the door on its unusual strategy of ``spinning out''
businesses based on emerging technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The company had made a name for itself in the 1970s and 1980s
with its policy of selling off minority stakes in its subsidiaries
to public investors. But since the mid-1990s, the Waltham, Mass.
company has disappointed investors as it tried to juggle the
complexities and poor financial performance of as many as two dozen
such spinouts.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in a bid to streamline and get back on track, the
company said it will split into three separate, publicly traded
companies and sell businesses with annual sales of $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of the new companies will retain the Thermo Electron
name and focus on the instruments businesses that had been the core
of the old Thermo Electron; Thermo Fibertek, which will focus on
recycling technologies, mainly for the pulp and paper industry; and
a medical products company.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it plans to sell more than a half dozen
other businesses that do not fit with the three new companies _ a
move that will raise about $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a very radical restructuring,'' said Richard
Syron, Thermo Electron's chairman, president and chief executive.
Syron, who previously was president of the American Stock Exchange
in New York, joined Thermo Electron last spring to lead a
turnaround at the company founded in 1956 by George Hatsopoulos, a
Greek immigrant and former MIT professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic structure as a company with many parts just did not
work, given the changes in industrial practices and financial
markets,'' said Syron, who added that no immediate layoffs are
planned.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that Thermo Electron's structure _ two dozen
companies, each majority owned by the parent company with the rest
owned by public investors _ had become too unwieldy. The
complicated setup also made it difficult to distribute products, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And he added that the spinout strategy is no longer successful
on Wall Street because it resulted in too many obscure stocks with
little following among analysts and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Syron's announcement of the sweeping changes came after company
founder George Hatsopoulos, who ran the company for 44 years,
stepped down as chairman last month. At the time, he said he agreed
with the sweeping changes Syron and Thermo Electron's board of
directors were implementing. (Hatsopoulos turned the CEO job over
to Syron in June.)
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Thermo Electron's stock price rose a modest 1 1/16 to
close at 17 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   The stock did not react much to the news because Wall Street
investors had been first told in May that Thermo Electron planned
to streamline from 23 businesess to 11.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the changes ``are a little more aggressive than I
expected,'' said Jill Lehman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Global
Securities, ``but they are all very positive because it moves
Thermo Electron in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman cautioned that it is still difficult to determine the
profit levels the company will achieve without its other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Thermo Electron's instruments businesses will be
consolidated into a new company with the same name. Those
operations have annual sales of $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A second company, with yearly sales of $225 million, will focus
on recycling and resource recovery technology and will be formed
around Thermo Fibertek and Thermo Fibergen. The third business,
which will make medical instruments and devices, will have annual
sales of $335 million.
</P>
<P>
   Existing Thermo Electron investors will receive shares of the
latter two companies as a stock dividend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syron recognizes that Thermo Electron needs a clear and
aggressive strategy which they are showing with this
reorganization, so the question now is can they develop new
products, market them effectively and execute on their business
plan,'' said Paul R. Knight, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners,
a New York investment firm. ``That's the next leg in this race.''
</P>

EUROPEAN UNION WARNS AUSTRIA ABOUT ANTI-IMMIGRANT PARTY JOINING
GOVERNMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The European Union warned on Monday that its 14 other
members would diplomatically isolate Austria if its anti-immigrant
Freedom Party led by Jorg Haider enters a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, issued in Portugal, said the other members of the
European Union ``will not promote or accept any bilateral official
contacts at a political level'' with any Austrian government that
included Haider's party. Portugal now holds the European Union's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian candidates for posts in international organizations
would find no support, it said, and Austrian ambassadors ``will
only be received at a technical level.''
</P>
<P>
   It said that ``the Portuguese prime minister and the minister of
foreign affairs had already informed the Austrian authorities that
there would be no business as usual in the bilateral relations with
a government integrating'' Haider's party.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Portuguese television, Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres of Portugal justified the action, saying: ``We had to send
a very clear signal that behavior of a racist or xenophobic
character will not be tolerated within the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the union has issued such a warning to a
member state. Austrians were shocked, and a diplomatic crisis seems
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it strange if the 14 EU states were to come to such a
decision without consultations with the member state Austria,'' The
Associated Press quoted Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's own reaction, Reuters said, was that if the president
and other parties bowed to foreign pressure, ``then we might as
well abolish democracy in this country straight away.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it became clear last week that Haider had a chance of
being in the government, the European news media have been full of
articles implying that Nazism is on the rise in Austria, a charge
that many Austrians vigorously reject and resent.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's party, which favors cutting off immigration to Austria
and preventing European Union expansion because it is likely to
bring more eastern Europeans over Austria's borders, came in second
in the October elections, with 27 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The party's share of the votehas grown from 5 percent when
Haider took over in 1986, but political analysts say it is not
entirely because of its stance on immigration. Instead, they say,
the party's supporters are fed up with the cozy patronage
relationship between the Social Democrats, in power for 30 years,
and the People's Party, which has governed jointly with them for
the last 13.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the first-place Social Democrats and the third-place
People's Party failed to revive their coalition. So Haider began
negotiations with the People's Party on forming a coalition with
104 seats in the 183-seat legislature, squeezing out the Social
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Israel immediately reiterated a threat made in October to cut
off diplomatic relations. Other European countries, led by France
and Belgium, steadily ratcheted up their denunciations.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Austrians seemed dumbstruck on Monday by the European
announcement. ``This is very, very, very, very strange,'' said
Alexander van der Bellen, the leader of the Green Party, which came
in fourth in October. ``As an Austrian, I feel terrible. As head of
the Green Party, I can only say that we wanted to block the
participation of the Freedom Party in government, but still. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The threats, he said, would probably only make Austrians more
likely to snap back that ``no foreigners can tell us what to do,''
as was the case when they elected Kurt Waldheim as president after
he had been soundly condemned abroad for lying about the fact that
he had been an officer in a German army unit that committed
atrocities in Yugoslavia during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Haider contends that the hostility is really panic by Social
Democrats elsewhere Europe and that even Israel is reacting largely
to the prospect of an ally being forced out of power.
</P>
<P>
   He also says his critics know almost nothing about him.
President Jacques Chirac of France, Haider said this weekend,
``greeted me warmly at a state reception'' not long ago, ``and now
suddenly he is against us.''
</P>
<P>
   The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, gave a radio
interview on Monday in which he enumerated ways that a European
country could be punished if it was found to have violated
fundamental human rights.
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``what we want is for them to give up'' on plans to
let the Freedom Party into government. ``But if they don't, then
Austria will be under surveillance as no country has ever been in
the European Union,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to characterize Haider because his positions are
all over the political map. Van der Bellen of the Green Party has
called him an opportunist and a ``political chameleon,'' and many
Austrian analysts agree. Imitating Newt Gingrich, he calls his
platform, ``Contract With Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   He is definitely opposed to more immigration, and has used the
word ``over-foreignization,'' which many find redolent of Naziism.
He implies that immigrants are responsible for Austria's crime rate
and ``drug problem,'' although both are negligible, for welfare
fraud and for increases in tuberculosis in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   His words may fall on receptive ears because Austrians are
heavily taxed, and until recently, the country has had liberal
asylum policies and benefits for Balkan refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But he also gives voice to the frustration with the bickering
and the patronage machines of the Social Democrats and the People's
Party, a renamed Christian Democrat party. Austrians are so
disgusted with the two parties' failure to form a government since
October that polls suggest that if new elections were held today,
Haider would get 33 percent of the vote.

BRITISH DOCTOR GETS 15 LIFE TERMS IN PATIENT DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ An English doctor was convicted Monday of killing 15 of
his female patients by injecting them with heroin and may face
charges in at least 23 other killings. Authorities said he is
suspected in the deaths of more than 100 others.
</P>
<P>
   Police say that Dr. Harold Shipman, 54, who once seemed to
epitomize the kindly, house-calling English general practitioner,
is probably Britain's most prolific serial killer. He was sentenced
Monday to 15 life sentences for the murders by a judge who
described him as ``a wicked, wicked man'' who had engaged in a
``calculated and cold-blooded perversion'' of his Hippocratic oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have little doubt that each of your victims smiled and
thanked you as she submitted to your fearful administration,''
Preston Crown Court Judge Thayne Forbes told Shipman, who showed no
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   While Shipman's four-month trial for the deaths of his 15 mostly
elderly patients from 1995 to 1998 was widely publicized and
followed one of the biggest police investigations in British
history, it was not until Monday that the public became aware of
the enormity of his alleged crimes. Under British law, the
authorities and the media are not allowed to disseminate
incriminating information about a suspect until a trial is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as Forbes passed sentence on Shipman, Greater
Manchester police and other local authorities said they believe
that he killed more than 100 patients by injecting them with
morphine or heroin, and covered up his crimes by altering medical
records and cremating many of the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Pollard, the South Manchester coroner, said it was
``reasonable to assume'' that Shipman killed 120 to 150 people.
Police say they have investigated 136 suspicious deaths of
Shipman's patients over the past decade. The local prosecutor,
Robert Davies, said his office was considering additional charges
in consultation with victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of Shipman's murderous practice in the small town of
Hyde, just outside Manchester in northwest England, is just sinking
in. The British government is expected to announce Tuesday a formal
inquiry into the circumstances under which Shipman was able to kill
so many of his patients before being found out.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, police made a brief preliminary investigation
into Shipman after a local undertaker took her suspicions to
another doctor, who then went to police. But such was Shipman's
reputation in Hyde, where he was considered a pillar of the
community, that police concluded the probe without questioning him
or any of the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they found nothing in Shipman's records that
pointed to foul play. Police now acknowledge that they were duped
because Shipman had falsified records, attributing to his patients
ailments that they didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   Police also now admit that three more women died since their
initial investigation. Police reactivated their investigation of
Shipman in 1998 after the daughter of his last victim, 81-year-old
Kathleen Grundy, realized that Shipman had forged her mother's will
and had himself named as the beneficiary of her $600,000 estate.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators say Grundy's murder was the only one in which
they were able to establish an obvious motive. As for his other
victims, police said it appeared Shipman enjoyed feeling a sense of
power over his victims. Investigators say Shipman, like other
serial killers, took ``trophies'' of his victims, including
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Postles, the detective who led the investigation, said,
``He just enjoys killing people.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipman replaces Peter Sutcliffe, the so-called ``Yorkshire
Ripper,'' as Britain's most notorious serial killer. Sutcliffe was
imprisoned for life in 1981 for killing 13 women and trying to kill
seven others.
</P>
<P>
   But police say Shipman's final tally will make Sutcliffe's pale
in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Mike Williams, who interrogated Shipman, described him
as arrogant and devious, a sociopath who thought he was smarter
than his inquisitors. He said Shipman complained about some of his
patients, including those he killed, as being nuisances. Pollard,
the coroner, said Shipman ``developed a taste for it. He enjoyed
holding the power over people.''
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's verdict, investigators said that Shipman had been
addicted to pethidine, an opiate, which he had been stealing from
the first practice he joined as a young doctor in 1974. He was
forced to leave that joint practice, but was allowed to return to
practicing medicine 18 months later.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually opened a one-man, storefront practice in Hyde and
became well known and respected among his 3,500 patients and the
rest of the town.
</P>
<P>
   A local undertaker became suspicious of Shipman when she noticed
his dead patients were being found fully clothed, with no sign of
illness or discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   She passed her concerns on to a doctor in a clinic across the
street from Shipman's. Doctors in that clinic had been asked by
Shipman to countersign cremation certificates, as is required by
law. When doctors in that clinic checked their own records, they
found that in 1997, 41 of Shipman's patients died, while their
practice, with almost three times as many patients, had just 14
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Shipman initally killed his patients during house
calls. Then, emboldened, he killed six patients by injecting them
at his small office, just a few feet from his staff, including his
wife, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Shipman administered the fatal doses on the
pretext of giving injections or drawing blood.
</P>
<P>
   Bearded and bespectacled, the father of four, he was widely
admired for his small-town ways.
</P>
<P>
   But the Reverend Denis Maher, a local priest, said a darker side
of Shipman emerged when he saw the doctor at the home of one of his
parishoners, Winifred Mellor, after she died two years ago. Father
Maher said Shipman was cold to the dead woman's children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was cold, calculating, evil,'' Father Maher said.
</P>
<P>
   During his trial, Shipman calmly insisted that some of the 15
women had failed to disclose health problems to him. He also told
police that he suspected that Grundy, the town's former mayor, was
a drug addict.
</P>
<P>
   After he sentenced Shipman, Judge Forbes took off his powdered
white wig and in a voice shaking with emotion, consoled the
victims' families who were in court and thanked the jury of seven
men and five women who deliberated for six days.

   Canada's leading conservative politician, Preston Manning,
embarks this week on a nationwide tour to unite the political
right, bolstered by a 75 percent endorsement at the Reform Party
convention for his plan to create a new national party, the
Canadian Alliance. The Liberal Party has governed Canada on the

</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, the police in Ontario, Canada's most populous
province, can arrest people for aggressive begging and offering to
clean windshields at traffic lights. In December, Ontario's
Conservative-controlled legislature banned intimidating panhandling
after complaints from the mayor of Toronto. It is now illegal to
beg anywhere there is a ``captive'' audience _ at bank machines,
bus stops, or in a line of vehicles stopped at a red light.

   BRITAIN: DOCTOR KILLED 15 WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   A general practitioner from near Manchester, Dr. Harold Shipman,
was given 15 life sentences after he was found guilty of murdering
15 female patients, most of them elderly, with heroin injections.

   The Home Office set up a working group to identify failing
prisons and suggest ways to promote education and to combat drug
addiction. Recent reports by the chief prison inspector have
painted a dismal picture of conditions in two of the country's
prisons. ``We need better warning systems to identify much earlier
those prisons which are not operating to an acceptable standard,''
Home Secretary Jack Straw said.

   The Congress of South African Trade Unions began a three-month
campaign of lunch and teatime demonstrations and worker forums to
highlight the government's failure to create jobs. The campaign,
which will not disrupt business for the time being, was kicked off
by the South African Textile and Clothing Workers' Union and the
National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa. Some estimates put
unemployment as high as 40 percent.

   Striking public hospital doctors returned to work after a court

doctors walked off the job in support of hundreds of striking
junior doctors who were fired for protesting hospitals' poor

sides never met. First, the Greek Cypriot delegation trooped into
the U.N. European headquarters in Geneva to meet with Annan. Then
the Turkish Cypriot delegates arrived, led by Rauf Denktash. Annan
said he thought a deal could be reached within the year.

 &HT;    Tennessee to try for two Super Bowls in a row
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Titans might have seemed to the public to be a
surprise entrant in the Super Bowl. But they sounded Monday as if
they plan on making a return trip, and soon.
</P>
<P>
   It should have been expected from a team that rallied from a
16-0 third-quarter deficit to tie the game _ and then missed by the
longest yard of forcing Super Bowl XXXIV into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team that came from nowhere and did things no one
expected us to do this year,'' coach Jeff Fisher said about the
Titans, which lost to the Rams 23-16 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we'll be respected and perceived around the league as a
team to be contended with the next few years,'' Fisher said. ``I
told the team they didn't fail. It's just success put on hold.''
</P>
<P>
   That new-found respect is not necessarily such a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Losers of Super Bowl XXXIII a year earlier, the Atlanta Falcons
entered the offseason very much as will the Titans, who face
relatively little roster re-shuffling.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's 16-3 record from last season landed the Falcons both
new respect around the league and a tougher schedule. The Titans
(16-4) can plan on the same.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta went 5-11 and missed the playoffs. What will become of
Tennessee?
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business in Nashville will be for owner Bud
Adams to sign a contract extension with Fisher, who has one year
left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has just four players who will become unrestricted
free agents Feb. 11, chief among them right tackle Jon Runyan.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Yancey Thigpen, who has a broken foot, was missed
in the Super Bowl; the addition of depth at the position will be a
goal of the offseason. Linebacker Joe Bowden, free safety Marcus
Robertson, tight end Jackie Harris and backup quarterback Neil
O'Donnell also will be eligible to hit the market.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's loss, Tennessee executed its offensive game plan in
the second half only, after the Rams had taken a 9-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, however, got strafed by the Rams, who flew to 443
yards of offense, 294 in the first half. Only a heavy dose of
Tennessee blitzing held St. Louis to three field goals in five
first-half possessions inside the Titans' 20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, running back Eddie George, tight ends Harris
and Frank Wycheck and quarterback Steve McNair helped tie the game
through vintage smashmouth football.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who has been criticized for his shortcomings as a
passer, made some poor throws Sunday. However, his final passing
numbers of 22 of 36 passing numbers for 214 yards looked decent.
</P>
<P>
   He also proved that he makes good decisions, and he rushed for
65 years, as his athletic ability was essential in Tennessee's
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, neither team turned over the ball, and the Titans,
who set a franchise record in the regular season with 54 sacks, got
just one.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, when the Titans beat the Rams 24-21 in Nashville
on Oct. 31, Tennessee sacked St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner six
times, and scooped up three of his fumbles without turning the ball
over.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in the Georgia Dome, McNair's pass to wide receiver
Kevin Dyson on the final play nearly sent the Super Bowl to
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   With Wycheck double-covered in the end zone, Dyson caught it on
the 5. ``I thought I was going to score,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rams linebacker Mike Jones, who had the responsibility of
covering the first receiver to break toward the middle of the
field, was behind Dyson. Jones got his right hand on Dyson's right
hip and his left hand on Dyson's left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended with Dyson going down at the 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran out of time,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got all we could ask for _ our wide receiver on a
linebacker,'' McNair said. ``But their linebackers are very quick
and athletic, and the guy just made the play.''

 &HT;    Super Bowl scores high in TV ratings
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rams and Titans didn't bring tradition or
familiarity to the Super Bowl, but that didn't matter to America.
</P>
<P>
   ABC enjoyed a typical Super Bowl audience for the Rams' 23-16
win on Sunday, drawing an estimated 130,745,000 viewers. The game's
national Nielsen rating of 43.2 was up 7 percent over the
Falcons-Broncos game in last year's Super Bowl on Fox. (One
national rating point equals 980,000 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's rating was the 19th highest of the 34 Super Bowls. The
game has drawn a rating of 40.2 or higher for 29 of the past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dispels any notion that small-market teams can't pull in
big ratings,'' said ABC vice president Mark Mandel. ``It's all
about the Super Bowl and not so much about what teams are
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis is the nation's 21st biggest market; Nashville is
30th.
</P>
<P>
   Mandel said the rating grew every half-hour and reached 46.9
during the last 30 minutes of the telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's rating was 52.0, falling between Saint Louis' 55.0 and
Nashville's 50.0. (For Atlanta, one local ratings point equals
16,750 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   Enhanced TV, ABC's interactive component, set a record with
650,000 users, who averaged 42 minutes per connection. The previous
high for Enhanced TV was 125,000 during the Florida State-Virginia
Tech showdown for the collegiate national championship in the Sugar
Bowl.

MCCAIN'S `STRAIGHT TALK EXPRESS' TAKES ITS LAST RIDE ACROSS N.H. 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also NH-MCCAIN) 
(nk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Seats on Sen. John McCain's Straight Talk
Express were hard to come by Monday, as the now famous rolling
press conference took its last ride across the state.
</P>
<P>
   For days, media bigwigs like David Westin, who runs ABC News,
and Peter Kahn, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, had been
showing up to take their turn on the bus, where reporters for The
New Yorker and Seventeen magazines, MTV and NPR have all jockeyed
for seats.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford, South Carolina
Republicans who are campaigning for McCain there, were along for
the final trip, too. To help work that all-important South
Carolina-New Hampshire connection? No, said McCain. ``They just
wanted to come up and be part of this the last couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wanted to miss the experience of a fairly radical
experiment in the whole dance between candidates and the media. And
for those who had been with McCain for months, ``it's like the last
day of camp,'' said Jake Tapper, a reporter for Salon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Tapper asked a newcomer if in her first hour with McCain on this
trip she had fallen in love: ``Have you had the Kool-Aid yet?''
</P>
<P>
   The bus driver, hard at work in a drizzling snow, was anything
but weepy: ``He gets on every morning, says, ``Hello, friend,' and
is absorbed'' by the media, said the driver, Walt Pim, of Columbus,
Ohio. ``I'd never done a political deal before, but this is like a
county fair all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate himself, though, en route from one outdoor rally
to another on his last full day of campaigning here, was already
nostalgic: ``It's been a great ride. I know it sounds like I've
gone insane, but I'll miss New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   But that, of course, is not the insane part.
</P>
<P>
   Unlimited media access _ which any political consultant will
tell you is way too risky to work in any candidate's favor _ has
become part of McCain's message that greater openness begets
greater trust _ and makes life on the trail more fun.
</P>
<P>
   But will other candidates, seeing how well it's worked for him,
follow his lead? The Arizona Republican doubts it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I had an occasional flash of stupidity, it was certainly
well reported,'' he said, perhaps thinking of his comments about
how in the Navy he just knew who was gay.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, then, was this experiment a good idea? He sipped his
coffee, and said, ``It almost doesn't matter if it was a good idea;
It was the only way I could do it, because it's just the way I
am.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Monday morning, his wife, Cindy, was sitting in one of several
chaise lounges reading a magazine while McCain was perched on a
bench, surrounded by reporters who wanted to know what his eclectic
foreign policy advisers have in common, whether he has a health
care plan, and if he is ``waffling on Al Pacino.''
</P>
<P>
   (Earlier, he had revealed that he did not think Pacino would be
too convincing as a football coach in ``Any Given Sunday,'' but
then backtracked to say that he generally appreciated Pacino's
oeuvre.)
</P>
<P>
   He explained why the Straight Talk Express will work a little
differently in South Carolina, where the day's events are more
likely to be held all in one town rather than all across the state.
And while he talked, Rice Krispie Treats sailed over his head,
lobbed by a reporter distributing goodies to his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The whole McCain team was much amused by one reporter's
assertion that the Bush campaign had been putting out the word that
McCain is only polling well because his supporters tend to be older
and thus are home on weekends, resting up, rather than out leading
vigorous lives like the Bush crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're down to that,'' said Mike Murphy, a senior adviser,
``then all I can say is, poor, poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCain answered her cell phone then, and handed it to her
husband: ``It's Gary Bauer. He fell off a stage today.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was solicitous of his fellow candidate, who fell while
flipping pancakes at a campaign event. But not long-winded: ``Are
you alright? Be careful, my friend, and good luck tomorrow, my
friend. I've grown to appreciate you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   When he hung up, he said a word about this new friendship:
``He's a decent person. I just got attracted to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Then another call came through, and several aides, along with
Mrs. McCain, put their heads together, laughing, whispering, and
trying to get the candidate's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he stopped talking about trade and bit. ``What? I am
like the cuckholded husband! I am the last to know anything in this
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   With the proper build up, Murphy announced new poll numbers that
had their guy up by 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh?'' said one reporter, John Dickerson, of Time Magazine.
``Is the sample this bus?''

ISRAEL TELLS SYRIA TO REIN IN HEZBOLLAH GUERRILLAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak says Israel will not
resume peace talks with Syria until it reins in the Hezbollah
guerrillas who killed three Israeli soldiers during intensified
fighting in Lebanon Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel will not be able to negotiate peace as long as the
Syrians do not restrain the Hezbollah from acting against the
Israeli army in the security zone,'' Barak said Monday. The United
States has been pushing the two countries to resume the difficult
negotiations that picked up in December after a four-year
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli fighter jets pounded Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon
heavily Monday as Barak promised to respond aggressively, using
language that has in the past presaged massive retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have known in the past and we still know to strike at the
place and time of our choosing,'' Barak said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The escalation of tension in Lebanon came one day after
Hezbollah forces killed the top field commander of the
Israeli-financed militia, the South Lebanon Army, in a carefully
planned and executed attack.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli military strategists said the killing of Colonel Akel
Hashem, who was buried in his south Lebanon village Monday, was a
deeply damaging blow to the already faltering morale of Israeli and
SLA forces in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   US officials in Washington sought to minimize the likely impact
on the stalled peace talks. ``We condemn the violence and urge
restraint on all parties that have influence in the regions,'' said
Security Council spokesman David Leavy.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's response to the bomb attack on Hashem and the ambush of
the three Israeli soldiers proved again just how closely tied the
newly rekindled Israeli-Syrian negotiating track is to the
protracted conflict in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers are stationed inside a 9-mile wide ``security
zone'' in south Lebanon, where they face a daily guerrilla war of
ambushes and roadside bombs waged by Hezbollah fighters trying to
force Israel to leave what they see as illegally occupied land.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which has about 35,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, has
long backed Hezbollah and used the conflict as a proxy war against
Israel. The two countries have been bitter enemies for more than
half century.
</P>
<P>
   The three Israeli soldiers were killed when their patrol was
attacked on a road between the villages of Taibe and Deir Mimas
near the Crusader-era Beaufort Castle, only 2 miles from the
Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after the attack, Israeli warplanes staged air raids
against suspected guerrilla positions in areas facing the Israeli
occupied zone. There was no immediate word on casualties from the
raids.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, the Associated Press quoted a Hezbollah statement
saying its fighters staged a ``daring attack deep in the occupied
zone,'' targeting Israeli soldiers as they gathered. Other
guerrillas opened fire on nearby positions at Beaufort and Dabshe
to prevent reinforcements and rescuers from reaching the area, the
Hezbollah statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah statement gloated that its ambush was carried out
``despite all the threats of Israeli leaders,'' a reference to
Barak's statement Sunday that Hashem's death would be avenged.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's tough tone in promising reprisals underscored the
domestic political pressures he is facing. The prime minister is
under fire in a campaign finance scandal, and the spiral of
violence in Lebanon has called into question whether he will live
up to the pledge he made during his election campaign last year to
have Israeli troops out of Lebanon by the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's deaths brought to four the number of Israeli soldiers
killed in Lebanon since the resumption of Syrian-Israeli peace
talks in December. One of the three soldiers killed was an officer,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The escalating violence in Lebanon comes at a time when Israel
and Syria seemed to be grudgingly softening the the positions that
had kept them frozen out of peace talks for four years.
</P>
<P>
   US diplomats and President Clinton himself have been making
strenuous efforts to help the sides bridge their differences and
resume the historic talks that began in December in Washington and
continued in January in Shepherdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Syria postponed the next scheduled round of
negotiations at the last minute. Analysts said the decision was
triggered by Israel's refusal to accept Syria's precondition that
it commit to total withdrawal from the disputed Golan Heights, and
over the degree of demilitarization that would be enforced along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Barak said Syria was allowing the new Hezbollah attacks
in order to pressure Israel into making concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is . . . the Syrians, not just Hezbollah, that are behind
supply lines and freedom of movement (for the) guerrillas,'' the
Associated Press quoted Barak telling his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts saw significance in the fact that Barak,
Israel's most highly decorated soldier, issued his statement on
Defense Ministry letterhead and used language that in the past has
been a precursor to major Israeli counterattacks.

<P>
   HSINCHU, Taiwan _ The assembly lines at the Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp. were running full tilt after midnight last
Sept. 21, when the floor began to heave. A massive earthquake had
struck central Taiwan 60 miles south of here. But for the luck of
geography, this futuristic technology park could have resembled a
scene from the most expensive disaster movie ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Although the quake cut off power and jostled the company's
delicate silicon wafers _ ruining 28,000 of them _ it did little
structural damage to Taiwan Semiconductor's five factories. The
main problem was lack of electricity, which left Taiwan's largest
chip maker becalmed when worldwide demand for its semiconductors
was running at a fever pitch.
</P>
<P>
   For Morris Chang, the founder and chairman of Taiwan
Semiconductor, the solution was obvious: he placed a call to
Taiwan's prime minister, Vincent Siew, requesting power be
restored. Within three days the lights starting coming on, and less
than 10 days later, Taiwan Semiconductor's factories were humming
at 95 percent capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's earthquake was a jolting reminder to the computer
industry of its reliance on this island nation. Leading American
manufacturers like Dell Computer, Compaq Computer, and
Hewlett-Packard blamed quake-related shortages for depressing
third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   No company better symbolizes Taiwan's role as quartermaster to
the world computer industry than does Taiwan Semiconductor. Few
have had more to do with putting Taiwan there than has Chang. At
68, this mainland China-born, American-educated executive is one of
the titans of Taiwan industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``People call Morris Chang the godfather of high technology in
Taiwan,'' said Benny T. Hu, the president of the China Development
Industrial Bank. ``He created the semiconductor industry here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hu's kind words come as no surprise, given that he is also vice
chairman of Worldwide Semiconductor Manufacturing, Taiwan's
third-largest chip maker, which Chang agreed to buy last month in a
stock deal worth at least $5 billion. That was two weeks after
Taiwan Semiconductor agreed to merge with TSMC-Acer Semiconductor
Manufacturing, its joint venture with Acer.
</P>
<P>
   In a single month of deal making, Chang expanded Taiwan
Semiconductor's production capacity to 3.2 silicon wafers a year
from 2.8 million. That is still far short of demand, which Chang
reckons will be more than 4 million wafers this year and 5.5
million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``These last six months have really been the most painful in our
company's life, because there were so many customers who depended
on us,'' said Chang, a courtly, white-haired man who was born in
the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, spent three decades as an
executive in the United States, and came to Taiwan for the first
time in 1985 to start a new career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central part of our corporate culture is to give customers
what they want,'' Chang said. ``And we couldn't give them enough.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Chang's happy problem to be caught in one of the chip
industry's periodic booms. After slumping for three years in the
late-1990s, demand rebounded in the second half of 1999. That was
because of the end of the Asian economic crisis and the
proliferation of new digital devices _ from set-top boxes and video
games to electronic organizers and cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate worldwide demand for chips will grow 30
percent this year, while Taiwan Semiconductor's sales will double.
The company reported 1999 earnings last week. Even with the week of
lost production in September, sales rose 45.6 percent, to $2.43
billion, while net income jumped 60 percent, to $816 million. The
company's shares, which trade here and in New York, have risen 80
percent since Dec. 17, giving it a market capitalization of $51
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan Semiconductor is growing even faster than the rest of the
industry because Chang has discovered its sweet spot. Rather than
design and produce integrated circuits as do Intel, Motorola and
IBM, Taiwan Semiconductor acts as a contractor, making chips based
on the designs of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's insight was to recognize that a growing number of small
chip designers could not afford to build their own semiconductor
factories. Known as fabs, these space-age complexes take at least
18 months to complete and cost from $1 billion to $2.5 billion,
depending on the size.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to justify that kind of capital expenditure,'' said
Calvin Chang, a semiconductor analyst at Jardine Fleming in Taipei.
``There aren't that many companies who can afford to build new
fabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for full-service producers like Motorola or NEC, the cost
of manufacturing a wide variety of chips in their own factories has
become prohibitive. Increasingly, the semiconductor giants are
farming out part of their work to contractors like Taiwan
Semiconductor. Motorola has said it plans to contract 35 percent of
its chip production to these so-called foundries by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, foundries produce roughly 15 percent of the total
output of the $160 billion semiconductor industry. But by 2010,
analysts say, they will produce half. Taiwan Semiconductor's share
of the foundry market is 35 percent. Its main competitor, United
Microelectronics , has a 30 percent share. It is also based in the
teeming Hsinchu technology park. Together, these companies have
made Taiwan a sort of country-for-hire to the semiconductor
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, the son of a prosperous Chinese banker who fled the
Communists in 1949, was sent to the United States to be educated,
first at Harvard and later at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   After earning his doctorate in electrical engineering from
Stanford University, Chang joined Texas Instruments and ended up
running its semiconductor division. He left in 1983 after a
falling-out with his bosses and joined General Instruments, where
he served a brief, disillusioning spell as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had enough money not to work for the rest of my life, and I
had gotten a little weary of the corporate rat race,'' said Chang,
who is an American citizen. ``At that time, Taiwan beckoned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan government, eager to turn this island into a
technology redoubt, initially recruited Chang to head an industrial
research institute. But given his pedigree and experience, it was a
matter of time before the government persuaded Chang to join
Taiwan's drive into the semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the government staked him $100 million and took a 49
percent share in what would become Taiwan Semiconductor. That,
along with $58 million from Philips, the Dutch electronics company,
allowed Chang to set up shop. The government still owns 15 percent
of the company, while Philips owns 26.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chang has cultivated ties with senior officials and financiers
like Hu, who are close to the governing Nationalist Party. But he
says he has no allegiance to the party and prefers to stay out of
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's concept of the foundry was born of an appreciation of
both the virtues and limitations of Taiwan. He said he believed the
country had an advantage in making wafers _ likening Taiwan to
Japan, which also excels at churning out high-quality chips. Both
countries, he said, had plenty of highly trained, skilled line
operators, technicians, and production engineers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Chang said he doubted Taiwan's ability to
compete in the more rarefied business of designing integrated
circuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have enough creativity,'' he said. ``Our
educational system is state-run. We are very successful at turning
out engineers with basic skills, in fact better than the
engineering graduates from U.S. universities. However, they are not
as entrepreneurial and not as creative.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has become a pace-setter, cutting costs to the bone and
turning its factories into supple operations capable of producing a
range of chips in a single factory. At one of Taiwan
Semiconductor's fabs in the Hsinchu Science Park, the manager
pointed out a conveyor belt that rushed silently overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The belt, he explained, was used to correct imbalances in the
fab's two assembly lines. Wafers were shuttled from one line to the
other to ensure that both were running at capacity. Movable racks
in a glassed-in storage room held boxes of wafers bound for NEC,
Motorola and a dozen other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Taiwan remains a bit player in the world of chip design,
which is dominated by the United States and Japan. Even Chang's
efforts to develop memory chips, which are less complex than logic
chips, have come to naught. In 1994, he started Vanguard
International Semiconductor, with the goal of producing dynamic
random access memory, or D-RAM, chips without relying on foreign
technology.
</P>
<P>
   After losing more than $200 million in 1998 and 1999 and failing
to make a dent in the memory-chip market, Chang recently decided to
scale back Vanguard's ambitions. Now, like Taiwan Semiconductor, it
will turn out chips on a contract basis. Taiwan Semiconductor owns
25 percent of Vanguard, and analysts expect the two will be folded
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vanguard has been a thorn in the foot of Taiwan
Semiconductor,'' said Dan Heyler, a semiconductor analyst at
Merrill Lynch in Taipei. ``Investors have always wondered why TSMC
spent as much time with Vanguard as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chang, however, Vanguard was not merely about money.
``Vanguard was going to be the second-stage of creating a really
powerful industry in Taiwan,'' he said wistfully. ``It was sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setback, Chang said he was confident that Taiwan
would retain its edge in the chip industry over emerging Asian
rivals like Singapore and Malaysia. In addition to five working
factories in Hsinchu, Taiwan Semiconductor is building new plants
here and in southern Taiwan, as well as joint venture plants in
Singapore and Washington State. One will produce 12-inch wafers,
which hold far more chips than the traditional 8-inch wafers.
</P>
<P>
   With a stake in the company that is worth nearly $250 million,
Chang can afford to take the long view. A few years ago, he stepped
back from the day-to-day management of Taiwan Semiconductor,
freeing up time for a role he seems to relish: the elder statesman
of industry, helping to propel his adopted country to the next rung
on the technology ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been pushing for the need for innovation, for more
creativity,'' he declared, with the confidence of a man who gets
Taiwan's top leaders on the phone with little trouble. ``We need to
reform the educational system. It's very slow, but it's going to
happen.''

DOWN TO THE WIRE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, New Hampshire _ An estimated 350,000 voters will cast
the first primary ballots of America's 2000 presidential election
here Tuesday, in a serenly beautiful but fiercely independent New
England state famous for making frontrunners stumble.
</P>
<P>
   A New Hampshire loss won't be fatal to Texas Gov. George Bush or
Vice President Al Gore, who have resources and party regulars to
fight future battles. A win is nearly essential, however, to the
reformist grassroots GOP campaign of Arizona Sen. John McCain, and
badly needed by the Democrats' challenger, ex-Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a small lead in pre-election polls over Bradley in a
battle between two candidates and two campaigns that have come to
intensely dislike each other. After watching Gore take apart his
health care plan, Bradley has taken a sharply negative turn,
pummeling Gore's credibility and urging the Democratic Party to
``clean our house'' of the Clinton administration's campaign
finance scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is a new politics of belief and conviction and
giving America a new candor,'' Bradley tells rallies, echoing a
slogan of the late 1960s and early 1970s. But the former New Jersey
senator is under fire for refusing to release his health records
and being less than candid about his bouts of irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, with 64 days of campaigning and 114 town
meetings, McCain has caught fire and threatens to put at least a
temporary halt to Bush's seemingly unstoppable march to the GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Several polls Monday put McCain in the lead. Typically, he put
down the good news. On his bus, McCain spied reporters and aides
whispering about the latest figures. ``I am like the cuckolded
husband,'' he joked. ``I am the last to know anything about the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   One Republican candidate is operating largely beneath the radar
screen. Millionaire publisher Steve Forbes is mobilizing phone
banks, calling radio talk shows and courting religious
conservatives as well as the 30,000 members of Gun Owners of New
Hampshire. Forbes is waging a political ground game aimed at
repeating his strong second place showing behind Bush in the Jan.
24 Iowa GOP caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire may mark the end of the line _ or end of serious
consideration _ for two other GOP candidates. Former Reagan
administration official Gary Bauer fell off the stage at a
pancake-flipping contest yesterday. He has nearly disappeared from
the race, too, registering barely 1 percent in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Former diplomat Alan Keyes has aroused the Republican right with
his anti-abortion oratory. ``Creation does not take place in the
womb. It's just announced there,'' Keyes declared at one stop.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes has offended others, including several parents of children
in a class he spoke to last week. He asked the fifth graders a
series of questions about whether it is okay to kill other people.
They replied in the negative. Whereupon, Keyes told his youthful
listeners: ``We live in a country where, according to the law and
courts and some of our politicians, it is okay to kill children.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the 2000 campaign has been positive in tone,
with debates revolving around serious choices facing the country.
In part, candidates have responded to polls suggesting an American
public sickened by the politics of personal destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most polite, the most civil, the most
issue-oriented campaign the state has seen in 30 years,'' said
Steve Duprey, state GOP chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, however, gloves have come off between the
Democrats with Bradley accusing Gore of deliberate misstatements. A
pair of Bradley surrogates, Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey and Washington
Rep. Jim McDermott, showed up at Gore's Sunday rally at
Somersworth. Two 1992 presidential candidates, Kerrey and Sen. Tom
Harkin of Iowa, a Gore surrogate, got into a shouting match.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, however, the real drama may come if the
Republican front-runner goes down to defeat. The Bush campaign has
progressed toward the nomination with the majesty of a royal coach.
At times, it seemed like New Hampshire was being called upon to pay
tribute to the procession as it passed this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shame, since Gov. Bush is going to be elected
president, for him to be elected without the support of New
Hampshire,'' former Gov. John Sununu said. Sununu was part of a
daily parade of endorsers, culminating in a Saturday appearance at
which former President George Bush praised ``this boy, this son of
ours,'' and predicted of George W: ``He's going to go all the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   But a large number of New Hampshire voters seem of a mind that
the presidency is not a royal inheritance. ``If you listen to Bush,
it's pretty much what we've already got in politics,'' said Roy
Parker, a retired Digital Equipment Engineer, who heard McCain
speak in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
   McCain cannot match Bush's money or nationwide organization. But
the former Vietnam POW has found themes that resonate _ campaign
finance reform, an end to corporate welfare and cutting pork barrel
spending. ``(Voters) want someone independent of special
interests,'' he declared to cheers at a noontime rally here
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Belatedly and awkwardly, Bush has tried to sound like an
outsider. ``I am not of Washington, D.C.,'' the Texas governor has
declared in prefacing his tax cut program. But he has trouble
sounding humble. ``I have the right organization, I am the right
person to lead the party to victory,'' he declared at a weekend
stop.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has one strategy: Come out of New Hampshire with
momentum, grace the covers of national magazines, and use
grassroots enthusiasm to rout the Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 35 percent of today's voters will have enjoyed
personal contact with at least one presidential candidate. Melissa
Jahn and Wayne Goertel, young New Hampshire professionals, are
among thousands who have gone to watch several candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was for Bush a couple days ago, but McCain seems more
competent on the issues with a better sense of integrity,'' said
Jahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of ideology, we see at least four strong
candidates,'' added Goertel. He identified Gore, Bradley, Bush and
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In Newmarket, high school senior Larry Gladhill considers
himself a Republican but will vote for Gore. ``I like how he stands
on violence in schools,'' Gladhill said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Republicans once exploited bad times under Jimmy Carter,
the campaign of Democrat Gore never fails to mention that Bush's
father presided over the worst recession since the Great
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of this country don't want a president who will
bring us back to the way things were back in 1992 with layoffs and
factory closings, when there was another George Bush in office,''
New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, Gore's chief local booster, told
a weekend dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Democratic voters are uneasy at the excesses of
America's political system and are receptive to Bradley's
reformism. ``I buy into his idealism,'' said Susan Stafford, a
businesswoman who attended Bradley's rally Sunday in Exeter.
</P>
<P>
   At a town meeting in Lebanon, school administrator Frank Fahey
asked Gore about his attendance at a 1996 Democratic fund-raiser at
a Buddhist temple in California, and overnight stays by
Clinton-Gore campaign donors in the Lincoln Bedroom of the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you get into that situation?'' asked Fahey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made a mistake in the episode you asked me about. I
learned from that mistake,'' Gore replied. He ignored the Lincoln
Bedroom question, but said of the Buddhist temple event: ``I should
have learned what its intended purpose was.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president argued that when he was in Congress, he
sponsored or co-sponsored more than a dozen campaign reform bills.
Gore called for federal financing of campaigns for the presidency
and Congress, and for broadcasters to offer free times to political
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Fahey was unimpressed. ``No, I don't think he has learned,''
said Fahey, a political independent. ``I guess I feel more
genuineness, honesty and believability in Mr. Bradley's answer.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans unveiled their own proposal
Monday to give a tax cut to married couples, stepping up pressure
on President Clinton and Democrats to agree to an election-year
compromise on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan, laid out by Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, was intended in
part to reduce the so-called marriage penalty paid by many
two-income couples, and represented a counteroffer to a more
narrowly drawn provision proposed last week by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said his plan, which would give a tax break to nearly all
married couples, would be worth $182 billion over 10 years, more
than four times as much as Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of the Republican plan would go to couples across
the income spectrum whether or not they pay a marriage penalty, and
would include couples with only one spouse working.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposal, valued by the White House at $45
billion over 10 years, would limit benefits largely to two-income
couples who claimed the standard deduction on their federal income
taxes, nearly all of whom are in low-income and middle-income
brackets and most of whom pay some marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said his bill would be taken up by the committee on
Wednesday and would go to the floor for a vote by the full House in
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first in a series of separate tax cuts, each with
powerful constituencies, that the House leadership intends to bring
up this year in a change of strategy from the last few years, when
Republicans assembled catch-all tax bills that the White House and
Democrats cast as fiscally irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fixing the marriage penalty would be the best Valentine's Day
present we could give to millions of couples,'' Archer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Archer's approach was too expensive, and they
criticized the Republicans for not seeking a bipartisan deal before
moving ahead with their own bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the Ways
and Means Committee, said the bulk of the tax relief under Archer's
bill would go to the most affluent 25 percent of taxpayers. And he
said the $180 billion cost of the tax cut would drain the projected
federal budget surplus before Congress and the administration
worked out plans to shore up Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long made reducing or eliminating the marriage
penalty a goal of their tax-cutting efforts. The penalty mostly
hits couples in which the two partners have roughly similar
incomes.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the penalty arises when the combined income of
the partners pushes them into a higher income-tax bracket than they
would be subject to if single and filing separately. In other
cases, couples pay the penalty because the standard deduction for
couples filing jointly is less than twice the standard deduction
for a single filer.
</P>
<P>
   But not all couples pay a marriage penalty. Last year, of 51.4
million joint returns filed, 24.8 million, or 48 percent, paid a
marriage penalty, according to a study by the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   Another 21 million, or 41 percent _ mostly couples in which only
one partner worked, or in which one partner made much more than the
other _ actually received a marriage ``bonus'' _ a lower tax bill
than they would pay if single.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's bill would raise the standard deduction for couples so
that it is twice that for single taxpayers. Most high-income
couples itemize their deductions and would not benefit from that
change. Clinton's proposal is built around a similar increase in
the standard deduction.
</P>
<P>
   But Archer also proposed to expand the 15 percent income-tax
bracket to higher income limits than current law specifies. Under
his plan, the 15 percent bracket for married couples, which is
adjusted for inflation each year and currently ends at $43,850 of
taxable income, would rise gradually until 2008, when it would
reach twice the level for single filers, which is currently
$26,250.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Archer's plan would also increase by $2,000 the income level at
which married couples lose the earned-income tax credit, a cash
payment made by the government to working families below and just
above the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way it is structured, Archer's plan would help
all couples, not just those paying the marriage penalty, making his
plan as much a broad-based tax cut for families as a marriage
penalty bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically trying to help people also who are at home
with a single earner,'' Archer said. ``We certainly should be
encouraging that homemaker who stays at home and takes care of the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would provide no tax cut for single people.

INS DECIDES FATE OF `UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' ON REGULAR BASIS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARLINGEN, Texas _ While the future of a 6-year-old Cuban
immigrant has gathered worldwide attention, along the border in
South Texas, deciding the fate of children arrested while trying to
illegally enter the United States alone is a routine, weekly
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Take the immigration court case begun Monday for Jose Enrique
and Jose Luis Oliva-Rosa, 16-year-old identical twins from Honduras
who have been in a detention facility since they were caught after
swimming the Rio Grande last summer. They say they will become
street kids if deported back home, and have asked for political
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   And while the twin's case has not garnered the attention given
Elian Gonzalez, the young Cuban immigrant in Miami, South Texas
immigration attorneys say the plight of the Honduran twins and
others among the thousands of minors who make the long, hazardous
journey alone are perhaps more critical. Elian Gonzalez has
relatives in Miami and Havana who desperately want to take care of
him, they note.
</P>
<P>
   But some children who arrive in South Texas have no living
parents back home or have been abandoned by their families and
lived on the streets until they fled to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol officers who apprehend the children swimming the
shallow Rio Grande or wandering Texas bordertowns call them
``unaccompanied minors,'' and place them in the custody of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. Most of the children are
quickly united with relatives already in the United States, pending
a hearing, and others agree to a voluntary return and take an
airline flight home, at their government's expense.
</P>
<P>
   But recently lawyers have had some success in convincing
immigration judges that a few of the unaccompanied children deserve
political asylum, although they have no connection to political
groups or activities in their homeland. Instead, the lawyers argue
they are a distinct social group of children who will likely fall
victim to street gangs, vigilante groups and police death squads if
they are deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to win asylum for half a dozen Honduran street
children by using the argument that in Honduras especially, there
is a pattern and practice of persecution by the authorities of the
country against members of this particular social group of street
children,'' said Steven Lang, an attorney with Probar, an immigrant
law clinic in Harlingen.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then we try and show our client is a street child, and has
no choice but to be a street child. Obviously, if you are abandoned
and there is no social agency to take care of you, then you have no
choice but a life on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The twins are represented by Lang and volunteer attorneys with
ProBar, a nonprofit immigration law project funded by lawyers
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Honduran brothers were among the 4,607 undocumented
juveniles under the age of 18 who were detained after entering this
country by themselves in fiscal year 1999, according to INS
records. The year before, 4,457 juveniles were detained, and most
of the children were from the three Central American countries of
El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, and from Mexico. In 1999, only
24 were from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, attorneys for the Oliva-Rosa brothers began
the courtroom phase of a legal fight to keep them from being
deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go back to Honduras I will have to live in the streets,''
Jose Luis told the immigration judge as he sat next to his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't join the (street) gangs, they will kill you,''
the youth testified. ``... and if you're on the streets ... the
very police will kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy, under questioning from a Minnesota law student and
Probar volunteer Rishi Garg, said he and his brother were abandoned
by their mother when they were 22 days old and sent to live with
their grandmother. He testified he doesn't know who his father is,
adding he's been told his mother lives in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis testified that at age 7 his grandmother sent him to
live with various aunts and uncles in Honduras, and he recounted a
series of violent beatings with clubs, sticks, kitchen utensils,
stones and metal bats. He also described how his machete-wielding
aunt attempted to murder him several times, lack of food, and other
deprivations and hardships meted out at the hands of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The twin's hearing continues Tuesday, after which the judge will
issue a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Lang said among thousands of unaccompanied children detained
each year there is a small group like the twins _ perhaps 100 to
200 children a year nationwide _ who have no relatives in the
United States and no place to live back home except the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients very often are fleeing from gang violence, from
life on the streets, from incredibly abusive (home) environments.
And in countries like Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, you
don't have a child protective services to run to,'' Lang said,
before the twin's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just go to them and say, `Hey, so and so is being
abused.' Or `Hey, look at him, he's living on the streets and
eating out of a dumpster, and sniffing glue everyday and selling
himself in prostitution.' There's no state agency that's going to
pick him up and put him into a boys home.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang noted that while the INS provides funds to house, clothe,
and educate the detained children while they await the outcome of
immigration proceedings, it provides no legal services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about thousands of kids every year who would
go on the social (services) rolls. We're not talking about a tidal
wave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's time we re-evaluate our responsibility in these
proceedings and that we should consider providing ad-litem
guardians or appointed counsel at government expense,'' Lang said.

COMMENTARY: SAVOR THE MOMENT

   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Memo to the half-naked teen-ager waving the
Bradley poster on the corner in Concord: It's winter in New
England. Bill wants you to put your shirt back on.
</P>
<P>
   This New Hampshire primary has been wonderful. For one brief
moment, in one smallish state, the American people are really hyped
about the presidential election. Even the little kids seem excited.
(Well, maybe not the ones who got cornered by the anti-abortion
candidate Alan Keyes and asked how they'd feel if he bashed their
brains out.)
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, fire marshals were actually turning people away
from political rallies. At a high school near Nashua, you could see
folks forlornly/ peeking in the windows, yearning to be let inside
to hear George W. Bush call for ``a law that provides liability to
teachers who enforce discipline in the schools.'' All the
candidates are tired, but Bush's speeches are getting particularly
unintelligible _ at the same high school, he announced, ``I think
we need not only to eliminate the tollbooth to the middle class, I
think we should knock down the tollbooth.'' At a Lincoln Day dinner
in Manchester last week, his handlers approached Gary Bauer, the
candidate who had drawn the first-speaker slot, and told him ``the
governor is really exhausted'' and would appreciate being allowed
to switch places.
</P>
<P>
   If you have seen the diminutive Bauer in any of the Republican
debates, glaring at Bush like the Chucky doll in those horror
movies, you can imagine the response.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowds are so great and the races so competitive, the
candidates are practically bouncing off the walls with adrenaline.
If Bush's audiences can't make much sense of what he says, they can
hear the underlying music _ something between ``Onward Christian
Soldiers'' and ``Boola Boola.'' Al Gore, who always gets louder
when he gets revved up, has been sounding like a bull on branding
day.
</P>
<P>
   Today is really about John McCain and Bill Bradley _ unless they
do well, we may be down to nine months of incoherent babbling
versus unimaginative bellowing. All the candidates are claiming to
be ``genuine'' this year, eschewing polls and speaking from the
heart. (The polls say genuine is in.) But McCain seems to be trying
to strip away everything, including his own superego, going for
direct id-to-id communication. He has had 114 town meetings with
the folks in New Hampshire. He talks and talks and talks _ to the
voters, to the reporters, to the lamppost _ creating a sort of
stream-of-conscious communication with the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, on the other hand, is all about repression, the
rejection of the cheap shot and easy headline. ``No pretense, no
manipulation,'' he told a crowd at a law school in Concord
solemnly, warning that he only wants the votes of people who
``agree with the direction I want to take the country.'' Al Gore,
of course, would be perfectly happy to get the votes of people who
were under the impression he was a new brand of breakfast sausage.
He is the archfiend of the Bradley world view, but the vice
president should really be more worried about his own admirers, who
have developed a disconcerting habit of using words like
``shameless'' and ``junkyard dog'' to describe his debating skills.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's anti-Gore attacks are so obscure, the only charitable
interpretation is that he wants to avoid saying anything that could
be turned into a sound bite for a Republican ad in the fall. One of
his strongest statements about the Clinton-Gore record on campaign
finance was: ``there's more explanation that is needed ... And I
believe that unless that explanation is forthcoming, that the
public will reject a candidacy in the fall that fails to come to
terms with this circumstance in our Democratic Party in 1996.'' But
during his ``no manipulation'' speech you could hear faint but
fervent cheers from a classroom down the hall where an overflow
crowd of eager Bradley supporters had been stashed. They had picked
him not as the lesser of two evils, but as the best of a lineup of
very interesting candidates, several of whom appeared, at least for
that moment, to be perfectly feasible presidents. Outside, children
and dogs romped on a frozen pond. The sun shone. Nobody looked as
if he would have rather been watching ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   It must be tough being the candidate for a new politics on the
one day of the year when the old politics seems just fine.

CANDIDATES _ EXCEPT MCCAIN _ MIX IT UP IN FINALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ In the end, it came down to pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 months of campaigning along the back roads of New
Hampshire, after six debates and more than $5 million spent on
advertising in the fight to become leader of the free world, the
Republican primary Monday found a metaphor of sorts in a big bowl
of batter.
</P>
<P>
   Governor George W. Bush was the darling of the Bisquick
Presidential Pancake Flip-off, arriving first and expertly tossing
his wheel of batter into the air while the cameras rolled. Gary
Bauer was the loser, falling off the stage as he tried to catch
his. And Senator John S. McCain, determined to defy political
expectations, didn't show up at all.
</P>
<P>
   To the voters of New Hampshire it was another amusing moment in
a campaign that began earlier than ever and was still thoroughly
undecided Monday night. But to political observers, the pancake
flip-off also provided a sort of thumbnail of the roles each
Republican played right up until the end of the 2000 New Hampshire
race _ Bush as frontrunner, McCain as outsider, everyone else
somewhere just off the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The top two contenders in New Hampshire did not, in the end,
disagree much on matters of substance, despite claims they
sometimes made that they did. Instead, the campaigns fought an
image battle _ over who could best restore the moral integrity of
the White House, who would be more likely to beat the Democratic
nominee, who could tell the more compelling narrative about his
family and his past.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and McCain emphasized the need for a tax cut,
disagreeing only about its size. Both demanded a military pay raise
and free trade. Both oppose abortion, but won't promise to to
appoint only judges who agree. Both wavered on whether the
Confederate flag should flutter atop the South Carolina capital.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest divergence from consensus came from McCain, whose
call for campaign finance reform has outraged the Republican
establishment and left him open to attacks from Bush, who believes
McCain's plan would harm the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The real differences between the candidates, it seemed, were in
style and strategy. And in their resumes. And in the stake they
place on the outcome here.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the 53-year-old governor of Texas who held no elected
office before 1994, a win in New Hampshire is important but not a
test of whether his superbly well-financed candidacy will survive.
</P>
<P>
   Still Bush had to be disappointed by the reception he first
encountered here after winning the first-place ribbon from Iowa _ a
solid win in that state's Jan. 24 caucuses. Bush arrived
triumphantly only to find modest crowds, tempered applause and
mostly static poll numbers. As late as Sunday night, a Superbowl
party he attended in Portsmouth drew just 500 people, more than 150
of whom left before the Texas governor began to speak.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush pressed on, with characteristic good-nature and vim.
Having promised a consistent message, he stuck with his
``prosperity with a purpose'' stump speech, varying only the
backdrop and setting. He then unveiling a new list of high-voltage
endorsements before aiming his big guns: his parents, the former
President and First Lady, George and Barbara Bush, who flew in for
a campaign stop last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Never once did he seem downtrodden. Instead he smiled and
offered sports metaphors, likening New Hampshire to the six-mile
mark in a marathon he intended to run to the finish line. Then Bush
bounded out into the snow, where a single photograph could capture
everything he hoped to show the voting public: his youthful spirit,
his down-to-earth style, his vigor.
</P>
<P>
   He avoided the glare of the critical press as much as possible.
Shortening his stump speech to under 10 minutes, he instead spent
hours shaking hands with voters along the rope line, giving his
trademark grin and calling young children ``dude.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush held up his education record in Texas. He spoke about
single women and saving social security. But for the most part, his
was a conservative campaign in a historically conservative state,
focused on tax cuts and integrity, intended to appeal to Republican
party members whose hopes for change were tempered and cautious.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, by contrasts, savors the role of the rebel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't you view me as a threat?'' McCain liked to say.
``Wouldn't you be unhappy if you were part of the establishment?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush says campaign finance reform would hurt the party,''
he said at a town hall meeting Sunday. ``Well, I think what's good
for the country is good for the party.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised to roust out special interests and he talked like a
outsider _ despite being a fixture on Capitol Hill since 1983,
despite being a powerful Senate committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   And news of his exclusion from some districts in the New York
primary, which he is currently challenging in Federal court, only
cemented his image as the persecuted outsider.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home the point, and none too subtly, the senator held a
press conference outside the Russian embassy in New York, where,
surrounded by a huge, unruly scrum of reporters, McCain called on
Governor George Pataki and Republican party chair William Powers to
``open up this ballot,'' and referred to those who seek his
exclusion as ``apparatchiks.''
</P>
<P>
   As endorsement after endorsement rolled Bush's way, McCain
became scrappier, playing up his status as a rebel with a noble
cause.
</P>
<P>
   To a large audience at Windham Middle School on Saturday,
McCain, 63, said he didn't mind that Bush had picked up so many
``celebrity endorsements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only celebrities I'm interested in are the people in this
room and the voters in the state of New Hampshire,'' he said, to
loud applause.

 &HT;    From cats to munchkins, Super Ads entertained _ but did they
sell?
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Next to the heart-stopping finale of Super Bowl XXXIV,
one of the game's most memorable images was a computer-aided
commercial of paralyzed actor Christopher Reeves getting up and
walking again.
</P>
<P>
   And for comic relief, there was a hilarious commercial showing a
group of trail-hardened cowboys rounding up a herd of cats.
</P>
<P>
   But quick: Who were those advertisers and what exactly were they
trying to sell you?
</P>
<P>
   While millions of Super Bowl viewers were riveted by the
commercials, some top marketing experts argue that the megabucks
ads leave many viewers dazed and confused, and may wind up being a
bust at the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's too soon to tell if the ads will justify their
$2.5 million pricetags for a 30-second spot, the age of instant
information produced several Monday morning quarterbacks trying to
determine which ads were the most popular.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today ran a ``Super Bowl Ad Meter'' on its Website, allowing
visitors to vote for their favorite commercials. With results
updated every five seconds, the three most popular commercials
Monday were the World Wrestling Foundation, ETrade, and
Epidemic.com.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous search engine Yahoo! also had an online ``Super
Bowl Poll'' that allowed viewers to pick the top ads. Their big
winners included Autotrader.com, the cat herders for EDS
information systems, and the singing sock puppet for pets.com. The
Christoper Reeve ad for Nuveen Investments, a financial services
company, didn't fare as well, only getting 3 percent of online
votes.
</P>
<P>
   However John Antil, a professor of Business and Economics at the
University of Delaware, said while such ads are increasingly
expensive and inventive, some of them are too entertaining for
their own good.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an ad entertained you but you can't remember what it's
about, it becomes a popularity contest, not a measure of
effectiveness,'' Antil said. ``Those kinds of ads make great
conversation around the office photocopier the next day, but most
people still couldn't tell you what the message was.'' As a group,
one of the most prolific Super Bowl advertisers this year were
online companies.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Allvine, a professor of marketing and electronic commerce
at Georgia Tech said online companies apparently hoped to repeat
the success of Victoria's Secret, the lingerie company that
launched its Website during eye-opening commercials at last year's
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the big conclusion we can draw is that the dot.coms
were duds,'' Allvine said. ``I just think they were naive to think
they could drive traffic to their Website with a 30-second ad. Next
year, I think you will see far fewer dot.coms wasting their money
on the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The real trick is to make sure the ads will work with viewers
before they ever get on the air, said Wade Holmes, a marketing
group manager for Advance Research System in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found a lot of things that work, but there is no magic
formula,'' he said. ''We can tell people what we think before they
get to the Super Bowl, but it's very hard to tell if a commercial
is going to move the needle with viewers or not.''

FEUDING BRADLEY, GORE LEAVE SHARED IDEALS BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. -- They started as creatures of the same culture,
pro-labor Democrats with Ivy League training and Senate pedigrees
entering a collegial contest for their party's top prize.
</P>
<P>
   Now this: With their first warm handshake of the 2000 campaign
turned cold over time, Vice President Al Gore and former Senator
Bill Bradley conclude the New Hampshire primary as politically
bloodied as if they had warred with Republican rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The aura of their shared ideals has evaporated in the heat of
their effort to condemn each other for their differences, some
almost too small to discern. And as they looked beyond New
Hampshire Monday to the national battleground, the angry rivals
gave every indication there is no truce in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in a remark that was as piercing as it was playful,
started the day on the ``Imus in the Morning'' radio show by saying
Gore has been ``squealing like a stuck pig'' from the wounds that
Bradley believes he has inflicted by assailing Gore's honesty and
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore, stumping at the Tilt'n Diner in Tilton, said, ``This
is a contest. The real fight is far from over.''
</P>
<P>
   While both Democrats insist their differences are miniscule
compared to the gulf between either of them and the Republican
field, the question remains: Will the Democratic survivor be strong
enough - politically and financially - to withstand the
deep-pocketed GOP campaign that awaits them?
</P>
<P>
   Gore, as if ripping a page from a Republican playbook, has
branded Bradley a ``quitter'' for leaving the Senate in 1996. The
vice president has mocked Bradley as an ivory tower intellectual
who is too cerebral to conduct the political spadework he would
need to make good on his bold promises.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore has ridiculed Bradley's agenda, depicting the former
New Jersey senator as a liberal throwback who would bust the
federal budget with his sweeping overhaul of the health care
system.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, after largely absorbing Gore's blows for five months,
last week unleashed a five-day fussilade of negative counterpoints.
He derided the vice president as having flip-flopped on abortion,
rapped him over his controversial appearance at a 1996 fund-raiser
at a Buddhist temple, and ultimately cast doubt on Gore' fitness
for the presidency by challenging his veracity and ethical
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did all that after accusing Gore of hurting former
Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988 presidential
race by raising the Willie Horton furlough issue.
</P>
<P>
   And as Republicans reveled in the ``rat-a-tat-tat,'' as Bradley
refers to the bitter partisanship of modern politics, some
Democratic loyalists cringed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attacks don't elevate anyone in terms of esteem in the
eyes of the voters,'' said Irwin ``Tubby'' Harrison, a Democratic
pollster in Boston, not aligned with either campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The ugliness boiled over Sunday when Bradley partisans, led by
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Representative Jerrold Nadler of
New York, turned up at a Gore event to rebut the vice president's
attacks. Gore activists ridiculed the overweight Nadler and shouted
at Kerrey that he was a ``quitter'' for deciding not to seek
reelection this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, defended the activists, saying
they were exercising their First Amendment rights to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Bradley's communications director, Anita Dunn, asserted
that if Bradley supporters had similarly heckled lawmakers loyal to
Gore, Bradley would have apologized. ``I find that so indicative of
the tone of their campaign, which is set by the candidate,'' Dunn
said of Lehane's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a gaping loss by Bradley Tuesday, the struggle will
continue for at least another five weeks, as the candidates vie for
nearly 60 percent of the total nominating delegates in multistate
primaries on March 7 and 14. Both candidates have reserves of
campaign cash to finance such an effort, though Bradley's campaign
is the more flush, with $8.3 million left at the end of last month
_ compared to Gore's $5.7 million. Both men have spent heavily in
New Hampshire since.
</P>
<P>
   An irony of the political alley fight between the two Democrats
is that they have long taken pains to present themselves as
gentlemen and public policy scholars. But another mutual trait also
clearly compels them: both want desperately to win, and neither has
a history of giving up easily.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of both men insist the candidates have limited their
assaults to policy, not personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Al Gore, there is a difference over health care, and how
to do it right,'' said Bob Shrum, a Gore advisor. Gore and Bradley
``have the same objectives,'' Shrum said, but different solutions
to the problems American faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are real differences,'' he said, ``but they are real
differences on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore engaged in a ceasefire Monday, Shrum said, because
``Senator Bradley appears to have stopped for the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, said Bradley had refrained
Monday only from focusing on Gore's abortion record and
fund-raising practices. ``There is no backing away,'' Hauser said.
``There is only a crystallizing of all the arguments we have made
over the five days into one central point for voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The point, Hauser said, was that voters could endorse Gore's
``distortions and the misrepresentations, and the eagerness the
vice president has shown to do that,'' or opt for Bradley's ``new
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Many voters, as they prepared to head to the polls, said they
were baffled by the vitriol in the Democratic contest. Others said
they were saddened. And some appeared resigned to the nasty nature
of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it does turn me off,'' said Jo Anne Marchant,
35, a Gore supporter in Sanbornton, who described the fight between
Bradley and Gore as ``silly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's the nature of the beast, in politics,'' she said.

THE CREATION OF THE HOPIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
 
Editor's note: The Navajos are not alone in their reverence for the
windswept rangelands of northeastern Arizona. These excerpts from
the Hopi creation story show how they too feel a sacred bond with
the land. 
 
In the beginning, there was only Tokpella, Endless Space. . . .
Tawa, the Sun Spirit, gathered the elements of Endless Space and
put some of his own substance into them, and in this way, he
created the First World. . . .
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Tawa commanded Gogyeng Sowuhti, Spider Grandmother, to lead the
insectlike creatures up to a Second, then a Third World, each more
habitable than the First. The people then climbed through the
sipapuni _ hole in the sky _ to the Fourth World.)
</P>
<P>
   As the first climbers emerged through the sipapuni and stepped
into the Upper World, Yawpa the mockingbird . . . sorted them out.
``You shall be a Hopi and speak the Hopi language,'' he said to
one. ``You shall be a Navajo and speak the Navajo language,'' he
said to another. . . . He assigned every person to a tribe and a
language. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The people gathered around while Yawpa the mockingbird placed
many ears of corn on the ground. One ear was yellow, one was white,
one was red, one was gray, some were speckled, one was a stubby ear
with blue kernels. . . . The mockingbird described the life that
went with each ear, and then he told the people to choose. . . .
The leader of the Navajos reached out quickly and took the yellow
ear that would bring a short life but much enjoyment and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   . . . . (The other people choose until) only the Hopis had not
chosen. The ear that was left was the stubby ear of blue corn.
</P>
<P>
   So the leader of the Hopis picked it up, saying, ``We were slow
in choosing. Therefore, we must take the smallest ear of all. We
shall have a life of hardship, but it will be a long-lasting life.
Other tribes may perish, but we, the Hopis, will survive all
adversities.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Hopis became the people of the short blue corn. &QL;

CHRONOLOGY - HOPIS

 1882: An order by President Chester A. Arthur sets aside about 2.5
million acres in northeastern Arizona for the Hopis and ``other
Indians'' who might be settled there by the secretary of the
Interior. The land centers on the mesas of the village-dwelling
Hopis, but includes areas occupied by scattered Navajo
sheepherders. 
 
 1900: An Indian agent to the Hopis reports that Navajos ``have been
allowed to encroach upon the Hopi Reservation for years, taking
possession of the best watering places, best farming, and best
pasture land. . . .'' 
 
 1925: An Indian agent writes that the Hopi tradition of clinging to
the mesas ``explains why they have not prospered parallel to their
neighbors, the Navajos.'' The same agent later reports that new
Hopi interest in lands beyond the mesas has brought them into
conflict with Navajos. 
 
 1930s-1940s: Federal officials act to reduce overgrazing by Navajos
and Hopis. Within the 1882 reservation, they establish the
650,000-acre Grazing District Six for exclusive Hopi use. Some
Navajo families are forced to relocate. Others continue living on
the remaining 1.8 million acres of the 1882 reservation. 
 
 1962: A court rules that the Navajos and Hopis are joint and equal
owners of the 1.8 million acres, which becomes known as the Joint
Use Area. 
 
 1974: Congress passes legislation to partition the Joint Use Area
and relocate those living on the ``wrong side'' of the line. 
 
 1991: To reduce relocation, a federal Appeals Court initiates
intertribal negotiations after a lawsuit claims relocation violates
Navajos' freedom of religion. 
 
 1996: The tribes reach an ``accommodation agreement'' to allow
Navajos to stay on Hopi land if they sign a lease acknowledging
Hopi jurisdiction. Many Navajos do so. Others refuse. 
 
 Feb. 1, 2000: Navajos on Hopi Partition Land who have not signed
the agreement are subject to eviction.

<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. _ Citing a ``shameful record of convicting
innocent people and putting them on death row,'' Gov. George Ryan
of Illinois on Monday halted all executions in the state, the first
such moratorium in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, a moderate Republican who supports the death penalty but
questions its administration, noted that 13 men had been sentenced
to death in Illinois since 1977 for crimes they did not commit,
before ultimately being exonerated and freed by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot support a system, which, in its administration, has
proven so fraught with error,'' he said, ``and has come so close to
the ultimate nightmare, the state's taking of innocent life.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was hailed by opponents of the death penalty,
who said mistaken convictions like those discovered in Illinois
were common throughout the United States. Some 85 people have been
found to be innocent and released from death row since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature in Nebraska passed a moratorium on executions
last year, citing concerns of racial disparity in sentencing, but
the governor vetoed it. Bills that would halt executions are
pending in 12 states. In Oregon, an anti-death-penalty group led by
Mark Hatfield, a former Republican senator and governor, hopes to
put a measure on the ballot that would eliminate executions and
provide instead for sentences of life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 inmates have been put to death since 1977, when
the Supreme Court allowed the reinstatement of the death penalty.
The death penalty is on the lawbooks in 38 states. The Midwest has
traditionally been a center of opposition to the death penalty. It
is not allowed in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, Wisconsin and
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's announcement of a moratorium in Illinois, pending a
review by a special panel, met with little public criticism here,
even among ardent conservatives, a measure of how public outrage
over the wrongful convictions has changed the political landscape
on the issue in this state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I can be sure that everyone sentenced to death in
Illinois is truly guilty, until I can be sure with moral certainty
that no innocent man or woman is facing a lethal injection, no one
will meet that fate,'' the governor said, according to The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading voices for a moratorium has been that of
Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago, who, while he was Cook County
state's attorney in the 1980s, prosecuted some of the death penalty
cases that later were overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Daley now contends that prosecutors did nothing improper in
these cases but that defense lawyers were often poorly financed and
sometimes incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   In nine of the reversed Illinois cases, students and professors
at Northwestern University unearthed pivotal evidence in the trials
that freed the men from death row.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Marshall, a law professor at Northwestern University
who is director there of the Center for Wrongful Convictions , said
that the mistakes unearthed in Illinois surely exist in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should not be seen as an Illinois problem,'' said
Marshall, who said defendants probably received fairer treatment in
Illinois than in many other places. ``What happened here is that we
got lucky in the first few cases, and found the evidence. After
that, people were more willing to take a second look at other
cases. It was a snowball effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The willingness in Illinois to examine such cases, Marshall
said, means that letters from inmates protesting innocence are not
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political climate has changed here,'' he said. ``There has
been an astonishing recognition that innocent people are being sent
to death row. So now people are re-examining cases in Illinois that
would not be re-examined in other states. The letters from those
inmates are being read, not thrown in the wastebasket.''

MYTH OF THE NAVAJO-HOPI DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(KYKOTSMOVI, Ariz) - _ Beyond the battles over which tribe has the
stronger spiritual connection to the land or the more powerful
claim for historic justice, the Navajo-Hopi dispute has also been a
battle of public relations.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, that worked to the advantage of the Hopis, long
celebrated among non-Indians for their highly spiritual,
peace-loving ways.Most outsiders heard ``Hopi'' and thought:
kachina dolls.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Hopi tribal leaders bolstered their position with
a PR campaign portraying the Navajos as marauding bullies.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, it's the Hopis' turn to be cast as the villains.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton Honyumptewa, director of the tribe's lands office, hears
it in telephone calls about the forced relocation of thousands of
Navajos from land granted by federal law to the Hopis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to know about this so-called genocide we're putting
on the Navajos,'' Honyumptewa said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Nutumya, a Hopi art dealer, encounters it at shows in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get questions all the time,'' he said, ``because the Navajos
have made people feel sorry for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the relocation issue has spawned pro-Navajo ``support
groups'' across the United States and as far away as Europe and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   They blast relocation as a human-rights violation and demand
that Congress cancel the program it created in 1974 to settle the
Navajo-Hopi dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The activists have spread their message on the Internet,
sometimes with an exaggerated sense of drama.
</P>
<P>
   In December, for example, an ``International Urgent Action''
bulletin was posted in English, French, German and Spanish, warning
about trouble on Feb. 1, when the Hopis will assume jurisdiction
over the 911,000 acres that were partitioned to them.
</P>
<P>
   On that date, the bulletin warns, ``the over 2,000 remaining
Dine people will be forcibly relocated.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal and Hopi authorities call the date a non-event, and
pledge that there will be no forced evictions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, federal officials concede that they _ and the
Hopis _ face a public-relations nightmare in the specter of elderly
Navajos being dragged off before news cameras. That could still
happen, they say, after eviction proceedings expected to last a
year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Such anti-Hopi feelings mark a curious historical counterpoint
to the 1960s, when admiring non-Indians streamed to the Hopi
mesas. &QL; 
THE HOPI WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They were drawn by the 1963 publication of Frank Waters' Book of
the Hopi, which celebrated the Hopis as a mystical people whose
very name means ``peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The book became part of the American counterculture, an anthem
of rejection of consumer culture and the nuclear age. It remains in
print, in a paperback edition that calls Waters' account ``a
reassertion of a rhythm of life we have disastrously tried to
ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Hopi Chairman Ferrell Secakuku said many of the eager
visitors camped near Old Oraibi.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in vans filled with flower children in white
robes,'' he said. ``I guess they were looking to realign their
lives in a Hopi way.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Hopis petitioned federal officials to remove the
``hippies.''
</P>
<P>
   But such romantic views of the Hopis _ never endorsed by the
Hopis themselves _ were only partially based on reality.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, not everyone agrees that the name Hopi means
``peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekkehart Malotki, a linguist at Northern Arizona University,
said the name actually means ``well mannered or civilized.'' The
Hopis adopted the name, he said, to distinguish themselves from
nomadic tribes that lacked agricultural and architectural skills. &QL; 
THE HOPI REALITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the tribe may never have fought the U.S. Cavalry, but
they do have a long tradition of fighting among themselves:
</P>
<P>
   In 1700, Hopi warriors wiped out one of their own villages,
Awatobi, after villagers embraced Christianity and welcomed back
Spanish priests who'd been driven out years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Hopi legends tell of a feud at the village of Shungopovi that
led to the establishment of Oraibi village. History documents that
a 1906 schism at Oraibi spawned the village of Hotevilla.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, four of the 13 Hopi villages guard their
independence so fiercely that they refuse to send representatives
to the Tribal Council, which they consider an alien institution
imposed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopis are far from united on many issues _ notably including
Navajo relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Hopi public opinion ranges from nationalistic pride over
achieving massive Navajo relocation to outright support for the
Navajos who are refusing to move.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse from a PR standpoint, some traditional Hopi religious
leaders are among the Navajo supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mina Lansa, traditional leader of Old Oraibi, criticized tribal
officials for warning of war unless Congress intervened in the land
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are not true, and it makes us very ashamed to
hear and see that some of our young people who claim to represent
us created much publicity in this way,'' Lansa said in a visit to
Washington. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE HOPI AMBIVALENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other traditionalists agreed, calling the Navajos good neighbors
and buffers against non-Indian encroachment.
</P>
<P>
   But even Hopi traditionalists aren't united. After Lansa's
death, her brother replaced her as kikmongwi. He has thrown his
support solidly behind the Tribal Council in the land dispute.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; So has Frazier Nasaftie. His family holds bitter memories of
problems with Navajos that began 50 years ago at their ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Navajo will steal from you even if he's your good friend,''
said Nasaftie, 64, who said Navajos helped themselves to Hopi corn
and peaches. ``The Hopis always say, `You can't trust a Navajo.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Quotskuyva, 88, also remembers conflict with Navajos, who
``burned Hopi houses and even killed some of our animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he said, ``I'm in between'' about the relocation question.
``I had a lot of Navajo friends.''
</P>
<P>
   And former Hopi Tribal Chairman Lee Thomas concisely expressed
the ambivalence felt by many Hopis that belies their stereotype as
the villains of relocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good friends,'' Thomas said of the Navajo neighbors he
pushed to have evicted from nearby land.
</P>
<P>
   Wiry and energetic at 83, Thomas leaned on his tractor and noted
that Navajos are not only friends but family: He has two Navajo
daughters-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with Navajos,'' he said calmly, ``except
they tried to take over the whole land.''  &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Navajo-Hopi land dispute is also a battle of public relations,
and for years, that worked to the advantage of the Hopis. The tribe
has long been celebrated among non-Indians for its highly
spiritual, peace-loving ways.

REPORTS ON IRAQI ARMS FRUSTRATE CLINTON'S ADVISERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Satellite photographs and American intelligence
reports have shown that Iraq has in in the last year rebuilt
military and industrial sites damaged by American and British air
strikes in late 1998, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The recent intelligence findings have raised concerns among
Defense Department and other officials in the Clinton
administration that in the prolonged absence of international
weapons inspectors, whose job would be to search those structures,
President Saddam Hussein's government has continued its pursuit of
biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those concerns, the administration's policy has been
allowed to drift, leaving the United States unable to force Iraq to
accept a resumption of inspections even after resolving an impasse
at the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's refusal has now left the administration in a quandary
over how to respond at a time when international support for its
policy and for sanctions against Saddam is waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern in intelligence circles that he has begun to
rebuild buildings that could enable him'' to produce chemical or
biological weapons, a senior administration official said. ``He has
had a lot of time to operate without inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the intelligence reports have not provided concrete
evidence that Iraq is producing chemical or biological weapons, the
officials said, the reports have raised the possibility of renewed
military confrontation, because the administration has repeatedly
warned that any effort by Iraq to produce the weapons would prompt
new American air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The concern has given urgency to the new inspection program
created last month by the Security Council. But for the
administration, the latest Iraqi defiance has been met with
frustration, uncertainty over how to proceed and even fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address on Thursday, President Clinton
devoted exactly six words to Iraq. The American representative to
the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, a diplomat noted for his
tenacity, barely involved himself in the Security Council's
negotiations over inspections, leaving them to his deputy, James
Cunningham, who arrived in New York just last month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a policy of ``containment,'' punctuated by American-led
strikes in 1993, 1996 and 1998, Saddam remains as much a thorn as
he was when Clinton took office. And Iraq's defiance comes in a
year when any action by the administration would have political
ramifications in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year and a half after Iraq blocked the last team of
U.N. inspectors, administration officials said that getting
inspectors back into the country remained the best way to determine
if Baghdad's weapons programs were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after months of diplomatic wrangling, the Security
Council agreed to nominate Hans Blix of Sweden to lead a new
inspection team in Iraq, having rejected a candidate supported by
the United States, Rolf Ekeus, also of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and France vetoed Ekeus' nomination after consultations
with Saddam's government, diplomatic officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Iraq has been less hostile toward Blix, Iraqi
officials have said they will not accept any resumption of
international weapons inspections under the terms of the latest
Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Saddam eventually relents and allows Blix's team to
enter the country, it will take at least three or four months
before inspectors can resume work inside Iraq. Administration
officials expressed their concerns when asked to assess the state
of Washington's policy toward Iraq. Some officials defended the
administration's approach, but others, including Pentagon
officials, criticized the policy out of concern that it has left
the United States few viable options.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen months ago, the United States and Britain launched four
nights of air and missile strikes to punish Saddam after he
expelled the last team of weapons inspectors. At the time, senior
commanders estimated that the operation had set back Iraq's ability
to produce chemical or biological weapons _ and the missiles needed
to launch them _ by one to two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're marching toward that point'' now, a senior military
officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon and other officials declined to discuss the recent
intelligence findings in detail, but they said Iraq had rebuilt
many of the 100 installations damaged or destroyed in the American
and British raids in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Of those targets, 12 were missile factories or industrial sites
that commanders said were involved in Iraq's efforts to produce
weapons of mass destruction. The officials said significant
reconstruction had been seen at those sites, including Al Taji
missile complex north of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the diplomatic wrangling, administration
officials defended their policy toward Iraq. They said they
remained determined to contain Saddam militarily while maintaining
the economic sanctions first imposed when Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990 and while supporting Iraqi opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   Officials emphasized that a new American attack did not appear
imminent. They said they wanted to see if the new inspection
program would eventually get off the ground before taking any
action that could further erode international support for the
American stance toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said there remained three ``red lines'' that
the United States would not let the Iraqis cross: a threat against
a neighboring country like Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, an attack on the
Kurdish minority in northern Iraq or a reconstitution of nuclear,
chemical or biological weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Washington's handling of Iraq said the administration
appeared to have no clear plan on how to force an end to Iraq's
defiance. ``There is no adult supervision of our policy,'' said
Anthony H. Cordesman, a military analyst at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And despite American efforts to unify Iraqi opposition groups,
factions remain. The administration has provided only a small part
of the $97 million that Congress authorized to support those bent
on overthrowing Saddam's government.
</P>
<P>
   Also, international sanctions are fraying. To win Russian and
French support for the new weapons inspection program, the United
States and Britain agreed to offer Iraq an opportunity to end the
sanctions. Under the new Security Council resolution, the United
Nations will suspend sanctions if Iraq cooperates with the new
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   But one reason for the continued Iraqi defiance may be that the
sanctions are already leaking. Iraq is allowed to export $10
billion a year to buy food and other essential goods, and while the
proceeds are closely monitored by the United Nations, the Iraqis
have been able to divert some of the money, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's government has also been able to earn millions of
dollars in smuggling. Since August, Iraq has steadily increased
illicit shipments of oil from the Shatt al Arab waterway, much of
it flowing through an installation near the port of Basra that
American warplanes attacked and damaged in 1998, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Iraq's illicit trade reached the highest level since
the Gulf war. More than 130 ships, some of them Russian, left the
port and skirted the Iranian coast, staying in Iran's territorial
waters to evade American ships trying to intercept them. ``The
Iranians are at least tacitly involved in this,'' a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the same month, Navy warships boarded only 36 ships and
seized only 4. According to American intelligence estimates, Iraq
was able to smuggle out a record amount of 317,000 metric tons of
oil, or more than 2.3 million barrels, in December alone. At
today's price of about $27 a barrel, the shipments were worth more
than $62 million.
</P>
<P>
   A recent intelligence report concluded that the smuggling was
undermining the sanctions. Pentagon and other administration
officials say they increasingly worry that the proceeds may be
intended to finance weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   But another senior administration official said the amounts of
illicit profit were not enough to allow Saddam to produce nuclear,
chemical or biological weapons. ``What's inside the buildings is
much more expensive to put up than any walls and roofs,'' the
official said.

 PR31-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(KYKOTSMOVI, Ariz) - _ Beyond the battles over which tribe has the
stronger spiritual connection to the land or the more powerful
claim for historic justice, the Navajo-Hopi dispute has also been a
battle of public relations.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, that worked to the advantage of the Hopis, long
celebrated among non-Indians for their highly spiritual,
peace-loving ways.Most outsiders heard ``Hopi'' and thought:
kachina dolls.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Hopi tribal leaders bolstered their position with
a PR campaign portraying the Navajos as marauding bullies.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, it's the Hopis' turn to be cast as the villains.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton Honyumptewa, director of the tribe's lands office, hears
it in telephone calls about the forced relocation of thousands of
Navajos from land granted by federal law to the Hopis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to know about this so-called genocide we're putting
on the Navajos,'' Honyumptewa said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Nutumya, a Hopi art dealer, encounters it at shows in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get questions all the time,'' he said, ``because the Navajos
have made people feel sorry for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the relocation issue has spawned pro-Navajo ``support
groups'' across the United States and as far away as Europe and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   They blast relocation as a human-rights violation and demand
that Congress cancel the program it created in 1974 to settle the
Navajo-Hopi dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The activists have spread their message on the Internet,
sometimes with an exaggerated sense of drama.
</P>
<P>
   In December, for example, an ``International Urgent Action''
bulletin was posted in English, French, German and Spanish, warning
about trouble on Feb. 1, when the Hopis will assume jurisdiction
over the 911,000 acres that were partitioned to them.
</P>
<P>
   On that date, the bulletin warns, ``the over 2,000 remaining
Dine people will be forcibly relocated.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal and Hopi authorities call the date a non-event, and
pledge that there will be no forced evictions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, federal officials concede that they _ and the
Hopis _ face a public-relations nightmare in the specter of elderly
Navajos being dragged off before news cameras. That could still
happen, they say, after eviction proceedings expected to last a
year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Such anti-Hopi feelings mark a curious historical counterpoint
to the 1960s, when admiring non-Indians streamed to the Hopi
mesas. &QL; 
THE HOPI WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They were drawn by the 1963 publication of Frank Waters' Book of
the Hopi, which celebrated the Hopis as a mystical people whose
very name means ``peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The book became part of the American counterculture, an anthem
of rejection of consumer culture and the nuclear age. It remains in
print, in a paperback edition that calls Waters' account ``a
reassertion of a rhythm of life we have disastrously tried to
ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Hopi Chairman Ferrell Secakuku said many of the eager
visitors camped near Old Oraibi.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in vans filled with flower children in white
robes,'' he said. ``I guess they were looking to realign their
lives in a Hopi way.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Hopis petitioned federal officials to remove the
``hippies.''
</P>
<P>
   But such romantic views of the Hopis _ never endorsed by the
Hopis themselves _ were only partially based on reality.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, not everyone agrees that the name Hopi means
``peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekkehart Malotki, a linguist at Northern Arizona University,
said the name actually means ``well mannered or civilized.'' The
Hopis adopted the name, he said, to distinguish themselves from
nomadic tribes that lacked agricultural and architectural skills. &QL; 
THE HOPI REALITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the tribe may never have fought the U.S. Cavalry, but
they do have a long tradition of fighting among themselves:
</P>
<P>
   In 1700, Hopi warriors wiped out one of their own villages,
Awatobi, after villagers embraced Christianity and welcomed back
Spanish priests who'd been driven out years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Hopi legends tell of a feud at the village of Shungopovi that
led to the establishment of Oraibi village. History documents that
a 1906 schism at Oraibi spawned the village of Hotevilla.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, four of the 13 Hopi villages guard their
independence so fiercely that they refuse to send representatives
to the Tribal Council, which they consider an alien institution
imposed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopis are far from united on many issues _ notably including
Navajo relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Hopi public opinion ranges from nationalistic pride over
achieving massive Navajo relocation to outright support for the
Navajos who are refusing to move.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse from a PR standpoint, some traditional Hopi religious
leaders are among the Navajo supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mina Lansa, traditional leader of Old Oraibi, criticized tribal
officials for warning of war unless Congress intervened in the land
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are not true, and it makes us very ashamed to
hear and see that some of our young people who claim to represent
us created much publicity in this way,'' Lansa said in a visit to
Washington. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE HOPI AMBIVALENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other traditionalists agreed, calling the Navajos good neighbors
and buffers against non-Indian encroachment.
</P>
<P>
   But even Hopi traditionalists aren't united. After Lansa's
death, her brother replaced her as kikmongwi. He has thrown his
support solidly behind the Tribal Council in the land dispute.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; So has Frazier Nasaftie. His family holds bitter memories of
problems with Navajos that began 50 years ago at their ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Navajo will steal from you even if he's your good friend,''
said Nasaftie, 64, who said Navajos helped themselves to Hopi corn
and peaches. ``The Hopis always say, `You can't trust a Navajo.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Quotskuyva, 88, also remembers conflict with Navajos, who
``burned Hopi houses and even killed some of our animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he said, ``I'm in between'' about the relocation question.
``I had a lot of Navajo friends.''
</P>
<P>
   And former Hopi Tribal Chairman Lee Thomas concisely expressed
the ambivalence felt by many Hopis that belies their stereotype as
the villains of relocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good friends,'' Thomas said of the Navajo neighbors he
pushed to have evicted from nearby land.
</P>
<P>
   Wiry and energetic at 83, Thomas leaned on his tractor and noted
that Navajos are not only friends but family: He has two Navajo
daughters-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with Navajos,'' he said calmly, ``except
they tried to take over the whole land.''  &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Navajo-Hopi land dispute is also a battle of public relations,
and for years, that worked to the advantage of the Hopis. The tribe
has long been celebrated among non-Indians for its highly
spiritual, peace-loving ways.

TRADE RUMORS SURROUND WALKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ The trading deadline is still more than three weeks
away, but that hasn't stopped Antoine Walker's name from popping up
in a lot of rumors.
</P>
<P>
   An NBA general manager told The Boston Globe that the Celtics
fluctuate when Walker's name comes up for discussion. A GM told
Sports Illustrated that the Celtics are trying to ``give away''
their captain.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, an intriguing rumor popped up on the Internet: The
Celtics would send Walker to Chicago for a No. 1 pick; the Pacers
would send Jalen Rose to Boston and acquire Toni Kukoc from
Chicago. It's even cap-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   So, what about it, Rick Pitino?
</P>
<P>
   ``Antoine Walker will not be traded unless Michael Jordan
considers to come back. Then, I would consider it,'' said the
Celtics coach before flying out to Indiana for Tuesday's game with
the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these rumors about Antoine Walker are false, (coming from)
people who don't understand the salary cap,'' Pitino said. ``And,
more important, he's playing exactly the way I want him to play
now. So, I didn't go through all these pains, from Kentucky on, to
finally start to get him that way, and then trade him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wasn't progressing the way we hoped, that'd be a
different situation. But it's totally opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach said Walker wants to remain a Celtic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not interested in retarding our growth,'' said Pitino.
``That's what that trade would do. We want to be patient. But we
also want to win. If we let Antoine Walker go for a first-round
draft pick, all we're doing is making excuses. We don't want to do
that. We want to stick with what we have right now and build on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. The trading deadline is 6 p.m., EST, Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked whom he voted for as Eastern Conference All-Star reserves,
Pitino said, ``None of your business'' (in a good-natured way, of
course.) ``It's a secret ballot.'' He said he wasn't wasting any
brain cells on the game or the voting. Paul Pierce, the Celtic most
likely to make it, said, ``I feel like I'm one of the better
players in the Eastern Conference. But, whether I'm having an
All-Star year or not, it really doesn't matter right now. It's what
happens with this team right now. If I make it, that's fine. I'll
be happy. But my main interest right now is winning ballgames and
making sure the team does well.'' Pierce did say that he thought
players on better teams should have the edge . . . Pitino said the
team is as close to 100 percent healthy as it has been all year. He
said Pierce ``looks like he's back'' from ankle and hamstring
injuries. Pierce concurred. ``Everything is pretty much up to
par,'' he said. ``Right now is as healthy as I've been since the
start of the season.'' . . . Pitino did say Adrian Griffin still is
somewhat limited by his ankle. Griffin will chase Reggie Miller
around Conseco Fieldhouse Tuesday . . . The Pacers have not played
since Saturday, so they, too, have had prep time for this one.
Indiana is looking at this one as another payback game, having lost
last time to the Celtics. The Pacers are 6-0 this season in such
situations . . . Pitino said he's particularly worried about
Indiana's 3-point shooting and the Pacers' home-court advantage.
``The three ball can hurt you because they shoot it with so many
different players,'' he said. Indiana is fifth in the league in
3-point shooting percentage and, at 18-2, has the best home record
in the East. A bigger concern: You have the team (Boston) that is
28th in fouls (only Cleveland commits more) and the NBA's top free
throw shooting team (Indiana, at 81.4 percent). The Celtics, by the
way, have had the two best free throw shooting teams in NBA
history. The 1989-90 team shot 83.2 percent and the 1988-89 team
shot 82.4 percent . . . Pitino said he likes his standard starting
five from an offensive standpoint. ``That lineup, staying together
for three or four years, will be extremely potent,'' he said. He
added that Walker is getting better defensively, too. ``When the
day comes where Paul and Antoine are our two best defensive
players, as well as being our two best offensive players, I think
that's when we'll have arrived as a basketball team,'' he said.

BRAVE'S PITCHER ROCKER BANNED FROM PLAYING UNTIL MAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Double parens in 7th graf substitute for brackets.) 
(DW) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Commissioner Bud Selig, saying John Rocker had
dishonored Major League Baseball by disparaging many groups of
society with his harsh comments in a magazine interview, suspended
the Atlanta Braves' No. 1 relief pitcher Monday for 73 days,
marking the first time a baseball player has been disciplined for
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The players' union said that it would file a grievance
challenging the suspension and suggested that the disciplinary
action was a public relations move.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said that Rocker could not participate in spring training
with the Braves, a 45-day period, and could not play during the
first 28 days of the season. The commissioner also fined Rocker, a
25-year-old Georgian, $20,000 and ordered him to undergo
sensitivity training.
</P>
<P>
   Under baseball practice, Rocker will not lose any of his salary
while he is suspended. He has yet to sign his contract for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major League Baseball takes seriously its role as an American
institution and the important social responsibility that goes with
it,'' Selig said in a statement. ``We will not dodge our
responsibility. Rocker should understand that his remarks offended
practically every element of society and brought dishonor to
himself, the Atlanta Braves and Major League Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who initially gained notoriety by lashing out at Mets
fans during the National League Championship Series last October,
expanded his target group in a Sports Illustrated article last
month. He disparaged an assortment of foreign people _ ``I'm not a
very big fan of foreigners,'' he said, adding, ``How the hell did
they get in this country?''_ as well as homosexuals and others. He
also called a black teammate ``a fat monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking about playing for a New York team, he said: ``Imagine
having to take the 7 train to the ball park, looking like you're
((riding through)) Beirut next to some kid with purple hair next to
some queer with AIDS right next to some dude who just got out of
jail for the fourth time right next to some 20-year-old mom with
four kids. It's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Marge Schott was the owner of the Cincinnati Reds in the
1990s, she was suspended more than once for her public statements
on blacks and Jews, but no player whom anyone could remember was
ever disciplined for words that he spoke. Players have been
suspended for drug abuse, and Dennis McLain, a well-known pitcher
for the Detroit Tigers, was suspended for the first half of the
1970 season for his relationship with gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker will not be permitted to begin formal preparation for the
season until April 3, when, he was informed, he could participate
in extended spring training and/or minor league activities. He
cannot play for the Braves until May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe it is appropriate that I should be harshly
disciplined for my misguided speech unaccompanied by any conduct on
my part,'' Rocker said in a statement released by his agents. ``I
have previously apologized for my unfortunate remarks and stand by
my apology.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks triggered an outcry from the Atlanta community as
well as Braves officials and players.
</P>
<P>
   As unpopular as Rocker's comments were, even with his own
teammates, the magnitude of the penalty is prompting the Players
Association to challenge it, Gene Orza, the union's associate
general counsel, said. A grievance would be heard by Shaym Das,
baseball's arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems fairly obvious to me,'' Orza said, ``that they
imposed this penalty in almost defiance of but certainly with an
eye toward the arbitration process. You wash your hands of it and
let others worry about the propriety of what you've done. I just
don't think they're going to fool anyone with what they're trying
to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution's freedom of speech provision does not apply to
private industry. Acknowledging that fact, Orza said: ``Speech
which harms the business is subject to discipline. The question is
whether the harm is real or just a function of the belief. You have
to actually demonstrate the harm. Even assuming that, the magnitude
of the penalty has to be taken into account.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were quick to link Rocker's remarks to potential
economic harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a very difficult time for the Braves' front
office,'' Stan Kasten, the club's president, said at a news
conference in Atlanta. Saying the Rocker issue generated the most
calls and mail he could recall on a single issue, he added: ``It
has been difficult for us businesswise because all of these people
had strong feelings. It's been difficult for the sales department,
the promotions department, the community relations department.''
</P>
<P>
   John Schuerholz, the team's general manager, said Braves players
had expressed the view that if Rocker were ``suspended, punished in
some way, probably fined for his comments, they would be willing to
give him a second chance as a teammate. They would be willing to
see him get a chance to redeem himself.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first players who criticized Rocker publicly was Tom
Glavine, an Atlanta pitcher, who is the union's National League
player representative. He might have been one of the people Orza
had in mind when he said, ``Even the people who are offended by
what Rocker said should see the stakes in this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All players,'' Orza added, ``who work in an industry that
encourages them and sometimes insists that they talk to the press
have a stake at not being penalized for pure speech unaccompanied
by bad conduct, particularly when the penalty for that pure speech
is as enormous as this one has been.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension, Orza said, is longer than that imposed on some
players who were found to have been drug users.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker had previously been ordered to undergo psychological
evaluation under baseball's Employee Assistance Plan. The
announcement Monday said he had completed that procedure.

PARTIES GARNER $100 MILLION IN `SOFT MONEY' IN 1999 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shrugging off calls for reform, the two major
parties raised about $100 million in unregulated ``soft money''
from unions, major corporations and wealthy individuals in 1999,
according to reports filed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Congress came within a handful of votes of banning the
controversial practice last year, soft money flowed in from
Hollywood, from Wall Street and from Minnesota to Texas. It came
from retailers and financiers and cigarette manufacturers. Soft
money donors included major corporations like AT&AMP;T and Microsoft;
big unions, and lots of rich people.
</P>
<P>
   Struck by the numbers from 1999, campaign finance experts
predicted Monday that the Democrats and Republicans might raise
$500 million in unregulated soft money funds in the 1999-2000
election cycle. The biggest tide of soft money donations always
occurs in the summer and fall before the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft money is going to be huge this cycle,'' said Larry
Makinson, of the Center for Responsive Politics. ``We are looking
at probably half a billion dollars in soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   When combined with the phenomenal fundraising success of GOP
presidential candidate George W. Bush -- who reported raising $70
million in hard money in 1999, and spending $17 million in the
three months leading up to the Iowa and New Hampshire presidential
contests -- the soft money totals appear to guarantee that the
1999-2000 election cycle will be the most expensive yet.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing just behind Bush and the two major parties were
Democrats Bill Bradley ($27 million) and Vice President Al Gore
($28 million) and GOP candidates Senator John McCain ($16 million).
Finance reports for publisher Steve Forbes were not available
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee listed $28 million in soft
money donations in its annual report Monday, which was the deadline
for filing the 1999 year-end reports. The Democratic National
Committee was right behind, with just under $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though final figures were not available for the parties'
congressional fundraising committees, party officials estimated
that these filings would add at least $50 million to the soft money
totals for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money donations flow through the biggest loophole in
federal election laws. Soft money is money that is given to the
Republicans and Democrats for ``party-building'' activities, and so
is not capped or regulated like the ``hard money'' given to
presidential or congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the candidates of both parties have taken
advantage of the parties' big soft money treasuries to run
televised advertising that boosts individual candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unlimited appetite for money in politics, and this
is the one place where there are no limits,'' said Makinson. ``This
will probably be the fastest growing part of the money pie this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous record for soft money expenditures was reached in
the 1995-1996 cycle, when the parties raised and spent $260
million.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC total was boosted by several six-figure contributions in
December alone, including some $400,000 donated by Bush's
fundraising ``pioneers,'' and their firms and families.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Fox, a Bush pioneer, gave the RNC $250,000 in December.
Officials from the Enron Corporation, a Texas energy firm with
close ties to Bush, gave the RNC $75,000. Other big donors included
the Philip Morris Co., the tobacco conglomerate, and Finn
Caspersen, the CEO of Knickerbocker Management Inc., each of whom
gave the Republicans $250,000 in December.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the big donors reported Monday include
Peter Angelos, the trial lawyer who owns the Baltimore Orioles, who
gave $100,000, and Jon Corzine, the Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. executive
who donated $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other big Democratic donors were Tim Gill, the chairman of
Quark, Inc., who gave $225,000; Louis Weisbach, the president of
HA-LO Industries, who donated $264,000, and the Pechanga Band of
Mission Indians of California, who gave the Democrats $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other Democratic donors were Marc Andreessen of
Netscape ($12,500); Los Angeles screenwriter Stephen Bing
($75,000); record producer Quincy Jones ($10,000) and journalist
Gail Sheehy ($1,000).
</P>
<P>
   The special Democratic ``New York Committee'' reported receipts
of $72,500 to help Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign. The DNC
distributed $118,000 to New York in the second half of 1999, the
report said.

EUROPEAN UNION WARNS AUSTRIA ABOUT ANTI-IMMIGRANT PARTY JOINING
GOVERNMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to correct spelling of two names: Joerg (in 1st graf) and
Schuessel (in 7th graf))  
(sw) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The European Union warned on Monday that its 14 other
members would diplomatically isolate Austria if its anti-immigrant
Freedom Party led by Joerg Haider enters a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, issued in Portugal, said the other members of the
European Union ``will not promote or accept any bilateral official
contacts at a political level'' with any Austrian government that
included Haider's party. Portugal now holds the European Union's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian candidates for posts in international organizations
would find no support, it said, and Austrian ambassadors ``will
only be received at a technical level.''
</P>
<P>
   It said that ``the Portuguese prime minister and the minister of
foreign affairs had already informed the Austrian authorities that
there would be no business as usual in the bilateral relations with
a government integrating'' Haider's party.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Portuguese television, Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres of Portugal justified the action, saying: ``We had to send
a very clear signal that behavior of a racist or xenophobic
character will not be tolerated within the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the union has issued such a warning to a
member state. Austrians were shocked, and a diplomatic crisis seems
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it strange if the 14 EU states were to come to such a
decision without consultations with the member state Austria,'' The
Associated Press quoted Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's own reaction, Reuters said, was that if the president
and other parties bowed to foreign pressure, ``then we might as
well abolish democracy in this country straight away.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it became clear last week that Haider had a chance of
being in the government, the European news media have been full of
articles implying that Nazism is on the rise in Austria, a charge
that many Austrians vigorously reject and resent.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's party, which favors cutting off immigration to Austria
and preventing European Union expansion because it is likely to
bring more eastern Europeans over Austria's borders, came in second
in the October elections, with 27 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The party's share of the votehas grown from 5 percent when
Haider took over in 1986, but political analysts say it is not
entirely because of its stance on immigration. Instead, they say,
the party's supporters are fed up with the cozy patronage
relationship between the Social Democrats, in power for 30 years,
and the People's Party, which has governed jointly with them for
the last 13.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the first-place Social Democrats and the third-place
People's Party failed to revive their coalition. So Haider began
negotiations with the People's Party on forming a coalition with
104 seats in the 183-seat legislature, squeezing out the Social
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Israel immediately reiterated a threat made in October to cut
off diplomatic relations. Other European countries, led by France
and Belgium, steadily ratcheted up their denunciations.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Austrians seemed dumbstruck on Monday by the European
announcement. ``This is very, very, very, very strange,'' said
Alexander van der Bellen, the leader of the Green Party, which came
in fourth in October. ``As an Austrian, I feel terrible. As head of
the Green Party, I can only say that we wanted to block the
participation of the Freedom Party in government, but still. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The threats, he said, would probably only make Austrians more
likely to snap back that ``no foreigners can tell us what to do,''
as was the case when they elected Kurt Waldheim as president after
he had been soundly condemned abroad for lying about the fact that
he had been an officer in a German army unit that committed
atrocities in Yugoslavia during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Haider contends that the hostility is really panic by Social
Democrats elsewhere Europe and that even Israel is reacting largely
to the prospect of an ally being forced out of power.
</P>
<P>
   He also says his critics know almost nothing about him.
President Jacques Chirac of France, Haider said this weekend,
``greeted me warmly at a state reception'' not long ago, ``and now
suddenly he is against us.''
</P>
<P>
   The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, gave a radio
interview on Monday in which he enumerated ways that a European
country could be punished if it was found to have violated
fundamental human rights.
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``what we want is for them to give up'' on plans to
let the Freedom Party into government. ``But if they don't, then
Austria will be under surveillance as no country has ever been in
the European Union,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to characterize Haider because his positions are
all over the political map. Van der Bellen of the Green Party has
called him an opportunist and a ``political chameleon,'' and many
Austrian analysts agree. Imitating Newt Gingrich, he calls his
platform, ``Contract With Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   He is definitely opposed to more immigration, and has used the
word ``over-foreignization,'' which many find redolent of Naziism.
He implies that immigrants are responsible for Austria's crime rate
and ``drug problem,'' although both are negligible, for welfare
fraud and for increases in tuberculosis in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   His words may fall on receptive ears because Austrians are
heavily taxed, and until recently, the country has had liberal
asylum policies and benefits for Balkan refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But he also gives voice to the frustration with the bickering
and the patronage machines of the Social Democrats and the People's
Party, a renamed Christian Democrat party. Austrians are so
disgusted with the two parties' failure to form a government since
October that polls suggest that if new elections were held today,
Haider would get 33 percent of the vote.

PUERTO RICO LETS NAVY RESUME SOME USE OF BASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Puerto Rico agreed Monday to let the Navy resume
limited training on the island of Vieques as part of a deal that
includes up to $90 million in aid if residents of Vieques vote to
allow live-fire exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement closely resembles the pact rejected by Puerto Rico
in December, with one important exception: an offer to more than
double the initial $40 million aid package. During six weeks of
often bitter negotiations, a compromise became possible when
``everyone agreed that the centerpiece should be that the people of
Vieques should decide the issue through a referendum,'' said a
senior official who took part in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Monday, President Clinton said the plan ``will
help resolve the impasse over Vieques in the fairest possible way,
because it will meet our training needs while giving the people
most affected by this decision _ the people who actually live on
the island _ the ability to choose for themselves the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Gov. Pedro Rossello of Puerto Rico said the Navy
could resume training with inert, or nonexploding, bombs, a
concession that was immediately criticized by Vieques activists who
vowed to block the return of the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is treason,'' Roberto Rabin, head of the Coordinating
Committee for Peace and Justice in Vieques, said in a telephone
interview. ``This is a very serious reversal of the position of the
Puerto Rican government that there will be no more bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabin said that his group, which includes some of the protesters
now occupying the Navy range in Vieques, would ``resist and
mobilize massive numbers of people the moment the Navy resumes
bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Monday to Clinton affirming the agreement, Rossello
said he would help evict the protesters occupying parts of the
900-acre range.
</P>
<P>
   The governor wrote that Puerto Rico would ``support federal
efforts to assure that trespassing or other intrusions on the range
cease entirely by providing complementary support required of state
and local jurisdictions.''
</P>
<P>
   That will relieve some of the concerns voiced by Attorney
General Janet Reno, who strongly argued that local law-enforcement
officials should be involved in any forcible removal of the
protesters from the range, which is scattered with unexploded
ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   All training was suspended last April when a civilian Puerto
Rican security guard was killed in a bombing accident, touching off
widespread protests there. The issue has even shaped the
presidential campaign and the Senate race in New York, which is
home to a large population of Puerto Ricans. Vice President Al Gore
and Hillary Rodham Clinton both sided with Puerto Rico in the
dispute with the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before Congress last fall, Rossello said the Navy
would not drop another bomb on Vieques after what he described as
six decades of poor stewardship of the island.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Navy has described the Vieques range as the
``crown jewel'' of its training ranges, the only site along the
East Coast where battle groups could use live ammunition during
joint training exercises that included amphibious landings of
marines, shelling from ships, and aerial bombardment from fighter
jets. Those exercises, the Navy says, are essential to prepare
sailors and marines for overseas deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum, tentatively scheduled for May 2001, will give
the people on Vieques a choice of letting the Navy resume full use
of the range with live bombs and ammunition or ordering the
military to end all training by May 1, 2003. If the voters favor
the Navy, Clinton has agreed to give an additional $50 million in
aid to encourage employment and development of the small island.
</P>
<P>
   With the resumption of training with dummy bombs, the island
will immediately receive $40 million to improve infrastructure,
like roads, ferry piers and the airport; to help the fishing
industry and offer job training for young adults; and to protect
the threatened waterways and wildlife of Vieques.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The negotiations became urgent when several members of Congress
threatened to close down the large Roosevelt Roads Naval Base in
Puerto Rico if Vieques training was ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Armed Services committee was even scheduled to begin
hearings Tuesday on the issue, but the session was canceled Monday
night after the agreement was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a general sense that it would be good to get this
done,'' said the official who took part in the negotiations. ``It
wasn't helpful to anyone to have the intensity of the opposition
between the military and Puerto Rico build up any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   In his annual speech on the state of Puerto Rico on Monday
evening, Rossello portrayed the agreement as a victory for the
island, which is a commonwealth of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I have the pleasure to announce to you with immense joy
that after six decades of military exercises on Vieques we have
arrived at a solution to ensure peace for Vieques,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign to win approval of the referendum in Vieques,
the Navy will highlight the fact that its officials now understand
the mistakes made in the past and are willing to spend $90 million
in programs to repair the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this represents a definite step ahead,'' Richard
Danzig, secretary of the Navy, said in an interview. ``Now the
people of Puerto Rico and the people of Vieques in particular
should embrace a process of reconciliation that is peaceful,
law-abiding, and doesn't allow for trespassing on the range.''

AS N.H. CAMPAIGN WINDS DOWN, CANDIDATES PUT THE GLOVES BACK ON
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERRIMACK, N.H. _ With the last hours before this state's
presidential primary ticking away and plenty of undecided voters
out there, it was time Monday for the candidates to make their
final pleas, show their best sides and conclude their campaigns on
memorable grace notes.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that Gov. George W. Bush and Gary L. Bauer found
themselves on a stage at an armory in Manchester around 9 a.m.,
spatulas in hands and pancakes at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   At this and other photogenic endeavors, the candidates turned
their attention away from detailed policy discussions and, by and
large, from biting verbal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect case in point was the presidential pancake flip-off.
Bush sent his pancake high into the air, where it did more than a
dozen revolutions before he caught it, for a score of 59 out of a
possible 60.
</P>
<P>
   His Republican opponent, Bauer, then lofted his own, stepped
backward and plummeted from the stage, but not before getting in a
dig at a conservative rival, the wealthy publisher Steve Forbes,
who was not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's over on the other side of town,'' Bauer said, ``at a
Faberge egg scrambling contest.'' Bauer's score was 29.
</P>
<P>
   At times Monday, the campaigns took on an aura of willful
levity, but the goal was utterly serious. By carefully contriving
scenes irresistible to television cameras, the candidates sought to
guarantee themselves a hefty share of the coveted time on local
news programs.
</P>
<P>
   They also wanted to project images of unflappable confidence or
unwavering determination, and they were not about to let too much
speechifying or too many unpredictable questions from voters get in
the way. Dropping by diners and family-run stores, they chattered
playfully, and any apprehension they felt was buried deep.
</P>
<P>
   When Forbes slid on a patch of ice outside his headquarters,
where he and several family members made telephone calls to voters
as television crews and photographers surrounded them, he was
nonplused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the ground is slipping,'' he said, ``we are
standing firm.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking potshots at each other for days, the Democratic
candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley,
had a fairly sedate day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent the day trying to win voters over one by one. He
campaigned in diners, on the telephone, on radio, on television and
at a town meeting Monday night in Amherst. He was still answering
questions about his relationship with President Clinton. ``I want
to take my own values into the presidency,'' he said. ``I think
people understand that any two human beings are very different.
That's where it's at.''
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside the inevitable questions about whether he would
respond to allegations by Bradley that Gore had trouble telling the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm focusing on the issues and I'm focusing on a positive
message for the future,'' he said. ``There's a big difference
between differences on the issues and having manipulative old
politics-as-usual attacks. I'm not going to do that, haven't done
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley stepped back Monday from the more confrontational
approach he has taken over the past week and returned to the
quieter, more cerebral, even inspirational style of his appearances
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the president of the United States to use the
power of that office to do good,'' he told workers a software
company, Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was a bit more rousing. With his four
youngest children he traveled from Keene, to Hanover, Concord,
Portsmouth and Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we win tomorrow night,'' he said in Keene, ``the message
is going to be sent from New Hampshire to America and the world
that we are going to give the government back to the people of the
United States, take it out of the hands of the special interests
and the big money and give it back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the candidates struck their most fetching poses in
public, their campaigns were also operating on another, less
visible track. Each operation was marshaling its resources and
lavishing its energy in the service of last-ditch efforts to get
out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser for Bush said that his campaign had an army of
4,000 volunteers _ nearly half of them from outside New Hampshire _
who were placing phone calls and canvassing neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Bush campaign placed about 110,000 phone calls
Monday and would place nearly as many on Tuesday. Voters who had
already indicated steadfast support for Bush got a recorded message
Monday from his wife, Laura Bush, who thanked them and encouraged
them to go to the polls; undecided voters heard the taped voice of
Bush, asking them for their help.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made calls himself.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., the chairman of Bush's campaign in the
state, said that more than 180,000 pieces of literature touting
Bush's candidacy had been distributed door-to-door over the last
week. Additionally, the amount of money Bush had devoted to
advertising for the New Hampshire race climbed to $3.3 million,
much more than the $2.1 million that his advisers estimated that
McCain was able to spend. A spokesman for McCain said that the
senator had spent much less than that, but said he could not
provide a specific figure.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides, the intensive efforts reflected polls that showed
races still too tight to call.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidates themselves talked less about actual numbers
and more about the general success they insisted they were
anticipating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something going on out there,'' Bush told reporters as
he visited a state government office in Concord. ``It's called
energy and enthusiasm and excitement, and I like my chances.''

PARTIES GARNER $100 MILLION IN `SOFT MONEY' IN 1999 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shrugging off calls for reform, the two major
parties raised about $100 million in unregulated ``soft money''
from unions, major corporations and wealthy individuals in 1999,
according to reports filed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Congress came within a handful of votes of banning the
controversial practice last year, soft money flowed in from
Hollywood, from Wall Street and from Minnesota to Texas. It came
from retailers and financiers and cigarette manufacturers. Soft
money donors included major corporations like AT&AMP;T and Microsoft;
big unions, and lots of rich people.
</P>
<P>
   Struck by the numbers from 1999, campaign finance experts
predicted Monday that the Democrats and Republicans might raise
$500 million in unregulated soft money funds in the 1999-2000
election cycle. The biggest tide of soft money donations always
occurs in the summer and fall before the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft money is going to be huge this cycle,'' said Larry
Makinson, of the Center for Responsive Politics. ``We are looking
at probably half a billion dollars in soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   When combined with the phenomenal fundraising success of GOP
presidential candidate George W. Bush -- who reported raising $70
million in hard money in 1999, and spending $17 million in the
three months leading up to the Iowa and New Hampshire presidential
contests -- the soft money totals appear to guarantee that the
1999-2000 election cycle will be the most expensive yet.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing just behind Bush and the two major parties were
Democrats Bill Bradley ($27 million) and Vice President Al Gore
($28 million) and GOP candidates Senator John McCain ($16 million).
Finance reports for publisher Steve Forbes were not available
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee listed $28 million in soft
money donations in its annual report Monday, which was the deadline
for filing the 1999 year-end reports. The Democratic National
Committee was right behind, with just under $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though final figures were not available for the parties'
congressional fundraising committees, party officials estimated
that these filings would add at least $50 million to the soft money
totals for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money donations flow through the biggest loophole in
federal election laws. Soft money is money that is given to the
Republicans and Democrats for ``party-building'' activities, and so
is not capped or regulated like the ``hard money'' given to
presidential or congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the candidates of both parties have taken
advantage of the parties' big soft money treasuries to run
televised advertising that boosts individual candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unlimited appetite for money in politics, and this
is the one place where there are no limits,'' said Makinson. ``This
will probably be the fastest growing part of the money pie this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous record for soft money expenditures was reached in
the 1995-1996 cycle, when the parties raised and spent $260
million.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC total was boosted by several six-figure contributions in
December alone, including some $400,000 donated by Bush's
fundraising ``pioneers,'' and their firms and families.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Fox, a Bush pioneer, gave the RNC $250,000 in December.
Officials from the Enron Corporation, a Texas energy firm with
close ties to Bush, gave the RNC $75,000. Other big donors included
the Philip Morris Co., the tobacco conglomerate, and Finn
Caspersen, the CEO of Knickerbocker Management Inc., each of whom
gave the Republicans $250,000 in December.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the big donors reported Monday include
Peter Angelos, the trial lawyer who owns the Baltimore Orioles, who
gave $100,000, and Jon Corzine, the Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. executive
who donated $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other big Democratic donors were Tim Gill, the chairman of
Quark, Inc., who gave $225,000; Louis Weisbach, the president of
HA-LO Industries, who donated $264,000, and the Pechanga Band of
Mission Indians of California, who gave the Democrats $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other Democratic donors were Marc Andreessen of
Netscape ($12,500); Los Angeles screenwriter Stephen Bing
($75,000); record producer Quincy Jones ($10,000) and journalist
Gail Sheehy ($1,000).
</P>
<P>
   The special Democratic ``New York Committee'' reported receipts
of $72,500 to help Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign. The DNC
distributed $118,000 to New York in the second half of 1999, the
report said.

 SPRINGFIELD, Ill.: the wastebasket.''   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Illinois seems to have become a center of debate over the
death penalty, the issue is gaining resonance around the nation,
after many years in which it was seen as essentially a dead letter
in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the halt on executions here, and the vetoed moratorium
in Nebraska, the death penalty has been the focus of intense
scrutiny in Florida and other states. Last year, in a visit to the
United States, Pope John Paul II called on Catholics to oppose the
death penalty. And a new movie, ``Hurricane,'' examines the life of
a man, Reuben Carter, who was sent to death row for a crime he did
not commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to raise more concerns about the death
penalty,'' said Steven Hawkins, the executive director of the
National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. ``It's becoming
obvious that mistakes can be made, and innocent people'' can be
sent to death row.
</P>
<P>
   While the wrongful convictions in Illinois have generated
intense scrutiny and debate, Florida has seen 18 death row cases
reversed, the most of any state.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who said he would appoint a panel to study death penalty
sentences, heads the Illinois campaign for Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the state that executes more people than any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that a public dialogue must begin on the question of
fairness of the application of the death penalty in Illinois,''
Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   In about a year as governor, Ryan has taken some actions that
have put him at odds with conservatives in his party. He has called
for strict gun control, expressed support for the civil rights of
gay people and traveled to Cuba and met with Fidel Castro, the
communist leader. Some suburban and downstate lawmakers have
complained that Ryan has maintained too cozy a political
relationship with Mayor Daley, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has lately been beleaguered by an investigation into a
bribery scandal at driver's license bureaus that occurred during
his watch as the Illinois secretary of state. While Ryan has not
been charged with wrongdoing, one of his top aides is expected to
be indicted. Seventeen people have pleaded guilty to taking bribes
to fix driver's license exams, and some of the bribe money went to
Ryan's campaign.

<P>
   Since 1977, Illinois has executed 12 inmates, the most recent in
March 1999, the lethal injection of Andrew Kokoraleis, a suburban
Chicago man who had been convicted of an especially grisly murder.

<P>
   The Cook County state's attorney's office has instituted special
internal reviews for all cases that would be eligible for the death
penalty. The prosecutor's office, which is headed by Richard
Devine, a Democrat, has not called for an execution date since
April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   David Erickson, the first assistant state's attorney, said the
governor's call for a moratorium was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy thing would have been to finger-point, and the
governor did not do that,'' Erickson said. ``If something has
fallen apart here, it is a systemic problem.''

 &HT;    NFL linebacker questioned after double murder in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta police are trying to determine if Baltimore
Ravens middle linebacker Ray Lewis had any connection to a double
slaying that occurred in the tony Buckhead club district just hours
after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   National Football League officials said they were taking a
wait-and-see attitude after learning Lewis' name had surfaced in
the murder investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said Monday night he had been cleared by Atlanta homicide
investigators in the stabbing deaths of Jacinta Baker and Richard
Lollar. But Atlanta homicide investigators declined comment on the
NFL star Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens coach Brian Billick and Ravens owner Art Modell said they
are waiting to see how the situation unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was allowed to fly to Hawaii where he will play in the Pro
Bowl, NFL officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Angry Buckhead activists, meanwhile, vowed to ask the Atlanta
City Council for a temporary curfew that would shut down the area's
nightclubs and bars at 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   No arrest warrants had been issued as of late Monday and police
said they were desperately seeking any witnesses who may have seen
the fatal altercation near the Cobalt Lounge on East Paces Ferry
Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone can come forward we would really appreciate it,''
said Lt. Mike Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Officers and detectives involved in the double murder
investigation said Lewis was inside the black stretch limousine
that roared away from the spot where Baker and Lollar were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and his agents denied any wrongdoing on his part.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not involved in any aspect of the investigation as far as
I know,'' said Roosevelt Barnes, Jr., one of Lewis' agents.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lewis confirmed to the Baltimore Sun he was
questioned by Atlanta police, but says he was told he could go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cooperated fully (with police). As far as the situation, I
have no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, 21 and Lollar, 24, were stabbed several times as the pair
fought with a handful of men who were passengers in a stretch
Lincoln Navigator limousine with Maryland plates, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens owner Art Modell said, ``I don't believe he had anything
to do with it. I'm going to give Ray the benefit of the doubt and
defend him until something is proven otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis became the NFL's highest-paid linebacker in November 1998
when he signed a four-year, $26 million contract, which included a
$7 million signing bonus. A first-round draft choice of the Ravens
in 1996 out of the University of Miami, Lewis has played in three
straight Pro Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is scheduled to stand trial in Maryland's Baltimore County
next month for assaulting a woman in a bar on Dec. 6, 1999. The
24-year-old woman claims Lewis struck her on the left side of the
face, knocking her into the bar at Baltimore's Windsor Mill Inn.
Lewis left the scene before police arrived. Atlanta homicide Lt.
Mike Smith said detectives are seeking any witnesses who may have
seen the 4 a.m. altercation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want anyone who saw this to please come forward,'' Smith
said Monday afternoon. ``We just want to question anyone who may
have seen anything or heard anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The one big break in the case came just a couple of hours after
the killings when detectives found the stretch limousine behind a
Holiday Inn on Peachtree Road. Homicide detectives spent most of
the day talking to the driver of the luxury sedan, but they would
not provide details concerning those conversations. Police were
called to the hotel after someone told them a man with bloodstains
on his clothing had gotten out of the Lincoln Navigator limousine
and entered a bathroom in the hotel lobby to wash off, officers
said.
</P>
<P>
   No arrest warrants had been issued as of Monday night.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS CRAFTING BILL TO EASE `MARRIAGE PENALTY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to keep President Clinton from stealing one
of their tax-cut proposals, House Republicans on Monday put the
final touches on legislation to ease the so-called ``marriage
penalty'' in the federal tax code.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, drafted by Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, with no input
from Democrats, would provide tax relief for more married taxpayers
in higher-income brackets and would cost four times more than the
proposal outlined last week in Clinton's State of the Union
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people support this, representatives and senators
of both parties support this, so there's no excuse why this
shouldn't be done this year,'' said Archer, who chairs the House
Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 million two-paycheck couples pay more income tax,
largely because their combined income boosts them into a higher tax
bracket than if they were filing separately.
</P>
<P>
   Archer plans for his tax-writing committee to consider the bill
Wednesday and send it to the full House for debate by Feb. 14,
Valentine's Day. Archer's bill is similar to a provision included
in last year's $792 billion tax package Republicans pushed through
Congress last year only to have it vetoed by Clinton complaining it
was too large.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by Clinton's veto, which prompted little public
backlash, Republican leaders in the House last month announced
plans to repackage their tax-cut proposals in a series of separate
bills that will make them harder for Democrats and the White House
to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it is approved by the House, the marriage-penalty relief
bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where many
Republicans prefer combining smaller tax cuts into one large tax
package.
</P>
<P>
   In his annual address to Congress, Clinton on Thursday called
for easing the so-called marriage penalty for about 9 million
couples. The president's plan, which would be phased-in over the
next 10 years, would increase the standard income deduction for
two-income couples to an amount twice what is allowed for single
filers.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's measure, which is backed by the House leadership, would
increase the standard deduction for married couples to twice that
for single tax filers beginning in 2001. This would translate into
a standard deduction of $8,800, compared to the current $7,351.
</P>
<P>
   It would allow married couples to pay the lowest tax rate on
their first $52,500 of income, compared to the $43,850 under
current law.
</P>
<P>
   The Archer proposal would provide no tax break for middle- and
lower-income couples who already are in the 15-percent tax bracket
until at least 2006. Archer estimated it would extend a tax break
to a total of 44 million two-income households by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The Archer bill also would enlarge the bottom 15 percent income
tax rate to ensure a tax cut for couples with higher incomes and
those who itemize deductions. Clinton proposes relief only for
couples who take the standard tax deduction.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the GOP and the president propose increasing by
$2,000 the income cutoff for lower-income married couples who claim
the earned income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP bill would reduce government revenue by $182.3 billion
over 10 years, or almost 10 percent of the projected $1.9 trillion
non-Social Security surplus. Clinton's proposal to ease the
marriage penalty would cost $45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   New York Rep. Charles Rangel, the ranking Democrat on the Ways
and Means Committee, said Archer and other Republicans are
signaling that they prefer to put Democrats into a position of
having to accept the GOP proposal or appear to vote against relief
from the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also signals that they (the Republicans) do not want to get
something done for the American people,'' Rangel said. ``The bulk
of the cost of the bill is accounted for by the tax break to those
with incomes that exceed the top of the 15 percent tax bracket,
(and) that's the most affluent one-quarter of tax filers.''
</P>
<P>
   Before agreeing to support the Republicans' proposal, White
House officials said the president wants to see how they balance
projected budget surpluses among the overall priorities of Social
Security, Medicare, government spending, debt repayment and tax
cuts.

<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ From the stage at a hotel ballroom here the other
night, Alan Keyes was scorching another Republican audience with a
speech about, among other things, the depravity of President
Clinton, the moral crisis endangering the Republic, and most of
all, Keyes' conviction that he alone could save the Republicans
from losing the White House for a third time in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In the audience, Susan Davis leapt to her feet again and again.
When Keyes finished, Ms. Davis, a Republican from Nashua, pulled
him over for a handshake and a compliment. ``Ambassador Keyes, it
is an honor _ an honor _ to meet you!'' she proclaimed. ``I look
forward to coming to Washington and serving in your
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Keyes moved away, Ms. Davis offered a quiet confession.
Yes, she said, she would vote for him in the primary here Tuesday,
but would he win? ``Sadly, I don't think he will,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, Keyes _ or Ambassador Keyes, as he prefers to be
addressed _ should be on a roll. Since finishing third in the Iowa
caucuses, he has been cheered by Republican audiences here and has
appeared on television talk shows. The candidate who had complained
that he had been ignored by the news media because he was black
says that these days, he is finally getting the attention he
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   But even Keyes is already talking about what is next after New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I know there is a path that leads to the
nomination,'' Keyes said in an interview at his hotel in Concord
the other morning. ``That path, while not likely, is possible.
There is a very possible series of events that leads to Alan Keyes
being nominated.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes is, without question, a distinctive presence in this
Republican contest: an unusually evocative speaker, a black
Republican and a conservative who stands to the right in a
conservative field, an ideological stance that served him well in
the Iowa caucuses. But New Hampshire is not Iowa, with its strong
and influential bloc of Christian conservatives and Keyes' speeches
about moral decline and abortion _ the defining platform of his
candidacy _ may not carry quite the weight here that they did in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   That his sensibilities on abortion may be slightly askew from
those of some potential supporters was particularly clear the other
day when he took his case to an audience of elementary school
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now tell me something. If I were to lose my mind right now and
pick one of you up and dash your head against the floor and kill
you, would that be right?'' Keyes asked his young audience. ``It's
wrong to kill children, isn't it? At what age is it all right to
kill children?'' Keyes worked backward until he posed the question
about a fetus.
</P>
<P>
   The point, Keyes explained later, was to provide the children a
lesson they would never forget. Some of the parents found it
unsettling, though Keyes said he had no apologies. ``I think the
message and the result was entirely appropriate,'' he said. ``And
in fact, it was the way they should be taught, if you don't mind me
saying so.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes remains an intense and at times angry man, wary of what he
sees as discrimination against him, which he said is frequent. He
recounted, by way of an example, an episode in which he showed up
at MSNBC studios here to offer his reaction to Clinton's State of
the Union address, only to learn that he had been inserted as part
of a panel, rather than being given his own platform. He left.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Keyes perseveres, proclaiming his faith in God _ ``Our
rights come from the hand of the creator God almighty: that is the
first premise of American life'' _ and denouncing abortion, big
government, homosexual marriage, and the income tax system to
anyone who will give him an ear or a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   And there is arguably no one in the field who is quite as
unambivalent _some Republicans suggest the word is extreme _ in his
views as Keyes. Steve Forbes supports a flat tax, and George W.
Bush and John McCain favor a cut in the tax rates. Keyes supports
eliminating the payroll and income tax entirely, replacing it with
a sales tax of about 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All the candidates decry Clinton: Keyes describes him as ``a
traitor'' and his presidency as ``the most humiliating and
degrading and shameful'' in the history of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he shows signs of fading away, Keyes continues to argue
that he alone can win the White House for his party next year,
dispatching Bush and McCain as candidates headed for certain
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open your eyes,'' he said. ``Money will not win this election.
Name will not win this election. The only thing that will win this
election for the Republican Party is a champion that can stand
before the American people and challenge them to return to their
allegiance to our great moral principles.''

<P>
   PEPPERMINT CORNER, N.H. _ Vivian Poirier, a 44-year-old massage
therapist, smiled broadly Monday when asked at the Post Office in
Portsmouth, on the eastern edge of the state, to judge how this
year's primary campaign for president had been conducted. ``There
doesn't seem to be as much _ what's the word I'm looking for? _
viciousness,'' she responded. ``They aren't as vicious, which is
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Derry, to the southwest, Grant Benson, 71, a hardware store
owner, said after years of being forced to choose the lesser of two
evils, he has never been as pleased with the candidates as this
time. ``I think it may even be better today than it was 30 years
ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in this tiny enclave further south, Joanne Tramontozzi, 52,
a sales clerk, said she could not remember as detailed _ if perhaps
at times dry _ examination of the issues by the candidates. ``It's
been a nicer campaign,'' she said. ``In the past, it was all
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   In a marked break from the tenor of presidential campaigns over
the past two decades, New Hampshirites _ in dozens of interviews
across the state on the eve of the nation's first primary _ said
Monday they were pleased with the choice of candidates and
heartened by what they described as an unexpectedly uplifting
discourse by candidates of both parties, at least until this past
weekend, when Al Gore and Bill Bradley, the two Democrats, began
squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   They also described themselves as largely pleased with the state
of the nation, and, most important, the economy, in a part of the
nation that has long suffered. The almost single-minded focus on
economic decline that for so long dominated interviews here with
voters _ and shaped the appeals of presidential candidates from
both parties _ has been replaced with a broad new set of issues,
including health care, education and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The voters' comments came on a day when this tiny state's
fascination with politics, as well as its arguably disproportionate
influence on the presidential selection process, was on display.
Caravans of candidates barreled across the state's highways, while
on street corners, young volunteers, many of them bussed from New
York and Boston, hoisted placards bearing the names of their
candidates and waiving to motorists driving by, some honking in
support.
</P>
<P>
   And more than ever, voters here, voicing a parochial pride, said
they were confident that this state serves a valuable role in
inspecting, even educating, the Democrats and Republicans who have
put themselves forward to be president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you people in New York City think? Those country
bumpkins up there, right?'' said Ernest Desjardins, a clinical
neuropsychiatrist from Rye. ``But in some ways, we make or break a
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The upbeat politicking reflected a campaign season that voter
after voter Monday described as ``nice,'' and the candidates as
``substantive.'' It offered a particularly striking contrast to
presidential campaigns of the past decade, when voters, here and
elsewhere, always seemed unhappy with the candidates before them _
and often blamed them for their own discontent.
</P>
<P>
   An important reason for the collective smiles among the
electorate here may be that voters also said they were not consumed
by any single looming issue and were relatively pleased with their
own lives. ``There aren't any that stand out,'' said John
Prendergast, 36, a landscaper from Portsmouth. ``There's nothing
broken specifically.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, voters said, they were not searching for candidates
eager to change things in Washington. ``This is the most prosperity
we've ever had,'' Desjardins said. ``I don't think anyone is
anxious to have any change. It would be nice to keep this going for
a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Bouley, 51, the owner of Shute's Corner Country Store near
here, said while he was concerned about the nation's health care
system, he mostly wanted things to stay the way they are. Thus, he
said, he is voting for Gore. ``I'd like the economy to stay the way
it is,'' he said. ``I wouldn't want to gamble with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues raised by voters Monday reflected, for the most part,
what is being discussed by candidates from both parties. ``Campaign
finance is a big one for me,'' said Jeff Burton, a 29-year-old
computer programmer from Dover, and a Bradley supporter. ``There's
too much money in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Megan Hall, 21, a student at University of New Hampshire, said
she was concerned about the viability of Social Security, a topic
that has been debated by both Democrats and Republicans. ``I want
it to be there when I'm ready to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is taxes: an evergreen issue here in New
Hampshire. ``The government takes too much from us,'' said Ms.
Hall. Her sister, Amanda, 20, then joined her in chanting a line
that could be heard at most campaign stops and on talk radio
throughout the day: ``It's like giving the government an
interest-free loan.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was the tone of the primary campaign that drew the most
remarks from voters Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the cleanest campaign I can remember _ it has been
nothing like in the past,'' said Kelly Taaffee, 42, a legal
assistant, as she chatted over lunch in Keene. ``The candidates
have stuck to the issues for the most part. It's been a gentleman's
race so far _ really.''
</P>
<P>
   A clerk at the camera store up the street, Robert Hale, 21,
said: ``All the candidates have handled themselves well this year.
I'm happy to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Donah, 55, who is retired and lives in Portsmouth, said
that he watched both parties' presidential debates, and was
impressed by what he described as the candidates' demeanor and
depth. ``We have had some intelligent debates,'' he said. ``I felt
they were both civil. We did not get into a contest of stupidity.''
</P>
<P>
   And those voters who expressed concern with the attacks that
have marked the closing days of the campaign mostly blamed Bradley,
who stepped up his attacks in the final weekend of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does bother me that Bradley had started to become negative
in the last few days,'' said Mary Ann Kristiansen, 36, and a
Democrat who said she had been leaning toward voting for Bradley.
``It only hurts the Democratic Party. I thought he'd stay away from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in past years, voters offered relatively little criticism
of other candidates in expressing their choice. Again and again,
they said they would be satisfied with a number of choices.
``McCain, Bradley and Gore _ they all would make good candidates,''
said Al Souma, 68, a retired manufacturing manager from here.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Sheppard, who was having breakfast at Mary Ann's Diner,
said he was voting for Sen. John McCain, adding: ``I feel quite
good about my candidate, and not that he's the best of a bad
bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as politicians in other states continue to question New
Hampshire's oversized influence in the political process, most
voters said they were not about to abdicate their position _ and
pointed to the events taking place outside their windows in
explaining why.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Washington area you never see the candidates, you just
get stuck in traffic behind them,'' said Mike Ward, 53, an
administrator at Keene State College, who moved here from Virginia
last year. ``The access here is phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Live free or die!'' declared Charles Butterfield, 83, a
retired postmaster who lives near here as he repeated the state
slogan. ``In New Hampshire, you don't push us around.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Canada, a violence mediator from Portsmouth, said: ``We
are an eclectic people. We are highly intelligent. We are highly
educated.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their satisfaction over how the run-up to the primary
has played out, many voters here said they were ready for it all to
end on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it _ as long as it doesn't go on too much longer,''
said Al Dimmock, 62, a retired truck driver from Derry. ``After a
while it gets pretty boring.'' Ms. Tramontozzi said she was eager
for the politicking to end. ``It seems like the only thing you see
on television is campaign, campaign, campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Crooker, 54, a machinist who is on disability and lives
near Peppermint Corner, said he had been besieged for weeks by
mailings and telephone calls from campaigns. As a mail carrier
tried to jam more literature into his mailbox Monday afternoon,
Crooker, who was shoveling the snow off his walk, waved him off:
``No political mail! Please!''
</P>
<P>
   The mail carrier commiserated with a chuckle. ``I don't blame
you,'' he said.

MANNESMANN MAY RECONSIDER A MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., skedded earlier as VODAPHONE-MANNESMANN)  
(lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Mannesmann AG reversed its opposition to
talks with Vodafone AirTouch PLC on Monday and began to consider a
face-saving friendly merger, executives close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said there was a growing feeling within
Mannesmann that the company could not defeat the $156 billion
hostile takeover bid from Vodafone, especially after Vivendi SA,
historically an ally of Mannesmann, joined an alliance with
Vodafone on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While advisers to Mannesmann and Vodafone have already been in
contact, the talks are now expected to intensify, the executives
said. ``There is greater likelihood of a friendly deal now,'' one
executive said. Mannesmann is also ready to accept a lower stake in
the combined company, the executives said, though it is still not
ready to accept Vodafone's current proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Vodafone, increasingly confident that it will capture a
majority of Mannesmann shares by the time its offer expires on Feb.
7, has yet to raise its offer, and people on both sides were
skeptical that it would do so.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's chief executive, Klaus Esser, has insisted that he
would reject any offer in which Mannesmann shareholders ended up
with less than 58.5 percent of the shares in the combined company.
Vodafone's current offer would give them 47.2 percent, though
Vodafone has offered to raise that share to about 49 percent if
Esser agrees to a friendly deal.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mannesmann's spokesman said the company was receptive
to a higher offer. ``If there is an improvement in the offer, then
this would be a totally different situation,'' said Georg Denoke,
Mannesmann's spokesman, in a telephone interview. But he added,
``We would only negotiate a deal that is really good for our
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Other people close to Mannesmann said Esser might accept an
offer that gave Mannesmann control of just 51 percent of the
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann executives were still stunned Monday by Vodafone's
agreement on Sunday to form a big new Internet venture with
Vivendi. The news was a big blow to Mannesmann, which has been
Vivendi's partner in France's second-largest wireless telephone
company, SFR, and which had been trying to negotiate its own merger
with Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Mannesmann said Esser endured a stormy meeting
with members of the company's supervisory board. Several board
members are now forcefully prodding Esser to reach an agreement if
possible. Among those who favor an agreement are Henning
Schulte-Noelle, chief executive of Germany's largest insurance
company, Allianz AG, and Juergen E. Schrempp, chief executive of
DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   But one person close to Mannesmann said Vodafone's hand seemed
so strong now that it might be able to acquire a majority of shares
without sweetening its deal at all.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts in London questioned who was in the driver's
seat. ``Why would Vodafone do this deal with Vivendi if they had
the whole deal locked up?'' one analyst asked. Another analyst
acknowledged the counter point, ``Mannesmann no longer has a card
to play,'' referring to Vodafone's alliance with Vivendi, spoiling
a white knight scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Some shareholders have already begun offering their shares to
Vodafone, but Vodafone has refused to say how many shares it has
received. Typically in a takeover battle, most stockholders wait
until the last day or two before selling.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and institutional investors said the Feb. 7 deadline is
self-imposed by Vodafone and that some investors said they might
hang onto their shares and make their decision before Feb. 21, when
the deadline lapses under German takeover regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the actual percentage of Vodafone shares that end
up in the hands of Mannesmann's current shareholders, control of
the combined company would rest with Vodafone's chief executive,
Chris Gent. Mannesmann's shares are widely distributed among
shareholders and Esser would not be able to invoke them in a bid to
retain management control of the ``new'' Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   Gent remains eager to reach a peaceful agreement. Even if a
majority of Mannesmann's shareholders trade in their shares for
stock in Vodafone, Mannesmann's dissenting shareholders could still
block or at least delay Vodafone from taking full legal control of
the company. Those problems are greatly reduced if Mannesmann
management endorses Gent's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Investors interpreted the Vodafone-Vivendi alliance as a sign
that Vodafone would prevail. Mannesmann shares closed up 4.5
percent, or 12.05 euros ($11.69), at 280.25 euros ($271.81) in
Frankfurt trading, while Vodafone closed 1.5 percent lower in
London, down 5.25 pence (8.48 cents) at 338.50 pence ($5.47),
though most London stocks dropped.

COMMENTARY: 1 DAVOS, 3 SEATTLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ Every year at the World Economic Forum
there is a star or theme that stands out. The star of Davos 2000
was, without question, Seattle. Seattle was talked about
everywhere. The only problem was that the business and government
leaders here were actually talking about three different Seattles _
the Seattle that is afraid of the future, the Seattle that is
demanding a slice of the future and the Seattle that is building
the future.
</P>
<P>
   All three were at play here, and it is important not to forget
that, because there are some activists and politicians who want you
to believe that there is only one Seattle that counts _ the Seattle
of protesters against trade and globalization and the World Trade
Organization, who trashed Seattle last November. Nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Seattle of the backlash against globalization is real.
This backlash was spearheaded, and financed, by the AFL-CIO, the
steelworkers and dockworkers, who oppose more free trade because it
means a churning of jobs. Alongside these unions in the streets of
Seattle were many serious environmentalists, who are legitimately
concerned about what more trade means for turtles and trees. But
the environmentalists and the unions _ and the stone-throwing
anarchists who joined them _ are not organic allies, with a shared
agenda. (God save any turtle that gets in the way of the
dockworkers unloading a boat. You wouldn't want to be that turtle.)
</P>
<P>
   The unions that drove this first Seattle want you to think that
they represent the world and the poor, and that they are all rising
against free trade. Oh, really? Africa is begging to increase its
textile exports to the United States, and the AFL-CIO is blocking
the African trade initiative. Why? Because Africa might increase
its share of total U.S. textile imports from its current level of
0.8 percent. The notion that this first Seattle represents all the
downtrodden is a pure fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the second Seattle. This was the Seattle of the
populous developing countries _ India, Mexico, China _ who know
that the reason they have all grown so fast lately is because of
trade and foreign investment. They came to Seattle not to wreck the
WTO but to get a better deal from it, and they resent the
protesters who want to keep them out by imposing impossible labor
and environmental standards. Mexico's president, Ernesto Zedillo,
denounced these ``globophobics _ a curious alliance of forces from
the extreme left, environmentalists and other self-appointed
critics in a common endeavor to save the people of developing
countries from development.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's economy minister, Youssef Boutros-Ghali, who was in
Seattle, said: ``The world was not represented on the streets of
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, most of the world's population was inside the
conference room in Seattle, not outside. It was developing
countries, like us, who want a fairer share of the pie, not to
destroy the pie. I can't grow unless I integrate with the global
economy, but the trade rules by the developed countries are unfair
... We open to you, but you don't open to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The third Seattle was the Seattle of Amazon.com, Microsoft and
the Internet revolution. This high-tech Seattle is creating an
enormous number of jobs, and has captured the imagination of youth
all over the world, but it has also terrified every CEO. Internet
commerce has been described as ``Darwinism on steroids.'' And John
Chambers, head of Cisco Systems, unnerved a packed hall in Davos of
business execs from Europe and the developing world by telling them
that survival in such a world required radical restructuring and
moving their companies online _ from customer service, to relations
with suppliers, to in-house education. If you haven't started yet,
said Chambers, it's probably too late. You're soon to be road kill.
His speech was delivered at Net speed, and so convincingly that the
moderator promised the wide-eyed audience to play back the tape of
his lecture at half speed.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, there are three Seattles _ those who want to slow
down the world so they can get off, those who want to slow down the
world so they can get on, and those who want to speed up the world
so they can stay ahead. Can they live together? Only if there is
real dialogue and hard tradeoffs, and only if there is a
recognition that the moral high ground isn't the monopoly of just
one Seattle.

   TRADITIONAL SPONSORS SCORE BIGGEST SUPER BOWL WINS
</P>
<P>
   The Ad Bowl, interrupted at various times by Super Bowl XXXIV on
Sunday, was emblematic of a new era for Madison Avenue. For
instance, there were more commercials aimed at women, the first
paid public service announcements and a larger presence for media
outlets. The most significant change was the proliferation of
dot-com spots, as 17 of the 36 marketers buying national commercial
time during the game came from the Internet world, including an ad
from Monster.com.
</P>
<P>
   Most preliminary opinion, buttressed by the results of polls,
agreed that commercials for Web sites and e-commerce marketers
fared less well than spots for traditional Super Bowl sponsors like
beers, soft drinks and credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS END JANUARY WITH A RALLY
</P>
<P>
   Stocks ended their first losing month since September with a
rally, as investors bought beaten-down telecommunications and
financial shares. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index advanced
34.30 points, or about 2.5 percent, to 1,394.46. The Dow Jones
industrial average gained 201.66, or nearly 1.9 percent, to
10,940.53. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 3,940.35, up 53.28
points.
</P>
<P>
   EX-OFFICIALS BACK MICROSOFT POSITION
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft gained some prominent allies in its antitrust fight,
as two former attorneys general and a pair of former senior White
House lawyers supported the software company's defense in a court
filing. They joined a friend-of-the-court brief submitted by the
Association for Competitive Technology, a trade group with close
ties to Microsoft that was founded in 1998 when the government
filed its antitrust suit against the company.
</P>
<P>
   RIVALS INCREASE OFFERS FOR NATWEST
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland raised their
bids for National Westminster Bank. The Edinburgh rivals are in a
heated bidding war for NatWest, a bank that is twice the size of
either Scottish suitor and that wants to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMER SPENDING GROWS AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending rose 0.8 percent in December. That helped lift
the increase for 1999 to a 10-year high of 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   UPS EARNINGS UP 37 PERCENT IN QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel Service said fourth-quarter earnings rose 37
percent, disappointing investors who had expected the provider of
package delivery service to get a bigger lift from holiday-season
shipments by online retailers. Shares of United Parcel fell $5, or
about 8 percent, to $59.9375. It was the lowest price since shares
were issued at $50 in an initial public offering on Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Profits at Union Carbide rose 40 percent in the fourth quarter
because of strong sales and improved prices in chemicals and
polymers. The results beat the 46 cents that analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett said fourth-quarter earnings increased 14 percent,
spurred by continued growth in advertising sales at its flagship
newspaper, USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   LAFARGE BID EXPECTED FOR BLUE CIRCLE
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Blue Circle Industries, a British cement company, rose
more than 20 percent on reports that building materials group
Lafarge of France was about to bid as much as $5.7 billion for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   SONY MUSIC IS SUED BY RETAILERS
</P>
<P>
   Sony Music Entertainment was sued by retailers who said the
company illegally steered customers to its online stores by
including hyperlinks on music compact discs. The National
Association of Recording Merchandisers filed suit in federal court
in Washington.

 &HT;    MLB's Selig suspends, fines Rocker
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Major League Baseball ended its six-week silence on
the John Rocker matter in a big way Monday, suspending the Braves
reliever for the first month of the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, whose racially inflammatory remarks in the December
issue of Sports Illustrated magazine sparked outrage throughout the
country, is suspended from opening day on April 3 until May 1, a
span of 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves pitcher also is forbidden from working out with the
major league club in any capacity until then, including this week's
``Camp Leo'' and the entire seven weeks of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker also was fined $20,000, with the understanding that the
money would go toward an organization that promotes diversity. And
he will be required to undergo diversity training, the nature of
which is yet to be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is the longest not related to drugs since Lenny
Randle of Texas was suspended 30 days in March of 1977 for punching
manager Frank Lucchesi.
</P>
<P>
   ''Major League Baseball takes seriously its role as an American
institution and the important social responsibility that goes with
it,'' Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement. ''Mr. Rocker
should understand that his remarks offended practically every
element of society and brought dishonor to himself, the Atlanta
Braves and Major League Baseball. The terrible example set by Mr.
Rocker is not what our great game is about and, in fact, is a
profound breach of the social compact we hold in such high
regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker indicated Monday he plans to file a grievance through the
Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe it is appropriate that I should be harshly
disciplined for my misguided speech unaccompanied by any conduct on
my part,'' Rocker said in a statement issued through his agents.
''I have previously apologized for my unfortunate remarks and stand
by my apology.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been in consultation with Mr. Rocker and it is our
present intention to appeal,'' said Gene Orza, the players union's
No. 2 official. ''It is literally unprecedented to impose a penalty
on a player for pure speech, offensive though the speech may be.
That, coupled with the magnitude of the penalty, just as
unprecedented, makes us optimistic about the outcome of the
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Braves president Stan Kasten nor general manager John
Schuerholz was willing to venture an opinion on the severity of the
punishment. But Schuerholz indicated the penalty was about what the
Braves expected.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Braves players, at least one fellow relief pitcher
was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a whole month? Holy cow,'' said Rudy Seanez. ``I figured
they might do one or the other _ suspend him or fine him. I don't
know what to say but I'm pretty shocked. That's real big.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten and Schuerholz indicated they were against a grievance, a
feeling they said was reiterated two weeks ago in a private meeting
they had with assistant general manager Frank Wren and seven
veteran Braves players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believed that if John was suspended or disciplined in
some fashion, they'd be willing to give him a second chance as a
teammate to rectify the wrong he had done,'' Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object should be to get John to a place where he's
accepted by his teammates and by his community,'' Kasten said.
``That's the war to win. And to win the battle by getting back a
few days early or what-not and have that viewed unfortunately as
something that would diminish the sincerity of his apology _ I
think that might be winning the battle but losing the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, what's most important is getting through successfully,
having people recognize the sincerity of his apology and put this
behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning April 3, Rocker will be allowed to work out either
with a Braves minor league team or in the Braves extended spring
training workouts. The Braves will renew Rocker's contract in March
and he will be paid during his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very difficult,'' Schuerholz said. ``The perception
has been we've been dragging our feet when we didn't have the power
to do anything about it. We're glad to have a decision. Now we can
go forward and plan for our needs in spring training.''

WITH FANFARE AND A TECHNICAL PROBLEM, AMTRAK BEGINS HIGH-SPEED
SERVICE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Maine, Wis., N.H., Conn., R.I., Colo., Va., Ill.,
Ga., France)   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amtrak unveiled new fully electrified train service
between Boston and New York Monday, but the day was marred by
technical problems that seemed symbolic of the difficulties the
company has faced in a $2.6 billion high-speed rail venture.
</P>
<P>
   The improved service was the first step in a project to
introduce 150-mile-an-hour trains that would reduce travel time to
Boston to three hours from five and cut about 15 minutes off travel
time to Washington. But Monday, as Amtrak officials boasted about
the superiority of the service, called Acela, mechanical problems
delayed the start of the first train.
</P>
<P>
   As a news conference concluded in Boston about 9:30 a.m.,
engineers rushed to fix the mechanical problems that caused a
20-minute delay. The minor setback, which company officials blamed
on an engine problem, did not seem to faze Amtrak officials.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, the chairman of Amtrak's board
of directors, said that the ``first step'' in building a national
high-speed railroad system ``has got to be the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What this really means,'' Thompson added, ``is that we will be
able to become really competitive with airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   The train, which left Boston at 9:51 a.m. and arrived at
Pennsylvania Station in New York at 3:30 p.m., was also delayed as
officials stopped for news conferences in Connecticut and Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   The service introduced Monday, Acela Regional, shortens the trip
to and from Boston to about four hours. It was made possible by
extending electricity along the entire corridor between the two
cities; previously, electrified service ended at New Haven, where
train crews switched to slower diesel locomotives.
</P>
<P>
   A faster service, Acela Express, which would reduce the trip to
just over three hours, has been delayed by problems with the
manufacture of high-speed trains. Both Monday's train and the
express train had been scheduled to begin service in September, but
Amtrak officials now say it is unclear when the contractor on the
project will be able to deliver the express train.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor, Alstom SA, a French manufacturing company, is
redesigning the express train's suspension after problems with wear
on the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   That train, which is being tested in Pueblo, Colo., was delayed
after the wheel problems made it difficult for the trains to make
curves.
</P>
<P>
   The delay has caused problems for Amtrak, which hopes to
generate $180 million a year in profits from the new train service.
Those profits are needed to help the railroad meet a cutoff in
operating subsidies at the end of the 2002 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak officials said that the delays would not cause budget
shortfalls because of a contingency plan and fines that could be
assessed against the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak officials hope the express service will help cut into the
airline business between Washington, Boston and New York. Amtrak
now carries only about 15 percent of the combined air-rail traffic
between Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, Amtrak replaced nearly a dozen bridges and
installed 115 miles of electrified rail between South Station in
Boston and New Haven. Much of this work was paid for by
Congressional appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's president, George D. Warrington, said he hoped to see
rail improvements and speedier trains, similar to the Acela,
traveling soon to transportation hubs like Richmond, Va., Chicago
and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Electrification of rail lines between New Haven and Boston was
originally proposed in 1912, but was never attempted by the private
railroads that ran passenger services at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s the idea was revived again, but stalled during
the Reagan administration, which opposed additional public
subsidies for Amtrak, officials explained.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1990s, a bipartisan coalition of business
leaders, academics and environmental advocates won reluctant
approval from the Bush administration, which helped secure funds
for the electrification that was completed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Electric trains cannot run all the way from Maine to Washington
yet, officials said, because of a small section of track missing
between two Boston stations.
</P>
<P>
   James P. RePass, the president and chief executive of the
National Corridors Initiative, a Providence-based organization that
has advocated for the improvements, said his group is lobbying for
a quick completion of that set of tracks to allow direct service
from New York City to New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts.

CIA INQUIRY OF ITS EX-DIRECTOR WAS HALTED AT TOP, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top CIA officials impeded an internal investigation
into evidence that the agency's former director, John Deutch,
mishandled large volumes of secret material, a classified report by
the agency's inspector general concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The report details a series of actions by the agency's former
executive director and general counsel that it says ``had the
effect of delaying a prompt and thorough investigation of this
matter.'' It asserts that George Tenet, the agency's current
director and Deutch's top deputy, should have done more to
``forcefully ensure'' that the case was properly investigated. But
the report also says that Tenet said he had given instructions that
the investigation go forward unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not accuse Tenet or his aides of violating any
laws in their handling of the incident. But at the inspector
general's recommendation, the CIA has set up a special panel to
examine whether Tenet and other top officials handled the case
appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Deutch began in December 1996, just as he
was leaving office. According to the inspector general's report,
CIA computer security specialists discovered he had placed large
volumes of classified material on personal computers in his home,
including information about some of the government's most sensitive
covert operations.
</P>
<P>
   This was a potential violation of both agency rules and federal
law, but the report says an inquiry by security officials was
effectively shelved after a few months. The CIA did not tell the
Justice Department about the case for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general did so in early 1998, after an agency
employee complained to the inspector general's office that the
inquiry had not been properly handled, according to officials
knowledgeable about the investigation. Tenet learned of the
possible security breach almost immediately but did not move to
reprimand Deutch until the inspector general had notified the
Justice Department of a possible violation and completed his report
on how the case had been handled inside the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the case, the Justice Department decided last
April not to prosecute Deutch, who lost his security clearances. He
issued a statement in August apologizing for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Running afoul of the government's elaborate rules for handling
paper and computer files can be a serious matter. Wen Ho Lee, the
former Los Alamos computer scientist who is being held without bail
awaiting trial, has been indicted for what prosecutors say is the
unauthorized downloading of massive amounts of nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report discloses that just three days
after Deutch learned that his computer practices were under review,
he deleted more than 1,000 classified files from his personal
computers. The report also says that Deutch declined to be
interviewed by the CIA's security officials.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general found that there was no evidence that the
classified material on Deutch's computers was obtained by another
country, although there was no way to be certain. In the case of
Lee, by contrast, the government has charged that he transferred
and copied nuclear secrets with the intent of aiding a foreign
country, although prosecutors say they have no evidence he
committed espionage.
</P>
<P>
   As the CIA case unfolded in late 1996 and early 1997, the report
says, it was closely watched by Tenet, Michael O'Neill, the
agency's general counsel at the time, and Nora Slatkin, its
executive director. Frustrated by limits the report says were
imposed on them, CIA security officers concluded that senior
officials were protecting Deutch and ``washed their hands'' of the
case. One security officer told the inspector general that the
``investigation had been one in name only.''
</P>
<P>
   The case raises anew a question that has plagued the agency for
the last two decades: Can the CIA police itself? Over the years,
Congress has prodded the agency to appoint forceful inspector
generals and included the director of central intelligence among
the handful of top officials subject to investigation by an
independent counsel. Lawmakers made it clear that agency officials
who blocked or misled internal investigators should be harshly
dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report on the Deutch case suggests that
these safeguards depend on how the agency's leadership interprets
the rules. Tenet and other senior CIA officials did not immediately
report Deutch's possible security lapses to the White House or
congressional oversight committees. Their delay in telling the
Justice Department about the case allowed a one-year time limit on
appointing an independent counsel to lapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Application of the independent counsel statute was not
adequately considered'' by CIA officials handling the case, the
report says. ``Given their failure to report to the Department of
Justice on a timely basis, this in effect avoided the potential
application of the independent counsel statute.'' The statute
expired in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials said there was never any effort by anyone to
constrain the inquiry and that the report, by Inspector General
Britt Snider, was overly harsh in its interpretation of ambiguous
events and remarks. In addition, they said, the security officials
interviewed by the inspector general's office portrayed themselves
as more assertive than they were in their investigation of Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The report specifically cites O'Neill and Ms. Slatkin for
impeding the inquiry. It also criticizes Snider's predecessor as
inspector general, Frederick Hitz, for failing to ``ensure the
timely and definitive resolution'' of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few details about the Deutch case and the inspector
general's classified report, which was completed in July, have
previously been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch emphasized that he never tried to block the CIA's
investigation. ``I have cooperated fully with the inspector
general's inquiry, and at no time did I do anything intended to
impede or interfere in any way with any investigation into this
matter,'' Deutch said through his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said in an interview that he believed he had acted
properly. ``I did not try to delay the investigation of Deutch,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a difficult circumstance,'' Ms. Slatkin said in a
statement. ``Our goal was to have a fair and thorough review and I
think we did precisely that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitz defended his actions as proper and said that in early 1998
he had notified the Intelligence Oversight Board, a White House
panel, about the Deutch case and was preparing to notify the
Justice Department but left the matter to his successor after he
left the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch joined the Clinton administration in 1993 as under
secretary of defense for acquisitions and technology. In 1994, he
was named deputy secretary of defense, the No. 2 post at the
Pentagon. In May 1995, Deutch was confirmed as director of central
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   When Deutch moved to the CIA, he named as deputy director Tenet,
then serving at the White House as director of intelligence policy
for the National Security Council. He also named Ms. Slatkin, then
assistant secretary of the Navy, to be the CIA's executive
director, the third-ranking position at the agency. O'Neill, a
former Democratic congressional staff member, was named Deutch's
chief of staff in 1995. In 1996 he became the CIA's general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   After taking over at the CIA, Deutch decided not to have a
classified computer installed in his suburban Maryland home, and
also declined to have CIA security officers assigned there. One job
of officers assigned to the home of a director is the securing of
classified material the director has brought from work, the
inspector general's report states.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Deutch used unclassified Macintosh
computers for classified work throughout his tenure as director. He
chose not to conduct sensitive work on the classified computer
system at the CIA because he said he was afraid that other CIA
officials would see what he was writing, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch placed the most sensitive documents that he worked on
while he was director on the unclassified computers in his home,
the report found. Among the 17,000 pages of documents discovered in
files on the computers were top-secret and ``code-word'' files
about a wide range of CIA activities, including presidentially
approved covert action programs. The documents also included 26
volumes detailing his daily activities in his nearly two years as
director and his previous time at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   After losing out on his bid to become secretary of defense in
President Clinton's second term, Deutch announced in early December
1996 his intention to resign as director of central intelligence
and return to academic life at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where he now teaches chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of announcing he was leaving, Deutch talked with a
top computer services official at the CIA and told him that he
wanted to keep the C.I.A.-owned Macintosh computers in his home
after he left the government. Deutch explained that he wanted them
because he was using them for his personal banking.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Deutch was told by the computer official that he
could keep the computers if he continued to work for the CIA as a
consultant or contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch then quickly arranged through O'Neill to obtain a no-fee
consulting contract with the CIA The terms called for him to retain
three CIA computers. The inspector general's report indicates that
the purpose of the contract was to allow Deutch to keep his
computers.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, a CIA computer security official went to Deutch's
home and found a large number of classified documents stored on his
computers. He also found that Deutch had been accessing the
Internet with the same computers, through unsecured services. He
had Internet access through America Online, Citibank's personal
banking Web site and a Defense Department service. The security
official told his superiors what he had found.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, O'Neill and Ms. Slatkin were informed that
classified material had been found on the computers. Tenet was soon
told about the discovery by Ms. Slatkin.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 20, 1996, Deutch began to delete files from his
computers, including more than 1,000 that had been stored on one
portable memory card. That day, Deutch called a CIA computer
specialist to ask for help because he was having trouble deleting
the files, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials from a CIA special security unit were
trying to open an investigation to determine whether Deutch had
violated CIA rules and U.S. laws by mishandling classified
information. By January 1997, the security officials were looking
for the most critical evidence, particularly four portable computer
cards that contained files from Deutch's computers. They were
informed that O'Neill had the material in his office safe.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill rebuffed requests to turn the four cards over to the
security staff, according to the report. In an interview, O'Neill
declined to comment on the handling of the cards.
</P>
<P>
   A security official complained to Ms. Slatkin that O'Neill ``was
dragging his feet,'' and that his refusal to turn the cards over
``made it look like a cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, O'Neill said, he, Tenet and Ms. Slatkin held a
series of discussions ``over a period of several weeks'' about the
need to protect the privacy of the material found on the computers.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch refused to be interviewed by the security staff, and
senior CIA officials allowed him to avoid being questioned,
according to the report. Eventually, Ms. Slatkin, O'Neill and
Deutch agreed to allow one security officer to review all the
computer files gathered from Deutch's home. The four portable
computer cards were finally turned over, but only after they had
been held by O'Neill for about three weeks, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   Without an interview of Deutch, the CIA's security unit ``washed
its hands'' of the investigation, according to one security
official interviewed by the inspector general's office. The
security unit did finally write a report on the Deutch case, in the
summer of 1997, but the report sat in the security office without
further action.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a CIA security official asked O'Neill in 1997 why no
referral had been made to the Justice Department about a possible
crime. ``We do it with everyone else,'' the security officer said.
O'Neill said that he was waiting for the security office to
complete its report before notifying the Justice Department, but
did not receive it before leaving the CIA himself in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet did not take action against Deutch before the inspector
general's investigation began because he was not aware that the
security office had completed its own inquiry. In the fall of 1997,
in fact, the security office recommended to Tenet that Deutch be
granted security clearances to serve on an outside commission on
weapons proliferation.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ With his entire candidacy hinging on victory in
New Hampshire's primary on Tuesday, Sen. John McCain was running
his insurgency by cellphone on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As his campaign bus crawled through a snow storm just after
dawn, McCain talked and talked, dialing up radio show after radio
show to promote his candidacy and matching the radio jocks for
irreverence.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator told a radio station in Boston of his theory
of the rise and fall of Western civilization: ``Ever since we've
seen the invention of the talk show we've been on a steady
decline.''
</P>
<P>
   On the air with ``Morning Attitude'' on WSMN in Nashua, he said,
``It's amazing, Arnie. They say we've upset the establishment. I've
been told they're in a state of panic.''
</P>
<P>
   On yet another call he proclaimed the actor Leonardo DiCaprio
``an androgynous wimp,'' then laughed, ``there goes the 13-year-old
vote.'' As he carried on, his four youngest children, just in from
Arizona, slept in the back of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his joking, this is John McCain's moment of truth.
His better financed opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has the
money and organization to weather a loss in the nation's first
primary and is preparing back-up plans. Steve Forbes has his
personal fortune to keep him going.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is gambling his entire candidacy on the hope that the
contrarian, maverick-loving state of New Hampshire will give him a
victory that will bring another wave of media attention and propel
him like a rocket into South Carolina, which holds it primary on
Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to win,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina,
who was at McCain's side Monday. ``The bigger the better.''
</P>
<P>
   It was more than 18 months ago that McCain's friend, former Sen.
Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, told him that he had the right,
plain-speaking rebel personality to win his home state, ``if you
work like no one ever had before.'' So McCain decided to skip the
Iowa caucuses and put his time and money into New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   He did everything but move in for good. His campaign bus _ with
Straight Talk Express emblazoned across its side _ became a fixture
of New Hampshire's back roads and highways. And on Sunday he held
his 114th New Hampshire town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The screaming, clapping crowds of a 1,000 or more who turned out
this weekend could not be more of a contrast to the early days when
the senator would walk into a restaurant and disturb the breakfast
of the seven people who were eating there. He was, McCain says ``at
3 percent in a poll with a 5 percent margin of error.''
</P>
<P>
   Now on the eve of the primary, most polls show him leading Bush
by a slim margin. But in recent days the Bush campaign has made an
all-out effort to stop McCain right here. Over the weekend, Bush's
parents and most of his siblings appeared for a rally here, and the
campaign has 4,000 volunteers making phone calls and canvassing
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCain's blueprint, a victory in New Hampshire will
produce a domino effect: a victory in South Carolina followed by
one in his home state of Arizona. Then, he hopes, there will be a
victory in Michigan, and Bush will suddenly seem a lot more
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and another South Carolina politician, Rep. Mark Sanford,
showed up Monday to fly with McCain to a pre-dawn rally in South
Carolina sometime on Wednesday and begin a drive there to thwart
Bush. South Carolina polls show Bush with a substantial lead.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also needs money if he is to make it to the Super Tuesday
primaries in March when the presidential campaign is run
simultaneously coast to coast. To capitalize fast on an upset in
New Hampshire, his finance team began arriving in the state on
Monday night to begin a nation-wide call-a-thon for cash starting
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has a string of fund-raisers planned in Los Angeles on
Friday, San Francisco on Saturday, and Washington D.C., New York
and New Jersey next week. The campaign is planning to try a
fund-raiser on the Internet, $100 per person for audio and video
access to the site.
</P>
<P>
   As it snowed and drizzled Monday, the senator raced across New
Hampshire one last time, from Keene in the west, to Dartmouth
College in the north, to the state capital of Concord, to
Portsmouth on the coast and finally to Bedford in the heavily
populated southern tier.
</P>
<P>
   On his bus, where he long ago gave up any kind of privacy in
order to pile in reporters he hopes will amplify his every word,
his wife Cindy brushed his white hair and doused it with hair spray
against the weather. (His broken bones from his days as a prisoner
of war leave him unable to lift his arms above shoulder level.)
</P>
<P>
   At rally after rally he thundered, ``It was said there was no
room in the Republican party for reform. My friends, we've made
room in the Republican party for a candidate for reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we win tomorrow night,'' he said from a snow covered
gazebo in Keene, ``the message is going to be sent from New
Hampshire to America and the world that we are going to give the
government back to the people of the United States, take it out of
the hands of the special interests and the big money and give it
back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   At times McCain's risky campaign style of constant access his
led to gaffes. Just last week he drowned out his theme of using the
growing federal surplus for Social Security and debt reduction,
with some musings that left the depth of his anti-abortion
commitment somewhat in question.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not made him more cautious. At one point Monday
morning, he confided to reporters the secret of his get-out-the
vote effort.``Death threats,'' the Arizona senator said with a
chortle. ``If you don't go out and vote for McCain, don't start
your car for the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly he pressed his message of campaign reform. Outside
the Alpha Delta fraternity house at Dartmouth _ the one that
inspired the movie ``Animal House'' _ he even retooled it slightly
for the college crowd. ``We're going to take those big money and
fat cats and establishment people and knock them on their'' _ he
paused _ ``ear.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowds were small because of the snow, and on the bus McCain
made cracks about the staff who had planned outdoor events.
``That's what happens when you get the people who run your campaign
from work release programs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, the senator was shadowed by
volunteers for Bill Bradley who are trying to attract independents,
who can vote in either primary, to their candidate and away from
McCain. Outside the Capitol, McCain stopped and shook hands with a
group of them. ``He wished us luck and said he hoped Bradley
wins,'' said Anna Benvenutti, 21.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he considered the idea that he and Bradley are
competing for independents to be overblown and his closing rhetoric
was designed to nail down his Republican support. All day long he
hammered away at Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   For one quiet moment, he reflected on the weirdness of the
months spent in the cocoon of his bus. ``It reminds one of the
`Twilight Zone,''' he said. ``You're just on the bus.''

CURRY ISN'T GOOD SPICE FOR CSUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Remember when you were a kid and you held your
breath when you didn't get what you wanted?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Cal State Northridge women's basketball standout
Edniesha Curry is doing. Curry remains AWOL from the Matadors after
walking out on the team last Monday over a dispute with coach
Frozena Jerro.
</P>
<P>
   When Curry left, she took teammate Jamilah Jones along,
extracting from CSUN (12-6, 6-2) two starters including its top
scorer and playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Both players are not only letting down their teammates, who have
worked hard to make this a special season, but themselves as well.
Someday, Curry and Jones maybe will realize this. It is hoped they
will do so in time to restore their tarnished images and salvage
the Matadors' season.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, a 5-foot-6 junior guard from Palmdale High, is averaging
15.3 points and 6.7 assists. She is also the school's leader in
scoring average and 3-point field goals attempted and made. Jones,
a 5-6 guard, is one of the Matadors' top defensive players.
</P>
<P>
   The longer Curry is absent, the more she resembles the kid with
the puffed-out cheeks who threatens to hold her breath until she
gets her way.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates indicate Curry's quarrel with Jerro stems from an
ongoing problem Curry has with certain members of the coaching
staff. The situation came to a head Jan. 23, when Curry argued with
assistant Karen Howell during practice. Jerro sided with Howell,
and Curry sulked out of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Curry quit a day later. Jones, her roommate, soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   They, along with Jerro, have left the door open to return. In
fact, they're probably waiting for Jerro to show up at their front
door with a bouquet of roses, get on her knees and beg them to come
back.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Curry: You can let your breath out now because it's not
going to happen. The best you can hope for is Jerro to call you
this week, which on Monday she indicated she might do to bring
closure.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that Jerro, the Matadors 29-year-old second-year
coach, won't budge any further. And she shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for Curry to understand this and before it's too late
for her or the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   Many predicted CSUN would win the Big Sky Conference, and the
Matadors seemed on their way until Curry and Jones left. They're
1-1 without them, beating Sacramento St. 76-52, then losing 61-59
Wednesday to Weber St, a setback that dropped them into second
place.
</P>
<P>
   Curry's abrupt exit threatens to tear the team apart. Players
might choose sides, some aligning with Curry, others standing with
Jerro. Curry might not have considered this when she turned her
back on the Matadors, but it was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each side thinks the other side is wrong,'' CSUN's Neda Milic
said. ``I don't like the way it is. I want (Curry and Jones) back.
I am hoping they come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerro does, too, but on her terms.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that Curry overplayed her hand, which often happens
when star players think the program will crumble in their absence.
Certainly, the Matadors are worse off without Curry, but they'll
move on.
</P>
<P>
   As for Curry, the hope here is that she realizes her mistake and
apologizes to Jerro, the coaching staff and her teammates and
returns to the team.

KATHLEEN-MARSHALL-DANCE -- Kathleen Marshall at a rehearsal of
``Saturday Night,'' a musical that is receiving its New York debut
46 years after Stephen Sondheim completed it. In a strange way,

Eggers's new book, ``A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,''

``memoir-y kind of thing'' that tells the sad, awful, tragic story
of how the author's mother and father died within weeks of each

CIA INQUIRY OF ITS EX-DIRECTOR WAS HALTED AT TOP, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  (sw) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top CIA officials impeded an internal investigation
into evidence that the agency's former director, John Deutch,
mishandled large volumes of secret material, a classified report by
the agency's inspector general concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The report details a series of actions by the agency's former
executive director and general counsel that it says ``had the
effect of delaying a prompt and thorough investigation of this
matter.'' It asserts that George Tenet, the agency's current
director and Deutch's top deputy, should have done more to
``forcefully ensure'' that the case was properly investigated. But
the report also says that Tenet said he had given instructions that
the investigation go forward unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not accuse Tenet or his aides of violating any
laws in their handling of the incident. But at the inspector
general's recommendation, the CIA has set up a special panel to
examine whether Tenet and other top officials handled the case
appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Deutch began in December 1996, just as he
was leaving office. According to the inspector general's report,
CIA computer security specialists discovered he had placed large
volumes of classified material on personal computers in his home,
including information about some of the government's most sensitive
covert operations.
</P>
<P>
   This was a potential violation of both agency rules and federal
law, but the report says an inquiry by security officials was
effectively shelved after a few months. The CIA did not tell the
Justice Department about the case for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general did so in early 1998, after an agency
employee complained to the inspector general's office that the
inquiry had not been properly handled, according to officials
knowledgeable about the investigation. Tenet learned of the
possible security breach almost immediately but did not move to
reprimand Deutch until the inspector general had notified the
Justice Department of a possible violation and completed his report
on how the case had been handled inside the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the case, the Justice Department decided last
April not to prosecute Deutch, who lost his security clearances. He
issued a statement in August apologizing for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Running afoul of the government's elaborate rules for handling
paper and computer files can be a serious matter. Wen Ho Lee, the
former Los Alamos computer scientist who is being held without bail
awaiting trial, has been indicted for what prosecutors say is the
unauthorized downloading of massive amounts of nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report discloses that just three days
after Deutch learned that his computer practices were under review,
he deleted more than 1,000 classified files from his personal
computers. The report also says that Deutch declined to be
interviewed by the CIA's security officials.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general found that there was no evidence that the
classified material on Deutch's computers was obtained by another
country, although there was no way to be certain. In the case of
Lee, by contrast, the government has charged that he transferred
and copied nuclear secrets with the intent of aiding a foreign
country, although prosecutors say they have no evidence he
committed espionage.
</P>
<P>
   As the CIA case unfolded in late 1996 and early 1997, the report
says, it was closely watched by Tenet, Michael O'Neill, the
agency's general counsel at the time, and Nora Slatkin, its
executive director. Frustrated by limits the report says were
imposed on them, CIA security officers concluded that senior
officials were protecting Deutch and ``washed their hands'' of the
case. One security officer told the inspector general that the
``investigation had been one in name only.''
</P>
<P>
   The case raises anew a question that has plagued the agency for
the last two decades: Can the CIA police itself? Over the years,
Congress has prodded the agency to appoint forceful inspector
generals and included the director of central intelligence among
the handful of top officials subject to investigation by an
independent counsel. Lawmakers made it clear that agency officials
who blocked or misled internal investigators should be harshly
dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report on the Deutch case suggests that
these safeguards depend on how the agency's leadership interprets
the rules. Tenet and other senior CIA officials did not immediately
report Deutch's possible security lapses to the White House or
congressional oversight committees. Their delay in telling the
Justice Department about the case allowed a one-year time limit on
appointing an independent counsel to lapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Application of the independent counsel statute was not
adequately considered'' by CIA officials handling the case, the
report says. ``Given their failure to report to the Department of
Justice on a timely basis, this in effect avoided the potential
application of the independent counsel statute.'' The statute
expired in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials said there was never any effort by anyone to
constrain the inquiry and that the report, by Inspector General
Britt Snider, was overly harsh in its interpretation of ambiguous
events and remarks. In addition, they said, the security officials
interviewed by the inspector general's office portrayed themselves
as more assertive than they were in their investigation of Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The report specifically cites O'Neill and Ms. Slatkin for
impeding the inquiry. It also criticizes Snider's predecessor as
inspector general, Frederick Hitz, for failing to ``ensure the
timely and definitive resolution'' of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few details about the Deutch case and the inspector
general's classified report, which was completed in July, have
previously been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch emphasized that he never tried to block the CIA's
investigation. ``I have cooperated fully with the inspector
general's inquiry, and at no time did I do anything intended to
impede or interfere in any way with any investigation into this
matter,'' Deutch said through his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said in an interview that he believed he had acted
properly. ``I did not try to delay the investigation of Deutch,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a difficult circumstance,'' Ms. Slatkin said in a
statement. ``Our goal was to have a fair and thorough review and I
think we did precisely that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitz defended his actions as proper and said that in early 1998
he had notified the Intelligence Oversight Board, a White House
panel, about the Deutch case and was preparing to notify the
Justice Department but left the matter to his successor after he
left the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch joined the Clinton administration in 1993 as under
secretary of defense for acquisitions and technology. In 1994, he
was named deputy secretary of defense, the No. 2 post at the
Pentagon. In May 1995, Deutch was confirmed as director of central
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   When Deutch moved to the CIA, he named as deputy director Tenet,
then serving at the White House as director of intelligence policy
for the National Security Council. He also named Ms. Slatkin, then
assistant secretary of the Navy, to be the CIA's executive
director, the third-ranking position at the agency. O'Neill, a
former Democratic congressional staff member, was named Deutch's
chief of staff in 1995. In 1996 he became the CIA's general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   After taking over at the CIA, Deutch decided not to have a
classified computer installed in his suburban Maryland home, and
also declined to have CIA security officers assigned there. One job
of officers assigned to the home of a director is the securing of
classified material the director has brought from work, the
inspector general's report states.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Deutch used unclassified Macintosh
computers for classified work throughout his tenure as director. He
chose not to conduct sensitive work on the classified computer
system at the CIA because he said he was afraid that other CIA
officials would see what he was writing, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch placed the most sensitive documents that he worked on
while he was director on the unclassified computers in his home,
the report found. Among the 17,000 pages of documents discovered in
files on the computers were top-secret and ``code-word'' files
about a wide range of CIA activities, including presidentially
approved covert action programs. The documents also included 26
volumes detailing his daily activities in his nearly two years as
director and his previous time at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   After losing out on his bid to become secretary of defense in
President Clinton's second term, Deutch announced in early December
1996 his intention to resign as director of central intelligence
and return to academic life at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where he now teaches chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of announcing he was leaving, Deutch talked with a
top computer services official at the CIA and told him that he
wanted to keep the CIA-owned Macintosh computers in his home after
he left the government. Deutch explained that he wanted them
because he was using them for his personal banking.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Deutch was told by the computer official that he
could keep the computers if he continued to work for the CIA as a
consultant or contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch then quickly arranged through O'Neill to obtain a no-fee
consulting contract with the CIA The terms called for him to retain
three CIA computers. The inspector general's report indicates that
the purpose of the contract was to allow Deutch to keep his
computers.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, a CIA computer security official went to Deutch's
home and found a large number of classified documents stored on his
computers. He also found that Deutch had been accessing the
Internet with the same computers, through unsecured services. He
had Internet access through America Online, Citibank's personal
banking Web site and a Defense Department service. The security
official told his superiors what he had found.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, O'Neill and Ms. Slatkin were informed that
classified material had been found on the computers. Tenet was soon
told about the discovery by Ms. Slatkin.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 20, 1996, Deutch began to delete files from his
computers, including more than 1,000 that had been stored on one
portable memory card. That day, Deutch called a CIA computer
specialist to ask for help because he was having trouble deleting
the files, according to the report.

 WASHINGTON: the report.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials from a CIA special security unit were
trying to open an investigation to determine whether Deutch had
violated CIA rules and U.S. laws by mishandling classified
information. By January 1997, the security officials were looking
for the most critical evidence, particularly four portable computer
cards that contained files from Deutch's computers. They were
informed that O'Neill had the material in his office safe.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill rebuffed requests to turn the four cards over to the
security staff, according to the report. In an interview, O'Neill
declined to comment on the handling of the cards.
</P>
<P>
   A security official complained to Ms. Slatkin that O'Neill ``was
dragging his feet,'' and that his refusal to turn the cards over
``made it look like a cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, O'Neill said, he, Tenet and Ms. Slatkin held a
series of discussions ``over a period of several weeks'' about the
need to protect the privacy of the material found on the computers.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch refused to be interviewed by the security staff, and
senior CIA officials allowed him to avoid being questioned,
according to the report. Eventually, Ms. Slatkin, O'Neill and
Deutch agreed to allow one security officer to review all the
computer files gathered from Deutch's home. The four portable
computer cards were finally turned over, but only after they had
been held by O'Neill for about three weeks, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   Without an interview of Deutch, the CIA's security unit ``washed
its hands'' of the investigation, according to one security
official interviewed by the inspector general's office. The
security unit did finally write a report on the Deutch case, in the
summer of 1997, but the report sat in the security office without
further action.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a CIA security official asked O'Neill in 1997 why no
referral had been made to the Justice Department about a possible
crime. ``We do it with everyone else,'' the security officer said.
O'Neill said that he was waiting for the security office to
complete its report before notifying the Justice Department, but
did not receive it before leaving the CIA himself in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet did not take action against Deutch before the inspector
general's investigation began because he was not aware that the
security office had completed its own inquiry. In the fall of 1997,
in fact, the security office recommended to Tenet that Deutch be
granted security clearances to serve on an outside commission on
weapons proliferation.

MERRILL LYNCH TO COMPETE WITH BANKS FOR CUSTOMER DEPOSITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For more than a year now, Wall Street analysts have
been wondering whether Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the nation's biggest
brokerage firm, would buy a commercial bank or be bought by one.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the response from Merrill: Why not just be a bank?
</P>
<P>
   The firm is preparing to make its biggest push to compete with
banks for customers' deposits. Merrill is taking advantage of
recent changes in national banking laws to roll out new banking
services, including a federally insured, interest-bearing account
tied to its customers' investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill brokerage executives also are developing the first new
version of the firm's Cash Management Account, which broke new
ground 25 years ago by combining interest-bearing checking with a
standard brokerage account that held stocks and bonds. The new
version, known internally at Merrill as CMA 2.0, would allow
customers who are queasy about mixing investments and savings to
choose how to segregate various assets within the account.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the vast majority of our clients have a fairly
significant amount of money at banking institutions,'' said John L.
Steffens, a vice chairman who runs Merrill's brokerage operation.
``I think we're offering a better deal than banks.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Merrill cash management account, all the cash that is not
invested in securities is regularly swept into a money-market fund
that pays dividends; for taxable funds, the current yield is 5.43
percent. But that cash, which amounts to about $118 billion, is not
guaranteed by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., as most bank
deposits are.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in June, Merrill plans to automatically switch the
cash that is being swept into taxable money market funds over to
insured accounts at two banks Merrill owns. Because Merrill owns
two banks, it will offer federal insurance on up to $200,000 per
account, twice the per-account limit for deposit insurance. The
firm's banks, in turn, will use the cash deposits to finance their
lending and investing activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the brokerage firms couldn't have previously was insured
deposits,'' said Joan Solotar, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. ``Now, with the financial services reform legislation,
there is no banking product that the brokerage firms can't offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill would not be the first financial services firm to offer
insured deposits. American Express Co. has such an account through
its online bank.
</P>
<P>
   After Congress repealed the Depression-era regulations known as
the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 last fall, some analysts predicted a
wave of mergers among banks, brokerage firms and insurance
companies. Ms. Solotar said at the time that she thought the
changes were ``less of a mergers-and-acquisitions event than an
opportunity for the brokers to get into other businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Solotar said the new products provided Merrill with ``a huge
opportunity'' to draw customers away from commercial banks, which
pay significantly lower rates on deposits than Merrill is
considering. She said she expected similar offerings from other
brokerage firms, like Charles Schwab, which has said it will buy
the private-banking company U.S. Trust Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will show that it is not a zero-sum game in retail
brokerage,'' Ms. Solotar said. ``It's not just Merrill Lynch versus
Schwab. It's Merrill and Schwab versus the consumer banks, which
currently don't seem well prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Moszkowski, an analyst with the Salomon Smith Barney unit of
Citigroup, estimates that no more than 30 percent of all investment
assets in the United States are held in accounts at brokerage
firms. Still, he said, that is double the market share the
brokerage firms had a decade ago and most of the gain has come at
the expense of banks and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of last year, after Merrill introduced an
all-in-one brokerage account that provided unlimited stock trades
for a preset annual fee, Merrill and Schwab showed that they could
simultaneously rake in new assets at a fast pace. Investors had
worried that Merrill's profit margins would shrink because it was
charging too little, less than 1 percent of assets in many cases,
for the new account, known as Unlimited Advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The potential gains to Merrill from introducing the new banking
products could go ``a long way toward offsetting a lot of the
erosion that some people have been concerned about in the
profitability of their retail commission business,'' Moszkowski
said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill is not making any projections about the impact the
banking products could have on its earnings but analysts think it
could be significant. Moszkowski said a conservative,
back-of-the-envelope estimate was an increase of 50 cents a share
in Merrill's annual earnings after the transition to the insured
accounts is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be able to offer a product that is more
profitable for them, and more attractive to the customer, than the
money market is,'' Moszkowski said. ``If Merrill wants to do this
bank lending and they can't fund it this way, they have to go out
into the market and buy that money and they'll buy that money at
higher prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill can afford to offer higher rates than banks offer
because it does not have to factor in the costs of operating its
network of branches, as banks do, Moszkowski said. Merrill's
730-branch system already is profitable, from selling stocks, bonds
and mutual funds, so the firm can treat the bank products as
virtually costless and consider them profitable even though there
will be a relatively slim gap between what it charges for loans and
what it pays for deposits.
</P>
<P>
   At commercial banks, that gap, or spread, runs as high as 5
percentage points. In recent years, a new breed of electronic
banks, unburdened by the costs of branches and tellers, has risen
to challenge established banks by offering cheaper loans and higher
yields on certificates of deposit.

BRITISH COURT UPHOLDS DECISION TO RELEASE PINOCHET
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: ADDS new 9th graf, Belgium and ..., with background on why
Belgium is involved in the case; corrects first name of judge in
14th graf) 
 (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A High Court judge issued a tough-worded judgment
Monday supporting the British government's decision to release Gen.
Augusto Pinochet and let him return home to Chile, but Belgium held
up any final action by lodging an appeal against the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw had said on Jan. 11 that he was
inclined to set the 84-year-old former Chilean dictator free
immediately because of his deteriorating health but would await the
outcome of any legal objections before issuing a definitive order.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's ruling, Judge Maurice Kay turned down appeals from
six human rights groups and the Belgian government contesting the
British government's finding that Pinochet is medically unfit to be
extradited to Spain to stand trial on torture charges.
</P>
<P>
   But the hopes of Pinochet supporters that Kay's verdict
constituted the end of legal moves in the 15-month-old case were
dashed by Belgium, which filed its appeal Monday afternoon. It will
be heard by a panel of three High Court judges on Monday and
Tuesday of next week. Amnesty International and the five other
rights groups have until noon Tuesday to file any appeals of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Office withheld all comment on Monday's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Kay was emphatic in rejecting the arguments presented in two
days of hearings last week, saying they were ``inappropriate'' and
``utterly without merit.'' The groups had jointly protested Straw's
refusal to make public records of a medical examination of Pinochet
conducted by four British doctors that was the basis for the
findings on the general's infirm physical state.
</P>
<P>
   Kay found that Straw acted ``lawfully, fairly and rationally''
in not disclosing the medical documents. Straw had argued that to
do so would violate a pledge of doctor-patient confidentiality made
to the general before the Jan. 5 examination. ``In legal, if
somewhat peremptory terms,'' the judge said of the complainants'
request, ``it is none of their business.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge added that he was ``conscious that my decision is
unavoidably adverse to, on the one hand, people who have suffered
greatly in Chile's recent history, and, in the case of Belgium, to
a friendly state and its judicial authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgium, France and Switzerland had joined Spain in seeking
Pinochet's extradition on behalf of residents who said they
suffered under the general's military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's pursuers denounced Monday's ruling but did so in a
way that suggested they realized chances of judicial relief might
now be slim. Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch,
said: ``We are dismayed by Monday's decision, which is a setback
for Pinochet's thousands of victims in their quest for justice. It
is a shame that the attempt to prosecute General Pinochet for the
worst international crimes may be halted on the basis of secret
medical evidence examined behind closed doors.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its conclusion, the case has already resulted in a
fundamental change in concepts of international law to allow the
prosecution of dictators and leaders of repressive regimes by
courts in countries where the alleged abuses did not occur.
</P>
<P>
   This came about when Britain's highest court, the Law Lords of
the House of Lords, turned aside the general's claim that, under
the principle of sovereign immunity, he could not be tried for acts
committed while he was Chile's head of state, from 1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has been under house arrest in England for more than 15
months while complicated legal moves unfolded around a Spanish
judge's request that he be extradited to Madrid to stand trial on
charges of genocide, torture, kidnapping and murder in connection
with the disappearance of more than 3,000 people in the years after
he seized power in the 1973 coup that ousted President Salvador
Allende.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Baltasar Garzon, considered something of a maverick
in the Spanish judiciary, had gathered his evidence during an
investigation into the so-called dirty wars in Latin America in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 16, 1998, the general was arrested as he lay in a London
clinic recuperating from back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days later, Pinochet won his first legal battle in a
ruling by the High Court that upheld his claim to sovereign
immunity. But in the judgment that was to create the case's legacy,
on Nov. 25, 1998, the Law Lords overturned that decision, saying
that being head of state did not excuse crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The case returned to the House of Lords after one of the
original judges was found to have had an association with Amnesty
International, a party to the case. But the second Lords' decision,
on March 24, 1999, was even more assertive on the principle than
the first one, though it drastically reduced the number of charges
and narrowed their scope to torture and conspiracy to torture.
</P>
<P>
   The case then moved on to the validity of the actual extradition
order itself, which was upheld by a London magistrate last October
and is under an appeal from Pinochet's lawyers that is likely to
become moot because of Straw's expected intervention.
</P>
<P>
   In Pinochet's one court appearance, on Dec. 11, 1998, he
maintained the defiant attitude he has adopted from the beginning,
saying that he did not recognize the jurisdiction of any court
outside Chile to try him and that he was innocent of ``all the lies
of Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since Pinochet's arrest, there have been boisterous gatherings
outside the House of Lords and the downtown magistrate's court,
with supporters and opponents behind barricades angrily facing one
another down, hurling taunts and jeers and holding aloft flags and
placards with accusatory slogans and pictures of missing friends
and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For the past 14 months, the general has been living under house
arrest with his wife, Lucia, in a rented mansion in one of London's
exclusive southern suburbs. He has had periodic visits from Chilean
supporters and from backers in Britain, the most outspoken of whom
has been former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. She has argued
that, far from holding him in custody, Britain instead owes him its
gratitude for the support he provided during the 1982 Falkland
Islands war with Argentina.

   A couple of Phoenix cops stopped a guy for not having a headlamp
on his bicycle and wound up shooting him three times in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Are you kiddin' me?
</P>
<P>
   From a vantage point high above the towers of St. Mary's
Basilica and only slightly below the roof of Bank One Ballpark, it
was a slam-dunk case of po lice brutality, of officers glee fully
using the traffic code to abuse unsuspecting citizens.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious, unequivocal, easy to write.
</P>
<P>
   If only I hadn't gotten the idi otic notion to take the elevator
to the ground floor, get in my car and drive to 22nd Avenue and
Monroe, where the incident happened.
</P>
<P>
   From the high-rise buildings of downtown, it's a short drive
west on Van Buren to 19th Ave nue, then south, then west on Monroe
over the railroad tracks and into the city's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called the St. Matthew's neighborhood,'' said Phoenix po

like Alcatraz.''
</P>
<P>
   Stately old porches are cov ered in iron bars, like jail cells,
as are windows and doors. In recent years, a considerable part of

declaring the neighborhood a ``high-intensity'' patrol area.

<P>
   `'The officer's (who fought with the bicyclist) were on
high-intensity,'' Halstead said. ``Their job is to make contacts
and hopefully impact and improve the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Within these few square blocks, even a ridiculously mi nor
violation of the traffic code will get you stopped.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, police say the suspect, Mark William Meador, had
an outstanding warrant for failing to appear in a drug case. They
say he knocked down one officer and was trying to pull the
officer's weapon from him when the other officer fired.
</P>
<P>
   They say the second officer tried other options first, warn ing
Meador and fighting with him, but nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a man in ``serious'' condition in the hospital, the
rest of us get to ask why the po lice were there in the first
place, hassling people.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old neighborhood. Some longtime residents re member
friends displaced when I-17 was built. The incident with the
bicyclist happened not far from a house where, late last week, an
elderly woman spread laundry over the leafless shrubs on the side
of her house, each blouse like a blooming flower.

really wonderful people, many of whom have lived here for

RIVAL SCOTTISH BANKS INCREASE BIDS FOR NATWEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland
Group raised their bids for National Westminster Bank PLC on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The rival Scottish banks, both based in Edinburgh, are in a
heated bidding war for NatWest, a bank twice the size of either and
one that very much wants to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Bank raised its bid first, increasing it by 6 percent, to
22.8 billion pounds, or $36.8 billion at current rates of exchange.
The offer includes 1.6 billion pounds in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Bank said it would pay 0.968 share of its stock plus 4
pounds in cash _ a total of 14.26 pounds, or $23.03, for each share
of NatWest. It also offered an alternative deal that would give
NatWest shareholders 0.92 share of its stock plus 4.50 pounds in
cash and a dividend of 1 pound a share through 2003. The Royal Bank
said that arrangement was worth 14.96 pounds a share, or $24.16.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Scotland showed its hand later, offering 24.1
billion pounds, or $38.9 billion. Its offer is for 14.41 pounds a
share, or $23.27, of which 3.56 pounds is in cash.
</P>
<P>
   While Royal Bank's offer is the lower of the two, the cash
component of its basic bid is 12 percent higher than that of the
Bank of Scotland bid. The cash component of the alternative bid is
nearly 27 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   Increased offers had been expected, and each Scottish bank
played down the other's move while trying to rally shareholder
support for its own bid. ``Our record of performance is
significantly better than RBOS','' said Peter Burt, chief executive
of the Bank of Scotland, adding that his company's ``management
strength and depth should now be conclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Goodwin, deputy group chief executive of Royal Bank, took
up the sparring. ``The cash element on offer from Royal Bank of
Scotland is significantly ahead of that of the Bank of Scotland,''
he said. ``This is significant, given the importance investors have
placed upon this component of the transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   With a midnight deadline Monday night for making final offers,
it is unclear which bank might win control of NatWest, or if the
London-based bank would be able to escape from the clutches of both
and remain independent. NatWest shareholders have until Feb. 14 to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both banks are running close to the wire,'' said John Tyce, an
analyst at SG Securities in London. Tyce said he thought that Royal
Bank would be the victor in the bidding war. ``Cash is what people
want,'' he said, alluding to Royal Bank's larger cash component.
``Equity is grossly out of fashion, especially in the banking
business.''
</P>
<P>
   For either Scottish bank to prevail, it would need votes
representing a majority of NatWest shares. Analysts noted that
Britain's Takeover Panel would be able to decide which bank would
control NatWest if neither suitor received enough support. Neither
Scottish bank can make another bid for NatWest for one year if it
does not receive a majority, unless NatWest pursues a friendly
merger with one of them, according to Takeover Panel regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of all three banks dropped Monday, as investors grew
bearish on the banking industry and on the value of a NatWest deal.
NatWest stock slumped 88 pence, or 6.9 percent, to 11.88 pounds,
the biggest one-day drop since Jan. 13, 1999. Bank of Scotland
shares dropped 40 pence, to 6.20 pounds, and the Royal Bank fell 58
pence, to 10.02 pounds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's funny how we've been praying for consolidation in the
banking sector for three years,'' Tyce said, ``and then the banks
get pummeled in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Scotland is being advised by Credit Suisse First
Boston Europe and Morgan Stanley. Royal Bank is advised by Merrill
Lynch International, Goldman Sachs International and Noble
Grossart. NatWest's advisers are J.P. Morgan and Dresdner Kleinwort
Benson.

   HUNTINGTON PARK, Calif. _ At one time, Pacific Boulevard was
where the residents of this hip-pocket city in southeast of
downtown Los Angeles came to realize their fondest middle-class
desires. The boulevard was the apotheosis of the postwar California
dream, an all-white working-class Beverly Hills with swank
department stores, auto dealerships and first-run cinemas.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Zagha recently sat in the home-furnishings store his family
has run on Pacific Boulevard for nearly 50 years and recalled those
days as so distant as to be almost an illusion, all but blotted out
by memories of how white flight and indoor shopping malls later
turned the once-vital street into a cliche of urban despair.
</P>
<P>
   Then he interrupted his reverie to exchange a few words in
Spanish with a busy sales clerk and marvel at the new California
dream taking shape around the racks of towels, curtains and
bedspreads.
</P>
<P>
   Today, thick crowds again stroll past his store, the Home Shop,
but they rarely get past the maze of $2 and $5 tables clustered
near the doors. The steady flow of sales is transacted almost
entirely in cash. Conversations are in Spanish, still carrying the
accents of the regions in Mexico from which most of Huntington
Park's new residents emigrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in business, but just about everything else has
changed,'' Zagha said. ``Times aren't bad.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a vantage from which to observe the concluding
chapters of Los Angeles' transformation into the country's largest
Hispanic-dominated metropolis, Huntington Park may be it. It
provides a glimpse into the region's rapid ethnic makeover not
because it is a reflection of the city as it will be, but because
it is the gateway to that future.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Huntington Park is not a perfect mirror of the Los
Angeles region; incomes are generally lower and it is far more
homogeneous _ it is close to 100 percent Hispanic _ than the
diverse, increasingly affluent neighborhoods in the surrounding
areas. But it plays a central role in the region because it is one
of several neighborhoods where Mexican immigrants often come first,
one of the places where they begin their pursuit of the dream that
brought many here, a middle-class way of life. Huntington Park has
become a sort of citizenship incubator.
</P>
<P>
   And the impact is being felt. As of 1998, Los Angeles County had
9.6 million residents, of which 44 percent were Hispanic and 33.5
percent non-Hispanic white. Government experts predict that in 2010
the Hispanic population will make up slightly more than half of the
expected population of 10.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you learn from looking at a place like Huntington Park,
and I'm not sure people appreciate this, is how upwardly mobile
most Latinos are,'' said Jack Kyser, the chief economist at the Los
Angeles County Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit
organization. ``This city is where the newcomers learn how to do
that. It is a stepping stone into the future of Los Angeles, and
that's not something you would have expected if you looked at the
city a couple of decades ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Legaspi, a major real estate broker and developer in this
part of Los Angeles, added: ``This is a point of entry for the
Latino population in Los Angeles, not a destination. This is where
the education begins for a lot of people. Huntington Park has been
where people aspiring to the middle class get a leg up.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, Huntington Park thrived because it was the terminus
of an electric streetcar line _ since shut down _ and had a wide
downtown boulevard that and attracted shoppers from all over the
region. It was where people, many of them white immigrants from the
Midwest, spent weekend afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   It was, however, a residential oasis amid one of the most
heavily industrialized areas of Los Angeles. County. Just to the
west was the Watts section of Los Angeles, which was traditionally
a large, and largely poor black community resting, literally, on
the other side of a double set of railroad tracks that for years
defined the borders of ethnic peace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Then about 30 to 40 years ago, Huntington Park went into a steep
decline, a victim of industrial cutbacks, white families nervously
fleeing the proximity to a suddenly restive black community and the
devastation on the boulevard caused by the emergence of indoor
shopping malls. When the car dealerships left, the city's tax base
went into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Jackson, a resident for more than 40 years and a city
council member for 31 years, said that many white families left
reluctantly, but that when they did were often more inclined to
find Hispanic home buyers, rather than black ones. ``You're talking
about 30,000 people who just pulled up and left,'' Jackson said.
``It was a racism thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Huntington Park's subsequent phoenix-like rise has taken off
with the soaring numbers of immigrants from Mexico. The city, which
covers a little more than three square miles, saw its population
swell to more than 70,000 people today from about 30,000 people two
decades ago. It is perhaps 98 percent Latino. (Even nearby Watts is
now dominated by Latinos, not blacks.)
</P>
<P>
   The median age, which had risen to more than 60 in the 1970s, is
now about 24, the city estimates. Reflecting its working-class
status, the city's median household income is about $28,000 a year,
below the county's average of $40,300. Its main elementary school
and middle school each has more than 4,000 students. Pacific
Boulevard has become a cut-rate retail bazaar of shoe stores, dress
shops, travel agencies, taquerias and dental clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boulevard is back again, even better than it used to be,''
said Frank MacLean, the president of the local merchants
association.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Martin, who said she had been a resident for six years,
was strolling with her three young children on Pacific Boulevard
recently, looking at the ostrich-skin cowboy boots she said her
husband coveted, but probably would not buy. She said she had
little interest in malls, in part because she has to rely on public
transit and in part because she did not feel at home at them.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Givertz, who has owned a clothing store, Buy Rite, on the
boulevard since 1974, agreed that the immigrants had provided a
solid new retail base. ``I don't think the malls are competition
for me,'' he said. ``This boulevard reminds them of the way things
were in the old country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosario Marin, the city's mayor, said: ``The people who move
here are often new arrivals, but they really want to make it.
Truthfully, they don't want to stay here. It's their first stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mayor Marin conceded, the city's transformation has also
created enormous challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marin estimated that perhaps 40 percent of the population
consisted of people who had lived in the country less than 10
years, and that perhaps 20 percent were here illegally. That means
that few vote, and many shield themselves from the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The number of new immigrants has also created enormous
challenges for the city's schools. Ms. Marin said roughly 60
percent of the parents of the children in the city's schools read
English at a level of third grade or lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become a safe harbor for new immigrants, a place where
they can come and feel at home right away,'' she said. ``When it's
time to move on, they move on, but I hope they remember Huntington
Park and what they got from this place.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WOODS' MISLEADING STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Tiger Woods tees off Thursday in the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am, he will be seeking his sixth consecutive victory
in a PGA Tour event. But it's misleading to think that, if he were
to win, he would be halfway to breaking Byron Nelson's record of 11
consecutive PGA Tour triumphs in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   What made Nelson's streak historic was not that he won 11
straight PGA Tour events, it was that he won 11 straight
tournaments that happened to be PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, in contrast, won four straight tournaments at the end of
the 1999 PGA. Tour season, then finished 6th and 10th,
respectively, in two non-PGA Tour events (the Johnnie Walker
Classic in Taiwan and the Williams World Challenge in Scottsdale,
Ariz.), before opening this year's PGA Tour with a playoff victory
over Ernie Els in the Mercedes Championship in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Woods' current winning streak is one, not five.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, the 24-year-old Woods has not boasted of the
streak or speculated on his chances of breaking Nelson's record.
When asked about it, he has talked about how a winning streak
should be considered only within the context of a calendar year,
not carried over from the previous year. He knows he didn't win in
Taiwan and Arizona even if the PGA Tour statisticians ignore those
events.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Nelson, who will be 88 on Friday, sounded almost in awe
of Woods' domination as the world's No. 1 golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tiger can win any tournament he's in, and if he breaks
my record I'll be the first to send him a letter of
congratulations; I'm very fond of him,'' Nelson said from his
Roanoke, Texas, ranch. ``As good as he is, he may get even better.
He's long and straight off the tee. He's a good 3-, 4- and 5-iron
player and he's a wonderful putter. He consistently reads the green
better than anyone I've ever seen, and he makes more long putts in
the clutch than anybody I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But a winning streak in golf should be considered only within
the context of consecutive 72-hole tournaments, not merely
consecutive PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' streak in PGA Tour events began last August at the World
Golf Championships NEC Invitational in Akron, Ohio, followed by his
victories in the National Car Rental Classic in Orlando, Fla., the
Tour Championship in Houston and the American Express Championship
at Valderrama in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Woods' recent victory in Hawaii extended his streak
to five in PGA Tour events is technically accurate, but it's
deceptive in regard to Nelson's streak.
</P>
<P>
   In 11 consecutive tournament appearances from early March until
early August in 1945 (when there was no Masters and no U.S. Open
because of World War II), Nelson won every time. Now that's a
streak. The next best streak is Ben Hogan's six in a row in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Nelson won a record 18 PGA Tour events in 1945,
including three before the streak and four after it.
</P>
<P>
   In that era long before corporate sponsors of tournaments,
Nelson began his streak by teaming with Jug McSpaden in the Miami
Four-Ball, then won the Charlotte Open, Greensboro Open, Durham
Open, Atlanta Open, Montreal Open, Philadelphia Inquirer
Invitational, Chicago Victory Open, the PGA Championship over five
rounds of match play, the All-American Open at Tam O'Shanter and
the Canadian Open.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, that year's PGA Tour had almost a two-month
break between the Atlanta Open in early April and the Montreal Open
in early June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play in any tournaments during that break,'' Nelson
said. ``I was the club pro at Inverness in Toledo, Ohio, in those
years, and I went back there for those two months. I might've
played two or three 18-hole exhibitions in the Toledo area, but I
didn't play in any tournaments there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson did duel Sam Snead in late May in a medal play-match play
event at Fresh Meadow, then in Queens, N.Y., and at Essex County
Country Club in West Orange, N.J. But on overall score, 272 to 276,
he was considered to have won that event, too.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Woods' schedule, if he is to break Nelson's record,
he must continue to win at the AT&AMP;T, the Buick Invitational at
Torrey Pines near San Diego, the Nissan Los Angeles Open at
Riviera, the Andersen Consulting Match Play at La Costa, the Bay
Hill Invitational in Orlando, the Players Championship in Ponte
Vedra Beach, Fla., and the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   That seems too much to ask of any golfer, but it would surely be
something special: breaking the record at the Masters, where Byron
Nelson hits the ceremonial first tee shot. Then again, Tiger Woods
is really riding a streak of one, not five.

 &HT;    Fans, civic leaders respond to Rocker's suspension and fine
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For weeks, the Atlanta Braves community has stood
nearly mute while John Rocker's fate rested in Bud Selig's office.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's one month suspension finally loosened some opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Brian Jordan, who a month ago suggested the Braves
closer be traded, sounds as if he has turned the other cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time has passed, you see there is a chance for
forgiveness,'' Jordan said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   From his home in El Centro, Calif., reliever pitcher Rudy Seanez
said, ``I guess you could say I do feel for (Rocker). But heck, I
don't know. Everything he's gone through, that's a lot of stuff. To
have this (suspension) on top of it is quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher John Smoltz had reserved comment until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people that reacted right away, it was like,
'there's a problem...get rid of it. Don't want to deal with it,' ``
Smoltz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not perfect and I'm not the person that should determine
anyone's fate,'' Smoltz said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the organization, opinion was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Lowery, former president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, said the action is good, but not enough,
while the Rev. Hosea Williams denounced what he described as the
crucifixion of the Braves relief pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Lowery, who has taken part in demonstrations urging Braves team
officials to punish Rocker _ up to and including his dismissal from
the team _ applauded the action by Major League Baseball's
Commissioner Selig.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the commissioner's office is concerned, this is a
good step. They mean to be fair,'' Lowery said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said enough is more than enough in the case of Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jesus could forgive ... his hanging on Calvary, if Martin
Luther King Jr. could forgive the Ku Klux Klan and other racist
advocates in this country for their exploitation of our people, why
in the hell can't we forgive this young man?'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he said was wrong, but he is willing to apologize
and ask for forgiveness. I think crucifying him will just make him
more bitter. I can't believe, in particular, that religious and
civil rights leaders are saying crucify him, crucify him.''

RELOCATION: ELDERLY NAVAJOS UPROOTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(UNDATED) - Natalie Joe's relocation home has four bedrooms, a
modern kitchen, and a gravel road leading right to her door.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the 72-year-old Navajo widow, who re ceived the home free
and clear from the federal goverment, talks about it in the numbed
voice of someone who has lost her place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nice house, but here I am lonely and I miss my
land,'' said Joe, who speaks only Navajo.
</P>
<P>
   She lives in the so-called New Lands, a government-built
community for relocatees near the New Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   Joe, who used to live in the enormous, windswept expanse west of
Canyon de Chelly, retains a single reminder of life before her
homeland was transferred to the Hopi Tribe: a cornfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the saddest person I know,'' said Alice Chee, a tribal
social worker. ``Sometimes, she won't let me in. She tells me to
leave her alone.''
</P>
<P>
   They are the worst casualties of the Navajo-Hopi land dispute:
Hundreds of elderly Navajos torn from the only life they knew _ a
life of land, livestock and the nurturing web of family and clan
relationships that Navajos call ke.
</P>
<P>
   Many younger and more educated Navajos have done well with the
federal benefits provided for relocation. But there are hundreds of
stories of relocation's toll in broken families and broken hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The relocatees once had a safe place in a wide land. There was
room in the mornings to walk to an eastward-facing ridge to say a
prayer and sprinkle corn pollen, to ask the Navajo deities called
the Ha'yol Ka'll Dine, or Dawn People, to bless the new day.
</P>
<P>
   Now they say they are strang ers, confined in the strange land
of relocation.
</P>
<P>
   On the New Lands, at least, there is room for some grazing. But
most relocatees have been cut off from the traditional life of land
and livestock. They struggle with alien concerns: utility bills,
insurance premiums and _ if they move off the reservation _
property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Some have lost their homes to creditors. Some rent them out,
preferring to live with relatives back on the reservation. A few
have simply moved out and left the homes abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tessler, the top adminis trator of the federal agency re
sponsible for relocation, acknowledges the widespread hardship
among older Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relocation has accelerated in evitable social change,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics speak in harsher terms. They say it has forced premature
and needless change upon some of the United States' most vulner
able citizens. They are an iso lated and mostly elderly group of
traditional Navajos bound by cus tom, emotion and religious belief
to the land of their birth.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics blame Congress for not comprehending the impli
cations of uprooting elderly Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have a clue what relocation would do to these
people,'' said Christy Chisolm Tures, once a social worker with the
Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation, the special commis
sion set up to do the job. &QL; 
COSTLY TO TAXPAYERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the human cost is hard to calculate, the cost to taxpayers is
clear. In the 25 years since relocation became law, its price has
soared from the $40 million anticipated by Congress. The cost is
expected to reach a half-billion
</P>
<P>
   before relocation is done.
</P>
<P>
   Relocation has been slowed by a host of forces beyond that
underestimation. The job has been hampered by political cro nyism
in the appointment of commissioners, internal dissen sion and
unscrupulous businesspeople chasing a quick buck.
</P>
<P>
   The misery of relocation be came apparent shortly after the
first families were moved. In 1979, the Indian Health Service
reported that Navajos marked for removal were seeking psy
chological help at a rate eight times the general population's.
</P>
<P>
   An IHS researcher recorded a medicine man's account of the
despair: ``He . . . says everyone's health is going bad now. He
says he notices the people's minds are sad; even the livestock
notices this, even nature knows this. That's why there's no rain
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says sometimes he thinks about this and feels silly when he
cries like a baby when he re members the time when he was a little
boy. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   For the elderly, relocation's ultimate wound is that they can no
longer perform the most basic Navajo responsibility _ passing on a
place that the young can live on, or at least return to as a haven
in a shifting world.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have died from the depression and the stress
and worries,'' said Ben Nez, 47, assistant foreman on a railroad
track crew. He blames relocation for the deaths of his mother,
father and two uncles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to enjoy laughter,'' Nez said. ``They would have
their kids and grandkids nearby. The relocation took that all
away.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is another side to relocation, especially for young
Navajos _ educated and cultur ally mobile. They have been leaving
the reservation anyway, pushed off by a stagnant econ omy and an
unemployment rate of nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many have taken their benefits _ a home and moving expenses _ to
communities in 28 states. Others have relocated to border towns
like Flagstaff and Winslow. More than 150 families have come to the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially, it is good,'' said Betty Pahi, 47, a single
mother and a secretary at the Maricopa County Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Pahi also talks of loss, of a milder form of the alienation
rampant among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, you used to live in a big open space and now
you've lost all that,'' she said. ``Here, you're closed in. My feel
ing is I got cheated out of all that. That place was my
birthplace.'' &QL; 
`THE EMOTIONAL END' The hard feelings were exacer bated by the
combativeness of one of the relocation commission ers, Hawley
Atkinson, who had a knack for antagonizing people.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson raised eyebrows among Navajos, for example, when he
compared the relocation law to the darkest hour of Navajo history.
It was, he said, ``the greatest political setback for the Navajo
Tribal Council since the Kit Carson War of 1863.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I could have been a little more diplomatic,''
Atkinson, 83, said recently from his Sun City home. ``. . . I
didn't want to get into the emotional end of things. . . ,'' he
said. ``I wanted to get the damn job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson acknowledges that he kept the job, despite repeated
attempts to force him out, be cause he had close ties to Sen. Barry
Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's haste left a hole in its planning that was
often filled by fly-by-night con tractors and con men.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the first homes built for relocatees developed cracked
foundations and walls. Some of the first relocatees, moved be fore
a counseling program was set up, lost their homes because they
couldn't pay taxes or keep up with utility bills.
</P>
<P>
   A few lost their homes to fast-talking real-estate agents and
loan sharks who promised to help with financial problems. They
introduced the relocatees to the concepts of loans secured by real
estate. They later gave les sons in foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Yazzie, 98, finds a simple formulation for the meaning of
relocation among elderly Navajos. ``Now I have a nice home,'' she
said through her granddaughter's translation, ``but I also have
depression.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing northward, toward her former homeland 75 miles away,
she said, ``When I go to sleep, my dreams are over there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dream about shi-keyah _ `my land.' In my dreams, I am young
and I am riding my horse. I am moving free on my land.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Lands are 372,400 acres of rolling rangeland south of
Interstate 40 near the New Mexico border. Congress author ized
purchase of the lands and the expenditure of millions of dollars to
build roads, a water system, community buildings and homes for 230
families. &QL; 
KINDER ALTERNATIVE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Developed in the 1980s after relocation's trauma had become
apparent, the New Lands project allowed extended families to stay
together and to bring livestock from their old lands. It has thus
offered a small percentage of relocatees an alternative to the
disorientation of a move to a border town.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Varner, a planner for the relocation commission, is proud of
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't support the concept of relocation at all,'' Varner
said. ``I think it never should have hap pened. But there are some
good things happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some relocatees have adjusted well. A 79-year-old medicine man
whose name translates as ``Ram Herder'' says the new land has
better forage for his livestock than his old home near Coal Mine
Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Helen, said: ``When they first came here, he did a
ceremony with prayers so the nature would accept us and the
livestock. He said this is our Mother Earth, just like it was over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ram Herder says reloca tion is one of the policies with
which Washington has upset the natural order of the Indian world.
As a result, he said, the sun and the wind have lately spawned
hurricanes and tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are our protectors,'' he said in Navajo about the natural
forces. ``They are striking back.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Soon after he became prime minister, Vladimir Putin
summoned his predecessors to a September meeting to discuss
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   A limited operation to seal the borders of the breakaway
republic, and to occupy the pro-Russian parts, had been planned for
months. But Russian generals, humiliated by the 1994-96 war in
Chechnya, were pushing for a decisive fight.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prime ministers urged Putin to keep the cautious
approach. It was after the terror bombings of Russian apartment
blocks, later in September, that Putin made his fateful decision to
move on Grozny, the capital of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   It was a decision that elevated Putin to high popularity and an
almost certain succession to the Russian presidency in elections in
March. But it embroiled Russia in a deadly struggle the outcome of
which remains far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after Russian forces entered Chechnya, much of the
Kremlin decision-making is still shrouded in secrecy. But in an
interview at his government dacha outside Moscow, a former prime
minister, Sergei Stepashin, provided an inside look at the debate
within the Russian establishment and at the thinking of the man who
is now Russia's acting president and is positioned to win the next
election.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's decision to seize and occupy all of Chechnya, Stepashin
explained, represented a vast expansion of the plan developed last
spring to stem the flood of kidnappings in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The decision reflects his resolve to assert traditional Russian
interests and his closeness with the Russian security establishment
that is prosecuting the war.
</P>
<P>
   But it also shows his vulnerability to overoptimistic
assumptions about Russia's military prowess and to Russian generals
determined to settle old scores. As the fighting has dragged on,
even close associates like Stepashin have questioned whether the
strategy can deal the rebels an early knockout blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had some experience in taking Grozny, so I knew the
resistance would be fierce,'' Stepashin recalled Monday. ``We
suggested that the federal forces proceed to the Terek River, seize
the command posts along the borders with Dagestan and Ingushetia
and then stop military action.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before he became prime minister, Stepashin a had long, if
unhappy, experience with Chechnya. As chief of the Russian internal
security service, Stepashin was a hawk during the first war there.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's setbacks, however, tempered his views on the
feasibility of a military settlement. But after a rash of
kidnappings, Moscow began to develop a new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the plan began in March when Stepashin was interior
minister and continued after he was named prime minister in May.
The initial goals were very modest: sealing Chechnya's frontiers
and establishing a buffer around the republic.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the plan was broadened to include the seizure of the
top third of Chechnya, down to the Terek River. That territory was
made part of Chechnya by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to
counterbalance the ethnic Chechen population there.
</P>
<P>
   Commando raids would be conducted throughout Chechnya to ferret
out rebel leaders. But there would not be any major ground
operations south of the river and certainly no heavy street
fighting in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to conduct special operations to destroy the
bandits, employing the kind of tactics the Israelis use,''
Stepashin recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just a planning exercise, he said, but an actual
decision on strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The war might have unfolded according to this script if
Stepashin had held onto his job as prime minister. But Boris
Yeltsin, who was then the president, replaced Stepashin with Putin
in August after concluding that he needed a hard-nosed minister to
do battle with his political rivals, particularly the mayor of
Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted a tougher person,'' Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
   The militants' decision to invade Dagestan from Chechnya also
raised the stakes. Still, Stepashin and his fellow former prime
ministers _ Yevgeny Primakov, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Sergei
Kiriyenko _ made their case for the limited approach when they met
with Putin in early September.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, who backs Putin for the presidency, was concerned not
just to limit Russian military casualties. He was worried about the
thousands of civilians, many of them ethnic Russians, who were
trapped in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days we are speaking mostly of old people because young
people have either left the place or been killed,'' he said. ``This
is a strange war. We have to fight on our own territory and against
our own people.'' Putin listened attentively but did not make a
final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders and others in the security establishment,
however, were chafing to go further. They complained that a limited
approach forfeited the initiative to the rebels and would prolong
the fighting. They also wanted to get even.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted revenge for their defeat in 1996 and for all the
humiliation Russia experienced after that,'' Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in September, mysterious blasts leveled several apartment
houses in Moscow and Rostov, killing almost 300. Even though the
culprits were not found and the militants have denied any
involvement, the Russian government has blamed the rebels for the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have suggested that the explosions were set off by
renegade elements of Russia's military and intelligence services to
build public support for a wider war. Stepashin rejected that view.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry over the blasts, and the military's early successes,
emboldened Putin to try to subdue all of Chechnya. ``They were too
optimistic,'' Stepashin said of the military's projections of a
quick victory.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that it was too late for the military to stop its
assault on Grozny, Stepashin said that Grozny and the Chechen
lowlands would be under Russian control by spring. But he expressed
doubt that the Russians could easily dominate the highlands in
southern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ''As for the highlands, I would not set any date or specify a
time frame,'' he said. ``It is like asking the president of Turkey
when the Kurdish problem will be solved.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Geraldine Laybourne thinks she knows what women really
want from their televisions and computers _ and she's gambling
hundreds of millions of dollars that her instincts are right.
</P>
<P>
   Laybourne's bet begins Wednesday, when the 52-year-old veteran
programmer launches her new Oxygen channel. It will feature _ on
air and online _ women chatting in ``Pajamas,'' learning how to
surf the Internet with Oprah Winfrey and cartoon superheroes saving
women from failing relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to lure women as a group is not new to television. Many
have tried, few have succeeded. What distinguishes Oxygen is the
level to which it harnesses television to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen will simultaneously broadcast shows online and on air,
and the Web site offers a heightened interactivity, with women
sharing with one another on such intimate subjects as divorce and
child-rearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are neither a cable TV channel nor a group of Web sites,''
said Tom Werner, who, with his wife, Marcey Carsey, heads Oxygen's
programming efforts. ``Hopefully the two add up to something better
than each of them alone.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a big if, even to some fans of Laybourne, who built the
Nickelodeon children's channel into a television powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gerry has a very good ear for what people want and she has a
track record of success,'' said Marianne Paskowski, editor in chief
of industry trade journal Multichannel News. ``However, Oxygen is a
very, very risky thing.''
</P>
<P>
   While it may be a long shot, Oxygen has already earned one notch
on its belt: a whole lot of press.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about Oxygen is that it must be the most hyped new
channel of all time,'' said Bruce Leichtman, a media analyst at
Boston-based industry consultant The Yankee Group. ``Come on,
Oxygen's only launching with 10 million subscribers. Does it really
deserve all this attention?''
</P>
<P>
   Ten million subscribers is not nearly enough to make Oxygen a
success. The industry's rule of thumb is that channels need at
least 30 million subscribers to break even.
</P>
<P>
   The top cable TV channels, such as Turner Broadcasting's TNT,
have 70 million-plus subscribers. Oxygen's chief competition and
the undisputed queen of the women's channels, Lifetime, goes into
75 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Laybourne has said she expects to have 50 million subscribers
within five years, but is currently having a difficult time
breaking into the crowded cable landscape. There are some huge
markets, like New York City and parts of Los Angeles, that won't be
seeing any Oxygen for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping a prized market
</P>
<P>
   What television executives like about women is that they watch
the most television. On average, women watch 4.5 hours a day, or 40
minutes more than men. That's according to surveys by ratings giant
Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, Nielsen's research shows that women control
the shopping in most households. They buy up to 85 percent of all
goods, including 66 percent of all cars.
</P>
<P>
   Women as a group are also growing increasingly interested in the
Internet. Nielsen's research shows about 30 percent of them are now
using the Internet, but that figure will reach 50 percent in the
next three years. Women will surpass Internet usage by men in that
time frame, according to the projections.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder television and Internet executives are trying to win
the loyalty of women. Yet most of their efforts have failed, says
Laybourne, because their shows spoke at women rather than with
them. That's a mistake she doesn't intend to repeat. And she
intends to use the Internet, with its built-in interactivity, to
get and keep women viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Laybourne says her shows will be driven by ``girl power.'' That
is, they'll listen to what women want (for example, through chat
rooms on the Web site) and then tell them how to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want feedback,'' Laybourne told the New York Times. ''We
want audiences to be as involved in the creation of Oxygen as we
can get them.''
</P>
<P>
   For women who want to get online, for example, there'll be
Winfrey's Internet lessons. The show will coddle and empathize with
struggling Web novices.
</P>
<P>
   And those who just want to kvetch, there's ``Pajama Talk,'' a
late-night talk show featuring guests and hosts in PJs. The Web
sites are open in the same way for women to talk to each other and
to Oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of what Laybourne sees as what's special about the
Internet. She believes that the Web's interactivity _ talking in
real time to other women anywhere, anytime _ offers the kind of
intimacy that women crave.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy hitters back network
</P>
<P>
   It may be short on initial subscribers, but the channel, based
in an old cookie factory in New York, is long on talent,
influential partners and money.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen's financial partners include such heavyweights as
investment bank Morgan Stanley and America Online, which traded
three Web sites for a stake in the channel.
</P>
<P>
   With the likes of AOL, Laybourne has raised $200 million in
capital. She expects to raise $450 million to spend on programming,
an amazing amount for a TV start-up.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Laybourne has used her capital to do something new for
the cable TV industry: She's airing all new shows.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a new channel airs reruns and then slowly adds
original programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oxygen is more of a service brand than a competitive
programming service,'' Caryn Mandabach, president of the
Carsey-Werner Co. and a partner in Oxygen, told the Los Angeles
Times. ``What we play at 8 p.m. should be very different to get
women's attention in a very important, immediate way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing something very fresh and modern,'' said Werner.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh, yes, but on the cheap. Its lineup will feature talk
shows, news shows, self-help shows and cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been good our whole lives in casting talent,'' said
Werner, who has been involved in the creation of such shows as
``Roseanne,'' ``Cosby'' and ``Third Rock From the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of new talent on Oxygen who are terrific
performers,'' Werner said.
</P>
<P>
   Werner plans to sprinkle in some big names. Winfrey is one;
another is Candice Bergen, who will host a talk show called
``Exhale.''
</P>
<P>
   The programming strategy is also new. Rather than building its
schedule around a handful of hits, Oxygen will break the day into
lifestyle segments catering to specific groups of women viewers
likely to watch at a particular time.
</P>
<P>
   For example, weekday afternoons will feature shows designed to
attract teenage girls home from school.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that has the industry shaking its collective
head, Laybourne has said Oxygen will not be hit-driven. In other
words, the channel will not look to establish itself with one show,
the way Comedy Central did with ``South Park,'' for example.
</P>
<P>
   Old strategy, new game
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Laybourne's strategy at Oxygen is an old move on a
new chess board. It mirrors the tactics she used to turn
Nickelodeon into one of cable's largest channels, with some 70
million-plus subscribers and $8 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Laybourne came to Nickelodeon in the early 1980s with a master's
degree in elementary education from the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   What drew her to television was a strong belief that the medium
was failing children. She wanted to create shows that celebrated
children, in all their quirks and anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   In her 16-year tenure at Nickelodeon, Laybourne aired shows such
as ``Rugrats,'' a cartoon in which kids have real fears, do bad
things and learn hard lessons _ all with a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   When the Internet began to become popular, she skillfully
integrated it with Nickelodeon's programming. Nickelodeon garnered
viewer feedback from kids and used that to design new shows and
promote current ones.
</P>
<P>
   Can Laybourne repeat Nickelodeon's success with young people
with a channel for women? Schwartz, for one, thinks so. One reason:
If Laybourne can successfully plumb a niche audience of women
through both the Internet and television, Oxygen may need fewer
subscribers to become successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small niches with good demographics can be profitable,'' said
Jeremy Schwartz, senior analyst at media consultant Forrester
Research.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some experts see the Internet as the key to Oxygen's
success. Hook a woman on a Web site branded Oxygen, and she might
check the programming on the channel of the same name _ or vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving that goal is easier said than done. While most TV
channels have Web sites and are posting content online, few are
doing it well. The person or company that figures out how to do it
right will probably win big.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Holy Grail of media,'' said Schwartz. ``The trick is
to create a rich, immersive experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning a commanding position in even a small market won't be
easy. There are already several entrenched players vying for the
loyalty of women.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there's Lifetime. It has been calling itself a
women's channel for the past 15 years. After struggling through
most of its history, Lifetime has finally hit pay dirt. With 75
million-plus subscribers, the channel ranked number one among
advertisers in delivering women viewers.
</P>
<P>
   There's also strong competition on the Net. Sites such as
iVillage, CyberGrrl, Women.com and HomeArts all cater to women and
have attracted a following. Pioneer iVillage alone has some 3
million unique visitors a month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stiff competition, no one is counting Laybourne out.
Her track record, connections and ear for popular programming are
just too strong.
</P>
<P>
   Said media analyst Leichtman: ``Laybourne has done a great job
of generating attention. Now the question is, can she generate the
eyeballs?''

 PG&AMP;E Hit For Words On Judge  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
With the California Public Utilities Commission slated to vote this
week on a multimillion-dollar rate increase for Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., the debate took an unexpected turn yesterday as the
head of the PUC reprimanded the utility for making ``unfounded''
and ``inflammatory'' charges against the judge overseeing the
matter.
<P>
   Commission President Richard Bilas cited a November statement
from PG&AMP;E that Judge Mark Wetzell's proposed $243 million rate
increase is ``short on evidentiary analysis and long on fundamental
bias.''
</P>
<P>
   The utility is seeking an increase of $822 million. It has
warned that as many as 3,500 workers could get the ax and that tree
trimming around electrical lines could be reduced if it fails to
get close to this amount.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement yesterday, Bilas called PG&AMP;E's charges against
Wetzell ``serious and untimely,'' and said they ``typify a
breakdown in the civility of the adjudicatory process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``PG&AMP;E's comments demonstrate a lack of respect for our
regulatory process, diminish the process and distract the parties
and decision-makers from the overall merits of the proceeding,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the rate increase is scheduled for Thursday. It will
come after months of frequently acrimonious debate between PG&AMP;E and
consumer and industry groups over the size of the increase.
</P>
<P>
   While Bilas' reprimand imposes no penalty on the utility, it may
influence commissioners ahead of their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly hope the other commissioners will look at the
sanction order before the vote,'' said Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman
for The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   She said PG&AMP;E ``had no legal argument'' in addressing the
judge's proposed increase. ``They were reduced to making
accusations instead.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, PG&AMP;E said its words have been misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fundamental misunderstanding of what the company
said,'' insisted Ronald Low, a PG&AMP;E spokesman. ``We never intended
the comments to be a personal attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said PG&AMP;E intended its remarks to be a ``critique''
of the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC has two proposals on the table. On the one hand, the
five commissioners will pass judgment on Wetzell's proposed
$243-million rate increase. On the other, they will consider an
alternative increase of about $400 million offered last month by
Commissioner Carl Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Wood presented his own rate plan because he said Wetzell's
proposal ``has cut too deeply into muscle and bone.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Bilas said PG&AMP;E's November statements ``exceed
the bounds of professional courtesy to be accorded to the
commission, commission staff and fellow advocates.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why Bilas waited until the week of the PUC's vote
on the matter to issue his reprimand. He could not be reached for
comment yesterday.

 Dot-Com Companies Score During Super Bowl With TV Ads  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Despite some technical glitches, dot-com companies were declaring
victory yesterday following their first widespread appearance
during the holy grail of advertising.
<P>
   A total of 17 online firms _ almost half of the 38 Super Bowl
advertisers _ shelled out an average of $2.2 million for a
30-second ad during ABC's telecast of the four-hour contest between
the St. Louis Rams and Tennessee Titans. Only two dot-com ads
(three if you count Victoria's Secret promotion for its Web fashion
show) aired during last year's game.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been hard for consumers to differentiate among the
various Internet companies such as Monster.com, Kforce.com,
Lifeminders.com and Agillion.com, let alone figure out what herding
cats or cheerleaders had to do with cyberspace. Still, the firms
behind the ads were practically gleeful Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   OurBeginnings.com, an online stationery supplier in Orlando,
Fla., said traffic to its site increased 550 percent, and sales
were up about 400 percent following the airing of its ``Angry
Brides'' spot, which showed a group of violent brides-to-be
fighting over a limited number of invitation styles in a
traditional brick-and-mortar store.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, and additional servers to handle the extra
traffic, cost the 20-person company a cool $4 million. But
OurBeginnings.com's chief executive said it was money well spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't be happier,'' said Michael Budowski. ``We had a
lot of experts criticize spending that kind of money on one event;
they thought it should be more spread out over prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   OurBeginnings wasn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   According to PC Data Online, a Reston, Va., Internet researcher,
most dot-coms saw a spike in the number of visitors just after
their ads ran. The increases ranged from 15 to 541 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that advertising during the Super Bowl
helped drive traffic to these dot-coms _ especially those trying to
establish a name or a brand,'' PC Data analyst Jeff Moulton said in
a statement. ``The real question is whether these sites can sustain
these traffic volumes throughout the remainder of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   PC Data tracked the number of unique home Internet users that
came to each site preceding and after the game on Sunday. A
proprietary software tool allows the firm to measure visitors and
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com built on the success it had with last year's Super
Bowl ad, which featured children making world-weary comments about
their future careers, such as, ``I want to be forced into early
retirement'' and ``I want to file all day.'' Its ad this year was a
black and white spot featuring city dwellers reciting a Robert
Frost poem.
</P>
<P>
   Although it didn't grab many accolades in post-game polls, the
spot garnered Monster.com an 80 percent gain in traffic, according
to PC Data Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the amazing thing about the Super Bowl; it's really the
Ad Bowl,'' said Monster.com's chief executive Jeff Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   After its ad featuring boxer Muhammad Ali ran, WebMD enjoyed the
highest number of visitors it's ever had in one 24-hour period,
according to Reggie Bradford, WebMD's chief marketing officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective, it was a home run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some Super Bowl advertisers actually saw
decreases in post-game Web activity. Pets.com, which sells
aquariums, leashes and other pet paraphernalia, saw its visitors
fall 5 percent; and Lifeminders.com, which sends people customized
information via e-mail, dropped 13 percent, according to PC Data.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites also experienced technical glitches, perhaps from a
spike in usage.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites for nine of the 38 Super Bowl advertisers had some
kind of performance problem in terms of page download times,
according to Keynote Systems, a San Mateo firm that measures
Internet performance. Keynote said five of the nine offenders were
dot-coms: AutoTrader.com, Computer.com, Epidemic.com, Kforce.com
and Lastminutetravel.com. The other companies experiencing problems
were Pizza Hut, Universal Pictures, Motorola and Oxygen Media.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Shklar, a researcher at Keynote, said both Autotrader and
Lastminutetravel suffered a major increase in the amount of time it
took to download their home pages. Autotrader went from 6 seconds
to 28; Lastminutetravel, from 5.5 seconds to 62 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   And Shklar said one site, Denver's Epidemic.com, was completely
inaccessible around 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Although Keynote doesn't measure the number of visitors to each
site, Shklar says the glitches were almost certainly related to a
spike in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web sites that have done well either didn't have
significant traffic or they've had lots of experience with traffic
surges,'' he said.

 MONEYBAG/ARTHUR M. LOUIS  &HT;     Writing Off Deadbeat's Bad Debt 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I am a self-employed consultant using the cash accounting
method. One of my clients hasn't paid for the services I provided.
The client has ignored all my efforts to collect the debt. Am I
permitted to deduct the amount of the debt from my taxable income?
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: You should be able to claim a bad-debt deduction, says
Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller. But you must be
able to demonstrate that you took ``reasonable steps'' to collect
the money.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it would help your case if you hired a lawyer or
collection agency to go after the debtor. But the IRS doesn't
necessarily expect you to go to that extra expense if the amount
you are owed is small, or if your business isn't prosperous enough
to afford such measures.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  Q: I bought 80 shares of Compaq stock in January 1999 at $41
each, and 40 shares in April 1999 _ after the stock plummeted _ at
$24 each. Later in the year, I sold 40 shares at $25 each and 40
more at $22, leaving me with 40 shares at present. How do I figure
my capital gain or loss?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  A: It depends on whether you told your broker exactly which
shares you were selling at the time you placed your sell orders. If
you did, then you would subtract the purchase price of those
particular shares from the selling price.
</P>
<P>
   However, the mere fact that you posed your question suggests
that you did not tell your broker which shares you were selling.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the Internal Revenue Service insists that you
account for the sales on a first-in, first-out basis. That means
the 80 shares you sold would be the first 80 you bought _ the ones
you got in January at $41 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   So, you would have a capital loss of $1,400 _ the $1,880
proceeds minus the $3,280 you paid _ before commissions and fees.
In addition, you can increase the loss total by any commissions and
fees you paid on both the purchase and sale.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a Schlumberger shareholder. I received shares of a
spin-off company called Transocean Sedco Forex at the end of 1999.
Do I need to declare these shares as a dividend or capital gain for
1999 and pay taxes on them? If not, how do I figure my cost basis
on them for tax purposes, both the date and the amount, in case I
ever decide to sell them?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: According to Schlumberger's investor relations
department, the company's shareholders received 0.1936 Transocean
shares for every share of Schlumberger they owned. Because that
multiplier is irregular, probably most shareholders were entitled
to a fractional share of Transocean in addition to full shares.
</P>
<P>
   Schlumberger's lawyers say that the full shares are not subject
to any tax for 1999. However, to qualify for tax-free treatment you
must enclose a notice of the transaction with your 1999 tax return.
</P>
<P>
   Schlumberger sent shareholders a form to be signed, dated and
filed with their tax returns. If you didn't receive one, telephone
the company's investor relations department at (212) 350-9432, or
send a letter to 277 Park Avenue; New York, NY 10172.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the fractional shares, there are immediate tax
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The fractional shares were not delivered to the shareholders.
Instead, the company pooled them, sold them on the open market, and
sent the cash proceeds to the shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The gain or loss on the fractional shares must be reported on
your tax return.
</P>
<P>
   I'll come back to that in a moment, because first I have to
explain how to figure the cost basis on your Transocean shares, and
how to revise the cost basis of your Schlumberger shares.
</P>
<P>
   To determine the cost basis for the Transocean shares _
including the fraction _ take the cost basis of your Schlumberger
shares and multiply by 0.10508.
</P>
<P>
   The Transocean purchase date, for tax purposes, is the same date
on which you bought your Schlumberger shares.
</P>
<P>
   The new cost basis for your Schlumberger shares will be the old
cost basis multiplied by 0.89492.
</P>
<P>
   Your cost basis for a fractional Transocean share can be
calculated by multiplying the cost basis for all your Transocean
shares by 0.0186. If you got more than that in cash, then you have
a capital gain; if you got less, then you have a capital loss.
</P>
<P>
   After you figure the cost basis for the fractional share, you
should subtract the result from your total Transocean cost basis.
The result will be the cost basis of your remaining, full shares of
Transocean.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly held companies are required to relay this sort of
information to their shareholders. The moral of the story: It is up
to the shareholders to give company mailings their full and careful
attention.

 SEC Fears Activities of Market Makers  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Placing a trade with your broker may seem quick and simple. You
make a phone call, or click a computer mouse, and seconds later you
receive confirmation that the transaction has been completed.
<P>
   Quick it is, thanks to the miracle of electronics _ but simple
it's not. There is a lot of hidden activity going on behind the
scenes _ and the Securities and Exchange Commission worries that it
could be costing you extra money.
</P>
<P>
   In filling your order, your broker will route it to an
independent trading firm that holds the stock in its inventory and
provides liquidity to investors while trading for its own profit.
</P>
<P>
   These market makers compete vigorously to process trades placed
by brokerage customers, because most of the trades they handle
produce a quick, sure profit.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they are so eager to get these orders that they
typically pay the brokers a fee of about $2 per 1,000 shares traded
_ a procedure known in the industry as ``payment for order flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Order-flow payments also add up to big money for brokers.
E-Trade Group received $39 million in order-flow payments during
its 1999 fiscal year, or 11 percent of total revenues. Ameritrade
got $22.1 million in payments, or 8 percent of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC dislikes payment for order flow. It contends that the
practice can breed conflicts of interest, causing brokers to send
orders to market makers that don't necessarily execute them
efficiently and impartially, at the best possible price for the
customers.
</P>
<P>
   If a customer loses one-sixteenth one-16th  &LR; of a point per share
_ 6.25 cents _ because of a faulty execution, that adds up to
$62.50 on a 1,000-share trade. The customer may be paying, say, a
$15 brokerage commission, but the hidden cost from getting a bad
stock price is several times greater than that.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has stopped short of banning payment for order flow,
evidently because it is nearly impossible to prove that market
makers are negligent.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Luparello, senior vice president for market regulation
with the National Association of Securities Dealers, the parent of
the Nasdaq market, says he and his colleagues check on member firms
from time to time to determine whether they ``ensure the quality of
execution.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the NASD hasn't found enough evidence to bring
disciplinary actions against any firms for poor executions.
However, it has cited a couple of small firms for not adequately
documenting their trading procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Market makers prefer to get market orders from the brokers _
orders to buy or sell a stock at the current market price _ rather
than limit orders, in which the investor specifies a minimum
selling price or a maximum buying price.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, market makers generally don't pay brokers for limit
orders.
</P>
<P>
   That's because with market orders, it is easier for the market
makers to play the spread _ the difference between the best current
bid (buying) and ask (selling) prices. The bid-asked prices
sometimes can vary slightly from one market maker to another, but
in general they are quite close.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for example, that the bid price for Microsoft stock is
$98 per share and the ask price is $98.0625. If you place a market
order to sell 1,000 shares, the market maker will take them off
your hands for $98 apiece and can immediately sell them to someone
else for $98.0625, for a quick $62.50 profit.
</P>
<P>
   With a limit order, the seller might specify a minimum selling
price of $98.25. This would cramp the market maker's style, because
the trade can't be completed unless Microsoft moves up from current
levels. If there is no trade, there is no profit.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal of market makers to pay for limit orders is
reflected in the commission schedules of some brokerage firms. The
broker, not receiving any payment from market makers for limit
orders, compensates by charging its customers more to place such
orders.
</P>
<P>
   For example, E-Trade Group, the Palo Alto -based  &LR; online
discount broker, charges its customers as little as $14.95 to place
a market order _ which it can sell to a market maker _ but $19.95
to place a limit order, which probably cannot be sold.
</P>
<P>
   SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt has repeatedly expressed his distaste
for order-flow payments, most recently in a stern speech last
November to the Securities Industry Association, whose members
include all the leading brokers.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, Levitt asked: ``Are conflicts in the order
routing and execution process diluting the natural forces of
competition in our markets?''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Levitt posed this as a question, rather than a
conclusion, underscores the fact that it is hard to prove his
point.
</P>
<P>
   Market makers and brokers insist that there are no abuses _ or
hardly any.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Pasternack, chief executive of Knight Securities in New
Jersey, one of the leading market - &LR; makers for Nasdaq stocks, says
that most of the trades his firm handles are matched
``algorithmically _ with a black box,'' without human intervention.
That, he says, ensures fairness and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Pasternack adds that the brokers he deals with are deeply
concerned about getting good prices for their customers. In fact,
they make good execution a condition for doing business with the
market makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come in here and negotiate an industry-best execution
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Griffin, a spokesman for Fidelity Investments, one of the
leading discount brokers, says his firm receives payment for order
flow, but he won't say how much.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that the payments don't influence Fidelity's
decisions about where to route orders _ that the orders are sent to
the firms that appear to provide the best execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never will sacrifice quality of execution,'' he says.
remarks.  &LR; ``We're always searching for the best execution for our
clients' trades.''
</P>
<P>
   Marta von Loewenfeldt, a spokeswoman for Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.,
says that her firm accepts payments for order flow, but that
``execution quality is what drives the routing of orders.''
</P>
<P>
   James Spellman, a spokesman for the Securities Industry
Association, says that customers who suspect that they got an
inferior execution on a stock trade should complain to their
broker, the NASD and the New York Stock Exchange. ``Brokers have an
obligation to do right by their customers,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Do your best to document your complaint, he says. For example,
you should ask your broker to provide a list of the prices at which
the stock traded just before and just after your order was
transacted.
</P>
<P>
   However, Spellman notes that the best order execution doesn't
necessarily equate to the best price.
</P>
<P>
   Also involved are ``speed, accuracy, and a reasonable certainty
that the trade will happen within the time frame you would like it
to happen,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt conceded as much in his speech to the SIA, S.I.A., &LR;   &LR; but
he warned: ``In any case, the quality of execution must always be
viewed from the customer's perspective, not the firm's.''
</P>
<P>
   There are indications that Levitt's jawboning is having some
effect on industry practice.
</P>
<P>
   Datek Online, one of the leading online brokers, announced this
month that it will begin rebating all payments for order flow to
its customers. If a market maker sends Datek $2 for your trade, the
full $2 will wind up in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree with Chairman Levitt,'' says Mike Dunn, a Datek
spokesman. ``We didn't want to give the impression that we had any
conflicts. The potential is there _ there's an inherent conflict of
interest in the payment-for-order-flow system.''
</P>
<P>
   Payment for order flow could diminish considerably once the U.S.
markets make their planned conversion from fractional prices to the
decimal system. (Decimal pricing has been the rule for many years
in most foreign markets.)
</P>
<P>
   The decimal system could shrink the spreads on many stocks,
making order-flow payments less generous.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the minimum spread on the most actively traded
issues is 6.25 cents, or one-sixteenth 1/16  &LR; of a point. In many
cases, once it is allowed, the spreads could shrink to just 1 cent
under the decimal system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the SEC released details of its previously announced
decimalization plan, decreeing that the markets must begin quoting
stock prices in decimals no later than July 3.
</P>
<P>
   On that date, the minimum price increments for most stocks will
be reduced to 5 cents _ slightly less than today's basic increment
of 6.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   However, the SEC also demanded that the markets launch a pilot
program in which some heavily traded stocks will be priced in
1-cent increments.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say that if market makers eventually are
unable to make more than a penny a share playing the spread,
order-flow payments are bound to decrease.

STUDY DOCUMENTS HOMELESSNESS IN AMERICAN CHILDREN EACH YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About 1.35 million children in the United States,
nearly 2 percent of the total number of children and nearly 10
percent of poor children, are likely to experience at least one
episode of homelessness over a year, a new analysis of national
census and survey data being presented Tuesday has found.
</P>
<P>
   The children are among an estimated 3.5 million people
nationally who become homeless at least once in the course of a
year, according to the analysis by the Urban institute, a
Washington research group. The work was done by the team that
prepared a recent federal report on homelessness released last
month by the secretary of housing and urban development, Andrew M.
Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 percent more Americans had an episode of homelessness
annually in 1996, during a sustained economic boom, than in 1987,
the institute found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been homeless as a child is a predictor of being
homeless as an adult, so you're building the next generation here
to an alarming extent,'' Martha Burt, director of social service
research at the institute, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, at the time of the previous national survey, Ms. Burt
estimates that about 1.8 million people became homeless at some
point in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are doing well are pushing the price of housing
up and taking over more space, and they're doing that all over the
country,'' she said to explain the rise.
</P>
<P>
   The national report found deep poverty and illness among the
homeless served in shelters and soup kitchens, though almost half
were in their first episode of homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   The new projections are consistent with studies based on several
years of complete, computerized shelter data in New York and
Philadelphia, and with more recent data in eight other metropolitan
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis P. Culhane, a professor of social welfare policy at the
University of Pennsylvania, said shelter data show that 1 percent
of the population in New York and Philadelphia uses a homeless
shelter for some period each year, with the rate about 10 times
higher among young poor children and highest among poor African
American children under 5.
</P>
<P>
   Most poor families, Culhane added, are paying 60 percent and 70
percent of their income on rent, twice what it was 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burt said the impact of homelessness may be longlasting.
About 21 percent of homeless adults experienced homelessness as
children.

JET WITH 70 ON BOARD CRASHES OFF CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An Alaska Airlines jetliner bound from Mexico to
San Francisco crashed into the Pacific Ocean northwest of Malibu on
Monday afternoon with 70 people aboard, after reporting mechanical
difficulties. Coast Guard boats, rescue helicopters and a Navy
search plane scoured the choppy waters for several hours into the
winter twilight, and found several bodies, but no survivors so far,
the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The jet, an MD-83 headed from the Mexican beach resort of Puerto
Vallarta, had reported mechanical difficulties and requested
permission to land at Los Angeles International Airport, Ron
Wilson, a spokesman for San Francisco International Airport said,
according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   But at about 3:45 p.m., the plane, Flight 261, was reported down
in the ocean off the Naval Air Station at Point Mugu, according to
Mitch Barker, a regional spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all we know at the moment,'' Barker said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson reported that radar indicated that the plane fell from
17,000 feet and then was lost from radar screens. FAA officials
said there were 65 passengers and five crew members aboard. Skies
were clear at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The plane came down about 20 miles northwest of Los Angeles
International Airport, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell, local television stations offered live coverage
of search helicopters hovering over scattered pieces of debris and
a spreading fuel slick on the deep blue water about 12 miles
offshore, where water temperatures are typically in the low 50s at
this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   As temperatures cooled, and searchlights played across the 10-
to 12-foot swells, fog began to roll into the area between the
California coast and the Channel Islands, complicating search
efforts, which drew Coast Guard craft from as far away as San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening the Coast Guard ordered private craft that
had sailed into the area to stay away from the debris field, to
prevent confusion in search and rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 is a seven-day-a-week flight from Puerto Vallarta to
San Francisco. It is scheduled to leave at 3:30 p.m. and arrive at
5:05. The plane that usually flies the route is an MD-80 or an
updated model like the MD-82, which has two engines attached to the
fuselage near the tail. The models first entered service in 1980,
and depending on configuration, usually carry 144 to 152
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83, a two-engine craft with engines on the tail, is the
successor to the McDonnell-Douglas DC-9, and like the Boeing 737 is
frequently used on midrange flights. The jet was built less than
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines has built a successful business and a strong
safety record operating north-south routes that serve more than 40
cities in Canada, Alaska, Mexico and states up and down the Pacific
Coast. The downed flight was to have stopped in San Francisco and
continued to Seattle, the carrier's corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The airline had two fatal accidents in the 1970s, both in
Alaska, according to Airsafe.com, a Web site that tracks plane
crashes. In 1971 an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727 approaching Juneau
crashed into a mountain slope after the crew had received
misleading navigational information. All 104 passengers and seven
crew members were killed. In 1976 one passenger was killed when a
727 overran a runway in Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
   The crash is the first for a commercial airline involving
fatalities since an American Airlines MD-82 crashed in Little Rock,
Ark., last June 1, killing 11 people including the pilot, as the
pilot attempted to land in a heavy storm.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ It's probably going to be awhile before Rams quarterback
Kurt Warner can fully digest the incredible changes in his life.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a guy who only last summer was simply hoping to make the
St. Louis roster. Now, less than six months later, he's heading to
the Pro Bowl with a league Most Valuable Player trophy, a Super
Bowl MVP trophy and a Super Bowl ring on the way.
</P>
<P>
   And while team achievements always mean more than the personal
ones, Warner reached some on his own that were much loftier than he
could have dreamed of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has dawned on me that we won the Super Bowl and
that I am going to have a ring,'' Warner said Monday morning.
``Obviously, that is what we all play for. That is the goal, and it
is great to have achieved it at this point in time. There have been
some great ones that have gone to it, but took them awhile to do
it. I am fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   John Elway didn't earn a champion's ring until his final two
seasons in the league. Dan Marino still doesn't have one. Warner
got one during his first season as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Former Raiders defensive end) Howie Long came in and talked
and said he got a ring (early in his career) and thought that he
would be there every year, and he never got back there,'' Warner
said. ``So I think we realize how fortunate we were, and it is
great to get that one under our belt. But hopefully, we have got a
lot more in us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was an exciting night for the quarterback who set a Super
Bowl record with 414 yards passing in the Rams' 23-16 victory over
the Tennessee Titans. He didn't get much sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a wink,'' Warner said. ``It was all right. I've got plenty
of time to catch up before minicamp starts.''
</P>
<P>
   There won't be much else for the Rams to do in the offseason.
They've gone through so many personnel changes since coach Dick
Vermeil took over three years ago that most of the players are
signed for a while. Among the starters, only cornerback Todd Lyght,
center Mike Gruttaduaria, offensive tackle Fred Miller and tight
end Ernie Conwell will become unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   But with a team that only looks to get better, Warner said the
Rams have the best bargaining tool when it comes time to sign free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the same thing: Get another ring,'' Warner said of his
team's new goal. ``I don't know if there is any other way to do it
better than we did it this year than to be able to repeat next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question is whether Vermeil will return. He has
already said he will turn the reins over to offensive coordinator
Mike Martz when his contract expires in two years. There has been
speculation, however, that Vermeil could step down now, having won
a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil has said he will give it some thought, but he has not
indicated which way he is leaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is much better to be talking about that than to be
answering the questions about getting fired, which I have done for
two years,'' said Vermeil, who retired once before and was out of
coaching for 14 years before returning to guide the Rams. ``And I
didn't give those questions much thought, and I haven't given
(retirement) much thought. I mean that sincerely. Right now, the
only thing on my mind is to get home and enjoy this experience with
my organization and football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil accomplished something close to a miracle, taking a team
that finished 4-12 one year ago and turning it into a Super Bowl
champion. His Rams went 13-3 in the regular season, then swept
Minnesota, Tampa Bay and Tennessee to win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I wrote a legacy, guys,'' Vermeil said.
``Coaching football is not like putting a man on Mars. The only
time I shed tears was when my brother said, `Our mother (was
right). She said you would go back and coach a Super Bowl-winning
team before you quit, and God was she right.' I didn't think she
was, but she was.''

RAMS MANAGEMENT REMAINS CHEAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  ATLANTA _ Since the St. Louis Rams are the second-youngest
team in the NFL, it wasn't surprising Monday that the main topic of
the new Super Bowl champions was their future.
</P>
<P>
   No one was talking dynasty, but two men who played vital roles
in the Rams becoming world champions, Dick Vermeil and Kurt Warner,
said the team should be a formidable presence for several more
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be able to keep this team together,'' said
Vermeil, who could lose three starters, Pro Bowl cornerback Todd
Lyght and offensive linemen Fred Miller and Mike Gruttadauria,
through free agency. ``I'm confident that, if the dollars and cents
are close in contract negotiations, our players will decide to
remain with the Rams. I'm confident that the leadership we've given
these players will make it hard for them to want to go play for
another team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can keep this together a long time,'' Warner said at the
early-morning press conference at the Hyatt Regency. ``The guys on
this team have developed a tremendous camaraderie and like playing
with one another. I just don't see this team breaking apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite Vermeil reciting the party line about the
contract-negotiating virtues and salary-cap prowess of Rams
executives John Shaw and Jay Zygmunt, there are no guarantees St.
Louis will remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers
were shredded after stirring Super Bowl triumphs by the loss of
talented free agents.
</P>
<P>
   It's known that Lyght, who earned $3.4 million this season, is
looking for $5 million, which the Rams might be unwilling to give
to a player who will turn 31 in nine days.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams actually have to watch their salary cap P's and Q's
now. That never was the case when they were ensconced in Anaheim
and the Shaw-Zygmunt Tag Team routinely bludgeoned players with
below-market contracts and the club's payroll annually ranked among
the league's lowest.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams have dramatically altered their fiscal policies since
moving to St. Louis and are reaping the enormous profits from the
taxpayer-subsidized $300 million Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   They are committed to giving Marshall Faulk $49 million through
2005 _ ``We kind of mortgaged our future slightly on that one,''
said Vermeil _ and there is three years left on Trent Green's $18
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams now will attempt to trade Green, but will they be able
to find a team with a flexible enough salary cap?
</P>
<P>
   The Rams also realize they're going to have to tear up Kurt
Warner's puny contract _ Warner stands to make only $280,000 next
season and is bound to the Rams through 2002 _ and give him a lot
more money. Warner kept saying Monday morning he wasn't thinking
about such matters and that he wasn't worried about it. But that
could change quickly if the Rams decide to play hardball with
Warner and his agent.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw and Zygmunt have well-documented histories of squeezing
players when holding the negotiating leverage, and Shaw has
confided to friends that salary-cap considerations might prevent
Warner from winding up with what he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   What Kurt Warner deserves is about, oh, at least a $2 million
raise from the $250,000 he made this season _ the Rams charitably
added a $500,000 bonus _ after climaxing a 4,353-yard, 41-TD
regular season with storybook playoff heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Kurt Warner did was revive our faith and dreams in fairy
tales,'' NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Monday in his
introduction of Warner.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when so many jocks are self-important boors whose
cultural enlightenment doesn't extend beyond regular visits to
strip joints, Warner is a refreshing anomaly. He's genuinely modest
and constantly speaks about family and religious values. He seems
to be a well-grounded person who won't be adversely affected by his
newly found celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked Warner what could be learned from his
implausible odyssey, he shook he head modestly, shrugged his
shoulders and finally said, ``Continue to follow your dreams.
Follow the Lord. And live every day for what it's worth.''

RAMS' NFL TITLE IS NO GATEWAY TO PERENNIAL GREATNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kurt Warner had stayed up Sunday night reliving the
pass. Yes, that pass. The one that gave his St. Louis Rams a 23-16
victory over the Tennessee Titans only hours before. The one that
probably has Hollywood agents calling screenwriters for a script on
Warner's hard-to-believe life.
</P>
<P>
   But in Warner's hotel room, sometime before sunrise, amid the
chaos and smiles and jubilation among a small group of friends and
teammates, Warner's wife asked her husband a simple question. It
was a relevant one, a smart one and one that will trail the Rams as
they go through their parades and sign their new contracts and are
declared kings of the free world.
</P>
<P>
   How long, Brenda Warner asked, can the team keep this going?
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when a professional football team could be a
dynasty. Then came free agency, which was followed by two words
that cause allergic reactions in the systems of general managers _
salary cap. Because free agency is such an integral part of modern
football and the salary cap is as formidable as any on-field
opponent, there will probably never be another decade dominated by
one team, the way Green Bay captured the 1960s and San Francisco
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And because the sport is more year round than it ever was, 21st
century champions have little time to soak in their Champagne. The
Rams beat Tennessee in one of the more thrilling title games in the
sport. Passing records were broken. Careers were made. History was
set.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, however, will soon have to fight off predators. Other
teams, through free agency, will try to sign some of its top
players and reserves. The salary cap will force management to make
hard decisions, like cutting popular starters. And money will
become a constant topic in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in position to keep this thing together,''
Warner said. ``But there are going to be pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   The future for Warner and the Rams seems as if it's a long,
unending path paved with gold. The team has only four starters
older than 30. Warner has demonstrated he can be a franchise
quarterback. Marshall Faulk is one of the best running backs in the
National Football League and the defense is full of talented, young
and hungry players.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities seem endless. But that was what Denver Coach
Mike Shanahan thought after winning his first Super Bowl, and then
his second, until quarterback John Elway retired and running back
Terrell Davis blew out his knee. The same could be said for
Atlanta, primed to make a return to the Super Bowl this season,
until Jamal Anderson tore ligaments in his knee during the first
game of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre once declared the Packers were
on their way to becoming a dynasty, then they lost to Denver in the
championship game the following year, thus the dynasty crumbled
before it ever got started.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no guarantees in anything,'' St. Louis Coach Dick
Vermeil said. Then he sounded this note of caution when discussing
the threat of how money can erode team chemistry like acid through
a piece of paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest things today is the influence of the
agent,'' Vermeil said, ``and that influence is not always the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Vermeil is already anticipating problems. That
makes him a smart man, because those who have tried to keep a
championship team together say the faster a general manager and
head coach map out a plan of attack to keep the continuity going,
the better off they will be.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis faces several key challenges. Meet them all, or even
most of them, and the Rams can at least make a good run at doing
something no team has ever done, which is win three consecutive
Super Bowls. But fail at meeting most of them, and the Rams will be
doing what other teams with great long-term potential have done,
and that is ask themselves where things went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge is free agency. St. Louis has three unrestricted
and three restricted free agents, with the most notable being
safety Todd Lyght. This is where a team can quickly become less
effective. Losing a key starter is bad enough, but the departure of
several primary backups can also be damaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be able to sign everybody,'' Vermeil said. ``That
would be impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the jealousy factor. After the game, Warner shot
his Disney commercial. It is only the beginning of the riches that
await him and other Rams. There will be shoe contracts,
endorsements, their faces on the sides of billboards.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame a player for simply taking advantage of these
things, after all, when they worked hard to reach this point. But
something that the former Giants general manager George Young once
called ``the greed of me'' can creep in. Players can easily cross
the line from trying to do what is best for both their families and
the team, to cutting out the team part.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge will be the schedule. St. Louis will have it
much tougher on the road next year. Like every defending Super Bowl
champion discovers, each week for the Rams will be like a
mini-Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are concerns to address,'' Vermeil said, ``I don't mean
this egotistically, but with our talent and skill people. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil didn't finish his sentence. He didn't have to. With the
Rams' abilities, they should be able to withstand any challenge
next year. But then again, that is what every defending champion
thinks. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Michael Jordan brought in a new coach Monday in his
role as head of the chronically underperforming Washington Wizards,
but he made clear that he was not about to trade away point guard
Rod Strickland, who has been the subject of trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference called to introduce Darrell Walker
as the new coach, Jordan was asked whether Strickland, who has been
described as a disruptive influence on the Wizards, might be
traded, perhaps to the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Jordan said. ``The Knicks would like him very much, but
I'm very impressed with him. I don't think that trading Rod
Strickland to New York is going to make this team better.''
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Walker, who played for the Wizards from 1987-91
when they were called the Bullets, came after a weekend of
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Wizards, in last place in the Eastern
Conference with a 14-30 record, fired Coach Gar Heard, and the
players were told that Rod Higgins, an assistant for the Golden
State Warriors, would be their new coach.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, word came that the job would go instead to Walker,
who was coach of the Rockford Lightning of the Continental
Basketball Association. Jordan said Monday that Golden State had
denied him permission to talk to Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has continued to make Chicago his home, and the actual
firing of Heard was done by Wes Unseld, the Wizards' general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I offered to do that,'' Jordan said of the dismissal, ``but
Wes said that it was his responsibility to fire him.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Heard, an old-school disciplinarian, was fired,
Jordan said, ``He lost the respect of the players.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Jordan went on, hindered their performance.
``Unfortunately, the coach is the first person to get the blame,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heard said he expected to be fired when Jordan was brought in as
part-owner and president of basketball operations on Jan. 19.
Jordan met with several veteran players and with Unseld, but not
with Heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, that's the nature of the business,'' Heard told
The Associated Press. ``I think they had their mind made up when he
got here. I never had the opportunity to talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the team's owner, Abe Pollin, who has spent millions on
players and built the new MCI Arena only to see the team founder
again and again, confirmed that the team had decided earlier to
drop Heard. Heard was 2-3 after Jordan's hiring, including a
victory over Cleveland the night he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wes and I considered a change before Michael came aboard,''
Pollin said in an interview after the news conference. He added,
``We would have changed coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether his teams had underperformed because he is,
by reputation, a nice guy, Pollin disputed it. ``I'm not a nice
guy,'' he said. When asked why the Wizards had underperformed, he
said: ``I wish I knew the answer. If I knew, I would do something
about it. I was very optimistic going into this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Walker, Pollin said, ``I'm sure you're going to see 110
percent performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what level the Wizards had been playing at under Heard,
Pollin said: ``Maybe 80 percent. That's unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, 38, played for the Knicks, the Denver Nuggets, the
Bullets, the Detroit Pistons and the Chicago Bulls, with whom he
joined Jordan in the 1992-93 season. As a coach, he was 41-90 with
the Toronto Raptors from 1996 to 1998, and his Rockford team in the
CBA was 11-13.
</P>
<P>
   When it was noted at the news conference that Walker had a
losing record as a coach, Jordan said, ``When you look at someone's
record, it can be because of the talent or lack of talent on the
team.'' The Wizards, he said, have the talent to win.
</P>
<P>
   If the Wizards do not improve despite that talent, Jordan said
that Walker would be evaluated at the end of the season and that
there might be more changes in the Wizards' management. &QL;

TOP THREE REPUBLICANS ON SOME ABSENTEE BALLOTS IN N.Y.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   New York election officials agreed Monday to put the three
leading contenders in the Republican presidential primary on
absentee ballots for members of the military while a court fight
continues over who will appear on the regular ballots.
</P>
<P>
   One of the candidates, Sen &UR; . &LR;  John McCain of Arizona, is asking
a federal judge to overturn the primary rules, which make it
difficult to qualify without the backing of the Republican State
Committee, and place him on the ballot across New York on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   After legal challenges to his nominating petitions by the state
party, which is supporting Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, McCain is
on the ballot in only 18 of the state's 31 congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Edward R. Korman of Federal District Court in
Brooklyn, last Friday criticized the primary rules as needlessly
complicated, and is expected to issue a decision this week.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials are scheduled to mail military absentee
ballots on Friday, and lawyers for McCain and another candidate in
the lawsuit, Steve Forbes, expressed concern that because the two
men have, for now, been thrown off the regular ballot in some
districts, their names would not appear on the military absentee
ballots for those districts.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has been disqualified in three Long Island districts, but
is on the ballot in the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   After a conference call among the judge and participants in the
case Monday, state election officials agreed that the names of the
three candidates would be on all the military absentee ballots. If
after the legal wrangling a candidate is disqualified in a
district, any votes for him on a military ballot for that district
would be disregarded, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Other absentee ballots are set to go out later in the month.

CLINTON CAMPAIGN HIRES AGENCY THAT CREATED ADS TWEAKING MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton has hired the Manhattan
advertising firm whose ads for New York magazine in 1997 enraged
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to produce the media campaign in her bid for
the U.S. Senate, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, DeVito/Verdi, has a reputation for edgy, streetwise
advertising but has no previous experience working for political
candidates. The firm will work with two veteran Democratic
operatives: Mandy Grunwald, a media consultant, and Mark Penn, a
pollster.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito/Verdi developed an ad campaign that ran on the sides of
public buses featuring pictures of Giuliani and proclaiming New
York magazine as ``possibly the only good thing in New York Rudy
hasn't taken credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads appeared in November 1997, shortly after Giuliani was
overwhelmingly re-elected for a second term. But the mayor,
infuriated at being portrayed as self-aggrandizing, complained to
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which removed the ads
until a federal appeals court ordered them restored.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Mrs. Clinton confirmed the components of the
campaign's media team Monday after David Doak, a political media
consultant in Washington, said he would not be joining the Clinton
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some long negotiations and couldn't come to terms on a
number of things,'' said Doak, who is a longtime associate of
Harold Ickes, the former White House chief of staff who is Mrs.
Clinton's senior political adviser. ``Hillary Clinton has been a
friend of mine for 20 years. I wish her the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Others close to the Clinton campaign and in the
political-consulting business suggested that money and control had
been sticking points in the talks with Doak, particularly the issue
of who would have ultimate authority on a large media team with
several strong personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grunwald, a New York native, has her own media-consulting
firm in Washington and has worked for President Clinton, Senator
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and Ruth Messinger, the former
Manhattan borough president who unsuccessfully challenged Giuliani
in 1997. Penn, who has also worked for Clinton and other Democrats,
is a partner in Penn &AMP; Schoen, which has offices in New York and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to go into battle,'' said Bill de Blasio, Mrs.
Clinton's campaign manager. ``It's a very strong team.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Verdi, president of DeVito/Verdi, said his firm was
excited. ``Any advertising campaign is a challenge, but in this
case we are blessed with a great product,'' he said. ``We beat the
mayor once before and we plan to beat him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, the head of Giuliani's Senate exploratory
committee, referred to the Clintons' many friends in show business
and said, ``Their team of television producers, ad agencies and
spin doctors is just more form over substance. It's like they are
gearing up for a production of Hollywood on the Hudson.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVito/Verdi also has produced politically minded ads for the
Pro-Choice Public Education Project, a consortium of abortion
rights groups nationwide, and commercials for Planned Parenthood
promoting the use of condoms.

CRIMINAL PROBE LOOKS AT MAINTENANCE OF MD-80S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The MD-80 has been a workhorse of Alaska Airlines'
fleet, taking the carrier's passengers up and down the West Coast
for years. It also has been at the center of a criminal
investigation into Alaska Airlines maintenance and a long-running
controversy over fumes in the passenger cabin.
</P>
<P>
   John Liotine, an Alaska lead mechanic in Oakland, Calif., set
the criminal investigation into motion in October 1988 when he
contacted an inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Records released under the Freedom of Information Act last year
showed that Liotine complained that an Alaska supervisor filled out
a post-maintenance checklist on an MD-80 even though he wasn't
qualified to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska repairs its 39 MD-80s at the Oakland maintenance
facility.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that initial contact by Liotine:
</P>
<P>
   -- A criminal investigation has been under way involving a
federal grand jury in San Francisco, the FBI, the U.S.
Transportation Department and the U.S. Attorney's Office. No
charges have been filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   -- The FAA has recommended that the mechanic's licenses of three
Alaska supervisors in Oakland be revoked for making false entries
on records.
</P>
<P>
   -- The FAA also proposed a $44,000 fine against Alaska. An
agency inspector in Oakland originally proposed an $8.7 million
fine. But FAA lawyers determined that top Alaska executives weren't
involved, so the size of the proposed fine was reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which has been the subject of news reports
for months, focuses on two MD-80s, including one in which a manager
allegedly released a plane for service with its throttle set
improperly.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA inspector in Oakland concluded that the two MD-80 jets
were flown 844 times from Oct. 7, 1998, through Jan. 19, 1999, ``in
an unairworthy condition'' because portions of records that
document maintenance hadn't been filled out.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has said that the alleged violations involved only
record-keeping and that the jets were safe to fly.
</P>
<P>
   What first caused Liotine to act was the signing of a checklist
by a manager he believed was unqualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant driving force in this endeavor has been the
downward trend among the ranks of maintenance personnel and this
management team with respect to actual work experience in the
performance of the duties entrusted to them,'' Liotine wrote in a
statement to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote that corrective action in the company for these
problems was lacking, as was ``interest by our management to
honestly deal with these causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Liotine's whistle-blowing cost him his post of president of a
local chapter of the mechanics' union. Other union members recalled
him from his post last year, and a letter from a union committee
that backed his recall cited his involvement in the criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska also put Liotine on leave with pay in September. The
company cited the investigation as well as ``the strains on the
existing operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The MD-80 also has been the source of dozens of complaints about
air quality in the cabin. For a decade, Alaska flight attendants
have blamed a range of maladies _ headaches, goiters, tremors and
lost mental abilities _ on what they believe are toxic fumes.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of the hundreds of complaints focus on the
MD-80. The airline also flies Boeing 737s.
</P>
<P>
   Several flight attendants are too sick to work, and others have
been put on reduced duties.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and company investigations have yet to pinpoint a source
of the problems. Because of the difficulty in connecting illnesses
to the planes, flight attendants have generally failed in their
attempts to get worker's compensation.

BOXING INSIDERS OFFER DETAILS OF CORRUPT RANKINGS BY OFFICIALS OF
IBF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. and RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the pattern had struck many people in the boxing
business as fishy. One after another, Colombian fighters with
almost no experience outside Colombia would appear out of nowhere,
rise rapidly up the International Boxing Federation's rankings and
get a shot at a title. Most of them then lost the title fight and
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Mercado, a junior bantamweight of little renown, rose to
the No. 1 contender's spot, then was soundly beaten by the
champion, Robert Quiroga, in 1992. Felix Naranjo, a miniflyweight,
also ascended rapidly to contender's status and got a 1993 title
fight against the champion, Ratanapol Vorapin of Thailand, who
knocked him out in two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Julio became the top lightweight contender in 1995 with
dubious credentials and persuaded the IBF to order the champion at
the time, Oscar De La Hoya, to fight him. But De La Hoya gave up
the IBF belt instead, saying the match would be an embarrassment.
Julio was later whipped by Philip Holliday, a lower-ranked South
African.
</P>
<P>
   The boxing insiders' suspicions turned out to have merit. The
Colombian fighters' manager, Ivan Feris Chadid, said in a sworn
affidavit that he had paid dozens of bribes from 1989 to 1997 to
IBF officials to advance his fighters in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Feris' affidavit was part of thousands of pages of testimony,
documents, tape transcripts and videotapes that a federal judge in
Newark, N.J., unsealed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The documents underpin a civil racketeering lawsuit filed by the
federal government against the IBF, in which prosecutors
successfully sought the appointment a monitor to oversee the
sanctioning organization's operations. The civil case grew out of a
grand jury indictment last November of the IBF's founder, Robert W.
Lee Sr., and three other officials on charges of mail fraud and
soliciting bribes.
</P>
<P>
   The documents and transcripts paint a picture of pervasive
corruption involving some of the biggest boxing promoters in the
United States, including Bob Arum, Don King and Cedric Kushner.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the government's case appears to be the testimony
of C. Douglas Beavers, who headed the IBF's rating committee from
its founding in 1983 until 1998. Facing prosecution himself,
Beavers agreed to cooperate with federal agents in May 1997,
secretly recording more than a hundred conversations with Lee and
other officials in which soliciting bribes and manipulating
rankings were discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers also helped the FBI surreptitiously videotape several
transactions. On a videotape of a meeting in October 1998 with Lee,
Beavers hiked his pants leg and untaped a cellophane package
containing $5,000 in what prosecutors contend was a bribe collected
by an IBF official in Colombia, Francisco Fernandez. In turn, Lee
then placed an envelope with $8,000 in cash on the table,
describing it in code as a payoff from King.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers, in a long deposition, described how he and Lee referred
to payoffs as ``turkey'' or ``stuffing'' in their conversations,
many of which were recorded. They had code names, too, for many
promoters; King was known as ``fuzzy'' or ``cuz,'' and Kushner, who
is portly, was called ``the fat man.''
</P>
<P>
   Beavers said he and Lee had regularly solicited bribes from
managers and promoters, starting in 1985, in essence selling
rankings to the highest bidder. They also accepted payments to
order rematches.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers said Lee had often given preferential treatment to
King's fighters, known to them as ``fuzzy's guys,'' even though
they often lacked the skills to deserve their rankings. Some
fighters were also abruptly dropped from the rankings once they
split with King, Beavers said.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers apparently never received money directly from King, but
he said Lee had given him payments on at least two occasions,
saying the money was from King. In December 1997, for instance, Lee
told Beavers a $4,000 cash payment was ``turkey from Don King.''
</P>
<P>
   In his sworn statement, Beavers said, ``Because we were
receiving payoffs from Don King, we gave special consideration to
his fighters and frequently rated them higher than they would have
been rated on merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the fighters promoted by King whose rankings were
artificially inflated were the heavyweights Gary Ballard and Henry
Akinwande, Beavers said.
</P>
<P>
   King was not charged in the case, and neither the affidavits nor
the transcripts indicate that the government's witnesses can
directly link King to specific payments.
</P>
<P>
   But Beavers and another IBF official, Donald William Brennan,
considered King to be the promoter with the most influence over the
IBF's rankings. In one taped conversation, Beavers said Lee was
``essentially working for King.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeated calls to Don King Productions and to lawyers for King
for comment on the allegations were not returned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   King was not the only promoter paying bribes, the documents
show. Kushner sent payments of $5,000 to $10,000 three to four
times a year, Beavers said. In one instance, Kushner paid Beavers
$100,000 in return for the IBF's forcing a rematch between the
heavyweight George Foreman, then in his 40s, and Axel Schulz, a
German fighter whom Kushner promoted in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1995, Beavers collected the $100,000 from Kushner at his
home on Long Island, N.Y., Beavers said, and then delivered $50,000
to Lee's son, known as Robby, at a service area on the New Jersey
Turnpike. Beavers then drove to Virginia and gave $25,000 to
Brennan. He kept $25,000 for himself. Both Robby Lee and Brennan
are also under indictment.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of that payment, Beavers said, ``Kushner's
payoffs were not to benefit a specific boxer in a specific manner,
but instead were to benefit Kushner's boxers generally.''
</P>
<P>
   Kushner, through a lawyer, has declined to comment on the
federal case. He has not been indicted.
</P>
<P>
   The payment from Kushner came after Foreman narrowly defeated
Schulz in 1995, but the first match was also tainted, according to
the affidavits. Foreman became the IBF's heavyweight champion in
1994, and rather than face again the boxer he defeated for the
title, Michael Moorer, he wanted a bout with Schulz, an unranked
heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit, Arum said he agreed at a meeting in the Mayfair
Hotel in Manhattan in December 1994 to pay Lee $200,000 to give
Foreman an exemption from the IBF's rules requiring a rematch with
Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   Arum used Stanley Hoffman, a New York manager, to funnel
$100,000 to Lee, both Arum and Hoffman said in separate affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he had refused to pay the second $100,000 installment
after he learned that another IBF official had demanded and
received a $250,000 bribe from Foreman to fight Schulz. Arum said
in his affidavit that he had then ordered Hoffman ``to tell Lee
that I refused to pay any more money.''

LOW BLOW FOR BAUER AND EXPECTATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Lowering pundits' expectations is not a
problem for Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll on the Republican presidential race released Tuesday
by CNN, USA Today and the Gallup Organization, Bauer was favored by
an unusually small percentage of the respondents: zero.
</P>
<P>
   Zero? Other polls out Tuesday, by the likes of The Associated
Press, the American Research Group and the University of New
Hampshire, put his support at 1 percent. When looked at from the
perspective of a forlorn zero, that sounded like quite a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Zero, of course, did not mean zero, but something akin to
``negligible.''
</P>
<P>
   William Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst, said that in
numerical terms it meant that of the 1,000 people interviewed for
the poll, fewer than one-half of 1 percent said they would vote for
Bauer on Tuesday. That works out to fewer than 5 people.

POLITICAL IS A BIT PERSONAL FOR THE TWO DEMOCRATS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Even after Bill Bradley compared Al Gore to
Richard Nixon on national television, his campaign continued to
insist last week that he had nothing against the vice president,
and that any harsh words were merely a response to Gore's
aggressive campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But several longtime associates say Bradley has disliked Gore
and made negative references to him since their days in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley's campaign chairman, Douglas Berman, acknowledges
that their differences do appear to predate the campaign. ``There
should be no suggestion that this is why Senator Bradley is
running,'' he said. ``In no way did that affect his decision. But
that their relationship is testy and getting testier and didn't
start warmly is probably true.''
</P>
<P>
   Several friends said that Bradley viewed his Senate colleague
then in much the same way he has portrayed him in recent days: as
untrustworthy and insincere.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the last year, Bradley has repeatedly said he barely
knew Gore when they served together from 1985 until the end of
1992. On Wednesday, he said on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' that
``I've spent more time in a debate room in this campaign than I had
with him in any previous time.''
</P>
<P>
   But while that is no doubt true, it is also true that there are
reasons, particularly on Bradley's part, why the two did not spend
more time together.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Sunday, through his spokesman, Eric Hauser, about his
friends' recollections of specific things he had said about Gore in
the past, Bradley refused to comment, saying he would not
characterize private conversations.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Bradley has said that Gore's attacks on him have been
unfair and inappropriate. Mostly, Gore's criticisms have centered
on Bradley's record and his proposals, particularly his health care
plan, which Gore suggested would hurt minorities. But in
complaining about these criticisms, Bradley has suggested that Gore
has no conscience and has repeatedly branded his opponent as a
liar.
</P>
<P>
   And the bad feeling seems to go back at least to Gore's first
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Bradley said he told them in 1988, when Gore was
running at age 39, that his colleague was nowhere near ready, that
he saw Gore's decision as self-indulgent and that he felt Gore was
unqualified.
</P>
<P>
   A Bradley campaign aide said, ``Given how Bill has always
thought about what it takes to run for president, and what you owe
the country in terms of being ready, he thought Gore was incredibly
ahead of that curve, that Gore viewed it as pure ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman acknowledged the tensions between the two candidates in a
general way after hearing the detailed recollections of several of
Bradley's friends who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Three friends of Bradley _ two of them former campaign aides,
both loyal to him and irate about Gore and the campaign he has run,
and a third who knows them both professionally and socially but is
not in either camp _ said they remembered hearing Bradley speak
disparagingly of Gore. And each of the three said Bradley had
referred to Gore as a phony.
</P>
<P>
   During the time the two men were in the Senate together, Gore,
for his part, does not appear to have shared his feelings about
Bradley one way or the other. And the same holds true more
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president did, however, tell friends he thought Bradley
was a defeatist because he announced soon after Republicans took
over Congress that he planned to retire from the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has often repeated the criticism during the
campaign, playing off Bradley's departure with a slogan reminding
voters that he, on the other hand, had decided to ``stay and
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bradley's friends who said he had long had a negative
impression of Gore emphasized that that did not mean that Bradley
had spent a lot of energy on his feelings about Gore. One said that
any residual ill will from that era ``pales in comparison to what's
occurred since Bill got into the race.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in an interview in 1997, Bradley spoke in flattering
terms of every other possible presidential candidate, Republicans
included.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether Gore would make a good president, Bradley
said, ``I assume there are a lot of people that could be good
presidents, and he'd be among them.''

</P>
<P>
   ONLINE FUND-RAISER: The McCain campaign has scheduled its first
live online fund-raiser on Feb. 10, an event that political
professionals said was probably a first for any candidate. Sen.
John McCain will be at a fund-raiser in Washington, and for $100,
anyone will be able to participate over the Internet, watching and
hearing him on a computer. He will take questions from people
online. Campaign aides said that more than 60,000 people had
volunteered through the McCain Web site and that the campaign had
raised more than $1.5 million through the site.

   PAPER WAR: The Manchester Union Leader, New Hampshire's largest
newspaper, was a battleground for Steve Forbes on Monday. On the
front page was yet another editorial supporting him. Inside was a
half-page advertisement from the Bush campaign, criticizing Forbes
for his attacks on Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and a full-page
advertisement from the Catholic Alliance, an anti-abortion group,
thanking Forbes for having ``spoken out on Catholic issues.''
William Dal Col, campaign manager for Forbes, said that the Bush
advertisement mimicked ones by the Republican Leadership Council,
which was proof, he contended, that the independent political group
was improperly coordinating with the Bush campaign.

   EARLY MORNING EVENT: After the vote is counted Tuesday night,
Vice President Al Gore will fly to New York for a 3 a.m.
appearance. Why an event at that hour? ``I don't want the traveling
press corps to get any rest,'' Gore said with a straight face. ``I
think that disorientation and jet lag work in my favor.''

   THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   CLOSE CONTESTS: The results of 11 polls available on the eve of
the New Hampshire primary showed Vice President Al Gore with a lead
of 3 percent to 12 percent over former Sen. Bill Bradley. All but
three of the results fell within the margin of sampling error. Ten
of the polls found Sen. John McCain leading Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, with eight of the leads within the margin of sampling error.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE RESOURCE: One of the newest media outlets in this
campaign is Voter.com, a political Internet site. Run by a
bipartisan cast of politicos, Voter.com seeks to be a clearinghouse
for the political process. On the evening of the Iowa caucuses, the
site (www.voter.com) provided running vote totals, linked to the
results being fed to the state Democratic and Republican Parties.
Jeff Hunter, Voter.com's director of political outreach, said in
New Hampshire the site would report real-time results using The
Associated Press and Reuters news services.

the nation's most prominent black Republicans, said Monday that he
would seek re-election this fall, ending speculation that he would
retire. Watts, 42, agreed to run for a fourth term after Speaker
Dennis Hastert and other Republicans furiously lobbied him to stay.

SAILING THE CARIBBEAN WITH A FEW PALS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The name tags scared me. They were the first thing I saw _ lined
up neatly in alphabetical order on a table _ when I entered the
observation lounge of the Nantucket Clipper on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. I was here to cruise the Virgin Islands for the beaches,
for the swimming and snorkeling in jewel-blue waters, for the
Caribbean's gentle wind in my hair, not to make new friends. So I
silently vowed to be polite but retiring, to commune only with a
good book, to smile and nod and keep to myself.
</P>
<P>
   Famous last words. By Wednesday, I didn't know how I'd ever
gotten along without Anne and Dave from Buffalo. I'd bonded with
Jane the naturalist from Seattle (even if I did skip her lecture on
hummingbirds). I'd watched myself on a land tour, one of a dozen
rowdy cruise-ship passengers in an open-air minibus, smiling and
waving at strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Cruises as a vacation form inspire mixed feelings in me.
Traveling by water, I have always thought, should mean either
making the trans-Atlantic crossing in evening clothes or hugging
the coast of Ischia, stretched out on the sun deck of a friend's
yacht, getting up only when a cold chicken salad and white wine
lunch is served at a table 20 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   But this time I was seduced by the experience and came away with
the conviction that the cruise is an art form _ and the fastest,
purest wind-down possible for the chronically stressed. Maybe it
was because this cruise was called the Yachtsman's Caribbean. The
brochure promised I'd be able to swim and snorkel directly from the
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Things went well from the beginning. American Airlines got me
from New York to the St. Thomas airport nonstop in four uneventful
hours flat. The Clipper's dock was five minutes from the airport,
but it was too early to board, so the ship's representative whisked
my luggage away (it appeared magically later that afternoon in my
cabin) and sent me in a taxi to the Island Beachcomber Hotel, about
three minutes from the airport. In fact, on the way back, some
people actually walked from there to the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The Beachcomber is a simple place and the sound of airplanes
landing isn't particularly tranquilizing, but there is a gorgeous
little beach and the requisite open-air restaurant and bar. (A
pleasantly chatty American bartender pointed out that some other
people at the bar were going on the same cruise; I ignored them.)
</P>
<P>
   We boarded the ship around 4 p.m. And after the initial shock of
the name tags, I noticed something wonderful: there were only 64 of
them. The 207-foot Nantucket Clipper has a 102-passenger capacity
and is usually fully booked, but this particular cruise began on
Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Y2K anxiety had discouraged a lot of people from
scheduling travel right after New Year's Day. Fine with me; it had
helped my travel agent negotiate a sizable discount on the package
price.
</P>
<P>
   But to whom did those name tags belong? The stereotypical cruise
passengers are, of course, an elderly couple in polyester with lots
of time on their hands. I admit I didn't look forward to being
surrounded by retirees, not because I'm ageist (I'm getting old
pretty fast myself) but because I hate feeling out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine my horror when I turned on the ship's on-board sound
system and heard the first number: ``Kiss me once and kiss me twice
and kiss me once again; it's been a long, long time'' (one of my
mother's sentimental World War II favorites). And the first
on-board conversation I overheard was about blood pressure
medication. As it turned out, two of the four people talking were
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, several passengers appeared to be in their 30s. There
were always young faces around, because the members of the crew
were bright-eyed all-American 20-somethings who looked as if they
might have been on semester break. And a number of people who
claimed to be retirees looked awfully young and fit, ready for the
hikes and snorkeling excursions ahead. Remember, while you're
sitting at your desk all week, these people are out power-walking
and taking tennis lessons.
</P>
<P>
   But even the laziest couch potato could have managed our
leisurely itinerary. We left St. Thomas on Monday morning, making
stops at Jost Van Dyke (a tiny island with a population of about
150), Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Peter Island (a last-minute
substitution for Salt Island, where we couldn't dock that day
because of the breakers), Norman Island (population 0) and St. John
before returning to St. Thomas on Saturday for a Sunday morning
departure.
</P>
<P>
   These are fairly unchallenging distances (from one end of all
the Virgin Islands to the other is only about 60 miles), so there
wasn't a lot of actual cruising involved. I never heard of a single
case of seasickness during the week, and I had forgotten to bring
Dramamine.
</P>
<P>
   So during most of our meals, the ship was sitting still. But
there were still gorgeous water views from the dining room, which
was spacious with lots of big windows. This is where I was forced
to talk to people. On the first night I asked Craig, the cruise's
hotel manager, if there was a small table I could sit at alone. He
promptly ushered me to an empty seat at a table for six, where I
met a family-and-friends group of five from upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, OK, I enjoyed talking to them. The next day at lunch, I
insisted on a table alone but was soon joined by two single women
from St. Louis traveling together.
</P>
<P>
   The food was very good if a little underseasoned at times. At
both lunch and dinner, there was normally a soup, a salad or two
and a choice of three or four main courses (one of them
vegetarian). The wine list was extremely reasonably priced (most
bottles were below $20).
</P>
<P>
   I loved the ship's portion-size policy. Maybe all the best
places are doing this now, but I hadn't run into it before:
Passengers are allowed _ even encouraged _ to order half portions
of a dish if they want or double portions if they're in the
opposite mood.
</P>
<P>
   One day I couldn't decide between the chicken Monterey and the
avocado and seafood main-course salad, so I had a half portion of
each. The half-portion idea took a lot of the guilt out of ordering
dessert, but after a week of unusual but tasty confections like
chocolate-chip banana cake and peanut butter satin pie, I still had
gained a little weight.
</P>
<P>
   There was also always the option of eating more informally in
the observation lounge: a breakfast buffet with cereals, fruit,
muffins and the like; a lunch buffet of soup, sandwich fixings and
dessert. The buffet also reduced my antisocial tendencies _ I could
take one of the little round cocktail tables alone but be close
enough to exchange a few words with people nearby. This was where I
met Ned and Terry from Maine, and Frank and Sandy from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After dinner I was happy to go to bed early with my book, but on
most nights entertainment was available. Both naturalists gave
lectures, as did a visiting professor whose subjects were pirates
and voodoo. There were on-shore parties on at least two nights _
one of them complete with, yes, a limbo contest. There were a
couple of movie nights, in the dining room. I was glad to see ``The
Sixth Sense'' again but decided to skip a repeat of ``Runaway
Bride.''
</P>
<P>
   No one I met spent much time in the cabins. Mine, a category 3
(right in the middle of the ship's price range), was neat and
tasteful enough, but as tiny as I expected. There were twin beds
with batik spreads on either side of the door, and just enough room
to walk between them to get to the blond-wood desk (with a big
mirror above it) and chair, the wall of three narrow closets and
the shower-equipped bathroom, which was a decent size by maritime
standards.
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of tasteful tropical-pastel framed prints on
the wall and two large windows with shades and short aqua
draperies. The shades stayed closed most of the time, because
people were always walking by. On the other hand, when I opened my
cabin door I was right on the deck, just a couple of steps from the
rail, enjoying blue water, green hills and the sea breeze.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, passengers could stay busy, with almost constant
excursions, or do nothing but relax on the sun deck or in the
observation lounge, a pleasant room with a bar, banquettes, sofas
and three walls of huge windows. The lounge was the only public
space on the ship besides the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   When you choose a small ship, you don't get a spa, casino or
pool; there wasn't even a gift shop, although a small selection of
merchandise was put on sale at the front desk twice during the
week.
</P>
<P>
   In total, there were 20 possible outings. They ranged from the
Sage Mountain National Park hike in Tortola to the snorkel
excursion (the cruise didn't offer scuba) at the wreck of the
R.M.S. Rhone, which sank in 1867. Prices ranged from $10 for a bus
to the beach to $75 for the Atlantis submarine trip.
</P>
<P>
   I chose three of the least labor-intensive: the Tortola island
tour, the bus to the Baths (a beach with great rock formations) in
Virgin Gorda and the bus to the beach at Trunk Bay in St. John.
</P>
<P>
   The island tour was only moderately interesting. At one point,
our guide, Elroy, got out of the bus to show us what a papaya
looked like. (Gee, and back home I would have had to walk two
blocks to the Korean market to see one.) The tour also involved one
of those winding-mountain-road-on-a-cliff-edge drives that I swear
I will never go on again but always do.
</P>
<P>
   It was, however, a pro-social experience: I always feel closer
to people after I've exhibited abject fear in front of them. At the
top of the mountain was something called Skyworld, where the
restaurant was closed and the bathrooms were locked and unavailable
but the gift shop was open.
</P>
<P>
   When I heard that the trip to the Baths the next day involved a
similar death-defying mountain drive, I canceled. But the afternoon
snorkeling trip I wanted to go on instead was canceled, so I was at
loose ends. Luckily, I remembered seeing a price list on the ship
for the Spa at Leverick Bay, and I passed that very spa on the walk
back to the ship. I went in and had an excellent $80 one-hour
massage that was worth every penny. Strangely, though, there was a
$15 charge for using the whirlpool.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite excursion was the bus to Trunk Bay on St. John.
Trunk Bay is a beach that lots of cruise ships shuttle their
passengers to, I'm told, but it wasn't really crowded. And it's
widely known as one of the most gorgeous beaches anywhere: white
sand against a backdrop of palms and sea grape trees, calm blue
water clear enough to examine your toenails under, and rockside
snorkeling so organized that there are signs underwater identifying
the sea life at hand.
</P>
<P>
   (Don't ask me how the parrotfish know to go to their sign every
day.) Even I, the clumsy snorkeler whose mask is always filling up
with water, could glide along peacefully and confidently here,
watching the fan coral fan.
</P>
<P>
   There were other swimming and snorkeling opportunities. At Jost
Van Dyke, for instance, we took Zodiacs from the ship to White Bay,
which was small, peaceful and beautiful. But the experience I had
come for was the opportunity to swim right off the ship.
</P>
<P>
   We did this twice: on Thursday at Norman Island and on Saturday
morning at Christmas Cove in St. Thomas. This meant you could leave
your cabin in just your swimsuit, pad down the stairs to the little
swim platform set up at the main deck exit and just dive or step
into the Caribbean. It was heaven.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, I had paddled out to a good snorkeling spot when I
looked back to the ship and saw what looked like a man holding a
tray aloft in the water. Yes, the hotel manager had put on a swim
belt and gotten into the water with a tray of rum punches.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of swimmers happily accepted them, even though it was
around 10 a.m. (I honestly don't think there was much rum in them,
but the idea of hedonism like this was extremely satisfying.) For a
minute there, I could have been on a rich friend's yacht. With Anne
and Dave, Valerie, Marilyn, Frank and Sandy, the Romines from New
Mexico. All my good friends.

DECOROUS HULAS AND NO SEQUINS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SARAH FERRELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A one-week American Hawaii Cruise among the Hawaiian Islands,
calling at five ports on four islands, sounds like exactly the
ticket for alleviating the winter drearies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It does not, however, begin well. In fact, it begins with one of
the worst _ and longest _ days of my life, a day on which, because
of an escalating series of mishaps too boring to detail, it has
taken me 22 hours to get from New York to Honolulu. To miss the
ship. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So there I am, after a night in an airport motel and a brief
interisland flight, standing on the pier at Nawiliwili, Kauai,
watching the Independence maneuver slowly into its first port of
call. Ah, but my spirits lift at the sight, and I enjoy a moment of
mild Schadenfreude when I realize that the docking is something my
soon-to-be-fellow voyagers, already aboard, will not get to see. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My cabin is welcoming, especially the single bed that makes up
into a tropical-flowered sofa. It is small, and without a porthole
(I had requested the cheapest inside single), but so what. The
Independence has acres of deck space where I can relax and read and
watch flying fish.
</P>
<P>
   There is a closet more than ample for a week's casual wardrobe,
a desk-cum-dresser with good lighting, and a tiny bath with a round
tiled shower that might double as a goldfish pond. I add a touch of
romance to the decor by hanging my orchid lei, a gift upon
boarding, on the back of the door. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a nap, I set out to poke around the ship. The Independence
is an aging beauty _ built in 1951, 20,221 tons, 1,066 passengers _
with great bone structure. Two pink-and-purple leis are painted
around each stack. Interior spaces are modest, with comfortable
rattan furniture and bits of Hawaiiana _ graphics, artifacts and
historic photographs _ throughout. (But why, I wonder, does the
picture in my room illustrate and translate the word ``hapai'' _
``pregnant?'') There are pots of orchids here and there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My cabin is on the Ohana deck, the fifth of 10, counting down
from the top, which turns out to be very convenient indeed. It is
one deck below the Kamaaina deck, with its little theater space,
library, bar and lounges, and just above the Aloha deck, where the
gangplank is set. The Ohana buffet stands midship; the Ohana Club
bar (which has a generous happy hour) serves large drinks in
plastic cups, which can be taken out onto the spacious afterdeck,
with its small pool, one of two.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good place to meet other passengers, who seem to be
almost 100 per cent mainland Americans and mostly middle-aged.
(Many are couples, a few newly wed and a lot celebrating
anniversaries.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The captain's formal dinner, my first night aboard, is
surprisingly informal and lacking in glitz, with nary a sequin in
sight. To be sure, the captain is elegant in black tie, with a lei
of fragrant maile vine, while the kumu, the teacher or storyteller,
is regal in a purple silk shirt, a flower tucked behind his ear.
</P>
<P>
   I take my place at my assigned table for six, which I share with
two older women from Florida and a woman from Maine with her two
daughters. The menu this evening is typical, no foie gras or
caviar, but surprisingly good Pacific Rim food. The ingredients,
especially the seafood, are splendidly fresh and carefully
prepared, their exotic elements more rational than bizarre. (Yes,
lemongrass does add a perky note to tiger prawns, and a Kona coffee
glaze gives a little kick to meltingly tender rare roast lamb.)
</P>
<P>
   The servers, all of whom are Americans and most of whom seem to
be from the islands, manage to be both attentive and laid back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast, lunch and dinner are all served in the two (Orchid
and Hibiscus) dining rooms; the two earlier meals may also be put
together from a buffet on the Ohana deck, just a few steps from my
cabin. The breakfast selection is ample and varied, verging on
awe-inspiring, so I never make it downstairs (or whatever you call
it on a ship).
</P>
<P>
   I am happy filling my plate with, perhaps, fresh pineapple and
Portuguese sausage and biscuits with gravy and settling down on an
outdoor deck to eat it. The buffet lunch is themed, Italian one
day, Mexican the next _ but the dining room serves a daily and
delicious ``traditional Hawaiian plate lunch,'' something like
chicken shoyu or lau lau (meat wrapped up in taro and steamed in ti
leaves), with two scoops of rice and one of macaroni-potato salad _
the apotheosis of greasy-spoon food, and irresistible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to choose from among the more than 50 shore
excursions and activities, so I take the easy way out and book the
Deluxe Captain's Choice, six bus tours and a big commercial luau.
Since the buses _ which bear the delightful logo of a galloping
rabbit wearing a lei _ tend to leave in the morning, I forgo most
of the evening entertainment for an early bedtime. In fact, I do
not set foot in the Hoi Hoi Showplace until I perform there, of
which more later. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I see some spectacular scenery in the course of the next few
days, from the red-striped Waimea Canyon on Kauai to the spiky,
mist-enclosed pinnacles of Maui's Iao Valley and the lava beds of
Volcano National Park on Hawaii, but there is also a lot of good
man-made stuff.
</P>
<P>
   On Maui, for example, there is the shiny new Ocean Center, with
its collection of endemic wrasses that come in colors that are
gaudy even for tropical fish, and the ruined fort in Lahaina that
proves that James Michener did not make up the
whalers-versus-missionaries wars. On the big island of Hawaii, just
outside Hilo, the Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden is my idea of
Eden.
</P>
<P>
   And a single trip out of Kona, on the big island, comprises a
visit to an ancient place of refuge and royal enclosure and a tiny
church, perhaps my favorite thing in the islands, where Father
Damien preached before he went to Molokai to minister to its leper
colony in 1873. This charming miniature, where a weekly
Hawaiian-language Mass is celebrated, is carpenter-Gothic outside
and inside entirely painted, by another Belgian priest, with faux
architecture and biblical and allegorical scenes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the course of my sightseeing, I acquire a large supply of
souvenirs without actually buying any, although there are plenty of
opportunities to shop. It is perhaps a requisite of the much
advertised ``aloha spirit'' of kindness and generosity, but
someone, a guide or shopkeeper or passer-by, is always giving you a
little gift or treat _ a soft drink or a chocolate-macadamia nut
bar here, a postcard or a refrigerator magnet there.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, I am slightly ashamed of myself for signing up for the
luau, held in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kaanapali, Maui _ how
touristy can you get? Well, plenty touristy, with a hokey
torch-lighting ceremony and a parade of the pit-cooked pig, and a
sleek show of pan-Polynesian dances.
</P>
<P>
   I love every minute of it (although the unlimited mai tais may
have helped). The pig is richly smoky, reminiscent of North
Carolina pulled-pork barbecue, the poi, although dull to the taste,
is a very pretty lilac color, and the dancers are adept and
beautifully costumed.
</P>
<P>
   The most exciting dance is a stomping, grunting Maori challenge
dance, with much thrusting out of the tongue. It is performed by
the remarkably wasp-waisted young man who, earlier on, put a shell
lei (tonight's little present) around my neck as I got off the bus.
He looks even handsomer with his face half-painted in tattoos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The show the next morning could not be more different. As we
sail into the harbor at Hilo, on the rainy side of the big island,
a troupe from a nearby senior-citizen center is waiting, as they
are every week. Those of us going on early excursions meet in the
Kamaaina Lounge, where two men with ukuleles play and sing Don Ho
songs (it is the only time on the trip that I hear ``Tiny
Bubbles''), and six women, two of them gray-haired, three of them
bespectacled and all with flowers in their hair, perform a decorous
hula.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, I return from a visit to the botanical garden,
in time for another amateur performance, this time by a group of
charming children from a well-regarded Hilo hula school. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Passengers _ or at least about a dozen of them, women, children
and one brave (and graceful) young man _ hula as part of the
graduation exercises that take place in the Hoi Hoi Showplace as
the voyage winds down. We have had a choice of classes in hula,
ukulele and something called ``Hawaiian implements,'' which turn
out to be an assortment of gourds, sticks and other rhythm
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   I choose the last, because it's clearly the easiest, and reminds
me of the fun I had in kindergarten band. My group goes on first _
the single man in our group leads us in, making amazing sounds on a
conch shell. We line up to play _ I have mastered the puili, two
joints of slivered bamboo that are struck together to produce a
jangling beat _ while the kumu chants. Then the hula class hulas,
accompanied by the ukulele graduates playing ``Little Grass
Shack.'' The audience is generous in its applause. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the voyage, the kumu, a man of imposing size and
voice, has given talks on history and mythology and made himself
available to answer questions. He comes into his own the night we
sail from Hilo to Kona, passing close to shore to view the fiery
pit and glowing lava flow of Kilauea Volcano. There, on the
afterdeck, he intones the story of Madame Pele, the fire goddess,
and the journey that brought her here. The flashbulbs that explode
from all sides seem a manifestation of the gods. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost every night aboard has a theme _ paniolo (cowboy)
evening, with line dancing, or the '50s and '60s evening with a
sock hop _ which one may honor or ignore. It is Polynesian night
when we pass the volcano, and almost everyone has dressed in newly
acquired tropical prints, with flower leis or headbands. We look
really pretty. The evening ends with a gala buffet in which ice
sculpture is elevated to a fine art. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The leis come into play again the next evening, our last on
board, when we gather to weave them together into a chain that
crosses and recrosses the deck. We carry them to the rail, where
they are gathered up and thrown overboard. Tradition has it that if
your lei floats back to shore, you will return to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Night is falling fast, as it does in the tropics, and no matter
how hard I peer into the gathering dark, I am unable to see what
direction our flowery little island is taking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Debarking at Honolulu, I have time for one last tour, a visit to
the Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbor. It is heartbreaking. After a
terrifying movie of the attack of Dec. 7, 1941, assembled from both
Japanese and American sources, the visitors board a Navy launch to
be ferried to the memorial itself.
</P>
<P>
   Eerily, for a boat full of normally chatty tourists, you can
hear a pin drop. The austere white structure that intersects the
sunken ship beneath it gleams in the light; inside, an orientation
table identifies the wreckage visible at water level.
</P>
<P>
   The back wall is inscribed with the names of the more than 1,000
crewmen whose bodies rest below; an oil slick spreads out across
the sea from the sunken battleship, and will probably continue to
do so for centuries. Among the floral offerings at the wall of
honor is a rainbow of origami flowers, left by students of a
Japanese high school.

CANDIDATES MAKE FINAL PLEAS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KEENE, N.H. _ Presidential candidates blitzed across New
Hampshire in a final flurry before the nation's first primary
Tuesday. Republican John McCain predicted victory while George W.
Bush, the front-runner turned possible runner-up, spent Monday
sledding and bowling.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley also kept campaigning to a
minimum Monday. Gore, who has evaporated Bradley's early lead in
polls, handed out coffee at a diner and greeted Lockheed workers.
Bradley worked hard to establish optimism among his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the senator from Arizona who has staked the survival of
his presidential campaign on a win in New Hampshire, clutched the
latest tracking polls that give him as much as a 10-point lead over
the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident of victory tomorrow night, although we may be
up a little late,'' the Arizona senator told about 150 people on
the Keene town square, freshly covered from an overnight snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   Various polls of Republican voters in New Hampshire all give
McCain a lead, from as little as 1 percentage point to as many as
11 percentage points over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, apparently concerned his confidence would sway his
supporters to stay home, urged voters at his four other campaign
stops scattered across the Granite State that their presence was
sorely needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We win tomorrow night, and the message is going to be sent
from New Hampshire to America and the world that we're going to
give the government back to the people of the United States, take
it out of the hands of the special interests, the big money
people,'' he said at his Keene rally.
</P>
<P>
   Bush addressed employees of the New Hampshire Department of
Safety and Blue Cross Blue Shield before noon Monday, then
conducted TV interviews and enjoyed the sunny, snowy day.
</P>
<P>
   At breakfast, Bush flipped pancakes with some of his rivals.
Later, he hopped on an innertube sled in Amherst with a pair of
13-year-old twins and hurtled downhill backward, legs akimbo, pants
legs flapping up to expose his out-of-place cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the man play. He's been working hard,'' one teen-age boy
yelled at the throng of reporters surrounding Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush portrayed tube sledding as a metaphor for his overall
campaign for the GOP nomination rather than any possible result of
the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel everything is downhill from here. I feel optimistic. I
feel exhilarated,'' Bush said. ``As we went downhill, one of these
girls said the faster we go the more likely we are to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush canceled a street-walking tour of Exeter after his staff
learned that about 20 people advocating legalization of marijuana
were awaiting him there.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates were struggling for attention and Gary Bauer
got some he might have wished he hadn't. At the presidential
pancake-flipping event, Bauer flipped a pancake into the air, and
backing up to catch it, fell off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer recovered, holding up the pan and pancake and declared,
``I'm a survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, flipped his pancake high in the air and
caught it on a spatula while hecklers shouted and waved.
</P>
<P>
   But ``people don't just want a nice smile, and a nod and wink.
They want something real,'' declared magazine mogul Steve Forbes
who has used his relentless attacks on Bush's conservative
credentials to secure a second-place finish in Iowa, and establish
hopes for a third-place showing in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done for most of the campaign, Forbes directed his
criticism primarily at Bush. He said the Texas governor has
proposed inadequate tax and education proposals and has not
addressed health care and Social Security reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats shored up their support across the state as well
as the various polls showed Gore leading Bradley by anywhere from 3
percentage points to 12 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent Monday stopping at diners and workplaces to shake
hands with voters, hand out cups of coffee and sign autographs. He
greeted factory workers at Nashua's Lockheed Sanders, visited with
patrons at a diner in Tilton and an Italian restaurant in Concord,
and then stopped in at his campaign headquarters in Manchester to
help telephone undecided voters.

GROUP SUES OVER LAW LIMITING TRUCK TRAFFIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group representing about 3,000 of the United States' largest
trucking companies sued New Jersey in federal court Monday, saying
that a state regulation banning interstate trucks from local roads
violates the Constitution's protection of interstate commerce and
will lead to arbitrary traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   In July the state Department of Transportation issued a rule
prohibiting large trucks that are not making a pickup or delivery
inside New Jersey from traveling on roads that are not part of the
National Highway System. In New Jersey the system consists of all
the interstate highways, the New Jersey Turnpike and several state
roads that link them.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks based in New Jersey are exempt from the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman directed her transportation commissioner,
James Weinstein, to issue the ban after years of complaints from
residents and local officials that big trucks are dangerous, noisy
and dirty and take a heavy toll on roads.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ban was imposed six months ago, tickets have not
been issued. Officials said Mrs. Whitman signed a bill on Jan. 13
providing penalties of up to $400 for a first offense, after it was
approved unanimously by both houses of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties must be added to police summons books before
ticketing begins. In the meantime, the police are redirecting
trucks onto authorized roads, said Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman
for Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Trucking Association, which filed the suit
Monday in U.S. District Court in Newark, says the ban violates the
clause of the Constitution that bars states from interfering with
interstate commerce, as well as the equal protection clause,
because it treats trucks based in New Jersey differently from those
based outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also claims the ban cannot be enforced legally, because
a police officer has to pull a truck over to learn whether it has
business in New Jersey. ``To enforce the regulations, local police
must inevitably make decisions to stop and detain individual
restricted vehicles on local New Jersey roads without probable
cause,'' the suit asserts.
</P>
<P>
   The association's state affiliate, the New Jersey Motor Truck
Association, has remained neutral on the ban. ``It doesn't affect
the people we represent,'' said Sam Cunninghame, its executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, because states can decide which of their roads are
part of the national highway system, Cunninghame said he was
lobbying the state to expand the system to include state Routes 1,
17 and 130, all north-south arteries. He is waiting for a meeting
to be scheduled with Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   John Dourgarian, a spokesman for the Transportation Department,
said, ``Certainly we could meet with the group, but at this point I
don't think we're inclined to add to the national network in New
Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Dourgarian said the state was well within its rights to impose
the ban, which has reduced truck traffic by as much as 30 percent
on some roads. ``The U.S. Department of Transportation advised us
last summer that the DOT had the authority to regulate truck
traffic on non-national highways,'' he said, referring to the state
agency. ``We feel quite strongly that the law does not impact
interstate commerce, because we're providing a good system of roads
for truckers to use.''

DUCKS RUN GOOD, BAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike the Los Angeles Kings, who are playing hard but losing to
just about everyone, the Anaheim Mighty Ducks seem to beat good
teams but get embarrassed by the lousy ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have victories over St. Louis, Detroit and Phoenix,
each at a point in the season when those teams were leading the NHL
in points. They have road wins over Toronto and Colorado, both
division leaders. And, they have three victories over the defending
Stanley Cup-champion Dallas Stars, a team that has beaten the Kings
22 straight times.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Ducks lost to the lowly New York Islanders, who had
dropped their previous seven.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray has been disappointed with his team's
results but pleased with the effort. Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg
can't say the same. If both aren't careful, they could find
themselves out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``(A coach) can scream and yell, but sooner or later, it has to
come from the players,'' Hartsburg said. ``This league is about
players being hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have lost twice to last-place Montreal and once to
Tampa Bay, which is just three points ahead of expansion Atlanta in
the Southeast Division. They also have tied Chicago (last in the
Central) and Vancouver (last in the Northwest).
</P>
<P>
   And, they lost at home to Boston and Buffalo during stretches
when the those teams were slumping badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating when your team is playing great against
the great teams but playing so bad against the not-so-good teams,''
Teemu Selanne said. ``Those points against Dallas and Detroit and
St. Louis don't mean anything if you don't win games like (the
Islanders).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fit to be tied: If the Kings season comes down to a point or
two, they can look at their inability to win in overtime as one of
the problems.
</P>
<P>
   They entered Monday night's game with the Islanders with 52
points, tied with Calgary for seventh. The Kings, however, are
0-7-3 in overtime compared to the Flames, who have a record 10 OT
victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames have done it despite being the lowest-scoring team in
the Western Conference. But they have taken a different philosophy
than other teams, which have become conservative after new rules
gave clubs one point for a tie in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary, led by the exciting Valeri Bure, has the speed to take
chances. Bure and All-Star defenseman Phil Housley have five points
apiece in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other teams know our record in overtime and they start
thinking, `Jeez, we can't give them anything in OT,' so they start
sitting back, and it allows us carry the puck,'' Jason Wiemer said.
``Bure and Housley are not going to give the puck up unless you
force them. They bring one or two guys to them and that creates an
opening for everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   One team that is watching is Edmonton, which began Monday two
points ahead of the Kings and Flames. The Oilers were 0-7-13 in OT
before finally beating Vancouver last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we know how Calgary is doing in overtime,'' Edmonton's
Mike Grier said. ``But we're trying not to get caught up in just
looking at them.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Stranded: There are plenty of worse places to be than the
Embassy Suites in Cary, N.C., but it's hard to convince the Phoenix
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived there last Monday, just hours before the beginning
of a snowstorm that dumped a record 20.3 inches on the area. The
next morning, everything was closed, including the airport. The
Coyotes' game with the Carolina Hurricanes was cancelled, as was
Wednesday's game in Atlanta because they couldn't get out of town.
</P>
<P>
   They were able to practice a little, however, shuttling five or
six players at a time to the arena in four-wheel-drive vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Embassy Suites, with more than 400 guests _
including a convention of pharmaceutical people who had already
been there for two weeks _ ran short of supplies and had a skeleton
crew working 40 straight hours and sleeping on the premises. The
hotel chef told the Coyotes they couldn't cook the team's requested
menu of chicken, pasta, brown and white rice, salad and salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard they ran out of beer, too,'' goaltender Sean Burke
said. ``Heck, we were ready to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix finally played Thursday afternoon and beat the
Hurricanes 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Montreal Canadiens might have had it worse. After
their game Monday night against the Hurricanes, they were stuck in
nearby Chapel Hill for the next three days. They never practiced
and were forced to cancel Thursday night's game in Boston when
their plane froze and wouldn't start. &QL;

   When Washington defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 2-0 on Sunday,
it gave the Capitals the longest unbeaten streak (10-0-1) in the
NHL this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ollie Kolzig made his 17th consecutive start and earned his
third shutout of the season for the Caps. It was the fifth by
Washington in the last 31 games after having none the first 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Caps, a playoff long shot at the beginning of the season,
are just five points behind the Flyers for the fourth playoff spot.
They are 15-4-5 at home after winning just 16 all last season. They
have allowed 50 goals in 25 home games _ the fewest in the
conference _ and have not allowed more than two goals in a home
game since Nov. 19 (14 games).

   TONY THE TIGER
</P>
<P>
   Former King Tony Granato, now with San Jose, must have forgotten
about the blood clot in his head four years ago that threatened his
career and nearly his life.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe when you're 5-10, 185 in a land of 6-5 speedskaters,
you know you can never let up. Just a week after giving the Kings
Mattias Norstrom 30 stitches with a cross check to the mouth,
Granato elbowed Colorado's Alexei Gusarov in the face, resulting in
a concussion and two lost teeth. Both plays were reviewed by NHL VP
Colin Campbell, who ruled they did not warrant a suspension.

   RUSSIAN RIDDLE
</P>
<P>
   When Detroit comes to the Staples Center on Thursday, make sure
to watch Sergei Fedorov. Despite injuries and a recent 11-game
scoring drought, he is critical to the Red Wings playoff chances.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov had 20-plus points for four consecutive postseasons from
1995-98 when the Red Wings played three Cup finals and the Western
Conference final. In last year's playoffs, he was dominated by
Peter Forsberg in a second-round loss to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   With just 11 goals and 31 points, Fedorov seems to make more
news about his cooling romance with tennis star Anna Kournikova,
who also has been seen with Florida's Pavel Bure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DECISIONS DECISIONS
</P>
<P>
   Before the March 14 trade deadline, the Panthers have to decide
what to do with veteran Rob Niedermayer, who was the Panthers'
first-ever draft pick taken as the fifth overall selection in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Florida obviously wants to go far in the playoffs, but
Niedermayer is in the final year of a $6.1 million contract, a deal
that pays him $2.3 million this season. Niedermayer also can become
a restricted free agent this summer. For the Panthers to retain his
rights, they must offer him at least a 10 percent raise by July 1.
He is seventh on the team in scoring and eighth in goals with
eight, although four are game winners.

CRIMINAL PROBE LOOKS AT MAINTENANCE OF MD-80S 
</HEADLINE>
   (Resending to fix date in 2nd graf.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The MD-80 has been a workhorse of Alaska Airlines'
fleet, taking the carrier's passengers up and down the West Coast
for years. It also has been at the center of a criminal
investigation into Alaska Airlines maintenance and a long-running
controversy over fumes in the passenger cabin.
</P>
<P>
   John Liotine, an Alaska lead mechanic in Oakland, Calif., set
the criminal investigation into motion in October 1998 when he
contacted an inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Records released under the Freedom of Information Act last year
showed that Liotine complained that an Alaska supervisor filled out
a post-maintenance checklist on an MD-80 even though he wasn't
qualified to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska repairs its 39 MD-80s at the Oakland maintenance
facility.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that initial contact by Liotine:
</P>
<P>
   -- A criminal investigation has been under way involving a
federal grand jury in San Francisco, the FBI, the U.S.
Transportation Department and the U.S. Attorney's Office. No
charges have been filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   -- The FAA has recommended that the mechanic's licenses of three
Alaska supervisors in Oakland be revoked for making false entries
on records.
</P>
<P>
   -- The FAA also proposed a $44,000 fine against Alaska. An
agency inspector in Oakland originally proposed an $8.7 million
fine. But FAA lawyers determined that top Alaska executives weren't
involved, so the size of the proposed fine was reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which has been the subject of news reports
for months, focuses on two MD-80s, including one in which a manager
allegedly released a plane for service with its throttle set
improperly.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA inspector in Oakland concluded that the two MD-80 jets
were flown 844 times from Oct. 7, 1998, through Jan. 19, 1999, ``in
an unairworthy condition'' because portions of records that
document maintenance hadn't been filled out.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has said that the alleged violations involved only
record-keeping and that the jets were safe to fly.
</P>
<P>
   What first caused Liotine to act was the signing of a checklist
by a manager he believed was unqualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant driving force in this endeavor has been the
downward trend among the ranks of maintenance personnel and this
management team with respect to actual work experience in the
performance of the duties entrusted to them,'' Liotine wrote in a
statement to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote that corrective action in the company for these
problems was lacking, as was ``interest by our management to
honestly deal with these causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Liotine's whistle-blowing cost him his post of president of a
local chapter of the mechanics' union. Other union members recalled
him from his post last year, and a letter from a union committee
that backed his recall cited his involvement in the criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska also put Liotine on leave with pay in September. The
company cited the investigation as well as ``the strains on the
existing operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The MD-80 also has been the source of dozens of complaints about
air quality in the cabin. For a decade, Alaska flight attendants
have blamed a range of maladies _ headaches, goiters, tremors and
lost mental abilities _ on what they believe are toxic fumes.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of the hundreds of complaints focus on the
MD-80. The airline also flies Boeing 737s.
</P>
<P>
   Several flight attendants are too sick to work, and others have
been put on reduced duties.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and company investigations have yet to pinpoint a source
of the problems. Because of the difficulty in connecting illnesses
to the planes, flight attendants have generally failed in their
attempts to get worker's compensation.

   LOS ANGELES _ An Alaska Airlines jetliner bound from Mexico to
San Francisco crashed into the Pacific Ocean northwest of Malibu on
Monday afternoon with 85 people aboard, after reporting mechanical
difficulties. Coast Guard boats, rescue helicopters and a Navy
search plane scoured the choppy waters for several hours into the
winter twilight, and found several bodies, but no survivors so far,
the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The jet, an MD-83 headed from the Mexican beach resort of Puerto
Vallarta, had reported mechanical difficulties and requested
permission to land at Los Angeles International Airport, Ron
Wilson, a spokesman for San Francisco International Airport, told a
local television station there.
</P>
<P>
   But at about 3:45 p.m., the plane, Alaska Airlines Flight 261,
was reported down in the ocean off the Naval Air Station at Point
Mugu, according to Mitch Barker, a regional spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   An Alaska Airlines spokesman told reporters at Los Angeles
International Airport on Monday evening that the pilots had radioed
to report a problem with the plane's stabilizer trim, a device that
helps control the horizontal stabilizing mechanism that governs the
pitch of the plane's nose. The MD-80 has no history of such
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson reported that radar indicated that the plane fell from
17,000 feet and then was lost from radar screens. Skies were clear
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The plane came down about 20 miles northwest of Los Angeles
International Airport, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell, local television stations offered live coverage
of search helicopters hovering over scattered pieces of debris and
a spreading fuel slick on the deep blue water about 12 miles
offshore, where water temperatures are typically in the low 50s at
this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   As temperatures cooled, and searchlights played across the 10-
to 12-foot swells, fog began to roll into the area between the
California coast and the Channel Islands, complicating search
efforts, which drew Coast Guard craft from as far away as San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of relatives were whisked away to a VIP lounge at San
Francisco International Airport by airline officials. Clergy were
reported to be on the way to the airport to offer counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening the Coast Guard ordered private craft that
had sailed into the area to stay away from the debris field, to
prevent confusion in search and rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said in a telephone interview on ``Larry King Live'' on CNN
that a ``Go-Team'' from the agency was scheduled to leave the East
Coast about 2 a.m. Tuesday to begin its investigation of the crash,
and was already considering whether to call for additional Coast
Guard ships from Hawaii for possible salvage efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're just trying to gather information,'' Hall
said.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 is a seven-day-a-week flight from Puerto Vallarta to
San Francisco. It is scheduled to leave at 3:30 p.m. and arrive at
5:05 p.m. It was then to continue to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The plane that usually flies the route is an MD-80 or an updated
model like the MD-82, which has two engines attached to the
fuselage near the tail. The models first entered service in 1980,
and depending on configuration, usually carry 144 to 152
passengers. About 1,170 of them have been built.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83, a two-engine craft with engines on the tail, is the
successor to the McDonnell-Douglas DC-9, and like the Boeing 737 is
frequently used on midrange flights. The jet was built less than
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Evans, an Alaska Airlines spokesman in Seattle, said the
plane in question had completed 14,350 cycles of takeoffs and
landings. The craft had more than 26,000 hours of flying time.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines has built a successful business and a strong
safety record operating north-south routes that serve more than 40
cities in Canada, Alaska, Mexico and states up and down the Pacific
Coast. The downed flight was to have stopped in San Francisco and
continued to Seattle, the carrier's corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The airline had two fatal accidents in the 1970s, both in
Alaska, according to Airsafe.com, a Web site that tracks plane
crashes. In 1971 an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727 approaching Juneau
crashed into a mountain slope after the crew had received
misleading navigational information. All 104 passengers and seven
crew members were killed. In 1976 one passenger was killed when a
727 overran a runway in Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
   The crash is the first for a U.S. commercial airline involving
fatalities since an American Airlines MD-82 crashed in Little Rock,
Ark., last June 1, killing 11 people including the pilot, as the
pilot attempted to land in a heavy storm.

 &HT;    NFL linebacker arrested for murder in post-Super Bowl slayings
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Ray Lewis, a middle linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens
football team, was arrested Monday and charged with murder in
connection with a double homicide in the Buckhead section of
Atlanta hours after the Super Bowl, said Atlanta police spokesman
Officer John Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in our custody,'' Quigley said Monday night. He could not
say where Lewis is being held, whether the charges were for more
than one count of murder, or whether any other person had been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   A Lincoln Navigator stretch limousine and its driver are also
keys to the Atlanta police's investigation of the fatal stabbings
of two Decatur, Ga., men.
</P>
<P>
   Officers and detectives involved in the double murder
investigation said Lewis was inside the black stretch limousine
that roared away from the spot where Jacinth Demarus ''Shorty''
Baker, 21 and Richard Dameco Lollar, 24, both originally from
Akron, Ohio, were killed early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the arrest, Lewis and his agents denied any wrongdoing on
his part.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis confirmed to the Baltimore Sun on Monday night that he was
questioned by Atlanta police, but said he was told he could go. He
had been scheduled to fly to Hawaii this morning for Sunday's Pro
Bowl. ``I cooperated fully (with police),'' he said. ``As far as
the situation, I have no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, 21, and Lollar, 24, were stabbed several times as they
fought with a handful of men who were passengers in a stretch
Lincoln Navigator limousine with Maryland plates, police in the
Buckhead precinct said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker was a sketch artist looking to get into art school, Lollar
was a barber who moved to Atlanta two years
</P>
<P>
   ago.
</P>
<P>
   Police were searching for six men who fled the lounge in a
limousine. Witnesses said the men in the limousine were involved in
an argument with the victims and fired at least five gunshots as
they drove away. Although shots were fired, Baker and Lollar died
of multiple stab wounds, accourding to the Fulton County Medical
Examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta homicide Lt. Mike Smith said detectives are seeking any
witnesses who may have seen the 4 a.m. altercation that ended at
the corner of East Paces Ferry Road and Grandview Avenue in
Buckhead Village. Smith said it started at the Cobalt Lounge, also
located on East Paces Ferry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want anyone who saw this to please come forward,'' Smith
said Monday afternoon. ``We just want to question anyone who may
have seen anything or heard anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The intersection where the blood of both men stained the street,
is flanked by outdoor cafes, galleries and upscale apartment
complexes. On an early morning drive along East Paces Ferry Road,
one is treated to joggers in colorful outfits, business people with
cups of coffee in their hands and merchants starting their workday
at small shops and boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt Barnes Jr., an agent for Lewis, said Monday evening he
did not believe his client was directly involved in the fatal
altercation. Ravens owner Art Modell agreed: ``I don't believe he
had anything to do with it. I'm going to give Ray the benefit of
the doubt and defend him until something is proven otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis became the NFL's highest-paid linebacker in November 1998
when he signed a four-year, $26 million contract, which included a
$7 million signing bonus. Lewis is scheduled to stand trial in
Baltimore County next month for assaulting a woman in a Baltimore
bar on Dec. 6, 1999. A Ravens official said the team is concerned
about the crowd Lewis associates with. He said management had
expected to meet with Lewis when he returned from the Pro Bowl next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the team officials's statement, Lewis replied: ``The
devil is always busy, always after God's children. He wants to get
you, one way or another. It's something I will discuss with (the
Ravens) at the proper time. I can't speak about it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A big break in the case came just a couple of hours after the
killings when detectives found the stretch limousine behind a
Holiday Inn on Peachtree Road near Lenox Mall. Homicide detectives
spent most of the day talking to the driver of the luxury sedan,
but they would not provide details concerning those conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called to the hotel after someone told them a man
with bloodstains on his clothing had gotten out of the Lincoln
Navigator limousine and entered a bathroom in the hotel lobby to
wash off, officers at the scene said.
</P>
<P>
   The slayings are the second in two weeks along East Paces Ferry
Road in the heart of the city's entertainment district. The
killings, as well as street fights and the hit-and-run death of a
34-year-old woman in 1998, have prompted Buckhead activists to
repeatedly ask the City Council to pass legislation that would
close the bars before 4 a.m.

Maybe something was in the air when Matt Bullard got up _ yes, he
confirmed, he did elevate _ and violently smacked back a Glen Rice
shot. Or perhaps it was evident moments later when Kobe Bryant went
through his typical gyrations only to be denied by Kelvin Cato
inside.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But if any of the first seven blocked shots of the afternoon did
not drive the point home, Cato did with No. 8, slapping back a
Shaquille O'Neal drive and giving the Rockets their final push
through the homestretch of Sunday's upset of the Los Angeles
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   There were the usual moments of O'Neal dominance inside. And
Bryant and Steve Francis traded NBC-friendly slams, with Francis
adding a spectacular reverse around Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   But if conversation at Super Bowl parties Sunday drifted to the
Rockets' win that afternoon, the talk undoubtedly was of the block
party Cato and the Rockets enjoyed before the dip was served that
night.
</P>
<P>
   It was not idle chatter, either. A day later, the Rockets said
the blocked shots were indicative of their renewed emphasis on
defense and the rehabilitation of their best shot-blockers, Cato
and Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blocked shots, people have to talk about more,'' said
Olajuwon, the NBA's all-time leader in the category. ``When you
have a shot-blocker in the lane, it creates a whole different
scenario for your opponent. They feel his presence. They know
you're there. They don't see you. But they know that you're around.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's no shot-blocker around, the door is open. They
can go in any time. When you have a shot-blocker in the lane, the
door is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his struggles to regain his conditioning since his
return from the injured list, Olajuwon has been blocking shots from
the day he stepped back on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Since rejoining the team, he has averaged 2.25 blocked shots per
game, which would rank eighth in the league. But it is a more
impressive figure considering he has played an average of just 18.6
minutes in his eight games back.
</P>
<P>
   Cato has come back slowly from a sprained right wrist. But in 35
minutes over the past two games, he has blocked seven shots.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the value of denying an opponent a basket, the Rockets
say the blocked shots have offered the same sort of emotional lift
that comes with a spectacular offensive move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve does some fantastic things on the offensive end,''
Bullard said. ``On the defensive end, the most fantastic thing you
can do is block a shot. The crowd gets fired up. It's fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does a lot for us emotionally. It solidifies our defense. I
can't think of anybody else in the league that can block Shaq's
shot like that, so it was really a big emotional lift for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It also serves to boost the confidence of teammates forced to
defend highlight-makers on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, I told Dream (Olajuwon) he was helping me out a lot
when I was forcing Kobe to go to the middle and pushing Ron Harper
to the middle,'' Francis said. ``I just want him to be there to put
that fear in their heart if they bring it in there. They're either
going to get it blocked or get fouled.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich: ``It's a big psychological
boost. You have confidence you can get up and pressure somebody. If
you make a mistake and the guy gets by you, there's an eraser back
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychological effect on the opposition is often even
greater. But the Lakers did not get shy. And Cato was careful not
to sound as if he was gloating, knowing a rematch is coming at the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have to see Shaq one more time,'' he said. ``There
might not be any more blocks after that. He might get that shoulder
and put me in the basket a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   But on one Sunday drive, Harper shied away from Olajuwon and
left his shot off the backboard short. And there is no telling how
many drives never come because of the threat of a shot-blocker
waiting inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``A blocked shot is a demoralizing deal,'' Tomjanovich said.
``When you've got somebody in there that slaps something back, it
doesn't matter if it's on a big guy or a small guy. It's not only a
physical barrier that's there; it becomes invisible. There's an
image that, `Well, I can't take this in there.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' eight blocks Sunday aside, Olajuwon and Cato
sounded more proud of shots they altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blocking shots is intimidating,'' Cato said. ``If you block
two or three shots, they stop coming. And if they don't stop
coming, you keep trying to block them. If you don't get in foul
trouble and everything is going right, it's pretty fun out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon said changing shots, rather than blocking them, is
really the more important part of his ``closed door'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a key to defense,'' he said. ``When you have a
shot-blocker in the lane, it's a whole different game.''
</P>
<P>
   If the idea is to remind that a shot-blocker could be waiting in
the lane, the thought is never far away in Compaq Center. A plaque
there honoring Olajuwon as the NBA's all-time block leader speaks
louder than any scouting report.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a reminder,'' Olajuwon said. ```He's still here.'''
</P>
<P>
   And though such things don't come quickly, Cato adds: ``I need
to get one of those.''

JACKSON WON'T BLAME TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Coach Phil Jackson said neither the Lakers'
offense nor the players were to blame for Glen Rice's lack of
scoring opportunities Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rice clearly was irritated about a lack of touches after taking
just one shot in the second half as the Lakers lost at Houston.
Jackson's offense doesn't rely on many designed plays, so the
players themselves dictate ball distribution most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe his teammates weren't looking for him?
</P>
<P>
   ``In recalling the situation, I don't remember anything that was
specific about that,'' Jackson said Monday, then quickly added,
``Maybe he didn't deserve any more shots, he was having trouble
putting it in anyway. But I didn't find anything that was sitting
there for him, now that I think about watching that second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice missed the only shot he took in the second half and
finished 1 for 7. His irritation isn't new. Rice frequently
grumbled about his role in the offense last season as well.
</P>
<P>
   In deference to Rice's streaky shooting, Jackson has at times
directed the offense to get him early opportunities and establish
his rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started the game off in that direction to see if Glen was
hot,'' Jackson said. ``He had what we consider an easy defensive
man (Walt Williams) playing him and it was a point of weakness on
the Houston team, but we couldn't take advantage of it. So that
hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Rice's scant opportunities late in the game, Jackson said,
``I don'tknow it it's a problem or not. I mean, it depends upon
what happens. If he's being played well enough, other people are
going to be open for shots. And those are the things that come with
the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Veiled threat: Jackson is concerned about a lack of intensity
among his players during their current 3-5 stretch, and he has an
idea why the energy is lacking _ ``but I'm not sharing it with
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a situation where we've got to have more
enthusiam about playing selfless basketball, which is a problem for
us. And being able to play through situational things that are
difficult on the floor. Sometimes we get mired into a game and it
looks like mental fatigue is the biggest problem we've got. We've
got too many worries by the end of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   As for how to snap the Lakers out of it, ``Maybe it's time for
us to start thinking about moving personnel out, who knows?''
Jackson said with a smile. ``Maybe we can't get anybody to play
together, we're just going to have to do it, but we're going to fix
it some way.''

BRAVE'S PITCHER ROCKER BANNED FROM PLAYING UNTIL MAY 
</HEADLINE>

new 11th graf and to clarify material in 15th graf)  (DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Commissioner Bud Selig, saying John Rocker had
dishonored Major League Baseball by disparaging many groups of
society with his harsh comments in a magazine interview, suspended
the Atlanta Braves' No. 1 relief pitcher Monday for 73 days,
marking the first time a baseball player has been disciplined for
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The players' union said that it would file a grievance
challenging the suspension and suggested that the disciplinary
action was a public relations move.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said that Rocker could not participate in spring training
with the Braves, a 45-day period, and could not play during the
first 28 days of the season. The commissioner also fined Rocker, a
25-year-old Georgian, $20,000 and ordered him to undergo
sensitivity training.
</P>
<P>
   Under baseball practice, Rocker will not lose any of his salary
while he is suspended. He has yet to sign his contract for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major League Baseball takes seriously its role as an American
institution and the important social responsibility that goes with
it,'' Selig said in a statement. ``We will not dodge our
responsibility. Rocker should understand that his remarks offended
practically every element of society and brought dishonor to
himself, the Atlanta Braves and Major League Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who initially gained notoriety by lashing out at Mets
fans during the National League Championship Series last October,
expanded his target group in a Sports Illustrated article last
month. He disparaged an assortment of foreign people _ ``I'm not a
very big fan of foreigners,'' he said, adding, ``How the hell did
they get in this country?''_ as well as gays and others. He also
called a black teammate ``a fat monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking about playing for a New York team, he said: ``Imagine
having to take the 7 train to the ball park, looking like you're
((riding through)) Beirut next to some kid with purple hair next to
some queer with AIDS right next to some dude who just got out of
jail for the fourth time right next to some 20-year-old mom with
four kids. It's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Marge Schott was the owner of the Cincinnati Reds in the
1990s, she was suspended more than once for her public statements
on blacks and Jews, but no player whom anyone could remember was
ever disciplined for words that he spoke. Players have been
suspended for drug abuse, and Dennis McLain, a well-known pitcher
for the Detroit Tigers, was suspended for the first half of the
1970 season for his relationship with gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker will not be permitted to begin formal preparation for the
season until April 3, when, he was informed, he could participate
in extended spring training and/or minor league activities. He
cannot play for the Braves until May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe it is appropriate that I should be harshly
disciplined for my misguided speech unaccompanied by any conduct on
my part,'' Rocker said in a statement released by his agents. ``I
have previously apologized for my unfortunate remarks and stand by
my apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker had previously been ordered to undergo psychological
evaluation under baseball's Employee Assistance Plan. The
announcement Monday said he had completed that evaluation but did
not provide additional information. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's remarks triggered an outcry from the Atlanta community
as well as Braves officials and players.
</P>
<P>
   As unpopular as Rocker's comments were, even with his own
teammates, the magnitude of the penalty is prompting the Players
Association to challenge it, Gene Orza, the union's associate
general counsel, said. A grievance would be heard by Shaym Das,
baseball's arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems fairly obvious to me,'' Orza said, ``that they
imposed this penalty in almost defiance of but certainly with an
eye toward the arbitration process. You wash your hands of it and
let others worry about the propriety of what you've done. I just
don't think they're going to fool anyone with what they're trying
to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that the Constitution's freedom of speech
provisions do not apply to private industry as they do to
government action, Orza said: ``Speech which harms the business is
subject to discipline. The question is whether the harm is real or
just a function of the belief. You have to actually demonstrate the
harm. Even assuming that, the magnitude of the penalty has to be
taken into account.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were quick to link Rocker's remarks to potential
economic harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a very difficult time for the Braves' front
office,'' Stan Kasten, the club's president, said at a news
conference in Atlanta. Saying the Rocker issue generated the most
calls and mail he could recall on a single issue, he added: ``It
has been difficult for us businesswise because all of these people
had strong feelings. It's been difficult for the sales department,
the promotions department, the community relations department.''
</P>
<P>
   John Schuerholz, the team's general manager, said Braves players
had expressed the view that if Rocker were ``suspended, punished in
some way, probably fined for his comments, they would be willing to
give him a second chance as a teammate. They would be willing to
see him get a chance to redeem himself.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first players who criticized Rocker publicly was Tom
Glavine, an Atlanta pitcher, who is the union's National League
player representative. He might have been one of the people Orza
had in mind when he said, ``Even the people who are offended by
what Rocker said should see the stakes in this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All players,'' Orza added, ``who work in an industry that
encourages them and sometimes insists that they talk to the press
have a stake at not being penalized for pure speech unaccompanied
by bad conduct, particularly when the penalty for that pure speech
is as enormous as this one has been.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick I. Herzberg, a psychologist who became one of the most
influential management teachers and consultants of the post-World
War II era, died in Salt Lake City on Jan. 19 from a heart attack
and injuries sustained in a related fall, according to Mark
Herzberg, his son. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Herzberg challenged assumptions that workers are motivated
primarily by money and other tangible benefits. He argued that
while low pay and uncomfortable working conditions could make
employees so dissatisfied that they would perform poorly, fixing
those problems was not enough to create effective labor forces. He
called such factors in worker satisfaction ``hygiene.''
</P>
<P>
   To truly motivate workers, Herzberg said, companies needed not
only to achieve acceptable hygiene levels but also to institute
practices that made people happy. His research pointed to elements
including work that lets employees feel they are achieving
something; makes workers responsible for particular tasks, and
allows them to work with minimal supervision. Recognition beyond
pay and advancement opportunities are also powerful motivators, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he started out calling job enrichment led to many of
today's theories about multiskill jobs and teamwork,'' said Jerome
Rosow, director of the Work in America Institute, a Scarsdale,
N.Y., research group. ``He was a major influence in the
re-evaluation of the importance of human resources.''
</P>
<P>
   That influence began to spread rapidly after publication in 1966
of Herzberg's best-selling book, ``Work and the Nature of Man.''
</P>
<P>
   He also frequently wrote articles in scholarly and popular
publications. ``One More Time, How Do You Motivate Workers?'' an
essay published in the Harvard Business Review in 1975, is the most
frequently reprinted article from that journal.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Irving Herzberg was born April 18, 1923, in Lynn,
Mass., the son of Gertrude and Lewis Herzberg, who had emigrated
from Lithuania. His father supported the family, which soon moved
to New York, by painting houses.
</P>
<P>
   Herzberg entered City College of New York in 1939, but
interrupted his studies to enlist in the Army. A patrol sergeant,
he was among the first American soldiers to arrive at the Dachau
concentration camp; he later said that the experience, as well as
his talks with ordinary Germans who lived near the camp, led to his
focus on motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Herzberg graduated from City College in 1946. He and his wife,
the former Shirley Bedell, whom he had married in 1944, moved to
the University of Pittsburgh where he gained master's degrees in
science and public health and a Ph.D. based on studies of
electric-shock therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Herzberg began focusing on workplace research in the 1950s while
teaching at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He moved
to the University of Utah in 1972, where he taught until his
retirement three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Herzberg consulted widely throughout his career, for
multinational corporate giants like AT&AMP;T as well as for both the
U.S. and foreign governments. He was among the first American
consultants to study workers in the Soviet Union and worked
extensively in Israel and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Herzberg's wife, Shirley, died in 1997. In addition to his son,
who resides in West New York, N.J., Herzberg is survived by his
sisters, Miriam Bernard and Pearl Zucker, both of Miami.

   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ It isn't easy being the vice president of the
United States, particularly when people don't believe you.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore had that experience Monday as he placed nearly two dozen
calls to voters to urge them to go to the polls on Tuesday for the
nation's first primary. Some people just accepted that the vice
president was phoning them. Others had a harder time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, it's Al Gore calling,'' the vice president told one woman
as he sat at a phone bank in his headquarters here. ``This is Al
Gore. No, it really is. I'm not joking. I'm calling from our
headquarters over here in Manchester. No, I'm not joking you. It
really is Al Gore. No, it's not a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman told him she thought he was her grandson Michael.
Laughing at her resistance, Gore finally asked her, ``How can I
prove it to you?''
</P>
<P>
   She asked him what her address was. He looked at the phone list
and told her. She asked him how many children she had. ``That I
don't know,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Gore asked to speak to her daughter, Mary. ``Mary,
hi, it's Vice President Al Gore. Your mom doesn't believe it's
really me. It's not Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking he had made some headway, he smiled, then looked
crestfallen as he said into the phone, ``No. This is Al Gore.''
Even Mary thought the voice on the other end of the line was that
of her prankster son.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, Gore was greeted with words of
encouragement by the woman who answered the phone. Then he asked to
speak to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm so sorry,'' he found himself saying. It turned out
that the woman's husband had died just the night before. But her
daughter was planning to take her to the polls anyway, to vote for
Gore.

ALONG CAME JONES TO MAKE THE TITLE-SAVING TACKLE 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By TOM JOLLY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coach Dick Vermeil of the Rams was already thinking overtime. So
was Titans quarterback Steve McNair.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of them thought linebacker Mike Jones was about to make
the play of his career, tackling Titans wide receiver Kevin Dyson 1
yard short of the end zone on the final play of Super Bowl XXXIV on
Sunday night, securing the Rams' 23-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' route to that moment was nearly as unusual as Rams
quarterback Kurt Warner's path to stardom. Jones was a running back
at the University of Missouri, and holds the school record for
receptions by a running back. But he was not drafted and he did not
become a National Football League-caliber player until he played
linebacker in the World League for a season. He signed with the
Raiders in 1992, and then came to the Rams as a free agent three
seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the Titans at the Rams' 10-yard-line, Jones said the
discussion was simple: ``There's six seconds left, they have to get
in the end zone. Keep them out and we win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   As he lined up at his spot on the left side, Jones said he
thought back to the touchdown the Titans' Eddie George had scored a
few moments earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, no matter who it is, I can't let him in the end
zone,'' he recalled thinking. ``We got a chance to win this game.
Get him on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had called for three-on-two coverage on the left side,
with Jones, cornerback Todd Lyght and safety Billy Jenkins assigned
to cover tight end Frank Wycheck and wide receiver Kevin Dyson.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson lined up on the outside, a step behind Wycheck, then went
in motion inside before turning and jogging back to the outside as
the ball was snapped. Wycheck ran downfield a step ahead of Dyson
as the play unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, though, the Titans presented Jones with an unexpected
wrinkle. Jones expected the bigger Wycheck to cut to the middle of
the field; instead the speedy Dyson suddenly darted inside.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson thought it was great strategy. ``I didn't think anybody
would be in the middle of the field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, for one, did not expect Dyson's move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking they're going to run the tight end on the inside
route,'' he said. ``But I guess they must have been studying our
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair's pass hit Dyson in stride at the 5, and for an instant,
he seemed to have a clear path to the end zone. McNair was sure
Dyson would get into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excitement you have and the positive attitude you have
when you get the ball into your guy's hands, he catches it and is
running, you expect him to score,'' McNair said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones reacted instantly. ``I saw him plant in the cut and I
broke in on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones reached out with his left hand, grabbing Dyson around the
waist and then fully grabbed him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dyson thought he could score. ``I didn't think he had a
good grip on me and I stretched out,'' he said. ``But I was just
short.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were champions, even if it was not quite the way Jones
had dreamed about.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dream of making the interception or the fumble or the sack
and taking it for a touchdown,'' he said. ``But not necessarily
tackling a guy to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he had to agree it was the biggest play of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won the Super Bowl,'' he said. ``So it had to be.''

   ATLANTA _ Four stadiums and seven years ago, the Tennessee
Titans last posted a winning season, that is, before this campaign
came to a spectacular, if losing, conclusion to the St. Louis Rams
in Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   Curling his lip defiantly Monday morning, Coach Jeff Fisher of
the Titans said: ``I believe this is a team that came from nowhere
and did things no one expected us to. Now it's a team that is
respected and will be perceived around the league as a contender
for some time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Even during the opening game this season, Fisher pointed out,
Titans quarterback Steve McNair was booed by his own fans for an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   McNair and his teammates went on to a 13-3 regular season and a
Super Bowl run that included a miraculous finish in one playoff
game and the heartbreaking 23-16 loss here to the Rams, with the
Titans 1 yard from the end zone and no time left.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on what impact this season will have, Fisher said,
``We kind of stamped the blueprint yesterday for what this team is
all about: we'll have to run the football.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Fisher talked of getting better production out of his
cornerbacks, he suggested that he did not believe in any major
changes and wanted his coaching staff back next season.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said the loss did not make him despondent, only more
resolute in finding ways to improve the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure this game was an exciting game,'' he said, ``if you
didn't care about the score.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop on the Mend
</P>
<P>
   Blaine Bishop of the Titans, who suffered a neck sprain in the
third quarter and was on the ground for 10 minutes before being
lifted onto a stretcher for X-rays and a CAT scan, said he felt
fine Monday as he left with the team. Bishop wore a neck collar and
said his only lingering effect was ``a nerve that was messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   The 203-pound strong safety attempted to tackle the 265-pound
tight end Ernie Conwell and instead crashed into him head first.
Bishop, who was knocked out on the play, said he asked to go back
into the game. But of course, he did not. Instead, he was sent to
the hospital for tests and returned before the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would make him `questionable' for next week,'' Coach Jeff
Fisher said Monday, cracking his only smile of the day.

TWO MEDIUM MARKETS PRODUCE ONE BIG RATING FOR SUPER BOWL
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the St. Louis-Tennessee Super Bowl match was set on Jan.
23, the assumption was that two medium-market upstarts with low
profiles would produce low television ratings. The notion held that
only large markets can turn Mr. Nielsen feverish.
</P>
<P>
   That supposition was turned on its head Sunday when the game
between St. Louis, the No. 21 market, and Nashville, the No. 30
market, produced a 43.2 Nielsen rating, up 7.5 percent from the
1998 and 1999 games and ahead of both Giants Super Bowls, in 1987
and 1991. Nielsen estimated that 130.7 million people watched at
least part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Great stories and great games produce great ratings, even when
the markets are not in the top 10 or 20. The appearance of Buffalo,
the No. 42 TV market, in four straight Super Bowls did not cause a
ratings mudslide; the 1993 game against Dallas produced a 45.5.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-game St. Louis-Milwaukee World Series in 1982, for
example, produced a 27.9 rating, the fourth best of the 1980s and
16 percent better than any Series in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl ratings have not tumbled like those of the rest of
prime-time _ or baseball _ as cable and other choices have
segmented viewing habits. They redefine sturdiness, which is why
National Football League TV rights cost so much and why networks
gross at least $150 million in ad sales on Super Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The heyday of Super Bowl ratings lasted from 1978 to 1986, when
the Nielsens peaked at a 49.1 (in 1982) and never fell below a 44.4
(in 1981).
</P>
<P>
   The highest since then was a 46.0, for San Francisco-San Diego
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   So it's clear that as fans grew more familiar with the Rams'
explosive offense and the improbable rise of their quarterback,
Kurt Warner, and came to appreciate the skills of Tennessee's Steve
McNair, Eddie George and Jevon Kearse, they found no reason to
watch the ``Matlock'' marathon on TBS instead of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And they were rewarded for sticking through three middling
quarters, because the fourth quarter made it one of the best of 34
Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been around the good teams of the '90s so often that you
really had to search to find something people didn't know about the
games,'' said ABC's Al Michaels, who called the game. ``It was
great to have fresh blood. This was like you were introducing these
teams to the country, like a debutante ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The ratings rose in each successive half-hour, starting with a
39.0 upon kickoff at 6:26 p.m. and culminating with a 46.9 from
9:30 to 10 p.m. (The only dip occurred for the halftime show, which
rated a 40.8.)
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis led all markets with a 55.6 rating, followed by
Nashville at a 50.3. The cities left behind by the Titans and Rams
did not boycott. Houston generated a 47.0 and Los Angeles a 37.8.
Memphis, where the Titans decamped in 1997 before moving to
Nashville, posted a 35.8.
</P>
<P>
   Millrose Next on Schedule
</P>
<P>
   Track and field is in a perpetual muddle: How can a sport so
popular at the Olympics _ and crucial to the broadcasts _ be such a
television afterthought the rest of the time?
</P>
<P>
   For Craig Masback, chief executive of USA Track and Field, there
is encouraging news, just not enough of it. Broadcast ratings for
its Golden Spike Tour of indoor and outdoor meets averaged a 1.7
last year; not great, but comparable to hockey, soccer and women's
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong coverage of the Adidas D.C. International on NBC
Saturday produced a 2.4 overnight rating, which means somebody's
watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``That beat the Senior Skins, auto racing and college
basketball,'' Masback said. Well, it tied the Senior PGA Skins Game
in its rating, but narrowly beat it in the share of TV households
watching at that time.
</P>
<P>
   But in its hour, the track meet never went head-to-head for long
with the Skins Game on ABC, the Kentucky-Miami college basketball
game on CBS, or the Indy Delphi Electronics 200 auto race on ABC.
Also, the meet led into NBC's National Basketball Association
doubleheader, while the Skins Game competed directly against it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the point is made. Track and field isn't dead. It is
dramatically underexposed and undersponsored. The impact of years
of lost opportunities can't be made up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who watch are upscale, educated and diverse,''
Masback said. ``But we don't have big investors willing to lose
$100 million over three years, like Major League Soccer. Now we're
in a situation where some sports that are better-heeled than us do
ratings lower than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Masback is hoping for a better fate for Saturday's Millrose
Games telecast (on NBC, from 2:30 to 3:30 p.m.) than for last
year's. The showing of Monica Lewinsky's deposition video at
President Clinton's impeachment trial pre-empted or delayed the
Millrose telecast last year, pushing the rating down to a slim 1.3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been and remains the world's best indoor track
meet,'' Masback said. ``To have it associated with USA Track and
Field is crucial to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the athletes entered in the meet, which takes place Friday
night at Madison Square Garden, are Maurice Greene, Ato Boldon, Jon
Drummond, Inger Miller and Carlette Guidry-White in the sprints;
Stacy Dragila and Lawrence Johnson in the pole vault; Joetta
Clark-Diggs in the 800-meter race; and William Tanui in the
Wanamaker Mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is what the other sports have done: develop
stars and try to tie the fortunes of the sponsors and advertisers
to the stars,'' Masback said.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila stars in a new Visa ad, and Marion Jones, the sprinter
who is likely to run in at least one Golden Spike outdoor meet, is
the star of new Nike and GMC Envoy TV spots.

POWER-SHARING IS IN PERIL, ULSTER UNIONIST WARNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to be more specific re time of delivery of documents and
sourcing in 3rd graf.)  
(mk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Northern Ireland's new power-sharing government could
be indefinitely suspended if an imminent report on disarmament does
not disclose moves by the Irish Republican Army to scrap its
arsenal, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble warned on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble made the comment against a background of near certainty
that the report by Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada, head of an
independent disarmament panel, would offer little evidence of IRA
willingness to give up its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The keenly awaited document was delivered to the British and
Irish governments just before midnight on Monday, a statement from
Britain's Northern Ireland office said early Tuesday, and they were
expected to spend some time examining it to see if there is
anything that could be construed as positive before making its
contents public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have the actions necessary to maintain confidence
in this process, then this process will go into abeyance _
temporarily, I hope,'' said Trimble, who is also first minister of
the Northern Ireland Assembly, which gained the power to govern
Ulster only two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the vexing problem of weapons emerging again as an obstacle
to political progress, there is a growing likelihood that, in order
to forestall a complete collapse of the fragile new government, a
coalition of Catholic republican and Protestant unionist parties,
Britain will have to reimpose the direct rule from London it
removed in December.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly and other new governmental bodies were set up under
the April 1998 settlement aimed at ending a conflict between rival
Catholic and Protestant paramilitary forces that led to the deaths
of more than 3,300 people in the past three decades. Putting the
terms of the accord into effect has become repeatedly deadlocked
over the issue of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has warned that though his party
is the political representative of the IRA, it cannot compel the
underground army to start turning over its weapons now. In response
to Trimble's warning, he said that if the government was suspended,
the IRA might never agree to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me that it would be very difficult to keep the IRA
in there if the institutions were removed,'' Adams said. IRA
representatives have been meeting with de Chastelain in what has
been the clandestine organization's first official involvement in
the political life of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Adams contended that this development and the fact that the IRA
has maintained a cease-fire for more than two years demonstrated
its commitment to peace. But Trimble said a ``clear promise'' for a
start to disarming by now had been given during the review
conducted last fall by George J. Mitchell, the former U.S. senator
and mediator of the Northern Ireland peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Trimble took the politically bold step of
persuading his Ulster Unionist party to drop its ``guns before
government'' insistence that the IRA must begin disarming before
the Ulster Unionists would enter government side by side with Sinn
Fein. To attract support for his decision to participate in the new
power-sharing administration, he vowed he would resign his
leadership of the assembly and his party if there were no
disarmament moves by the IRA by February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually jumped first and took a very substantial risk,''
Trimble said on Monday. ``It's time for other people to be as bold,
to take the same sort of risk we did, not to be hiding away.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble gained support from Seamus Mallon, the deputy first
minister of the assembly and a senior member of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, the province's largest Catholic
grouping. ``You have a responsibility to jump as well,'' he said,
speaking of Adams. ``You agreed to it, and the understanding was
clear in the Mitchell review. Decommissioning has got to be dealt
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble appears to be counting on the British to suspend the
Belfast government before a scheduled Feb. 12 meeting of the Ulster
Unionists' 860-member party council. Under present circumstances,
he could be forced to make good on his promise to step down. The
leading contenders to succeed him are opposed to the peace
settlement and would be less willing partners with Britain and
Ireland in trying to sustain the accord.

RACE AT ISSUE AS 5 DIALLO JURORS ARE SELECTED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Five jurors, including two black women, were
chosen Monday as jury selection began in the trial of four white
police officers accused of murdering Amadou Diallo, a West African
immigrant who was shot 19 times as he stood unarmed in the lobby of
his Bronx apartment building one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of the jurors came after a lengthy and contentious
discussion between the prosecution and the defense in which each
side accused the other of using race as a basis to remove potential
jurors from the pool.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had said it wanted to strike 10 jurors, 7 of
whom were white men, from a panel of 19 left at the day's end; the
defense said it wanted to strike 6 people, including 3 black women.
Each side is allotted a total of 20 peremptory challenges.
</P>
<P>
   In two decisions in 1986 and 1992, the Supreme Court ruled first
that prosecutors and then criminal defendants could not use race as
a basis to exclude jurors from serving.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Warner, the lead prosecutor for the case, said it was
inevitable that the prosecution would strike large numbers of white
jurors because Albany has a largely white jury pool. ``This is not
the Bronx,'' Warner told the judge as the issue went back and
forth. He labeled the defense's attempt to disqualify the black
women as ``blatantly discriminatory on race.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett M. Epstein, one of the lawyers for Officer Sean Carroll,
said they were seeking to remove one black woman because she had
lived in the Bronx in a neighborhood relatively near where Diallo
was killed, and the other two because they had had relatives
arrested on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   The sidebar concluded with Justice Joseph C. Teresi saying,
without elaborating on his reasoning, that he was going to seat two
of the three black women and that he was upholding all of the
challenges by the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   One of those reinstated by Teresi was a soft-spoken middle-aged
black woman who lived in the Parkchester section of the Bronx from
1973 to 1983. ``I've had absolutely no interaction with the police
whatsoever,'' the woman said. She was selected as jury forewoman
because she happened to be seated in the first chair in the jury
box.
</P>
<P>
   The others selected were a black woman in a wheelchair who said
a family member had once been convicted of a drug charge; an
elderly white woman whose husband is a lawyer and had once been an
FBI agent; a young white woman who said she had once been held up
at gunpoint in North Carolina; and a middle-aged white man who said
he was against the private ownership of handguns by anyone except
the police.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the case said they were surprised by the
rapid pace of jury selection. Defense lawyers used 4 of their 20
peremptory challenges, used to remove jurors without explanation,
one lawyer said, and prosecutors used 10 of their 20. It was not
possible to determine which side objected to which jurors because
they were removed in a private conference with Teresi. The judge
also excused 16 potential jurors because they said they did not
think they could be fair.
</P>
<P>
   The day began about 9 a.m. as the four grim-faced police
officers walked past demonstrators and reporters to make their way
into the Albany County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Carroll, one of the four, paused to wait for his wife
outside the courthouse and offered his condolences to the Diallo
family. ``I hope one day I'll be able to sit with the Diallos and
tell them I'm sorry about the loss of their son,'' he said.

MONEY ATTRACTS MONEY FOR RICH NEW JERSEY SENATE CONTENDER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ When he set out to run for the U.S. Senate from
New Jersey, Jon Corzine, a political novice with a reported net
worth of $300 million, vowed to spend as much on his campaign as he
needed to get elected. Apparently, he was not bluffing.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., paid
his top campaign workers salaries more typical of big business than
of grass-roots politics, en route to spending more than $3.6
million on his Senate campaign last year, according to records
filed with the Federal Election Commission on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1999, no nonincumbent had spent as much for a Senate race
in the year before an election, according to the Campaign Study
Group, a Virginia organization that monitors candidate spending.
But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, who spent $4.4 million last
year, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is believed to have spent
more than $3 million, appear with Corzine to be setting a new
benchmark in campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine hired two co-campaign managers, each at $20,000 a month,
a far more generous salary than the $150,000 a year that many
veteran campaign officials would consider themselves lucky to get.
He also hired a political director at $18,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   He paid $1.05 million for a roster of political consultants and
pollsters so long that it could be mistaken for an advertisement
listing all the underwriters of a Wall Street deal.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine lent his campaign $3.2 million himself last year, $2.65
million of that in the last six months. But even more noteworthy is
that he also managed to raise more than $1.4 million in donations
from other people. That sum exceeded the total, loans and all,
amassed by his only rival for the Democratic nomination, Jim
Florio, the former governor. What is more, most of Corzine's
contributions from others came in November and December, said Orin
Kramer, the Democratic fund-raiser who first talked Corzine into
running.
</P>
<P>
   Money has been a dominant theme in the New Jersey Senate race
since Corzine announced his interest a year ago. His willingness to
pay any price was cited by nearly every candidate who eventually
withdrew, among them Gov. Christie Whitman, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's supporters also promised that he would be able to
raise enough from individuals to show he could appeal to a broad
range of voters.
</P>
<P>
   They clearly hoped to force Florio from the race, too, by
starving him of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, whose political base is in the southern third of the
state, lost a great deal of fund-raising potential as Democratic
organizations in nearly all the wealthier North Jersey counties
endorsed Corzine. Florio's challenges mounted when Sen. Robert
Torricelli, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, though officially neutral, made it clear that he was
tacitly supporting Corzine. The effect was to dry up contributions
to Florio from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few months, Florio, who is determined to fight
on until the June primary, has often likened Corzine's easy-money
ways to a hostile takeover of the electoral system. ``I have some
trouble with someone buying an office,'' he said Wednesday night.
``We'll see what the voters say.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Corzine's aides insist they have to spend heavily
to compensate for a disadvantage in name recognition, given
Florio's more than 20 years on the New Jersey political scene.
Despite Corzine's spending, Florio enjoys a better than 2-to-1 edge
in the most recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Corzine's two campaign managers, Steven Goldstein,
went much further today, belittling Florio's war chest of $796,340
at year's end. In the last six months of 1999, records show, Florio
raised $511,500 in donations, lent his campaign $200,000 of his own
money and spent $444,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is utterly incomprehensible how any candidate in the modern
media age can run a campaign of even the slightest significance
with the embarrassing amount of money Jim Florio is reporting
today,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Florio brushed off such criticisms. ``We're not competing on the
basis of who raises more money,'' he said. ``He wins that
competition. Our game plan right from the beginning is a budget of
$2.5 to $3 million for the primary. We're on track to do that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But as one indication of the importance attached to money,
Florio's campaign said Monday that it had actually raised $1.61
million, about $250,000 more than was reported in its federal
filing. But that included contributions made as recently as Monday.
And a campaign official later confirmed that $200,000 of the extra
money was actually lent to the campaign by Florio.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Corzine's fund-raising ability, however, his own
filing with the Federal Election Commission raises questions about
his appeal among New Jersey residents.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $1.4 million Corzine raised in the last six months of
1999, more than one-third ($514,750) came from employees at
Goldman, Sachs and from Wall Street executives and investors. And
more money came from residents of New York ($561,525) than from New
Jerseyans ($475,085), records show.
</P>
<P>
   Among the five Republican contenders, state Sen. William L.
Gormley showed surprising financial strength by raising $1,530,990,
a figure far higher than any of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Franks was second, reporting $883,715 in
contributions.

AN ELECTRIC MOMENT FOR A MEN'S DESIGNER

<P>
   PARIS _ The notion that a first-rate designer can emerge from
the marginal world of menswear and become one of the true fashion
rebels worth watching anywhere is almost too remote to contemplate.
The audience for the sort of clothes shown on the men's runways is
too small, and the designers who get the most attention _ like Tom
Ford, Miuccia Prada and Calvin Klein _ do so largely because they
already rule in the women's field.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Hedi Slimane of Yves Saint Laurent men's the most
exciting figure in fashion at the moment?
</P>
<P>
   Because his show on Jan. 25 at the French fall 2000 menswear
shows cut through all the hype and headline build-up (``The return
of elegance'') by concentrating on the things that have always
counted: cut and proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Because there was a palpable sense of sexual energy in the
clothes; it was directed at men, skinny men, but all right, a woman
could appreciate it, too. Because when the last of the models had
left the runway and there was only the lone, reed-thin figure of
Slimane standing against the white wall of lights that formed the
show's backdrop, the audience became unglued and rose in a cheering
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, he is the only one who comes close to the genius of
Yves Saint Laurent,'' Pierre Berge, the former chief executive of
Saint Laurent, said afterward, with a Gallic flourish of hands.
``Let's not talk about these ridiculous things that people call
fashion _ no! It is about wonderful technique, cut and proportion.
Hedi understands this.''
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the body-conscious cut, Slimane banished every hue
except black. ``I wanted to show just the silhouette, like a
sketch,'' he explained afterward. That meant slim trousers, coats
with razor-sharp shoulders and a long, tapering torso.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes evoked some of the allure and sense of erotic danger
one associates with 1970s fashion, specifically Saint Laurent's, as
models in black leather trench coats and crocodile-embossed
trousers came out to fast-paced music commissioned for the show.
(Catherine Deneuve, a Saint Laurent muse, added her voice to the
soundtrack.)
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to say that an abundance of black leather (as a
tail coat, no less), shimmering T-shirts and slinky halter-style
tops of the dominatrix genre all verge on the homoerotic. Yet
rarely do tailored clothes hover so temptingly between what you
like and what you know you shouldn't have. And there's no doubt
that Slimane influenced the new sleek couture look that swept the
men's runways in Milan earlier last month.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether he is willing to be less a rebel,
and incorporate into his cut and technique some of those modern
marketing strategies that Ford, who was front and center at the
show, will surely expect as Saint Laurent's new creative director.
Slimane is one designer who deserves a wider commercial audience.
</P>
<P>
   The rich, gray-flannel look of English schoolboys was the
subject of Raf Simons' show, but don't bother thinking of oxford
bags or Sebastian Flyte. Just as the show was about to begin in a
sound stage on the edge of Paris, with the crowd sitting on either
side like students waiting for a pep rally, up rolled a Lincoln
Continental stretch limousine and out stepped two young men in dark
suits with crests on their jackets.
</P>
<P>
   It was hilarious. Simons has a knack for making the ordinary
seem subversive. Here were guys in those familiar gray flannels,
navy blazers, crew-neck sweaters over blue oxford shirts, and
slightly oversize Chesterfields (the coat, not the smoke) that
would have warmed a mother's heart if she had seen one of them
coming across a prep-school lawn, fresh from morning prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But these were no choirboys. For one thing, they all had
boot-black hair, which suggested something kinky, and for another,
the clothes _ the ultra-high turtleneck sweaters, the waistless
trousers, the tongue-in-cheek clerical collars _ expressed a
knowingness about fashion's ability to toy with convention and
illusion. Lest anyone think Simons was soft on bourgeois statements
of decorum, he also sent out the quintessential playboy-mobile, a
DeLorean.
</P>
<P>
   If the Milan shows are about product (clothes to wear!), the
French shows are about inventiveness and avant-garde fun (clothes
to write about!). It's hard to imagine there are too many followers
for the clownish plaids that Rei Kawakubo showed at Comme des
Garcons, although the models came out whirling and jiving to the
rock music with such youthful exuberance that the many plaid
trousers and shrunken-looking jackets seemed an antidote to the
strait-laced elegance attempting to return to men's fashion. They
are certainly the kind of clothes that die-hard individualists
wear.
</P>
<P>
   There were plaids, along with fabrics that looked lovingly worn
in, at Paul Smith's show, too, but these were of the English
variety for which Smith is known.
</P>
<P>
   Yohji Yamamoto's show was neither here nor there. The designer
seemed to be trying to move away from all-black statements, with
such things as jewel-embroidered cuffs and silky pajama pants in
pastel colors with striped or waffle-knitted sweaters. But his loud
patchwork effects and oversize jackets seemed to be a case of a
designer trying to work out a problem whose solution only he would
be interested in.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the runways, Marc Jacobs put on a good show at
Louis Vuitton. The collection focused on classic looks, like tweedy
jackets, turtleneck sweaters (often under shirts or matching V-neck
sweaters) and this season's apparently smart shoe, the tasseled
loafer. There was a flourish of logos, including on silk pajama
pants, but Jacobs wisely played things straight.
</P>
<P>
   The cool factor at Hermes was to be found in single-breasted
suits in olive and Hermes-orange velvet, buttoned over black
shirts. There were also leather trousers with knits, and a vivid
orange zip-front cardigan, worn by a model with fuzzy hair and
glasses, which made one think the clothes would look great in an
off-beat young Hollywood movie.
</P>
<P>
   In the program notes to his show, which was held in a loftlike
space with carpets placed in concentric circles on the concrete,
Walter van Beirendonck said he wanted his fall collection to
``bring back a feeling of pride and dressing up to fashion.'' He
mentioned that the clothes would be layered.
</P>
<P>
   And how! Van Beirendonck took stripes and cotton checks, even a
pattern that looked suspiciously as though it were copied from a
baby's crib bunting, and layered them, piling shirt upon
identically cut shirt until, indeed, the finished garment (its
layers connected only by tiny metal rods that stood up at the
shoulders) seemed to praise the process of dressing itself.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the design team of Viktor &AMP; Rolf tried a similar feat
at the autumn haute couture shows here last July, but van
Beirendonck was not imitating them. His layered coats and tops were
more naive, mixing common and high-tech fabrics, and presumably
they are also meant to be worn. And what was striking about seeing
clothes in six layers of the same shape is that they had texture
and depth and suddenly movement, too. They looked multidimensional.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the show, the models, standing front to back in
two circles, each stepped forward and removed the shirt or coat
from the person in front of him, holding van Beirendonck's artful
layers by the tiny rods.

FOOTBALL COLUMN: THE BEST SUPER BOWL EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What is your lasting memory of Super Bowl XXXIV?
</P>
<P>
   How about Blaine Bishop's headfirst, third-quarter tackle that
left him unconscious for a few moments and scared both teams and
the Georgia Dome crowd of 72,652 into eerie silence? What about
Kurt Warner's fancy 73-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce in the
final minutes that proved to be the winning points? How about Steve
McNair jousting two tacklers for a last-minute scramble and a
16-yard fling to Kevin Dyson in a shot at glory?
</P>
<P>
   All memorable moments, but the play of the game was the last
one: the 9-yard pass from McNair to Dyson that St. Louis Rams
linebacker Mike Jones made sure was good for only 9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   A thrilling, definitive finale of a play that saved the Rams'
chilling 23-16 victory. You just saw the best Super Bowl ever
played.
</P>
<P>
   No turnovers. No goats. No decisive controversy. Few penalties.
High drama.
</P>
<P>
   There have been Super Bowls with more points scored and with
more precise execution and with bigger crowds and with bigger
stars. There has never been another Super Bowl, however, that took
all 60 minutes, each and every second, and created a more dramatic
finish.
</P>
<P>
   The game's signature play will always be the last one: McNair to
Dyson, with Jones in the mix as the clock struck zero.
</P>
<P>
   For every Super Bowl to come, the play will be replayed, fixed
permanently in our minds and in Super Bowl lore. And on every
rerun, on every recount, Dyson will always finish 1 yard shy of the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what Tennessee faces,'' said Solomon Wilcots, the
former Cincinnati Bengals defensive back who now works for ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   He was part of Super Bowl XXII when Joe Montana's 10-yard
scoring pass to John Taylor with 34 seconds left won it for San
Francisco, 20-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year at Super Bowl time, they show that play,'' Wilcots
said. ``I keep looking at it hoping this time will be the one where
Taylor drops the ball. You know, he never does. And that is what
will happen for the Tennessee Titans. They will never escape that
play. Every time they see it, they will bleed a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never run and hide from it and in some ways you never
recover from it. You learn to live with it, but it's always harder
when the Super Bowl rolls around again.''
</P>
<P>
   We saw the Rams slip on their Super Bowl victory T-shirts and
caps. No doubt, the Titans had a box of them ready, too, just in
case. They can burn them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts a whole lot,'' Titans cornerback Samari Rolle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a lot of talking between us,'' Titans tight
end Jackie Harris said Monday. ``It is amazing, though, and we
realize that for all of the hype and hard work, for everything it
took to get here, that the game at the end boiled down to one play
and the basic fundamental of tackling.''
</P>
<P>
   For a true champion, the bigger the game, the bigger the
tackling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a combination coverage and with only 10 yards to
defend before the end zone, we were looking for them to try and
throw it before the goal line and to try and lunge in,'' Jones
said. ``I saw Dyson's move and sensed the ball coming. He planted.
I planted and anticipated his move. I got underneath him. I was
going downhill on him. I had the angle and made the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Warner passed for a Super Bowl record 414 yards. The Rams
won despite possessing the ball for only 5 minutes 49 seconds of
the second half. The team that runs best wins? Not this time,
because Tennessee easily won the rushing battle, 159 yards to 29
yards. McNair rushed for 64 yards, the most by a quarterback. St.
Louis scored the game's first 16 points. Tennessee scored the next
16.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Warner to Bruce for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Then McNair to Dyson for the desperate finale.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams move forward, with coach Dick Vermeil considering
retirement and with his offensive coordinator, Mike Martz, set to
replace him. Warner will receive a long-term contract. The Rams
will play a Super Bowl champion schedule next season, one much
tougher than this season, but they are suited for the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans look to develop a deep passing game in the
off-season. They played this Super Bowl without two pivotal injured
starters, receiver Yancey Thigpen and safety Marcus Robertson. For
much of the second half, Bishop was injured and gone, too.
</P>
<P>
   Would Robertson or Bishop deny the game-swinging play on Bruce?
Would Thigpen get into the end zone when Dyson could not?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team made great strides in our passing game, and there is
no question it will continue to mature and evolve and we will look
to develop more deep threats,'' Titans coach Jeff Fisher said.
``Yancey Thigpen watched this game from the sideline, and I'm
telling you that is a big difference for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have built this offense to run the ball and move the chains
with a short passing game, and that style is predicated on getting
turnovers and creating more chances. We got no turnovers. That was
big. With all of that said, I'm sure the game was exciting to watch
if you didn't care about the score.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was exciting to watch if you did care.
</P>
<P>
   It was the best Super Bowl ever.
</P>
<P>
   And once it was over, one of the most glorious postgame sights
Monday morning was Bishop. He walked on his own from the hotel to
board the team bus to catch the team plane back to Nashville. He
wore a cumbersome white neck brace.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was knocked out,'' Bishop said. ``I didn't remember
anything. Once I was aroused, I told them I could get up and go
back in. Once they got me on the cart, I knew I couldn't even stand
up. My head was spinning. I messed up a nerve in my left arm. But I
feel OK now. The doctors tell me it is only a sprained neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the way from the hospital back to the stadium, they told me
the score was 16-16. I had hope. Once I got there, I found out we
had lost. I didn't even see how until I saw the highlights this
morning. Could I have made a difference at the end? It's hard to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 132 plays in Super Bowl XXXIV. It was the best Super
Bowl ever because every single one coalesced, from start to finish,
for a memorable football tapestry.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pat Cetta, who with his brother, Mike, owned Sparks,
a renowned New York steakhouse, died on Jan. 24. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, Mike Cetta said.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, at 210 East 46th Street, is the kind of clubby place
where pinstriped executives can unburden themselves by removing
their jackets and sticking their ties into their shirts before
tucking into enormous char-broiled cuts of meat. Pat Cetta was a
ubiquitous presence, overseeing the dining room, while his brother
took care of administration and finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy was, two yeses to make a yes, one no to make a
no,'' Mike Cetta said.
</P>
<P>
   Night after night, Cetta could be seen prowling the room,
greeting, embracing and joking with his regular customers, steering
even the most hidebound martini swillers toward the legendary wine
list. Both Cettas adored wine and took particular pleasure in
offering a deep selection of wines from California, Bordeaux and
Italy at reasonable prices, especially for hard-to-find aged wines.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks sells wines like a 1982 Chateau Gruaud-Larose for $190 a
bottle, about what you would pay retail, if you could find it. This
is because Cetta bought wine with the idea of selling it perhaps 10
years down the road, a policy rare in New York, where storage space
is scarce and holding wine is seen as tying up an investment
without an immediate return. When an older wine finally made it to
the list, Cetta priced it according to what he had paid, rather
than the market rate, which rarity and age would make considerably
higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught an important lesson: longevity,'' said Drew
Nieporent, whose restaurants include Montrachet, TriBeCa Grill and
Icon. ``Maintaining a standard is not easy in this day and age.''
</P>
<P>
   As reknowned as Sparks is for aged beef and fine wine, it has
also been a beacon for the curious because of its association with
a gangland killing. On Dec. 17, 1985, Paul Castellano, the mob
boss, was gunned down outside the restaurant as he stepped from his
car on his way to dinner. The Incident, as it was referred to by
the Cettas, never seemed to hurt business, and in fact may even
have attracted it.
</P>
<P>
   Pasquale Cetta was born in 1933 in the Bay Ridge section of
Brooklyn, shortly after his parents, Rocco, a butcher, and Maria,
had emigrated from Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi in southern Italy. With
Mike, his elder by five years, Pat Cetta joined his father in the
meat business. Likewise, the brothers came to wine early, crushing
grapes in their cellar to make their own vintage, which was the
custom among many Italian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his brother, Cetta is survived by his wife, Kathleen,
and a sister, Angela Strelkoff.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cetta said that his brother had always wanted to get into
the restaurant business, and in 1966 they bought Sparks, a little
English pub on East 18th Street owned by a man named Don Sparks,
and turned it into a steakhouse. In 1977, they moved the restaurant
to its current site on East 46th Street, which, after a renovation
in 1997, now occupies 27,000 square feet and seats 684.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out as the smallest steakhouse in New York, and now
we're the biggest,'' Mike Cetta said.

LAWYER QUESTIONS TIMING OF ARREST IN BOMB PLOT INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A lawyer for a Brooklyn man charged with assisting in
an aborted bomb plot accused the government Monday of timing his
client's arrest to coincide with a court holiday so that he could
then be interrogated at length before being given a lawyer or taken
before a judge.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Abdel Ghani Meskini, was arrested on Dec. 30, and
charged with assisting in a terrorist plot that involved an attempt
by a group of Algerians in Canada to smuggle powerful explosives
into the United States near Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation that the government had improperly delayed
Meskini's arrest was sharply disputed by prosecutors and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Meskini's lawyer, Roland Thau, suggested that ``the
government timed the arrest very specifically in order to deny this
defendant his opportunity to appear before a judicial officer and
have counsel appointed promptly.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the hearing, Thau said that Meskini had
been under surveillance for several days but that the government
waited to arrest him until the morning of Thursday, Dec. 30, after
the federal District Courthouse in Manhattan had closed for New
Year's.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini, 31, was then interrogated for about eight hours, Thau
said. He did not make a court appearance until the next day, also a
court holiday, when Thau was appointed defense counsel. Meskini has
since pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI and prosecutors were very, very eager to get
statements from this defendant,'' Thau told Judge John F. Keenan on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A federal prosecutor, David N. Kelley, sharply disputed Thau's
contention. He said the allegation was ``an ill-founded premise _
and the fact it's an ill-founded premise will be borne out,''
Kelley added, if a hearing is held on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the FBI in New York, Joseph A. Valiquette,
denied that the timing of the arrest ``was intended to deny him due
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Thau has said that any statements by his client relating to a
bomb plot could not be construed as a confession, but rather as an
explanation of his own innocence.

EDITORIAL: THE USES OF NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after a speech in which he had, by implication,
questioned George W. Bush's readiness to be commander in chief and
linked him to Clintonesque fund-raising techniques, Sen. John
McCain was asked if he was violating his promise not to indulge in
negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm close,'' McCain said with a laugh. As usual, he
was being more candid _ and wittier _ than the other leading
candidates about a game that all of them are playing to some
degree.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, for example, Bush responds to the hint
that he will need ``on the job training'' by depicting McCain as a
crypto-Democrat who is ``mimicking'' Al Gore's timid tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic campaign, the exchanges between Gore and
former Sen. Bill Bradley are blunter and more personal. But the
plain fact is that all four are ready to go negative when it serves
their interests, and each man is capable of histrionic displays of
virtue when he thinks he can accuse an opponent of taking the low
road.
</P>
<P>
   The entire show provides an opportunity to reflect on exactly
what constitutes negative campaigning, what conditions bring it to
the surface and what value it can bring to a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a boil-lancing benefit to attack politics. It can
bring into the open key questions about temperament, character and
leadership ability.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's accusation that Bradley would not ``stay and fight'' in
Washington does touch on the important question of whether Bradley
has the inner toughness and practicality for the job he seeks.
Bradley's assertion that Gore cannot be counted on to tell the
truth does point up the vice president's habit of exaggerating and
revising his record. Attacks on Bush as green and untested and
McCain as outside the Republican mainstream clearly have relevance
to the choice before GOP primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for voters is that attack politics can lead to
distortion of the issues debate. For example, no one seriously
believes Bradley's suggestion that Gore's early waffling on
abortion means that he is not currently a reliable defender of
women's right to choose. Similarly, Gore's charge that Bradley's
proposal for universal health care would mean abandoning the people
on Medicaid is a willful misrepresentation. Bradley's plan to
replace Medicaid with other insurance programs is similar to the
approach used in the Clinton-Gore health plan of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the Gore-Bradley contest has brought out a
whiny quality in both men. Bradley seems to think that a rule of
his ``new politics'' is ``Thou shalt not attack Bill Bradley.''
Gore seems to think that negative campaigning is defined as others
doing to Al Gore what Al Gore does to them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the GOP contest has shown that Bush and McCain have
to struggle to keep their inner bullies in check. But the nature of
the campaign and the earnestness with which it is being contested
inclines us to cut all four a little slack.
</P>
<P>
   At least three of the four have faced problems of political
self-preservation. Insurgency candidates like Bradley and McCain
usually have to slash and burn in order to have a chance. Gore, in
becoming the first of the four to go negative in a big way,
energized a candidacy that was in danger of sleepwalking to defeat.
Bush has not really had to get tough yet, but it is worth
remembering that he is the lineal heir to a trend-setting
enterprise in the techniques of opponent destruction, that being
the campaign that his father, President George Bush, waged against
Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   That campaign and the Clinton-Gore campaigns of 1992 and 1996
convinced the current generation of candidates and consultants in
both parties that the politics of destruction are a necessary part
of any campaign arsenal. Voters invariably tell pollsters they do
not like tough campaign tactics, but as Bradley learned in Iowa,
fighting back is a necessary skill for anyone who aspires to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The voters have a good sense about what is rough but acceptable
and what is over the top. That is why candidates like Steve Forbes,
who do not balance their attacks on opponents with an uplifting
appeal of their own, seldom get to the big show.
</P>
<P>
   For the main contenders, the New Hampshire battle has been harsh
and sometimes unfair, but it has also been consistently
illuminating about what the candidates stand for and how they might
react under the much greater pressures that bear in upon the Oval
Office.

JET CRASHES OFF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES --Moments after reporting mechanical problems, an
Alaska Airlines jet with 88 people aboard plunged nose-first into
the Pacific Ocean off Point Mugu northwest of Los Angeles Monday.
There were no signs of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261, en route nonstop from the Mexican resort of Puerto
Vallarta to San Francisco, disappeared from radar around 3:45 p.m.
after its crew reported problems with the McDonnell Douglas DC83
stabilizer trim and asked permission to make an emergency landing
at Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   On Anacapa Island, witnesses saw the plane plummet into the
Pacific Ocean about 10 miles off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   A broad oil slick littered with debris marked the crash scene.
One body was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard and Navy ships and helicopters, aided by boats from
Channel Island fishermen and oil rigs, searched the cold and choppy
water through the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every resource we can muster either on-scene or en
route,'' said Coast Guard Capt. George Wright. ``We are going to
search for survivors until there is about zero chance of finding
anyone alive.''
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell, the Coast Guard's four helicopters, one
airplane and three boats on the scene were joined by more than a
dozen civilian boats combing the water for survivors. Coast guard
personnel were armed with infra-red vision devices to spot the body
heat of survivors floating on the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always hope there will be a survivor out there,''
Wright said. ``We've seen miracles before.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the 58-degree water temperature, however, officials said
it was unlikely people could survive for long.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration officials and an National
Transportation Safety Board an investigative team was immediately
mobilized and was expected to arrive in Los Angeles early today.
</P>
<P>
   They will lead recovery efforts and the search for what
Washington D.C. at 2 a.m. today and seek the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   An Alaska Airline spokesman said the plane had no previous
problems with the stabilizer trim, which controls the jet's
up-and-down maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   The flight left Puerto Vallarta at 2:30 Pacific Standard Time
and was scheduled to land in San Francisco just after 5 p.m. before
heading on to Seattle later in the evening. Eighty-three passengers
and five crew members were on board, according to the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers lost contact with the crew over Los
Angeles air space around as the plane cruised along the coast at
17,000 feet, said a spokesman for San Francisco International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said the crew members radioed that they were
having trouble with the stabilizer trim and were diverted back to
LAX.
</P>
<P>
   The jet was still 20 miles northwest of the airport when it
crashed, plunging into water at least 300 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   On Anacapa Island, roughly two miles away, a National Park
Service employee watched the plane slam into the ocean, said Suzan
Smith, a spokeswoman for Channel Islands National Park in Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went in nose first,'' she said. She declined to identify
the employee.
</P>
<P>
   The plane hit just outside the park's boundaries, she said. The
employee called in the crash to the park's dispatch center, which
called the Coast Guard with the information. The park's dispatchers
also reached a fishing boat crew that had witnessed the crash and
was speeding to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Mitch Barker said the first reports of the crash
indicated the plane was upside down in the water. Further details
were not available Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine plane was built in 1992 and is a version of the
MD-80 first flown in 1979. Since then McDonnell-Douglas, and now
Boeing, has sold nearly 1,200 of of the MD-80 in its various
versions.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB records indicate Alaska Airlines has never had a fatal
crash before, outside of a 1990 incident in Phoenix in which a
mental patient ran onto the runway in front of a Alaska Airlines
727 and was killed.
</P>
<P>
   A passenger list of the downed plane was not available Monday
evening. However, those who think family members may have been on
the plane can call (800) 553-5117 to reach the airline.

<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. _ Citing a ``shameful record of convicting
innocent people and putting them on death row,'' Gov. George Ryan
of Illinois on Monday halted all executions in the state, the first
such moratorium in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, a moderate Republican who supports the death penalty but
questions its administration, noted that 13 men had been sentenced
to death in Illinois since 1977 for crimes they did not commit,
before ultimately being exonerated and freed by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot support a system, which, in its administration, has
proven so fraught with error,'' he said, ``and has come so close to
the ultimate nightmare, the state's taking of innocent life.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was hailed by opponents of the death penalty,
who said mistaken convictions like those discovered in Illinois
were common throughout the United States. Some 85 people have been
found to be innocent and released from death row since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature in Nebraska passed a moratorium on executions
last year, citing concerns of racial disparity in sentencing, but
the governor vetoed it. Bills that would halt executions are
pending in 12 states. In Oregon, an anti-death-penalty group led by
Mark Hatfield, a former Republican senator and governor, hopes to
put a measure on the ballot that would eliminate executions and
provide instead for sentences of life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 inmates have been put to death since 1977, when
the Supreme Court allowed the reinstatement of the death penalty.
The death penalty is on the lawbooks in 38 states, and polls show
that a strong majority of Americans favor it. The Midwest has
traditionally been a center of opposition to the death penalty. It
is not allowed in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, Wisconsin and
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, about 150 inmates are on death row; none had an
execution date. Ryan's announcement of a moratorium in Illinois,
pending a review by a special panel, met with little public
criticism here, even among ardent conservatives, a measure of how
public outrage over the wrongful convictions has changed the
political landscape on the issue in this state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I can be sure that everyone sentenced to death in
Illinois is truly guilty, until I can be sure with moral certainty
that no innocent man or woman is facing a lethal injection, no one
will meet that fate,'' the governor said, according to The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading voices for a moratorium has been that of
Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago, who, while he was Cook County
state's attorney in the 1980s, prosecuted some of the death penalty
cases that later were overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Daley now contends that prosecutors did nothing improper in
these cases but that defense lawyers were often poorly financed and
sometimes incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   In nine of the reversed Illinois cases, students and professors
at Northwestern University unearthed pivotal evidence in the trials
that freed the men from death row.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Marshall, a law professor at Northwestern University
who is director there of the Center for Wrongful Convictions , said
that the mistakes unearthed in Illinois surely exist in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should not be seen as an Illinois problem,'' said
Marshall, who said defendants probably received fairer treatment in
Illinois than in many other places. ``What happened here is that we
got lucky in the first few cases, and found the evidence. After
that, people were more willing to take a second look at other
cases. It was a snowball effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The willingness in Illinois to examine such cases, Marshall
said, means that letters from inmates protesting innocence are not
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political climate has changed here,'' he said. ``There has
been an astonishing recognition that innocent people are being sent
to death row. So now people are re-examining cases in Illinois that
would not be re-examined in other states. The letters from those
inmates are being read, not thrown in the wastebasket.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Illinois seems to have become a center of debate over the
death penalty, the issue is gaining resonance around the nation,
after many years in which it was seen as essentially a dead letter
in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the halt on executions here, and the vetoed moratorium
in Nebraska, the death penalty has been the focus of intense
scrutiny in Florida and other states. Last year, in a visit to the
United States, Pope John Paul II called on Catholics to oppose the
death penalty. And a new movie, ``Hurricane,'' examines the life of
a man, Reuben Carter, who was sent to death row for a crime he did
not commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to raise more concerns about the death
penalty,'' said Steven Hawkins, the executive director of the
National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. ``It's becoming
obvious that mistakes can be made, and innocent people'' can be
sent to death row.
</P>
<P>
   While the wrongful convictions in Illinois have generated
intense scrutiny and debate, Florida has seen 18 death row cases
reversed, the most of any state.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who said he would appoint a panel to study death penalty
sentences, heads the Illinois campaign for Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the state that executes more people than any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that a public dialogue must begin on the question of
fairness of the application of the death penalty in Illinois,''
Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   In about a year as governor, Ryan has taken some actions that
have put him at odds with conservatives in his party. He has called
for strict gun control, expressed support for the civil rights of
gay people and traveled to Cuba and met with Fidel Castro, the
communist leader. Some suburban and downstate lawmakers have
complained that Ryan has maintained too cozy a political
relationship with Mayor Daley, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has lately been beleaguered by an investigation into a
bribery scandal at driver's license bureaus that occurred during
his watch as the Illinois secretary of state. While Ryan has not
been charged with wrongdoing, one of his top aides is expected to
be indicted. Seventeen people have pleaded guilty to taking bribes
to fix driver's license exams, and some of the bribe money went to
Ryan's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, Illinois has executed 12 inmates, the most recent in
March 1999, the lethal injection of Andrew Kokoraleis, a suburban
Chicago man who had been convicted of an especially grisly murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Cook County state's attorney's office has instituted special
internal reviews for all cases that would be eligible for the death
penalty. The prosecutor's office, which is headed by Richard
Devine, a Democrat, has not called for an execution date since
April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   David Erickson, the first assistant state's attorney, said the
governor's call for a moratorium was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy thing would have been to finger-point, and the
governor did not do that,'' Erickson said. ``If something has
fallen apart here, it is a systemic problem.''

EDITORIAL: A TIMEOUT ON THE DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Ryan of Illinois has shown political courage and
integrity in being the first governor in a death penalty state to
put a stop, at least temporarily, to executions in light of
overwhelming evidence that the capital punishment system is prone
to make mistakes. He said Monday, ``I now favor a moratorium,
because I have grave concerns about our state's shameful record of
convicting innocent people and putting them on death row.''
</P>
<P>
   Since capital punishment was reinstated in Illinois in 1977, 12
death row inmates have been executed while 13 have been exonerated
after their cases were reopened, many with the help of volunteer
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan cited a recent series by The Chicago Tribune that examined
nearly 300 cases in Illinois courts in which the death sentence had
been imposed. Of some 260 cases that have been appealed, fully half
have been reversed for a new trial or sentencing hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper found that in more than 30 cases, death row
inmates were represented by lawyers who were disbarred or suspended
from practice. In more than 40 cases, testimony from a jail-house
informant _ generally regarded as unreliable _ was used to convict
or condemn the defendant. In numerous other cases, recanted
testimony by prosecution witnesses, improper rulings by the judge
or misconduct by the prosecutors resulted in convictions that had
to be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, a Republican, has been a supporter of capital punishment,
and says he still believes that death is appropriate in some cases,
provided the system functions accurately. He said Monday, ``I
cannot support a system, which, in its administration, has proven
so fraught with error and has come so close to the ultimate
nightmare, the state's taking of innocent life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even talking about the system's mistakes shows an honesty that
many pro-death penalty politicians refuse to acknowledge. Indeed,
even as new technology and DNA evidence make it possible to prove
actual innocence, state and federal lawmakers have been truncating
the ability of death row inmates to appeal wrongful convictions.
Congress in 1996 set extremely tight time limits for federal death
penalty appeals, making it more likely that innocent people will be
executed for crimes they did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois is not the only state with a capital justice system so
flawed that it cannot ensure that innocent people are spared. The
solution ultimately is to end capital punishment, a system that
cannot afford to mete out a single mistaken sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan at least is willing to halt the executions long enough to
appoint a commission to review the administration of the death
penalty and analyze the horrendous mistakes that have already been
proved. It is time that other pro-death penalty governors _
including Gov. George W. Bush of Texas _ acknowledge the flaws and
stop what Justice Harry Blackmun once called the ``machinery of
death.''

GIVING THE PLAY BY PLAY FOR MET'S LISTENERS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ And all these years you thought that Peter Allen was
alone in the broadcast booth at the Metropolitan Opera on Saturday
afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. There are two people in there, facing the plate-glass
window. In the chair on the right sits Allen's wife, Sylvia.
</P>
<P>
   He says, in the deep-but-not-too-deep voice that has introduced
507 opera broadcasts: ``She performs a function. She kicks me when
I make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   She says, in a voice not heard on the 360 radio stations that
carry his: ``I never kicked him in my life. I poke him. And I'm
always right.''
</P>
<P>
   They laugh. They have been carrying on like this for 25 years
now, sounding happier than the characters he talks about, week
after week. Talk about contrasts: down on the stage, all those
messy entanglements, all that cavorting with other people's wives,
husbands, princes, princesses. Up in the broadcast booth on the
Grand Tier, a couple as proper and polite as Papageno and Papagena
in ``The Magic Flute.''
</P>
<P>
   They have his-and-hers binoculars to watch the action,
his-and-hers headphones to hear it. And when the ``on the air''
light is off, he is accommodating, even self-effacing. ``With all
those voices out there on the stage, to call me `the voice of the
Met' is very odd,'' he says. But he also manages to sound
authoritative.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, about the same as when the ``on the air'' light
is on. There is, perhaps, only one difference between on and off
the air. When he arrives at the Met on Saturdays, he transfers the
change in his right pocket to his left. In case of a kick (or a
poke), he does not want the microphone to pick up jangling coins.
</P>
<P>
   His 25 years as the Met's announcer have gone as fast as the
Queen of the Night's high F in ``The Magic Flute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to emphasize my age,'' he says, ``not out of
vanity, but I don't like to reinforce the cliche that opera is for
old people. I am 79, but I don't like to advertise that.''
</P>
<P>
   He no longer opens with the same five words every week _
``Texaco presents the Metropolitan Opera.'' Texaco has been the
sponsor since 1940, but to avoid monotony, the scripts now vary; on
Saturday, his first word was ``Welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long the audience was applauding and he was doing the
opera world's equivalent of play by play: ``The bravos rise as he
mounts the stand, smiling to the house, bowing to the house, now
turning to conduct,'' he said as the Met's artistic director, James
Levine, arrived for ``Der Rosenkavalier.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen also does the color, telling radio listeners what they
cannot see: after Act III, the soprano Heidi Grant Murphy was
``wearing a modest but very pretty dark red dress.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for the woman on his right, he might not be doing this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sylvia cast me in my first radio production, `Of Mice and
Men.' I was Slim. She was the director.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been the principal violist in the Ohio State Symphony.
Ohio State's radio station hired him to play in a string quartet,
but the three other musicians never appeared, so it was his voice,
not his viola, that went on.
</P>
<P>
   He was hired by a commercial station in Columbus, Ohio _ ``I did
the `RCA Victor Record Showcase,''' he says _ and eventually
married his former director (who became a painter). They moved to
New York and shared a subscription to the Met with another couple,
and in 1947, he became an announcer on WQXR.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to the 1973-74 season: He was hired as a standby
for Milton Cross, who had been presiding over the microphone since
the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   For a year Allen sat through the Saturday matinees. Cross died
on Jan. 3, 1975, a Friday. The next day, the Allens were in the
booth. They have not missed a Saturday since.
</P>
<P>
   On his fourth broadcast, he was introducing the second act of
``Tosca'' when he was handed a note that said, ``Keep talking.'' He
did. Later he learned why Act II had been delayed: The tenor Carlo
Bergonzi, had had a coughing fit backstage.
</P>
<P>
   Allen also talked his way through what he calls ``the `Macbeth'
episode,'' when an 82-year-old singing coach committed suicide by
jumping from a balcony during the intermission of ``Macbeth'' in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, he talked for 23 minutes when the Met's
stage-moving machinery stalled during a scene change in
``Parsifal'' and stagehands had to do the work by hand. Joseph
Volpe, who is now the Met's general manager, heard Allen's
ad-libbing on his car radio, driving in from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``How he came up with those things, from one subject to another,
from `Parsifal' to Wagner to you name it, I don't know,'' Volpe
said. ``It's not something you can prepare for.''
</P>
<P>
   But Allen tries. He writes about an hour's worth of his own
filler, material that can be pulled out if he needs it. ``There's a
lot to say about almost any opera or composer,'' he says, ``except
maybe Cilea.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is no surprise that if you ask what his three favorite
operas are, Cilea's ``Adriana Lecouvreur'' is not on the list.
``Otello,'' ``Tristan und Isolde'' and ``Boris Godunov'' are.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty happy diet,'' he says, though he adds, ``It
would be easier to name 25.''
</P>
<P>
   Having wrapped up ``Rosenkavalier'' and signed off, the Allens
hang up the headphones. He puts away the binoculars. And, as they
start out of the booth, he takes the coins out of his left pocket
and puts them back in his right pocket. No more kicks (or pokes)
until next week.

JET CRASHES OFF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID BAKER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES --Moments after reporting mechanical problems, an
Alaska Airlines jet with 88 people aboard plunged nose-first into
the Pacific Ocean off Point Mugu northwest of Los Angeles Monday.
There were no signs of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261, en route nonstop from the Mexican resort of Puerto
Vallarta to San Francisco, disappeared from radar around 3:45 p.m.
after its crew reported problems with the McDonnell Douglas DC83
stabilizer trim and asked permission to make an emergency landing
at Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   On Anacapa Island, witnesses saw the plane plummet into the
Pacific Ocean about 10 miles off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   A broad oil slick littered with debris marked the crash scene.
One body was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard and Navy ships and helicopters, aided by boats from
Channel Island fishermen and oil rigs, searched the cold and choppy
water through the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every resource we can muster either on-scene or en
route,'' said Coast Guard Capt. George Wright. ``We are going to
search for survivors until there is about zero chance of finding
anyone alive.''
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell, the Coast Guard's four helicopters, one
airplane and three boats on the scene were joined by more than a
dozen civilian boats combing the water for survivors. Coast guard
personnel were armed with infra-red vision devices to spot the body
heat of survivors floating on the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always hope there will be a survivor out there,''
Wright said. ``We've seen miracles before.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the 58-degree water temperature, however, officials said
it was unlikely people could survive for long.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration officials and an National
Transportation Safety Board an investigative team was immediately
mobilized and was expected to arrive in Los Angeles early today.
</P>
<P>
   They will lead recovery efforts and the search for what
Washington D.C. at 2 a.m. today and seek the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   An Alaska Airline spokesman said the plane had no previous
problems with the stabilizer trim, which controls the jet's
up-and-down maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   The flight left Puerto Vallarta at 2:30 Pacific Standard Time
and was scheduled to land in San Francisco just after 5 p.m. before
heading on to Seattle later in the evening. Eighty-three passengers
and five crew members were on board, according to the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers lost contact with the crew over Los
Angeles air space around as the plane cruised along the coast at
17,000 feet, said a spokesman for San Francisco International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said the crew members radioed that they were
having trouble with the stabilizer trim and were diverted back to
LAX.
</P>
<P>
   The jet was still 20 miles northwest of the airport when it
crashed, plunging into water at least 300 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   On Anacapa Island, roughly two miles away, a National Park
Service employee watched the plane slam into the ocean, said Suzan
Smith, a spokeswoman for Channel Islands National Park in Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went in nose first,'' she said. She declined to identify
the employee.
</P>
<P>
   The plane hit just outside the park's boundaries, she said. The
employee called in the crash to the park's dispatch center, which
called the Coast Guard with the information. The park's dispatchers
also reached a fishing boat crew that had witnessed the crash and
was speeding to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Mitch Barker said the first reports of the crash
indicated the plane was upside down in the water. Further details
were not available Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine plane was built in 1992 and is a version of the
MD-80 first flown in 1979. Since then McDonnell-Douglas, and now
Boeing, has sold nearly 1,200 of of the MD-80 in its various
versions.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB records indicate Alaska Airlines has never had a fatal
crash before, outside of a 1990 incident in Phoenix in which a
mental patient ran onto the runway in front of a Alaska Airlines
727 and was killed.
</P>
<P>
   A passenger list of the downed plane was not available Monday
evening. However, those who think family members may have been on

EDITORIAL: DANGEROUS STALL BY THE IRA

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Less than four months before the Irish Republican Army is
supposed to disarm completely, a monitoring panel is expected to
report that the IRA has yet to turn in a single gun or bomb. By
failing to take that modest but symbolically important first step,
the IRA.has pushed Northern Ireland's mainstream Catholic and
Protestant parties, along with the Irish and British governments,
into an extremely difficult position and jeopardized the progress
that has been made toward a fair and durable peace in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The basis for progress has been the agreement that Northern
Ireland's main parties signed on Good Friday, 1998. The text fixed
no starting date for IRA disarmament, but committed the IRA's
political wing, Sinn Fein, to undertake its best efforts to see
that disarmament was completed by May 2000. In a further agreement
last year, Sinn Fein indicated that disarmament would begin once
London shifted authority over Northern Ireland to a new
power-sharing executive in which Sinn Fein representatives would
play an important role.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of Sinn Fein's assurances, Northern Ireland's main
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, agreed to participate in
the new executive, to which Britain transferred authority early
last December. Two months have now gone by, the IRA has not turned
over any weapons and the Ulster Unionists, quite rightly, are
feeling abused. Unless the IRA takes some concrete step toward
disarmament by Feb. 12, the Unionists' leader, David Trimble, says
he will withdraw from the executive, bringing Northern Ireland's
experiment in self-government to a halt. He has also said he would
be forced to resign his party's leadership. That would bring a more
militant faction to power and could lead to the unraveling of the
whole Good Friday agreement. To keep Trimble from having to follow
through on these threats, London may pre-emptively suspend the
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Sinn Fein argue that as long as the IRA continues to
abide by its current cease-fire, disarmament is a merely symbolic
issue. But the symbolism is crucially important. The Good Friday
agreement guaranteed the Catholic minority equal political
representation and full civil rights. In return, Sinn Fein provided
assurances that the paramilitary IRA would permanently abandon
violence and turn its energies to electoral politics. By refusing
to turn over its weapons, the IRA puts those assurances, a central
element of the peace agreement, in doubt. It also risks reawakening
a conflict that almost all of Northern Ireland's people want to see
ended for good. &QL;
