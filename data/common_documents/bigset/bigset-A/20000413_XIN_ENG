<HEADLINE> Britain Provides Fund to Ukraine for Closing Chernobyl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain will provide Ukraine with 10.
5 million pounds (17.32 million U.S. dollars) in aid to help
consolidate the protective structure over the No. 4 reactor at
Chernobyl nuclear station.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on
Wednesday during his meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma, the Ukrainian Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that to close Chernobyl by the end of 2000 is one of
the common interests shared by Britain and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Cook expressed his support to Ukraine's
application for the membership of the World Trade Organization,
saying that it would promote the development of the trade
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Expressing Britain's welcome to Ukraine's initiative to
integrate with Europe, Cook said that Britain will increase its
investment in Ukraine.
</P>

set up standing working groups to deal with issues with regard to
cooperation between the two countries. The groups will report
directly to Ukrainian president and British Prime minister.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Victor Yushchenko and Parliament
Speaker Ivan Plyushch also held talks with Cook.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champion Fu Upset at National Diving Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Three time Olympic champion Fu
Mingxia was upset by younger rival Guo Jingjing in the final of
the women's 3-meter springboard at the Chinese national diving
championships here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Guo is the current top women diver in China and she proved that
by performing flawless routines and collected a total of 640.30
points in the final, beating Fu to the second place with 618.90.
</P>
<P>
Fu suffered a poor score in her second dive and admitted she
did not perform well today.
</P>
<P>
"I did not dive well tonight. I lost to myself," said the 22-
year-old Fu, who had a two-loss record in her three encounters
with Guo.
</P>
<P>
Her only victory was in the China Open in Wenzhou last June.
</P>
<P>
Guo will be paired with Fu at the synchronized springboard
event at Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning, Li Na and Sang Xue claimed the title in
the women's synchrony 10-meter platform while Xiong Ni and Xiao
Hailiang snatched the men's title on the 3-meter springboard.

<HEADLINE> EU to Hold Dialogue With Sports Authorities  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union, is to meet authorities of
sports federations and athlete representatives next week to
discuss what best suits the interests of sports and athletes alike.
</P>
<P>
A total of 54 sports federations including the International
Olympic Committee and the European Olympic Committee as well as
international and continental sports federations will meet members
of the commission and the European Parliament in Brussels next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting is scheduled to discuss and debate issues
ranging from doping, health, welfare of the youngsters to
differences between sports federations and civilian administrative
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also touch upon the argument between the
European Union and sports federations as regards the number of
foreign players European soccer clubs can play in their matches.
</P>
<P>
Viviane Reding, EU commissioner of culture and sports, told
FIFA and UEFA, governing bodies of soccer in the world and in
Europe respectively, that they should not expect a change in the
court ruling that led to free agency and the ending of quotas on
foreign players in soccer leagues in European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
The European Court of Justice ruled in 1995 via the case of
Jean-Marc Bosman that players could switch teams without transfer
fees when their contracts expire.
</P>
<P>
Both FIFA and UEFA want to re-introduce limits on the number of
foreign players clubs can field each match.
</P>
<P>
"The Bosman ruling has been based on the free movement of
people and non discrimination (of the EU Treaty)," said Reding on
Tuesday. "You cannot overrule a court ruling. That is the
principle."
</P>
<P>
One of the negative aspects, however, of the Bosman ruling has
been the decline in youth training and the resulted widening gap
between rich and poor clubs.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner backed a system of educational contracts
between clubs and young talents to make sure grassroots
development survive.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Soccer Coach to Stay Until 2002 World Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The head coach of the Belgian
national eleven will now stay until after the 2002 World Cup
tournament thanks to his flair that has uplifted the team.
</P>
<P>
Robert Waseige succeeded George Leekens last October after an
embarrassing 4-3 home defeat by Finland and was originally asked
to see the 2000 European soccer championship co-hosts through this
summer's event.
</P>
<P>
Waseige has now been awarded an extension of his contract for
some good performances of the "Red Demons" that have beaten Italy
3-1 away and held Euro 2000 co-hosts the Netherlands twice, 5-5
away and 2-2 at home.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian national team has so far played six warm-up matches
under the guidance of Waseige and it won two matches, drew three
and lost one, going 2-1 down to England away.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is scheduled to play Norway and Denmark, both away, as
its final tune-up before the European championship kicks off on
June 10 in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The 2002 World Cup tourney will be co-hosted by South Korea and
Japan.

<HEADLINE> Italy Confirms Cancellation of Mozambique's Foreign Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Italy confirmed here Thursday that
his government will write off 2.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of
foreign debt from poor countries, including the debt to Rome owed
by Mozambique, which has been recently attacked by the worst
floods in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Italian Vice Foreign Minister Franco Danielli told a meeting
called "Summits, Commitments and Cooperation" in Havana, "We need
to interrupt the vicious circle generated by debt."
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the Italian initiative, it will be possible to
obtain the cancellation of the entire restructurable commercial
debts at the Club of Paris," he said.
</P>
<P>
The club was to object the total cancellation of this debt, and
Italy would go ahead with the initiative by covering the remaining
portion, he said.
</P>
<P>
But it does not seem to be the case, as he put it, "the Italian
move has been well received at the club, which has on its part
decided to suspend external debt servicing by Mozambique, a first
step toward the possible cancellation of the debt."
</P>
<P>
However, Danielli noted that eliminating the servicing of debt
will not be sufficient to secure the sustainable development of
poorer countries, for "what we need are new international
strategies for reducing and fighting poverty: a new 'covenant'
based on joint efforts between a rich and a poor world."
</P>
<P>
"All of us feel the need to profoundly restructure the forms of
international cooperation, and Italian cooperation has made very
firm and clear strategic decisions in this direction, making human
development, the reduction of poverty and social exclusion its
focus," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian decision comes at a time when all 122 countries
attending the first South Summit of the Group of 77 in Havana are
identifying the burden of foreign debt as one of the main
obstacles to achieving development in the South.

<HEADLINE> EU Finances Regional Projects to Create New Jobs in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 148 investment
projects in Romania will benefit from financing worth 5.5 million
euros granted by the European Union within the PHARE Regional
Development Program.
</P>
<P>
Through these projects which were presented Thursday at a press
conference and which will benefit from co-financing from Romania's
government, as many as 3,200 jobs will be created.
</P>
<P>
The projects were selected out of a total of 3,029 which were
submitted in September last year at the headquarters of the eight
regional agencies with the support of the National Agency for
Regional Development.
</P>
<P>
According to the leader of the EU assistance programs in
Romania Simon Mordue, the high number of submitted projects and
also their quality are a good thing which demonstrates "not only
the potential which exists in Romania for economic growth and
creation of new jobs but also the high degree of initiative and
commitment which exists at local level."
</P>
<P>
Each project can receive up to 62,500 euros and European
Commission chief in Romania Fokion Fotiadis hoped that 10,000 new
jobs would be created at the finalization of all projects.
</P>
<P>
"The good answer received at this selection of projects makes
us believe that Romania would be capable of obtaining the sum of
75,000,000 euros existing in the PHARE budget for the year 2000
for Romania," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not to Request Pardon For Possible Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Thursday that he would not ask for any pardon from his
successor to avoid prosecution in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation or any other scandal.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any interest in that," Clinton told the American
Society of Newspaper Editors. "I don't want one and I am prepared
to stand before any bar of justice I have to stand before."
</P>
<P>
The question of a presidential pardon arose after recent
statements by Robert W. Ray, the independent counsel, who said he
had hired additional prosecutors and was considering whether to
indict Clinton after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
Ray replaced Kenneth W. Starr last October as the independent
counsel to investigate Clinton's affairs with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that his battle against his impeachment by Congress
in the sex scandal "saved the Constitution" and he is "proud of"
it.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was impeached by the House on perjury and obstruction
charges, then acquitted by the Senate a year ago.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that he had made "a terrible mistake" in
behavior in his affair with Lewinsky and he was "deeply regretful,
" but he has paid for it.
</P>
<P>
"We all pay for our mistakes," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made it clear that his president library would not
ignore his impeachment by the House and trial and acquittal in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
"We have to deal with it, it is an important part" of his
presidency, Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Justice Delays Turnover of Cuban Boy to Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The department said that it has been asked by the 11th Circuit
Court of Appeals to forestall any enforcement action in the matter
of Elian, pending their review of a motion for a temporary
injunction filed by attorneys for the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
The boy's relatives asked the appeals court in Atlanta to issue
an emergency order blocking any attempt by the government to
remove Elian from the family, pending further legal moves.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Elian's Miami relatives defied a government
order to turn over the boy by a deadline while the U.S.
authorities said they will not use force to take the boy away.
</P>
<P>
Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who has taken the custody
of the boy in Miami, had been instructed to deliver Elian to an
airport near Miami at 2 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said that there
won't be any immediate action by federal marshals to remove the
six-year-old boy from the home of the boy's Florida relatives and
return him to his father.
</P>
<P>
Reno, who met the family members Wednesday night, told
reporters in Miami that if the boy's relatives didn't work out a
solution, the government would take action in a "reasonable,
measured way."
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared to enforce the law, but I want to be clear that
if we are compelled to enforce our order, we intend to do so in a
reasonable, measured way, the approach that we have always taken
in this matter," she said.
</P>
<P>
After failing to get a deal with the family during the meeting
attended by the Cuban boy Wednesday, Reno ordered them to bring
him to the Opa-locka airport outside Miami at 2 p.m. for a flight
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said 50 police cars ringed the
airport and 200 officers were deployed to the area.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 last year after his mother and
other 11 people died when their boat capsized in the Atlantic off
Florida. His relatives in Miami then took custody of him,
insisting that the boy should remain in the United States even
after the boy's father came to the U.S. to pick up his son.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department ruled earlier this year that the
boy belongs to his father and should be returned to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Presents New Coins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Central Bank Thursday
presented the characteristics of the new fractional coins that
will replace the 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 sucre bills.
</P>
<P>
These fractional coins will start circulating in the local
market in the next three or four months because of the Ecuadoran
economy dollarization.
</P>
<P>
The new coins characteristics were approved by President
Gustavo Noboa, and the symbols that will be represented in every
one of these fractional coins were defined.
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Icaza, an official in the Cental Bank's managing
board and former foreign trade minister, announced at a press
conference that the 50-cent coin will have on its obverse the
faces of two children and will be called "Goodness."
</P>
<P>
The 25-cent coin will have on its obverse a humming bird, with
its wings spread and will be called "Liberty." The 10-cent coin
will be called "Truth," while the five-cent coin will have a snow-
covered mountain and a river, and will be called "Beauty."
</P>
<P>
The one-cent coin will have the relief of the American
continent.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Villagomez, BCE's Monetary Species Unit director,
confirmed that some 10 million U.S. dollar cent units will arrive
in Ecuador in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Villagomez said that the banks started to withdraw with more
frequency the dollars they have in their Central Bank accounts to
exchange them for sucres.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Economic Outlook Bright: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A report on the world economy
published Wednesday by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
projects a positive scenario for Brazil for this and next year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF study received here showed that the Brazilian gross
domestic product (GDP) will grow 4 percent this year and 4.5
percent the next, while its inflation rate will spin around 7 and
5 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Brazil has already recovered from the
turbulence which occurred at the beginning of 1999, when the
effects of the Russian crisis were having their heyday, taking the
Brazilian government to devalue the real before the time expected.
</P>
<P>
The IMF says that this recovery has been led by agriculture,
industrial production, and exports.
</P>
<P>
According to the IMF forecasts, Brazilian exports will increase
this year, while the current account deficit will be reduced and
completely covered by the arrival of direct foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The maintenance of the present budget policy and the
implementation of reforms to public administration and to the
social security system, together with an ample program of
privatization, must improve Brazil's access to international
credit, according to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF warned that the deceleration of the economy
and the rising trend of the rates of interest in the United States
could produce negative impacts on the recovery of the Brazilian
economy.

checkpoints for the control of the traffic in the country roads,
in which the rebels usually take hostages and burn buses and
trucks.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla group will also release the five crew members of
an Avianca airline plane that the rebels hijacked one year ago.
</P>
<P>
The airliner hijacking was the second of a series of three mass
kidnappings that the rebels used to press the government of
President Andres Pastrana to establish a neutral zone of
distension that would permit them to start a convocation of the
National Peace Convention.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Appeals Court Issues Temporary Stay for Cuban Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deputy Court Clerk Chris Basnett from the 11th Circuit Court of
Appeals said the stay was issued shortly after 3 p.m. EDT, one
hour after the government deadline passes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department announced earlier on Thursday that
it has agreed to delay any enforcement action to take six-year-old
Cuban boy from his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the department said that it has been asked by
the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to forestall any enforcement
action in the matter of Elian, pending their review of a motion
for a temporary injunction filed by attorneys for the Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
The boy's relatives asked the appeals court in Atlanta to issue
an emergency order blocking any attempt by the government to
remove Elian from the family, pending further legal moves.
</P>
<P>
Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who has taken the custody
of the boy in Miami, had been instructed to deliver Elian to an
airport near Miami at 2 p.m. EDT. Instead, he filed the emergency
appeal.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 last year after his mother and
other 11 people died when their boat capsized in the Atlantic off
Florida. His relatives in Miami then took custody of him,
insisting that the boy should remain in the United States even
after the boy's father came to the U.S. to pick up his son.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department ruled earlier this year that the
boy belongs to his father and should be returned to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Councillor Calls for Stiff Punishment to Witches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has been
urged to make amendments to the witchcraft act to give stiff
punishment to witches and wizards, Zambia News Agency reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Zambian councillor Joel Ndala as saying that
the law as it stands is lenient with people practising witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
Sorcerers or sorceress should not be shown any leniency as they
are making the lives of the people uncomfortable, he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that witchcraft cases would increase if the situation
is not checked by putting in place stiff penalties against those
proved guilty of such offences.
</P>
<P>
From time to time, one heard of a person who died from
mysterious illness or a suspected witch who had made some of his
family members insane or bewitched them and in some cases a
government institution which has been deserted by workers because
of witchcraft, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ndala said witchcraft exists especially in villages and is
reigning fear among some communities.
</P>
<P>
The sad part is that those practicing it even bewitched
innocent children, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government through the courts of law to impose
stiff punishment on those proved practicing witchcraft as a timely
warning to other wizards to stop the practice from spreading.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's economy is
expected to grow by 3.8 percent this year and four percent next
year, South African Press Association reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The forecasts were released by the International Monetary
Fund's (IMF's) World Economic Outlook, which attributed South
Africa's economic growth to rising European demand for the
country's exports, higher metals prices and effective fiscal
management.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also said South Africa's inflation rate is projected at
4.7 percent this year and will rise to 5.7 percent next year and
the country's unemployment rate is close to 40 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IMF predicted that economic growth in Africa as
a whole will bounce back to 4.4 percent this year from 2.2
percent last year and will hold steady next year.
</P>
<P>
"A rebound of activity in three of the largest economies,
namely Algeria, Nigeria and South Africa, is expected to lead this
recovery, but also significant is the continuing strong
performance projected for many of the smaller countries," the IMF
said.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Hold Mini-Summit on Second Monetary Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A mini-summit of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) would be held in the
Ghanaian capital next week to adopt a plan of action for the
introduction of a second monetary zone in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The summit is to be attended by heads of state from Ghana,
Gambia, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, said an ECOWAS official
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would also approve a task force to facilitate the
introduction of the zone, parallel to the existing West African
Franc (CFA) zone operated by the Francophone ECOWAS members, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, both zones are expected to be merged
into a single sub-regional currency by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Guinea, the only Francophone ECOWAS country, which does not
operate the CFA franc currency, would also attend the summit
scheduled for April 20, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 16-member organization endorsed the second
monetary zone, which is due to come into force by 2003, at their
22nd summit in December last year in Lome, the capital of Togo.
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit, a follow-up to the ministerial meeting held in
Abuja in February, would also approve a work program and
operational budget for the task force.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Warns Over Splittism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa warned on Thursday that his government will not
tolerate confrontational politics based on religious and tribal
intrigues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here at a function to commemorate Tanzanian late
president Julius Nyerere's 78th birthday, Mkapa said some elements
in the country are trying to drive a wedge among people using
their tribal and religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
Such tendencies are what Nyerere fought against, Mkapa said.
"It was not an easy task for Nyerere to build a country free from
religious and tribal differences."
</P>
<P>
"My advice today is that every one wishing this country a
prosperous future by instilling national unity, peace and love for
the future generation as Mwalimu (Kiswahili word for "teacher", a
respectful address for Nyerere) was always crusading should join
my government in discarding such misdeeds," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described Nyerere, who died of leukemia last October in a
London hospital, as an architect of Tanzania's independence. He
managed to unite the 120 tribes in the country and also
contributed to the forging of the union between Tanganyika and
Zanzibar, Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
The commemorating function was also attended by Vice President
Omar Ali Juma, former President Ali Hassan Mwinyi and Maria
Nyerere, wife of Julius Nyerere.

<HEADLINE> S. African Competition Laws to Come Under Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's controversial
new competition laws, which have already twice been challenged in
the courts since coming into being last November, will come under
the spotlight at a conference in Midrand north of Johannesburg
next week.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, which starts on Monday, will bring
together representatives from the private sector, government
regulatory authorities as well as international experts and
leading economists to discuss the issue, the South African Press
Association reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Keynote speakers will include Trade and Industry Minister Alec
Erwin and Public Enterprises Minister Jeff Radebe.
</P>
<P>
The most recent case concerning the Competition Laws was an
appeal case by the country's largest bank, Stanbic, against a
ruling by the High Court that the new Competition Act has no role
in the proposed hostile takeover of Stanbic by its smaller rival
Nedcor bank.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein upheld a High
Court decision, ruling that the merger must be adjudicated in
terms of the Banks Act and that the competition authorities merely
have to be consulted in terms of the Competition Act.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin has made it clear that
it was never the intention that the Competition Act play second
fiddle to other regulatory legislation, but rather that it serve
as the prime legislation in competition matters.
</P>
<P>
"Although the recent decision by the Supreme Court of Appeal
has settled to some extent the jurisdictional debate on bank and
insurance mergers, it has also highlighted the urgent need for a
holistic review of the regulatory framework in South Africa," the
Competition Commission says.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Does Not Need Eritrean Ports: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi reiterated here on Wednesday that his country does
not need ports of Eritrea to transport relief food from the world
community.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Meles said Ethiopia is able to
transport the food required to save the famine victims if
assistance is made available at the ports of Djibouti and Berbera
of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
If effective use of the ports is made, there is no need to use
other ports, he told Catherine Bertini, executive director of the
Rome-based World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
Bertini arrived in Ethiopia Tuesday to gather information about
the current drought situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drought that has been continuing for three years,
the prime minister said the government has done all it could
within the limit of resources available to the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has made a lot of progress in terms of
grain production, he said, adding that "it is because we have made
such progress that we are able to buy up to 100,000 tons of grain
locally to cover some our requirements."
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia harvested roughly 100 million quintals of grain in
fiscal 1998, roughly 80 million in 1999 and about 85 million this
year, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We will speed up process of development in the country so that
we will be able to feed ourselves," he said, stressing that
Ethiopia can realize food self-sufficiency in the future.

<HEADLINE> Jiang, Barak Hope for Closer Sino-Israeli Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said Thursday that there is great potential for the development of
Sino-Israeli ties, and the two sides should join hands in expanding
mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He made this remark at a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Although China and Israel are different in terms of domestic
situation, development levels and population and size, Jiang said,
they share the aspiration of speeding up the development of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Barak said China is a country with great development potential,
and there is bright future for the advancement of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he has witnessed China's rapid
development during his two trips there.
</P>
<P>
Israel is advanced in many hi-tech fields, Barak said, Israel
and China should learn from each other because there are many
opportunities for them to strengthen cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Israel has opened its door for cooperation with
China in the fields of industry, agriculture and advanced
technology. "Israel would like to participate in China's
development, including the massive development of its western
region," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president is here on a state visit. Earlier
Thursday, he met with Israeli Vice Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister David Levy and the opposition Likud party leader Ariel
Sharon on separate occasions.

<HEADLINE> Canadian PM Denies Taking in Palestinian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien has denied press reports that his country would take in
some 15,000 Palestinians refugees as part of a solution to the
refugee issue in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian embassy here released a statement Thursday saying "
There is no agreement with Israel and no undertaking with any party
for Canada to take in Palestinian refugees."
</P>
<P>
The Canadian leader also stressed that the Palestinian refugee
question has to be resolved by the parties concerned in the region,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after press reports quoted an unnamed
Israeli official as saying on Wednesday that Chretien had promised
to take in 15,000 Palestinian refugees during his talks on Sunday
with his Israeli counterpart Ehud Barak in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Chretien will arrive in Amman on Friday for a three-day official
visit to hold talks with King Abdullah Bin Hussein and Prime
Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh on bilateral talks and the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Canada has been chairing the Multilateral Peace Process Refugee
Working Group since its establishment in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Chretien stressed that as the chair country, it would be "
inappropriate for Canada to impose its views or prejudge the
outcome of negotiations to resolve this difficult issue."
</P>
<P>
The fate of millions of Palestinian refugees is one of the
thorny issues in the on-going final status peace talks between
Israel and the Palestinians, alongside borders, Jewish settlements
and the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Over 3 million Palestinians have fled their home since the
creation of Israel in 1948 as a result of wars between the Jewish
state and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Currently Jordan is home to some 1.2 million Palestinian
refugees, most of them have been granted Jordanian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordan supported the Palestinian refugees in the
kingdom to choose between returning to their homeland or asking for
compensation from parties concerned.

<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
expressed his conviction here Thursday that leaders in the Middle
East have wisdom and courage to realize the "peace of the brave" in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak during their
meeting Thursday afternoon that it is natural that there are
difficulties and obstacles in the present negotiations on the
Middle East peace, but the difficulties can be overcome.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation for the efforts Barak has made
for re-launching the peace negotiations since he took office last
July.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Jiang on the latest developments in the Middle East
peace process, Barak said that Israel will spare no efforts to push
forward the process.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as a permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council, China has played an important role in the Middle East
peace process, and Israel hopes that China will exert more
influence on the issue.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Jiang and Barak met the press and answered
questions about the economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is paying a state visit to Israel, the first leg of his
five-nation tour which will also take him to Palestine, Turkey,

<HEADLINE> Russian Ministers Urges Ratification of START II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov met with lawmakers
Thursday ahead of debates in the State Duma lower house of
parliament on ratification of the START II treaty.
</P>
<P>
In a closed-door hearing, the ministers urged Duma deputies to
ratify the long-delayed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the
United States as a way to rid of the aging nuclear warheads and
concentrate funds on new weapons, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty signed with Washington in 1993, the two
countries will cut their nuclear warheads each from some 6,000 to
3,000-3,500 by 2007.
</P>
<P>
Duma deputies are scheduled to start debating in the lower
house Friday morning and then vote on whether to approve the
document, which was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"I think concern over the future of Russia and its security
will prevail and deputies will vote in favor," Sergeyev told
reporters after addressing the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
"We've little room to maneuver," he said. "The reality is such
that it is essential to ratify START II and move on to START III."
</P>
<P>
Many of the 450 deputies were reportedly won over by the
ministers' statements in the conviction that Moscow should not
spend money from the already meager coffer on "arms eaten away by
rust," said Lyubov Sliska, the Duma's first deputy speaker, in an
interview with the ORT public television.
</P>
<P>
"It is better to create new technologies, missile systems, such
as Topol-M," she said. Russia has already deployed two 10-rocket
batches of the new-generation missile system.
</P>
<P>
Most observers predict that START II will clear the State Duma
Friday, now that the Communist Party, which staunchly opposes
ratification, wields far less influence in the chamber.

<P>
Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who has taken the custody
of the boy in Miami, had been instructed to deliver his grand-
nephew to an airport near Miami at 2 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said that
there won't be any immediate action by federal marshals to remove
the Cuban shipwreck survivor, Elian Gonzalez, from the home of the
boy's Florida relatives and return him to his father.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. authorities had reportedly told the boy's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, and his family to turn Elian over to them at 2 p.
m. local time, for return to his father.
</P>
<P>
Reno, who met the family members Wednesday night, told
reporters in Miami that if the boy's relatives didn't work out a
solution, the government would take action in a "reasonable,
measured way."
</P>
<P>
After failing to get a deal with the family during the meeting
attended by the Cuban boy, Reno ordered them to bring him to the
Opa-locka airport outside Miami at 2 p.m. for a flight to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said 50 police cars ringed the
airport and 200 officers were deployed to the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-elect Vladimir V.
Putin moved Thursday to settle a row between the country's two
huge state-owned electricity and natural gas giants.
</P>
<P>
Putin summoned the bosses of electricity firm United Energy
System (UES) and Gazprom, the world's largest gas company, to the
Kremlin to settle their differences.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Chubais, the UES head, and Gazprom's Rem Vyakhirev
appeared nearer to settling their spat.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom cut gas deliveries to UES's power stations from April 1,
arguing it did not have enough gas, and it suggested other types
of fuel be used instead. It also said it wanted UES to pay 100
percent in cash for supplies and to repay a debt of 1.57 billion U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In turn, Chubais said UES would have to cut electricity to 11
towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
"On the most pressing problems of today and of the second
quarter there is on the whole a base understanding, there is an
understanding of how we will solve the current problems," the Itar-
Tass news agency quoted Chubais as saying.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: Goal of Halving Poverty Attainable, But Difficult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The goal of halving by 2015
the proportion of the world's people who live in extreme poverty
can still be reached if economic growth resumes without further
increase in inequality, but achieving the goal will be difficult,
the World Bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, in its World Development Indicators 2000 (WDI),
said its annual statistical portrait of people and the state of
their world, a sixth of the world's population -- primarily the
people of North America, Europe, and Japan -- received nearly 80
percent of world income, an average of 70 U.S. dollars per day, in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank said, the 57 percent of the world's
population in the 63 poorest countries received only 6 percent of
world income, an average of less than 2 dollars per day.
</P>
<P>
In East Asia, "the proportion and number of people living in
extreme poverty has fallen sharply since 1987, mainly because of
progress in China," the bank said. However, in South Asia, the
number of people in extreme poverty rose from 495 million to 522
million, while in Sub-Saharan Africa the number of very poor
people increased by some 48 million to 291 million.
</P>
<P>
On globalization, the World Bank said the numbers in the WDI
underline that while globalization is creating new opportunities
for the poorest people in the world to improve their lives, it has
also brought new risks that could further widen the immense gap
between the haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
"In general, despite the setback in the late 1990s, the world's
economy continues to become more integrated, and developing
countries are realizing the benefits. Lower trade barriers in
industrialized countries have stimulated developing country
exports, creating the jobs and economic growth needed for
sustained poverty reduction," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to debt relief and aid, the World Bank said more
rapid reductions in poverty will require improved policies in
developing countries, especially those that are lagging farthest
behind, as well as increased support from the industrialized
countries for poor countries that adopt the necessary reforms.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Republican Budget for Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Republicans pushed through the
U.S. House Thursday a final budget of 1.83 trillion U.S. dollars
for next year that calls for tax cuts, debt reduction and extra
money for defense, education and medical research.
</P>
<P>
The House passed the measure on a near party-line 220-208 vote,
setting up likely final approval by the Senate later in the day.
President Bill Clinton does not have to sign the plan, which sets
spending and tax targets for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
But none of the subsequent 13 annual spending bills which
actually provide the money, or any tax bill, will become law
without the president's signature. With Republicans planning
deeper tax cuts and less spending than Democrats prefer, the
election-year battle lines were already clear.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in a speech to the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, said the Republican budget was "loaded with exploding tax
breaks and untenable cuts in critical investments."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to veer from the proven path onto a trail of
unmet obligations, unrealistic cuts and unnecessary giveaways. We
can't squander the moment by squandering the surplus," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Republican plan calls for at least 150 billion dollars in
tax cuts through fiscal 2005, and up to an estimated 215 billion
dollars, depending on how much economic growth occurs over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wants 99 billion dollars in tax cuts over the period,
plus 96 billion dollars in higher taxes on tobacco and some
corporate transactions.
</P>
<P>
Like Clinton, the Republicans would set aside the entire Social
Security surplus, about 1 trillion dollars over the next five
years, to reduce the publicly held debt. If achieved, many
economists say that would put downward pressure on interest rates
and spur the economy. Of the 5.7-trillion-dollar national debt, 3.
6 trillion dollars are held by the public.
</P>
<P>
The Republican budget also sets aside up to 40 billion dollars
over five years for creation of prescription drug benefits for
Medicare recipients or other changes in the program. It does not,
however, require action on such a program.
</P>
<P>
The budget calls for 311 billion dollars for defense, or about
5 billion dollars more than Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
And it sets about 289 billion dollars for many domestic
programs, roughly 30 billion dollars less than the president
proposed. That includes proposed increases for schools, veterans
and research, which will have to await the coming spending bills.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the budget covers interest payments on the federal
debt and automatically paid benefits like Social Security,
Medicare and Medicaid.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy's Miami Relatives Defy U.S. Government Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who has taken the custody
of the boy in Miami, had been instructed to deliver Elian to an
airport near Miami at 2 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said that
there won't be any immediate action by federal marshals to remove
the six-year-old boy from the home of the boy's Florida relatives
and return him to his father.
</P>
<P>
Reno, who met the family members Wednesday night, told
reporters in Miami that if the boy's relatives didn't work out a
solution, the government would take action in a "reasonable,
measured way."
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared to enforce the law, but I want to be clear that
if we are compelled to enforce our order, we intend to do so in a
reasonable, measured way, the approach that we have always taken
in this matter," she said.
</P>
<P>
After failing to get a deal with the family during the meeting
attended by the Cuban boy Wednesday, Reno ordered them to bring
him to the Opa-locka airport outside Miami at 2 p.m. for a flight
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said 50 police cars ringed the
airport and 200 officers were deployed to the area.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 last year after his mother and
other 11 people died when their boat capsized in the Atlantic off
Florida. His relatives in Miami then took custody of him,
insisting that the boy should remain in the United States even
after the boy's father came to the U.S. to pick up his son.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department ruled earlier this year that the
boy belongs to his father and should be returned to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Approves Blix's Working Plan for UNMOVIC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Thursday approved the working plan by Hans Blix,
executive chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) for the new weapons regime in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council reviewed and
discussed Blix's report Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
In the report which was formally presented to the Security
Council early this week, Blix proposed the staff structure for the
UNMOVIC with strong experts and technical personnel rather than
political functionaries, an apparent bid to make it different from
the now defunct United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and
encourage Iraq to cooperate with the new arms inspection regime.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Robert Fowler, president of the
Security Council for the current month and Canada's ambassador to
the U.N., said the council members had reached agreement on the
report and would send a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to inform him of the approval.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Blix recommended most UNMOVIC staff will be U.N.
employees, which would firmly place them under the U.N. Charter
rule and bars them from working for any other outside body.
</P>
<P>
Blix proposed to eliminate the post of executive deputy but set
up an executive assistant with less power.
</P>
<P>
On the role of the college of commissioners for the UNMOVIC,
Blix said they would meet at least four times a year to provide
professional advice and guidance for the UNMOVIC and the decision-
making would be his alone.
</P>
<P>
Blix stressed that the UNMOVIC, like the UNSCOM, has the right
to have immediate, unconditioned and unrestricted access to any
and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of
transport.
</P>
<P>
Blix said the flow of intelligence of the UNMOVIC must be only
one way and have regard only to matters of relevance to the
mandate of the UNMOVIC.
</P>
<P>
He also said the new arms regime's public information officer
will ensure that there will be single authoritative point of
contact with the media, Blix himself or someone authorized for him.
</P>
<P>
The UNMOVIC was created by U.N. resolution 1284 adopted last
December. U.N. arms inspection in Iraq has been suspended since
the U.S.-led military strikes against the country in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has refused to accept U.N. resolution 1284, saying lifting
sanctions is the precondition for U.N. arms inspectors to return.

<HEADLINE> Food Aid for Mozambican Flood Victims Low on Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has
warned that the emergency food stocks for flood victims in
southern and central Mozambique may soon run out if the allocation
of more funds is not speeded up.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambique News Agency Thursday quoted WFP spokesman Inyene
Udoyen as saying that there are only about 5,000 tons of food
left, which is enough for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment we are using stocks that were meant for
development projects, such as 'food for work' schemes in areas
vulnerable to disasters, the project for building schools with the
support of the World Bank, and the food intended for school
meals," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his organization is expecting to receive a further
10,000 tons, which will just be sufficient until mid-May.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called for urgency in the granting of funds, to
compensate for the time it takes for the suppliers to deliver the
goods and the time- consuming rules imposed for the disbursement
of funds.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the donors will respond to the appeal for an
allocation of 30 million U.S. dollars so that we can respond to
the needs of the people affected by the floods in various parts of
the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Udoyen added that the WFP has been conducting bilateral
negotiations with donors, since the launching of the last updated
appeal by the Mozambican government on March 22.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the May conference (which is to take place in
Rome) will be the big opportunity for the donors to announce their
contributions," he said, stressing that there should be a
response, otherwise stocks will run out.
</P>
<P>
He said the WFP is preparing, together with local
non-government organizations and district administrations, various
actions for resettling people displaced by the floods.
</P>
<P>
These include the urgent rehabilitation of about 1,000
kilometers of roads and several bridges to allow access to
isolated areas, so that food can be distributed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesperson for the National Disasters Management
Institute (INGC) Antonio Macheve also complained of the slow donor
response.
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is the need for money to pay for the present
expenses. What is easily quantifiable, at the moment, is the food
component, where the WFP needs 30 million U.S. dollars, but it is
also necessary to take into account resettlement, which has
already started, and logistics," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 490,000 people are still in accommodation centers, he
said, adding that about 650,000 people in all will need assistance
during the next six months.
</P>
<P>
"We need more assistance for us to be able to respond to the
needs," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Promises Fair Trial of Jews Accused of Espionage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian judicial official on
Thursday promised a "fair, lawful and impartial" trial of the 13
Jews arrested on espionage charges, saying there is no difference
between Muslims and Jews before law.
</P>
<P>
"All the accused will be treated in the same way according to
the law and no one in Iran will be on trial because of their
opinions," Hussein Ali Amiri, head of the Justice Department of the
southern Fars province, told a press conference in the provincial
capital of Shiraz.
</P>
<P>
He said the first session of the trial of the Jews was held "in
a congenial atmosphere among the judge, accused and their
attorneys" Thursday morning in Shiraz, the center of Iran's 35,000-
strong Jewish community, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door trial adjourned Thursday noon and was postponed
till May 1 upon the request of a defense lawyer as the timing of
the trial coincided with Passover, a Jewish feast.
</P>
<P>
The families of eight Jews have appointed defense lawyers, the
court designated lawyers for two others, while the three who were
released on bail have not appointed any lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers called for a postponement of the trial as they
have limited time to go through details of the case, which has
aroused grave concerns from the U.S., Israel and other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Iranian Jews along with eight Muslims were arrested in
March and April last year on charges of spying for the United
States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israel have denied any link between their
intelligence services and the Iranian Jews, and urged Iran to
release them since their arrest. But Tehran has rejected the appeal
as "interference" in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
On the likelihood that some of the accused would face the death
penalty, Amiri said the judge would act independently and any
specific ruling cannot be predicted.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the ruling would be fair and based on the
law. "All the accused expressed satisfaction with the way they were
treated," he said, adding that four of the accused confessed to
their crime in the first court session and asked for leniency.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the case has not been completed for all
the accused and the judge would only rule on that portion of the
case which has been completed.
</P>
<P>
He said the trial was held behind closed doors for national
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
The accused are of different professions including university
professors, teachers and entrepreneurs, he said, currently 10 of
the accused are in detention while the rest, including three Jews
and eight Muslims have been released on bail.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the representative of the Jewish community at the
Iranian Majlis (parliament) Manuchehr Eliasi said that it is not
important for the families of the defendants whether the court
hearing is held in public or in camera, but the important issue is
to conduct a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to IRNA, he expressed hope that the defendants would be
cleared of the charges. The charge of espionage against the
defendants is likely to have become weaker, but another charge
brought against them is acts against national security, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. Over U.S., British Aggressions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has protested to the U.N.
over the continued bombings and airspace violations by the U.S. and
British warplanes from April 1-7, and urged the U.N. to intervene
to halt such aggressions, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In two letters to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
president of the U.N. Security Council separately, Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said that during the seven days, the U.S.
and British aircraft made 202 armed sorties, 58 from Turkey and 144
from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, over the southern and northern
provinces of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British planes bombed civilian and service
facilities on April 6, 14 civilians were killed and 19 others
injured, representing one of the heaviest casualties Iraq has
suffered since December 1998, when the U.S. and Britain launched
the Operation Desert Fox air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi government vehemently rejects the so-called no-fly
zones imposed unilaterally by the U.S. and Britain under feeble
pretexts to justify their aggressions on Iraq," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz urged Annan and president of the U.N. Security Council to
intervene to halt the aggressions against Iraq, said the INA.
</P>
<P>
The so-called no-fly zones were set up after the Gulf War, with
the claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south from possible attacks by the Iraqi government
troops.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has never recognized the legality of the air exclusion
zones, which were not directly covered by any U.N. Security Council
resolution.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Official Renews Call for Lifting Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Yemeni Parliament
Speaker Sheikh Abdullah Al-Ahmar on Thursday renewed a call for
lifting the decade-old U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Our demand to lift the sanctions on the Iraqi people is an Arab
request. It is a call made in every occasion to help the helpless
Iraqis," said Al-Ahmar at a news conference held here during his
four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
But he underlined that Kuwait "has nothing to do with the
sanctions, it was a decision by the United Nations and the United
States."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed harsh economic sanctions against Iraq
since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. And the Iraqi government has
been drumming up support from the international community for the
lifting of the sanctions which hit the ordinary Iraqi people
hardest.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahmar added that there is "no link between Kuwait's demand
for the release of its prisoners in Iraq and the embargo on Iraq.
It's a U.N. decision."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to over 600 Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti nationals
who Kuwait insists are still held in Iraqi jails. Baghdad denied
the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Yemeni official reaffirmed Sanaa's readiness to
help free the alleged Kuwaiti prisoners. "We have always emphasized
that we are ready to play any role to release the prisoners," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Kuwait by Al-Ahmar, who heads a delegation of
government ministers and lawmakers, is the first of its kind since
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait which touched off the Gulf War in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait cut off its diplomatic ties with Yemen after Sanaa showed
sympathy with Iraq during the war.
</P>
<P>
Their relations were fully restored in May last year, when Yemen
reopened its embassy in Kuwait after a nine-year closure.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Needs Nuclear Energy: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will in no way give up the
choice of nuclear energy, said Turkish Minister of Energy and
Natural Resources Cumhur Ersumer on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ersumer made the remarks while addressing the "Energy Sources"
symposium in Canakkale, a city at the mouth of the Dardanelles
Strait, reported Turkey's Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey needs nuclear energy and other energies for
the country's development, noting that nuclear energy has made
significant contributions to the development of industrialized
nations.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, poor in fossil energy, decided several years ago to
build its first nuclear power station in Akkuyu, a Mediterranean
port city in southern Turkey, a move that has ever since aroused a
severe controversy between pros and cons in the country.
</P>
<P>
Three international consortia have been bidding for the 5-
billion-U.S.-dollar Akkuyu plant project.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Electricity Generation Utility (TEAS) has postponed
for several times announcement on the winner of the contract and
decided last Friday again to extend their bids until April 21.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Treasury had refused to provide a
guarantee for the financing of the costly nuclear project in view
of the current economic stability and disinflation program.
</P>
<P>
Ersumer acknowledged the fact that there are people who oppose
development of nuclear energy and they have stepped up their anti-
nuclear efforts.
</P>
<P>
On other energy options, the minister said that "There are
projects on solar energy and we are discussing them."
</P>
<P>
"Turkey imports 90 percent of natural gas and 95 percent of oil
the country consumes every year. We should evaluate all our energy
sources," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyz Lawmaker Rejects U.S. Criticism Over Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-three Kyrgyz lawmakers
Thursday accused U.S. observers of not being objective in
assessing the results of the recent parliamentary election in the
Central Asian republic.
</P>
<P>
In an open later, the lawmakers said international missions had
shown "an non-objective and even negative assessment" of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that election was held in compliance with
legislation, which had been prepared with the assistance of
experts for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe "to meet high international standards."
</P>
<P>
"That is why it was on the whole staged on the basis of strict
adherence to democratic principles and according to international
norms," the Interfax news agency quoted the letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
The arrest in late March of Felix Kulov, an opposition leader,
"was not related to his activity aimed at the state's current
leadership," it said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the arrest "was a logical result of a more-than-two-
year investigation into the criminal and anti-constitutional
activities which he had committed during the years when he
occupied key government positions," the lawmakers said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Wants Immediate Release of Gulf Tanker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
Thursday called for the immediate release of the Russian tanker
Akademik Pustovoit and its crew held in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is concerned over "the continuing groundless detention
by the multinational naval force" of the Russian tanker in the
Gulf," the ministry said in a statement carried by the Interfax
news agency.
</P>
<P>
"In its contacts with the American side, the Foreign Ministry
urgently poses the issue of the necessity for an operative and
objective investigation and the immediate release of the Russian
crew and the carrier vessel," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian tanker was held by U.S. navy ships last Thursday on
suspicion of smuggling embargoed Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
"Despite our repeated appeals, we have received no confirmation
of the lawfulness of the multinational naval force's activities,"
the document said.
</P>
<P>
It said this was the fourth detention of the Akademik Pustovoit,
which carries fuel oil for a foreign freighter from the Iranian
port of Bandar Mahshahr and does not enter Iraqi territorial
waters.
</P>
<P>
"We state once again that if weighty objective evidence
justifying the measures taken against the tanker does not appear,
the Foreign Ministry will uphold the relevant complaints of the
Russian ship owner to the multinational naval force in order to
get compensation for losses suffered," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Russians Support Chechen Campaign Despite High Toll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The campaign against Chechen
rebels remains popular among the Russians despite mounting
casualties suffered by federal troops in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent opinion poll conducted by the APRII
agency for regional political research, 60 percent of the surveyed
last Monday said the federal troops must carry the operation in
Chechnya through to victory, the Interfax news agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Only 22 percent of the 1,600 adults questioned in 90 cities,
towns and villages of 49 Russian regions said they were sure that
talks should start with the Chechens. The poll has an error margin
of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of the military actions in Chechnya seemed not
to have been dented by mounting casualties among federal troops in
the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
According to General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the
Russian General Staff, a total of 2,119 federal servicemen have
been killed and 6,253 wounded in the anti-terrorist campaign.
</P>
<P>
Manilov told a Thursday news conference that of those killed, 1,
396 were from Defense Ministry units and 723 came from the
Interior Forces.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the military assaults on Chechen rebels last
September following waves of armed Chechen incursions into
neighboring Dagestan and a spate of apartment explosions that left
some 300 people dead in Moscow and two other cities. Chechen
militants were accused of being behind the blasts.
</P>
<P>
The war in Chechnya was in its final stage, with all principal
Chechen separatist forces beaten and federal troops wiping out "
remnants of bandit formations," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the federal forces were killing up to 30 rebels and
destroying 10 to 12 rebel bases or ammunition depots every day.

<HEADLINE> EU Lends Vaccine to Japan, S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday that the European Union has decided to lend to Japan and
South Korea vaccines to combat the outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease in cattle.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, said
that the vaccine lend would be made from the EU antigen bank and
the commission's decision to lend followed a request from the
Japanese and South Korean authorities.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the foot-and-mouth disease in cattle was first
discovered and confirmed in Japan on March 24 this year and in
South Korea on April 2.
</P>
<P>
One million doses of the vaccine will be sent to Japan with the
first delivery scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Like the EU, the Japanese and South Korean authorities follow a
non-vaccination policy against the disease and vaccines are only
used in case of emergency.
</P>
<P>
The two Asian countries will replace the vaccines provided by
the EU within six months and the EU has important reserves of the
virus antigen which is the basis for the production of the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The European Union maintains a bank with virus antigens
equivalent to about 30 million vaccine doses against the foot-and-
mouth disease for use in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious viral disease,
known to cause significant economic losses to cattle farmers. In
general, an outbreak of the disease immediately leads to
restrictions on international trade in livestock and in products
such as meat, milk and certain cheeses originating from the
country affected.
</P>
<P>
The disease in animals, however, does not pose any threat to
human health.

<HEADLINE> Food Aid Pledges Almost Match Estimates: EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said Thursday
that international food aid pledges almost matched up with the
estimates about the shortage in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
EU officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the
press that satellite images and field trips helped international
observers to make the estimates of Ethiopian food shortage at 821,
000 tons for this year.
</P>
<P>
So far, total donor pledges are over 800,000 tons, of which the
15-nation European bloc pledged to provide more than half. The EU
food aid to arrive in Ethiopia in 2000 totals 432,526 tons,
according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, 282,526 tons are being offloaded, shipped or
procured with the remaining 150,000 tons in the process of being
allocated.
</P>
<P>
From all donors, total shipments of food aid expected to arrive
in Ethiopia between now and July is 504,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The EU food aid will be channeled to three relief programs, the
non-governmental organizations, the World Food Program and the
Ethiopian government, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Despite international efforts, food rations per head per month
in Ethiopia is only six kilograms as against the targeted 12.5
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The current food shortage in the African country has been
caused by a poor harvest due to the lack of rains, the EU
officials explained.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has been a major supplier of food aid to
Ethiopia in the past 25 years, during which period 38 percent of
all EU aid to Ethiopia has been used for food aid activities.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years alone, 250 million euros (240 million
U.S. dollars) have been spent on food aid for Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> New Case of Madcow Disease Found in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- One more case of madcow disease
was confirmed Thursday in Belgium, where altogether 13 cases have
so far been reported on the disease.
</P>
<P>
The new case, the third this year, was confirmed by a report on
local television RTBF, a radio and television service for the
French-speaking part of the country.
</P>
<P>
But the television report did not say where the case was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
Belgium announced discovery of its first case of madcow disease
on October 31, 1997. The diseased cow was located at a farm in
Mean in the east of Namur province.
</P>
<P>
The disease, commonly known as the madcow disease and
scientifically termed as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, was
first found in 1985 in Britain, where a total of 170,000 cows and
cattle were confirmed to have contracted the disease.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland is the next country in Europe to be heavily plagued
by the madcow disease, followed by Ireland, Portugal, France,
Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. Up till now as many as 3
million diseased cows and cattle have been destroyed through
incineration.
</P>
<P>
British beef and cow products had been banned from exporting
and the European Union lifted the ban only last autumn though
France is still barring British beef from entering its market.
</P>
<P>
The EU countries are now trying to trace down each of the
cattle herds and only cow and cattle raised for a designated
period of time are allowed for production of beef and other
products for human and animal consumption.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: South Has Better Understanding on Gobalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The word "globalization" is one of
the most frequently used words by leaders from developing
countries who are attending a summit here, but they are finding
themselves with a better understanding on what the word means in
the world economy and politics.
</P>
<P>
The more thorough understanding was achieved as some 60 heads
of state and government, together with senior officials from 122
countries, gathered in the Cuban capital of Havana for the first
South Summit of the Group of 77 (G-77) in the body's 36-year
history.
</P>
<P>
The South Summit came at the turn of century when many
developing countries, small and weak ones in particular, are being
marginalized in the globalization process, and the gap between the
haves and the have-nots is widening in economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
South and world Leaders took advantage of the historic event to
study the two sides of globalization, including its impact on the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many countries agreed that the pace of globalization
was quickened in the wake of the rapid progress in technology,
including information technology. However, they also realized that
interdependence is increasing among countries and the world is
linked as a whole in its economic development.
</P>
<P>
In fact, globalization, through trade, investment, capital
flows and advancements in technology, has had a profound impact on
all aspects of international relations.
</P>
<P>
Both Cuban President Fidel Castro, leader of the host country
to the summit, and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, chairman
of G-77, agreed that the rich and poor countries are traveling
together in the tide of globalization.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the same boat," Obasanjo said, referring to the
impact of globalization on the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Applying the similar metaphor, Castro said, "Gobalization is an
objective reality underlining the fact that we are all passengers
on the same vessel, that is, this planet where we all live. But,
passengers on this vessel are traveling in very different
conditions."
</P>
<P>
"Eighty-five percent of the passengers on this ship are crowded
together in its dirty hold suffering hunger, diseases and
helplessness," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rich are enjoying access to the Internet, cell phones and
global communication networks while the poor are living from hand
to mouth.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this vessel is carrying too much injustice to
remain afloat and it pursues such an irrational and senseless
route that it cannot call on a safe port," he said. "This vessel
seems destined to clash with an iceberg. If that happened, we
would all sink with it."
</P>
<P>
On the impact of globalization, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said at the prestigious Havana University, "Only a
relatively small number of countries are enjoying these games.
Many millions of people are excluded, left behind in squalor."
</P>
<P>
A lot of developing countries, at the summit, cried out to see
globalization as a powerful and dynamic force for strengthening
cooperation and development. Apart from increasing the
vulnerabilities of the South countries, the process presents
opportunities as well as risks and challenges.
</P>
<P>
"To those already enjoying them, the benefits of globalization
are clear: faster economic growth, higher living standards, the
rapid spread of new technology and modern management skills,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Many developing countries are already showing the way -- India
with its booming software industry; Costa Rica with its microchip
exports; Mauritius, using the Internet to position its textile
industry globally; Mali, using an Internet to give its citizens
more effective administrative services. These are just a few
examples.
</P>
<P>
However, developing countries has a really long way to go
before they can largely merge into the mainstream of global
economy.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve the strategic goal, many South countries
came to realize that the North-South relations should be further
improved in addition to the existing hard efforts to strengthen
cooperation among themselves and set up a more just and fair
international political and economic system.
</P>
<P>
The eradication of poverty and the attainment of sustainable
development in the South demands "a constructive and purposeful
relationship" between the developed North and the developing South,
Thabo Mbeki, chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), said.
</P>
<P>
"Speedy movement forward towards their accomplishment requires
a constructive and purposeful relationship between ourselves and
the countries of the North," he said.
</P>
<P>
The North-South relationship must address "the alleviation of
the debt burden carried by many of our countries, including its
cancellation, an effective mechanism to ensure a substantial
increase in capital flows into the developing economies as this is
a prerequisite for development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The focus should include the reversal of the trend resulting in
a sharp drop in official development assistance, the opening of
the markets of the developed countries to their products,
including agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
This should also cover the transfer of technology. If the
technology divided between North and South grows in the wake of
rapid advances in communication and bio-technology, then all will
suffer and not just the developing world.
</P>
<P>
The summit is expected to adopt the Havana Declaration and the
Program of Action, which will be conducive to the solidarity among
developing countries for stronger cooperation in order to
collectively face the challenge of globalization, observers here
said.

<HEADLINE> Somali Peace Conference to be Held in Djibouti Next Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The reconciliation conference
aimed at giving Somalia a central government will start on April
20 in Djibouti as planned, the head of a high level Djibouti
delegation said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Osman Ahmed Yussuf, advisor to Djibouti President Ismael Omar
Ghelleh, was speaking at a press briefing shortly after the
six-member delegation arrived in the Somali capital for the first
time since Djibouti announced a peace plan late last year.
</P>
<P>
Nothing has been changed in the plan, Yussuf said, adding that
during the conference in Djibouti, a President, a Prime Minister
and a speaker of parliament for Somalia will be announced.
</P>
<P>
The main Somali armed faction leaders except Ali Mahdi Mohamed
had immediately opposed the plan. However, the preparations for
the forthcoming Djibouti reconciliation conference have well been
underway.
</P>
<P>
During their short visit to Mogadishu, the delegation will be
meeting the various civic society groups, the traditional leaders,
clan politicians and the business community in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Yussuf said his delegation is also willing to see all those who
are interested in the peace.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention the faction leaders, but he said there is no
one the Djibouti government is segregating against in the peace
process for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
However, the local politicians see that the delegation may be
trying to persuade the faction leaders such as Hussein Mohamed
Aidid, Mohamed Qanyareh Afrah and Osman Ali Atto to attend the
meeting in Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
The Somali dignitaries who received the delegation included
General Mohamed Sheikh Osman, General Jilaow, General Mohamed Nur
Galal and many others including the Muslim scholars of the Islamic
courts.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 battle wagons and nearly 1,000 heavily armed
militiamen from the Islamic courts escorted the delegation from
Ballidogleh airport, about 90 kilometers south of Mogadishu, to
Hotel Ramadan where they will be staying during their short stay
in Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Angolan President Optimistic about G77 Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos said the on-going summit of Group 77 in Havana, Cuba, will
be successful as the political leaders are willing to outline a
strategy for the North/South negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos was quoted by the official news agency Angop as
saying that the North/South negotiation strategy will be
established in a way that the debt could be pardoned and the flow
of capitals directed to the countries of the south.
</P>
<P>
To the president, the assistance to the development and access
to fair credit terms shall be made available, thereby allowing
poorer countries to develop projects in the field of social
infrastructures and create conditions for development.
</P>
<P>
"But we have underlined that the future depends on ourselves, we
the third world countries must take our share of responsibility
and, therefore, set up appropriate mechanisms to realize our
objectives," said the president.
</P>
<P>
According to him, "there are some countries in Asia, Latin
America and Africa, that have achieved a very significant level of
development, some achievements in the technological field and have
accumulation of capital".
</P>
<P>
He said as well that these countries (of Asia, Africa and Latin
America) could well establish systems of coordination that allowed
the creation of funds to finance their own development.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Police Calls for Public Help in Fighting Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Senior Assistant Commissioner of
the Zimbabwean Police John Zvimba Thursday urged the public to
cooperate in the fight against corruption by not offering gifts to
the police.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a passout parade for 291 officers who have
completed a six- month training program, Zvimba said the public
should report any case of corruption using hotline and suggestion
boxes.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to warn you to desist from the temptation of
being corrupted by the society you will be policing," he told the
officers.
</P>
<P>
The police, he said, need cooperation from the public to
develop appropriate law and order management tactics.
</P>
<P>
"The duty of maintaining law and order depends for its success
on the amount of public support and cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important for policemen to know the extent to
which they could exercise their powers without infringing upon the
rights of individuals.
</P>
<P>
"Your training included an element of human rights to ensure
that as law enforcement agents you treat those you come in contact
with dignity and respect," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the police force has set a high standard of discipline
and reputation which should be maintained locally and outside the
country.
</P>
<P>
The police force would not hesitate to terminate services of
members whose discipline and performance are below standard, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Since February this year the police has suspended 55 officers
from the Harare province from active duty for corruption and
incompetence.
</P>
<P>
Last year, at least two officers were dismissed for corruption
every month from the 10,000 strong force, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Qualifies for Enhanced HIPC: WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Wednesday that Mozambique has qualified for an additional 600
million dollars worth of debt relief under the terms of the
enhanced HIPC (Heavily Indebted poor Countries) debt relief
initiative.
</P>
<P>
The International Development Association (IDA -- the Bank's
soft loans affiliate) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
have agreed to support "a comprehensive debt reduction package for
Mozambique", said the World Bank in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique reached the HIPC "completion point" on June 30 last
year: with the debt relief package being 3.7 billion U.S. dollars
in nominal terms (1. 7 billion U.S. dollars in net present value
terms - the net present value is the amount that would have to be
invested now to pay off the debt).
</P>
<P>
The new relief under enhanced HIPC brings the total up to 4.3
billion U. S. dollars in nominal terms and almost two billion U.S.
dollars in net present value terms.
</P>
<P>
This will push Mozambique's debt stock down to about 750
million U.S. dollars (net present value). In fact, once all the
calculations are made, the real figure for the debt stock may be
considerably lower, since several creditor nations (Britain,
Portugal and Finland, for example) have taken the unilateral
decision to cancel all or much of the debts owed by Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
But, just as with the original HIPC, there are conditions
attached to enhanced HIPC.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique will only receive the full amount of relief under
enhanced HIPC "when it satisfies the requirements for a floating
completion point, including adoption of a participatory poverty
reduction strategy paper", according to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
For Mozambique to obtain the full benefits of enhanced HIPC,
there must also be "maintenance of a stable macroeconomic
environment, as evidenced by satisfactory performance under a
program supported by an arrangement under the IMF's Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility."
</P>
<P>
The document adds that in response to the catastrophic
flooding that hit southern and central Mozambique earlier this
year, the World Bank and the IMF "decided to accelerate the debt
relief by forgiving 100 percent of the debt service owed by
Mozambique in the next 12 months, so that Mozambique will not have
to pay any debt service to either institution during this period".
</P>
<P>
Very few countries have so far qualified for either original
HIPC or enhanced HIPC. According to the World Bank, 36 countries
(29 of them in sub- Saharan Africa) are "expected to qualify" for
enhanced HIPC.
</P>
<P>
But so far only six countries have reached the completion point
of the original initiative (Mozambique, Uganda, Bolivia,
Mauritania, Tanzania, and Guyana), as the Bretton Woods
institutions demand that countries applying for HIPC must
demonstrate a "satisfactory track record" for perhaps as much as
three years first.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Investigate Violations of Sanctions Against Angolan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has set up a specialized
fact- finding committee to probe possible routes used by the
Angolan rebels to purchase arms in the east European country
through third parties or international armament traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The move stems from Bulgaria's appearing in the report prepared
by the United Nations experts in charge of investigating the
sanctions against the Savimbist rebels in Angola, said the
Bulgarian Embassy in Angola on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It said in a note that the Bulgarian authorities are determined
to communicate the findings to the United Nations Security
Council, as they "entirely share the sense of the sanctions and
that of the report by the group of experts of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has never had links with Jonas Savimbi
representatives, nor has it violated the sanctions imposed by the
United Nations against these rebels, the document said.
</P>
<P>
According to the note, Bulgaria is very worried to see that in
spite of pursuing a consistent policy on the observance of the
Security Council resolutions, there is still a possibility of
Bulgarian-made arms falling into the hands of the Savimbist
organization.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Stock Exchange Sees Another Tumbling Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- In abreast with Wall Street,
Canada's benchmark index saw a third tumbling day in a row
Wednesday, with one of the country's brightest tech stars plunging
to Earth.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index (TSE 300) closed
310.36 points or 3.32 percent lower at 9,047.67, losing nearly all
its surprise gains for the past month.
</P>
<P>
Up to 172.64 million shares worth 4.82 billion Canadian dollars
(about 3.30 billion U.S. dollars) changed hands at the TSE, where
decliners beat advancers 702 to 496 with another 225 issues
closing flat.
</P>
<P>
TSE 300 was downed due to the on-going heavy technology-focused
selloff, which cost Research in Motion Ltd. (RIM) 3.6 billion
Canadian dollars (about 2.5 billion U.S. dollars) in its market
value.
</P>
<P>
The Ontario-based world star in wireless pagers saw its shares
fall 52.65 dollars (about 36.01 U.S. dollars) to close at 68
dollars (about 46.51 U.S. dollars) after the company reported
revenue growth in the current quarter would be flat.
</P>
<P>
RIM shares traded at 260 dollars (about 177.84 U.S. dollars)
this year after ranking as the second best performer in Canada's
benchmark index in 1999.
</P>
<P>
There was also heavy selling in telecommunications equipment
maker Nortel Networks Corp., telecom giant BCE Inc. and a slew of
other Canadian tech companies.
</P>
<P>
Blue-chip heavyweights Nortel and BCE, which sank 10 percent
and 9 percent respectively, dragged the market lower in concert
with the tech-laden Nasdaq composite index, which closed 286.26
points, or 7 percent lower, at 3,769.64.
</P>
<P>
Skittish investors were concerned that they might have
overrated the high-flying technology sector, which would not be
able to meet expectations during this corporate earnings period.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Surge 1 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. wholesale prices shot up
1 percent in March, led by the biggest jump in energy costs in
nearly 10 years, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The advance in the Producer Price Index, which measures
inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, came from a
huge 5.8 percent gain in energy prices, the sharpest rise since a
7.5 percent increase posted in October 1990.
</P>
<P>
Excluding volatile energy and food categories, the "core" rate
of inflation at the wholesale level rose a tiny 0.1 percent, right
on target with many analysts' predictions, suggesting that most
other prices were well behaved.
</P>
<P>
In February, wholesale prices also surged 1 percent, which
marked the largest gain in nearly 10 years, while the core rate
rose an expected 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, wholesale prices have been rising at an
annual rate of 8.2 percent, compared with a 3 percent gain for all
of 1999. The pickup in this year's wholesale prices largely
reflects rising energy costs.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that retail
sales rose a bigger-than-expected 0.4 percent in March, but were
less brisk than the month before. But excluding the volatile
category of cars sales, March's total retail sales were up a
strong 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
And in a third report, the Labor Department said the number of
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week
rose by 3,000 to 264,000, but still left claims in a range
suggesting that companies are scrambling to find qualified workers.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times since
June 30 to slow the speeding economy and to keep inflation from
escalating. Given the outlook for strong continuing growth, many
analysts expect the Fed will boost rates again on May 16.

<HEADLINE> Security Alert in N.Irish Police Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Security forces in Northern
Ireland Thursday sealed off an area near the border following the
discovery of a suspicious object near a police station.
</P>
<P>
The cylindrical object was in a car parked near the police
station in Roslea, County Fermanagh, the west of the province.
</P>
<P>
The discovery followed an earlier report of a muffled explosion
shortly before midnight Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said a Volvo 340 hatchback was found with
all its windows blown out about 400 meters from the police station.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle was discovered near a house under construction at
approximately 0810 BST Thursday morning by a farmer.
</P>
<P>
He said four houses had been evacuated due to the discovery.
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth visited Hillsborough, just south of Belfast,
Wednesday on a trip that had sparked concern about possible
attacks by republican splinter groups.
</P>
<P>
She was making a rare visit to present a gallantry award to the
Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), the province's police force.
</P>
<P>
Security was tight but there were fears that republican
dissidents might stage attacks on security forces elsewhere in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's main extremist groups, including the Irish
Republican Army (IRA), are on ceasefire after 30 years of conflict
about the future of British rule.
</P>
<P>
But republican hardliners have launched sporadic attacks in a
bid to wreck a peace accord that they say cements London's
sovereignty over the disputed region.

<HEADLINE> UK Doctors "Allow" Elderly to Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in Britain were accused of
allowing elderly patients to die by deciding not to make attempts
to revive them should they fall unconscious as a result of serious
illness in hospital.
</P>
<P>
The Age Concern organization said Thursday doctors were
increasingly ignoring the wishes of patients -- and sometimes not
even asking patients -- when it comes to making resuscitation
decisions, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
British Medical Association guidelines state that patients or
their relatives should be consulted about any decision not to
resuscitate.
</P>
<P>
The BMA admits that some junior doctors may be too nervous to
involve patients and their relatives in discussions about whether
to revive or not.
</P>
<P>
Age Concern was calling for a full inquiry into the treatment
of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the case was highlighted of a cancer patient who
discovered that had she fallen unconscious in hospital, doctors
would have made no efforts to resuscitate her.
</P>
<P>
Jill Baker only found out after she left hospital that the
comment "inappropriate for resuscitation" had been written on her
notes.
</P>
<P>
Neither she nor her husband had been approached or asked for
their views on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Despite being "written off" by a doctor who had not even met
her, nine months later she is alive and enjoying life.
</P>
<P>
Campaigners said the case highlighted the way doctors were
flouting guidance on so-called "end of life" issues and making
decisions without the permission of patients.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Baker, 67, from Portsmouth, who has stomach cancer, was
admitted to a ward in the city's St Mary's Hospital last July
after a tube used in her chemotherapy treatment became infected
and she developed septicemia.
</P>
<P>
She eventually discharged herself because she was unhappy with
her care and demanded to see her hospital notes.
</P>
<P>
A doctor had written on top of the records, "In view of the
underlying diagnosis (cancer), in the event of cardiac arrest or
stroke, resuscitation would be inappropriate."
</P>
<P>
The note also said "Do not ring 555" -- the hospital number for
the resuscitation team.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for St Mary's Hospital said, "The hospital has
admitted that the Do Not Resuscitate message was put on Mrs Baker'
s notes inappropriately.
</P>
<P>
"The doctor involved was formally seen by the medical director
but no longer works for the hospital."

<HEADLINE> Putin, OSCE Head Discuss Chechnya, Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-elect Vladimir
Putin met Thursday with Benita Ferrero-Waldner, head of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and
the two discussed Chechnya and investment in Russia.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting in the Kremlin, Putin told Ferrero-Waldner
that the OSCE is the main European security system and that OSCE
activities should be strengthened not only in former Soviet
republics but also elsewhere like Kosovo, said Sergei Prikhodko,
deputy head of the Russian presidential staff.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Ferrero-Waldner, who also serves as foreign
minister of Austria, Putin set forth Russia's overall economic
strategy and its plans to improve the investment environment in
the country, the Interfax news agency quoted Prikhodko as saying.
</P>
<P>
Putin also briefed Ferrero-Waldner on Russian efforts to settle
the conflict in Chechnya, where federal authorities are trying to
restore government and the economy.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero-Waldner welcomed the institution in Russia of an office
of presidential human rights commissioner for Chechnya, and said
the OSCE will cooperate with the office.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian foreign minister, who arrived here Thursday, met
earlier with her Russian counterpart, Igor Ivanov, and the two
discussed bilateral ties and signed a protocol on avoidance of
double taxation.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero-Waldner is scheduled to leave Moscow and head for the
North Caucasus later Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes Zimbabwe Court Ruling on Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Thursday welcomed a
Zimbabwean High Court ruling that police must take action to clear
the illegal occupation of white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement that
the ruling was in Zimbabwe's own interests that land reforms are
carried out in an orderly and transparent way, "which does not
ride roughshod over the rights of individuals."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's High Court on Thursday dismissed a police
application to overturn an earlier eviction order on thousands of
veterans involved in the country's 1970s liberation struggle.
</P>
<P>
Under the ruling, supporters of President Robert Mugabe, who
seized white-owned farms, will be cleared out from the farms.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe police had argued earlier the order was impossible to
enforce without risking civil war.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the police will now begin to carry out this order
and that calm will return to the farms of Zimbabwe," Cook added.

<HEADLINE> Belgian King's Heart Operation Successful: Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Belgian King Albert II underwent
an emergency heart operation early Thursday and the quadruple
bypass operation turned out to be successful, according to
hospital sources.
</P>
<P>
The operation took two and a half hours in the early morning
after the king was hospitalized on Wednesday night after feeling
chest pains that were diagnosed as having been caused by the
narrowing of the blood vessels in the heart.
</P>
<P>
The operation was conducted by Doctor Hugo van Ermen at
Brussels's Onze Lieve Vrouw d'Alost Hospital.
</P>
<P>
King Albert II woke up in the morning with no signs of
complication and he was breathing normally, hospital sources
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
He has spoken to Queen Paola and will remain in intensive care
for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian royal palace announced later in the day that the
king would have to rest for several weeks before resuming
exercising royal functions.
</P>
<P>
The king and Queen Paola were scheduled to receive the visiting
Jordanian king on Wednesday, but only the queen and Prince Laurent
received the visitor and his family instead.

<HEADLINE> Ronaldo's Injury Confirmed as Torn Tendon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Ronaldo's injury, which forced him
out of field after only six minutes in his latest comeback, was
confirmed as the torn kneecap tendon in his right knee, his club
Inter Milan said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Brazil striker will undergo surgery later on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Inter club reassured their fans saying they were already
sure that the injury Ronaldo picked up in Wednesday night's
Italian Cup final first leg match against Lazio would not end his
career.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo, 23, tore the knee tendon in his right knee in an
Italian league match last November. Wednesday's comeback
appearance from that injury lasted just six minutes before his
knee gave way again.

<HEADLINE> Leeds United Shocked at UEFA Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Leeds United have been charged for failing to control their
players during the controversial first leg of the UEFA Cup semi-
final against Galatasaray.
</P>
<P>
UEFA brought the charges after four Leeds players were booked
in the first leg, which the Turkish side won 2-0. The West
Yorkshire club said it was astounded at the decision.
</P>
<P>
Leeds United secretary Ian Silvester said: "I was astounded to
receive this notification from UEFA. But apparently there is a
rule you can be charged with failing to control your players if
more than three are booked in the same game."
</P>
<P>
"The matter will be dealt with at a disciplinary meeting on 27
April," he said.
</P>
<P>
But European football's ruling body is still silent on what
action they will take over the murders of Leeds fans Chris Loftus
and Kevin Speight during violence in Istanbul on the eve of the
match last week.
</P>
<P>
UEFA will announce on Friday whether Galatasaray fans will be
allowed into Elland Road for the second leg after Leeds called for
them to be banned.
</P>
<P>
UEFA president Lennart Johansson has already suggested that a
limited number of Galatasaray supporters will be allowed to attend.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is very likely the match will go ahead at Elland
Road and that a restricted number of Galatasaray fans will be
allowed in," he said. "This has to be agreed by the (UEFA)
committee of course, and things could change."

<HEADLINE> BAR Driver Zonta Crashed at Silverstone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- British American Racing driver
Ricardo Zonta of Brazil was involved in a 300 kmph accident at
Silverstone at the corner where Michael Schumacher broke his leg
last year.
</P>
<P>
Zonta's car flipped into a grass area after smashing into a
tyre-barrier at Stowe Corner during testing for next week's
British Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The area behind the barrier is a no-go area for spectators but
the incident could force Silverstone officials to make changes to
that corner of the Northamptonshire track before the race on
Sunday week.
</P>
<P>
Zonta escaped with just a cut finger following the accident
after his car lost one of its wheels and started rolling sideways
along the gravel before hitting the barrier.
</P>
<P>
Zonta's car was sent out of control after one of its wheels
came off along Hangar Straight. The team will not run again today
until discovering the cause.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher, who began testing at the track this morning for the
first time since his accident last July, immediately went to the
scene.
</P>
<P>
The German, who had smashed head-on into a barrier rather than
go in sideways, had said last weekend that he would check the run-
off area at Stowe anyway.
</P>
<P>
Denys Rohan, chief executive of Silverstone Circuits, said
after looking at video footage of the incident that he would
listen to any suggestions by the drivers.

</P>
<P>
At a regular press conference, Sun said the U.S. bombing of the

<P>
 over Dalai Lama's Japan Trip
</P>
<P>
China today expressed "strong resentment and regret" over Japan
allowing the Dalai Lama into the country, in disregard of repeated
representations made by the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question at a regular press conference,
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said, the Dalai Lama
is definitely not merely an ordinary religious figure but a
political exile who has long been engaged in activities to split
China under the cloak of religion.
</P>
<P>
China demands that Japan honor its commitment in acknowledging
that the Tibet issue is an internal affair of China, be as good as
its words, so as to safeguard the overall Sino-Japanese relations,
Sun said.

Responding to reporters at a regular press conference, Sun said
that China has taken note of the decision made by the European
Union that it would not co-sponsor an anti-China resolution tabled
by the United States at the current session on human rights in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"We have all along believed that the dialogue based on equality

capacities, have obvious political intentions.
</P>
<P>
"So we hope that countries concerned, including Japan, will
stick to the one-China policy, honor their promises, and handle
such issues properly," Sun said at a regular press conference when
asked to comment on Lee's possible trip to Japan.

<HEADLINE> Rise &AMP; Fall of a Senior Chinese Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Hu Changqing had the perfect
resume for a senior official of the Communist Party of China (CPC):
He was born in an arid valley in Hunan Province in 1948, joined
the People's Liberation Army at age 20 and became a CPC member the
next year, was demobilized and came to Beijing to work in a state-
owned insurance company in 1987 and later a subsidiary of the
State Council, was sent to east China's Jiangxi Province and 1995
and made deputy governor in 1998.
</P>
<P>
And on March 8 of this year, Hu was executed in Jiangxi on
charges of corruption, becoming the highest-ranking Chinese
official to receive the death sentence since the CPC came to power
in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency released a 7,000-character story today
detailing Hu's rise and fall in politics, highlighting his
involvement in the type of corrupt practices which have disgraced
quite a few Party and government leaders, and calling on all Party
and government officials to draw a lesson and fight against
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Hu was convicted on charges of bribery and possession of
property from unidentified sources, and sentenced to death in the
final ruling of the provincial Higher People's Court.
</P>
<P>
From May 1995 through August 1999, Hu abused his power and
demanded and accepted a total of 5.45 million yuan in bribes on 90
separate occasions. He also failed to identify the source of 1.61
million yuan worth of property in his name.

<P>
Hu was executed in the morning of April 8 in the provincial
capital of Nanchang. His death sentence was upheld by the Supreme
People's Court of China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua just before the execution, Hu said,
"When I joined the Party, I didn't have a clear understanding of
its mission, but I did have the ambition to climb up the political
ladder."
</P>
<P>
"Over the decades, I became lazy about studying, and all the
diplomas I got illegally were just to pave the way for my
political promotion," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he used his connections to get a bachelor's degree from
prestigious Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea what makes a Communist Party member, except for
paying monthly dues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu was the youngest child in his family. As a boy, he herded
cows, farmed, and carried heavy loads of vegetables to sell in a
local market, using his earnings to pay for school fees.
</P>
<P>
His two sisters sacrificed their chance to go to school to help
support his education costs.
</P>
<P>
When he became powerful, he pursued money and women.

<P>
One of the people he bribed testified that the former deputy
governor once asked him to find some pretty women for Hu's
pleasure. He did, and Hu was pleased.
</P>
<P>
The investigation of the case proved that Hu took unauthorized
leave more than 20 times every year to tend to private, usually
illegal, matters.
</P>
<P>
Party discipline and the law were abandoned by Hu, and he was
free from any form of supervision from superiors or staff.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua article says that as a senior official, Hu should
have acted as a role model and strictly followed state laws,
instead of abusing his power for personal gains.
</P>
<P>
The scandalous case has deeply angered the public and brought
heavy financial losses to the state, and in response, a heavy
punishment for Hu in accordance with the law was handed down to
demonstrate China's determination to wipe out corruption.
</P>
<P>
The article urges CPC members and cadres, especially mid-level
and high-ranking officials, to learn from the cautionary tale of
Hu Changqing, and not to be tempted by harmful influences during
China's reform and opening up and the creation of a market economy.

It says that Hu's case is a reminder that not only should
leading Party officials practice self-discipline, but the
supervisory system for officials should be improved.
</P>
<P>
"Judging from major cases involving leading party members, one
of the main reasons some important Party members abused their
power to gain money is that the supervision and management
mechanism over leading Party members is far from perfect," it says.
</P>
<P>
"In this respect, the existing regulations must be carried out
firmly, and those which have room for improvement should be
improved, while other necessary rules should be set up as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
The article goes on to say that "the severe punishment of Hu
Changqing according to law serves as a warning to the Party's
leading members, a signal to those who have yet to change their
ways, and an encouraging sign to the general public."
</P>
<P>
"It tells us that in socialist China, no one is above the law
and no special Party member can evade Party discipline, and no one
can escape punishment if he has broken the law, no matter how high
his position or how powerful he is," it says.

<HEADLINE> Embezzled Funds From Three Gorges Project Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Of the 473 million yuan (57
million US dollars) embezzled and misappropriated by officials in
the massive relocation project linked to the Three Gorges Dam
construction, 338 million yuan (41 million US dollars) has been
recovered, Xinhua learned from a special auditing contingent here
today.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 through 1999, the central government earmarked a
total of 17.68 billion yuan (2.1 billion US dollars) for the
resettlement of 220,000 residents who live along the middle
reaches of the Yangtze River, where the new dam will be built, an
auditor said.
</P>
<P>
Auditors have learned that the misuse of the relocation funds
started as soon as the project did.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, prosecutors in the project area have uncovered
138 cases involving 165 officials who misappropriated 31 million
yuan. The most serious instance involved 15.56 million yuan
pocketed by a single official.
</P>
<P>
The Commission for the Construction of the Three Gorges Dam
issued an order today that the 1998 tally of 473 million yuan in
misappropriated funds discovered by the National Audit Office be
returned to the relocation account in full by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The commission also ordered all towns and villages located
within the project boundaries to make their financial accounts
public and to accept public supervision so that further losses
will not occur.

NEW DELHI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Sensitive Index (Sensex)
plunged by about 255 points Thursday, the seventh biggest drop in
the history of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and third in the

The share prices virtually collapsed on a fresh wave of all-

NEW DELHI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Indian President K. R.
Narayanan is scheduled to begin his state visit to France on April
16, aimed at enhancing economic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Lalit Mansingh said Thursday that the visit,
first-ever by an Indian head of state to France, would provide "
depth" to bilateral ties after the strategic dialogue initiated
between India and France during Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee's visit to France in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
An investment promotion agreement is expected to be signed
during the visit in a bid to remove obstacles in trading between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade in 1999 was in India's favor with exports
to France reaching 900 million U.S. dollars and imports from it
680 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
France's cumulative direct investment in India stood at 1.4
billion dollars since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Court Orders Police to Evict Farm Invaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's High Court ruled on
Thursday that the government must swiftly remove the black war
veterans from the white-owned farms they have invaded.
</P>
<P>
Judge Justice Moses Chinhengo also dismissed a police appeal
against an earlier High Court order for the eviction of farm
invaders, saying they have not enough manpower to enforce the
order.
</P>
<P>
He urged the executive to recognize that the permanent interest
of Zimbabwe and the rule of law were served by ensuring the land
invasions were brought to an immediate end.
</P>
<P>
"I would urge the executive to provide the Police Commissioner
 Augustine Chihuri with additional resources that the police force
may require to carry out its functions under the law," said
Chinhengo.
</P>
<P>
He said while the application could be viewed sympathetically
as a cry for the courts to recognize the predicament the police
commissioner was in, the court had on the other hand issued an
order which he should enforce.
</P>
<P>
War veterans and other landless black peasants have waged a
campaign since February to occupy commercial farms and ranches
owned by the whites, urging the government to accelerate land
redistribution reform.
</P>
<P>
When the campaign spread throughout Zimbabwe, the Commercial
Farmers Union applied to the High Court to have the invasions
stopped.
</P>
<P>
An order was granted by Justice Garwe on March 17, declaring
the invasions unlawful and invaders vacate within 24 hours.

The society urged the government to proceed with due
expedition and diligence to enforce the order, Moyo said.

orders be brought to an end as a matter of extreme urgency," Moyo

<HEADLINE> Canadian Student Studies Amphibians on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- In a first ever e-mail
multinational study, a Canadian doctoral student mobilized about
200 researchers to find that the world's amphibian population has
most likely decreased by more than 50 percent since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Heff Houlahan, 40, a doctoral student of biology at the
University of Ottawa, and his multinational team concluded that
the amphibian population declined at the steepest rate of 15
percent in the 1960s, the country's Ottawa Citizen reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The shrinkage continued, but at a slower rate of 2 percent
respectively in the 1980s and the 1990s, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The team compiled scientific data of the last four decades from
close to 1,000 studies. Up to 157 species of frogs and salamanders
were involved in the three-year-long multinational e-project.
</P>
<P>
This was unlike a traditional study that relied on original
laboratory research, the newspaper said, adding that Houlahan met
only one of his collaborators face-to-face over the course of the
project.
</P>
<P>
Houlahan was quoted as saying that the next phase in the
project is to study the cause of the decline of amphibian
population.
</P>
<P>
Scientists suspect the loss of habitat, the impact of
fertilizers and pesticides and the thinning ozone layer will
continue to be challenges to the survival of amphibians.
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is this is just one more indicator of the fact that
we are overworking the planet," he said in reference to his next
step of 18 months in the research.

<HEADLINE> Putin Pledges Probe in Human Rights Violations in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-elect Vladimir
Putin said here Thursday that all alleged human rights violations
in the breakaway republic of Chechnya will be investigated and
those responsible will be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
"All cases of human rights violations and abuse in the anti-
terrorist campaign in the Northern Caucasus, no matter who is
responsible for them, are being thoroughly investigated," Putin
said in a statement released by the Kremlin press service.
</P>
<P>
"The punishment will be severe if guilt is proven," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has been under mounting pressure from the West on
alleged human rights abuses in Chechnya, where federal troops are
fighting rebels in a campaign launched last September.
</P>
<P>
The assaults on the rebels came after waves of armed Chechen
incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a series of apartment
bombings that killed over 300 people in Moscow and two other
cities. Chechen militants were blamed for the blasts.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of responsibility of violators of human rights and
lawfulness in Chechnya are permanently in the center of attention"
of the Russian leadership, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"Several cases have been opened on charges of genocide,
abduction, inter-religious and inter-ethnic discord, among them
the murder of 33 residents of the Mekenskaya village of the
Naurskaya district and 10 Russian-speaking residents of the
Chervlennaya village of the Shelkovskaya district," the Interfax
news agency quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Putin also pointed to the massive rights abuses by
Chechen militants in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
He said that Dzhokhar Dudayev, the former ruler of Chechnya,
turned the republic into "a criminal and terrorist enclave
dominated by arbitrariness, lawlessness and neglect of elementary
human rights."
</P>
<P>
"National and regional discrimination, hostage-taking, slavery
and slave trade, murder, rape and public execution were everyday
life affairs in the republic. The bandits profaned fundamental
principles of Islam and waged a war against the whole population
of Chechnya under the cover of Sharia norms. About 220,000
Russians and 650,000 Chechens have had to flee the republic since
1992," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The restoration of law and respect for human rights on the
territory of the republic is a priority of Russia's state policy,"
Putin said.

<HEADLINE> China to Ensure Traffic Safety for Pupils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China is urging school-age
children to wear eye-catching yellow caps in an effort to reduce
traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, where the practice was introduced in 1996, traffic
accidents involving school-age children have been brought under
control as no school-age children wearing the bright caps died
from traffic accidents over the past two years in the municipality,
police said today.
</P>
<P>
Donning high-visibility hats is just one feature of the "
Youngsters Return Home Safely" campaign which began this month in
36 major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The program also recommends that school-age children go to and
from school in groups, and that some of them should carry signs
while crossing streets so that drivers will be sure to see them.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was jointly sponsored by the Chinese Communist
Youth League Central Committee, the Ministry of Education, and the
Ministry of Public Security, in response to a speech by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin calling on society to provide a safe
environment for school-age children.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- In the first quarter of the year,
a total of 211 Chinese died and another 211 injured in 13 major

<P>
CAIRO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- Omani Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Mohammed
al-Ramhi said his country has resumed its previous oil production
level fixed at 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) under the agreement
reached by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
last month.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian economic daily Al Alam El-Yom on Thursday quoted
al-Ramhi as saying his country plans to increase production to one
million bpd with collaboration of the foreign oil companies working
in the country, which has currently 5.6 billion barrels of oil
reserves.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- Visa International Company said in a statement that the
Saudi credit card market accounts for 60 percent of the total of 3.
45 million visa cards issued in the six Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
Al Alam El-Yom on Thursday quoted the statement as saying that
Saudi Arabia has issued, until the end of last year, 1.39 million
cards, followed by the United Arab Emirates that issued 886,000
cards and Kuwait, 835,000 cards.
</P>
<P>
The total spending through the use of visa credit cards in the
region amounted to 19.98 billion U.S. dollars, with Saudi Arabia
ranking first with 8.65 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said these figures are not final.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabian Oil Company "Aramco" said it is
currently exporting about 40 percent of crude oil and its
derivatives to the world markets via the port of Yanbu industrial
city, west of the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
According to Al Alam El-Yom, the company said the oil pipeline
has a transport capacity of 5 million bpd, while the daily capacity
of gas pipelines reaches 280,000 barrels of liquefied natural gas.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's Is Bank and Telecom Italia Wednesday
purchased the first of two new mobile phone GSM network licenses
with a record high bid of 2.25 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The group's unexpected high offer beat by far that of its
closest rival, a Sabanci-led consortium, including Dogan Holding,
Dogus Holding and Spanish Telefonica, which offered 1.35 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Sabanci-led consortium said that it would bid for the second
license, which will be awarded through a bidding war based on the
price of the first license.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- As Iran begins to block ships smuggling Iraqi fuel oil
in the Persian Gulf, Turkish experts believe that fuel oil entering
Turkey from Iraq across the Iraqi-Turkish border will increase,
reported Turkish Daily News on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
By differentiating between crude oil and fuel oil coming from
Iraq, oil experts prefer crude oil to fuel oil from Iraq as Turkey
has five refineries to produce enough fuel oil for the country's
market.
</P>
<P>
The government takes 300 percent tax on fuel from Iraq, but it
has failed to block the fuel oil trade at the border.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's ready-to-wear sector has started a series of
activities to expand its export market in targeted countries,
reported the Anatolia News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mete Oguz, chairman of the Aegean Ready-to-Wear Exporters Union,
said Wednesday that they are working to increase their export to
Denmark, Spain and Britain.
</P>
<P>
A delegation composed of 23 members from 16 companies held
bilateral meetings with 100 Turkish firms last week in Izmir,
southwest Turkey. They will come back to Izmir in two or three
months to give orders.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Lifts Ban on Golan Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government on
Thursday lifted a ban on construction on the Golan Heights, a move
that might harm the Israeli-Syrian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Kucik, a confidant of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and director general of his office, announced Thursday that all
construction and development plans on the Golan will be given the
go-ahead from now on.
</P>
<P>
The strategic plateau was occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle
East War.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the ban might pave the way for the implementation
of a large tourism project at Hamat Gader, another disputed area
along the border between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Golan Jewish settlements leaders have welcomed the lifting
of the ban, saying it will not only release land for the
construction of housing units but will also encourage economic
development in the area.
</P>
<P>
Kucik's announcement ended the freeze order issued by Barak last
year, when he was elected as prime minister and made peace with
Syria a top priority of his administration.
</P>
<P>
Barak reportedly thought the ban, as a good-will gesture, will
convince Syrian President Hafez al-Assad of Israel's sincerity for
peace, as the return of the Golan is the major topic in the
Israeli-Syrian peace track.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the reason behind the lifting of the ban, according to
Israel Radio reports, is Barak's deep disappointment toward the
stalled peace negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts even claimed that such a decision has finally
slammed the door for talks with Syria and begun to restore the
business on the plateau "as usual".
</P>
<P>
The off-again, on-again talks between Israel and Syria resumed
last December after a 45-month break, but only to break off again
in January after two rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
The latest effort to revive the talks, a summit meeting between
Assad and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Geneva on March 26, failed
to make progress as expected.
</P>
<P>
During Barak's meeting with Clinton in Washington Tuesday, the
Syrian peace track occupied little time, according to a senior
official in Barak's office.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that both leaders thought the
possibilities for new developments are very slim, although "the
door on the Syrian track is not closed" yet.
</P>
<P>
In such a context, Israeli Minister in Prime Minister's Office
Haim Ramon Tuesday confirmed that the construction of 200 more home
units had broken ground in Katzrin, the largest Jewish settlement
on the Golan Heights with 6,700 settlers.
</P>
<P>
Ramon said that because the peace with Syria are apparently not
in the offing, he thought the way should be cleared for the "
natural growth" for settlements on the Golan.
</P>
<P>
There are about 17,000 Jewish settlers living in the Golan
Heights.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: 57 Killed, 100 Missing in Philippine Ship Mishap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 57 people died and 100
others are missing when a cargo vessel capsized Wednesday night
off Sulu Province in the southern Philippines, the authorities
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense
said ferry Arlahada capsized at about 20:30 (12:30 GMT) Wednesday
off Jolo, Sulu Province, killing at least 57 people.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 others are still missing and feared dead, said
Mercado, who also heads the National Disaster Coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
Local TV reports said some 79 passengers were rescued and
brought to local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Maritime Police command in Western Mindanao
said Arlahada was on its way to Tawi-Tawi Province after which it
was scheduled to go to Sabah, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The authorities estimated that the ship was carrying more than
200 passengers when it was actually fit for only 50.
</P>
<P>
Coast guard officials from Jolo town said Arlahada left the
port of Jolo after it was checked by their men at around 18:00 (10:
00 GMT) with only 20 passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the vessel picked up many passengers along
the way by stopping at sea while motorized pump-boats side-docked
to bring in passengers.
</P>
<P>
Survivors of the sea tragedy recounted that the ship leaned on
its side at around 20:00 (12:00 GMT) but the crew were not able to
bring it back to its original sailing position, prompting sea
waters to run into all the cabins an other parts of the vessel.
</P>
<P>
Sulu Governor Abdusakur Tan said Arlahada with its main port of
call in Zamboanga city was illegally carrying passengers over its
capacity when it sank more than two hours after it left Jolo port.
</P>
<P>
Coast guard officials also said the vessel capsized due to
overloading of passengers and it should not have carried
passengers as it was licensed as a cargo vessel.
</P>
<P>
According to Tan, search and rescue operations were immediately
launched by a combined team of the Philippine Navy, the Philippine
Coast Guard and the Maritime Police after the tragedy. He said
rescue teams are still continuing their search and rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
However, Tan feared that most of the passengers of the ill-
fated vessel have either been drowned or were devoured by big
fishes in the sea.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Mercado said in a radio interview that the
government has mobilized concerned agencies to extend all possible
assistance to the victims.
</P>
<P>
He said his office is coordinating with the Department of
Transportation and Communication on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"We have been working in tandem with the governor of Sulu,
Abdusakur Tan, and other government agencies," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the authorities are still verifying the
overloading issue and that most of the passengers were not listed
on the vessel's manifesto.
</P>
<P>
Mercado also expressed fear that the coming observance of the
Holy Week will prompt ship operators to overload commercial sea
vessels in coming days.
</P>
<P>
"This practice is obviously rampant. What's more alarming is
that the rule and regulations regarding overloading are being
ignored all over the country," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
Of all the sea disasters in the Philippines, the most
unforgettable would perhaps be the collision between the passenger
ship Dona Paz and the oil tanker Vector in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Dona Paz was ferrying passengers who were then going home for
Christmas. It was supposed to carry only 1,800 passengers but
unofficial estimates put the number of the dead at about 3,000 in
the incident.
</P>
<P>
Only 24 people survived, prompting historians to dub the mishap
as the "worst maritime disaster of the century."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Opposition Hold General Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Thursday witnessed
another countrywide general strike called by the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party(BNP)-led opposition alliance as part of the
opposition's long-drawn anti-government campaign.
</P>
<P>
Security was tightened in Dhaka as the opposition called the
dawn-to-dusk general strike but there were no reports of major
violence despite sporadic incidents of bomb blasts and street
marches.
</P>
<P>
The public transport system remained in operation, though fewer
buses were seen than usual, and private cars were off the streets
in some areas of the capital. Shops, major markets and schools and
other academic institutions were closed but offices, including
financial institutions, were open.
</P>
<P>
According to the railway department, there were no reports of
disruption of train services from anywhere while civil aviation
sources said other than two domestic flights, all flights in local
and international routes operated as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The last time the opposition enforced such a countrywide
shutdown was on February 28 to press their demand for the
resignation of the government and announcement of an early general
election, which is not scheduled before 2001.
</P>
<P>
According to newspaper reports, at least 30 persons were killed
and thousands injured in violence during the opposition's general
strikes in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Awami League and its front organizations
Thursday held anti-general strike demonstrations in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Awami League supporters marched through city
streets to protest against the strike enforced by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
According to Awami League sources, the ruling party also held
similar processions in other cities.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance has recently started to discuss the
formation of an electoral alliance to contest the upcoming general
election. Its components have already begun preparing individually
for the election while carrying out the anti-government movement.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star reported Thursday that some senior leaders of
BNP, Jatiya Party (National Party), Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami
Oikya Jote (Islami Solidarity Front), which form the alliance,
told the daily that the parties have reached a consensus on
contesting the election together to fight the ruling Awami League.

<HEADLINE> IMF Sees Good Economic Conditions in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and an
International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission agreed Thursday that
favorable economic conditions have taken place in the Philippines
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of the Philippines and the visiting IMF
mission said in a joint press statement that the country's economy
is recovering on the strength of rapid export growth and a
recovery in domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Along with this, inflation has been lower than what was
programmed,helped by declining food prices. Similarly, the
external current account is in large surplus and official reserves
are at a comfortable level.
</P>
<P>
Both panels agreed that the solid economic fundamentals,
prudent implementation of the fiscal and monetary programs and
vigorous implementation of the government's reform agenda should
ensure a strong economic performance this year.
</P>
<P>
Real GDP growth is expected to be well within the government's
target range of 4 to 5 percent in 2000, reflecting the strong
recovery in industry and services as well.
</P>
<P>
The strong economic recovery was contributed by an improvement
in industry and services as well as a sustained growth of
agriculture.Inflation is expected to be between 5 and 6 percent
for this year, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission completed late Tuesday its fifth review of the
country's economy to release more funds for the country under its
1.4-billion U.S. dollar standby facility with the Philippine
government.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has so far disbursed 740 million dollars from the
standby fund and has extended the two-year program to June to
allow the release of the remaining funds. The IMF standby program
was originally due to expire in March.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Predicts 3.8 Percent GDP Growth for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish government Tuesday
revised its economic growth projection for this year to 3.8
percent from last autumn's 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the budget bill for spring put before the parliament, the
government predicts that export will grow by 7.6 percent in 2000,
2.4 percent higher than the growth rate of last year; and
household consumption will grow by 5 percent, 1 percent higher
than that of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the higher growth forecast has resulted from
the economic recovery in Sweden's major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The minority Social Democrat government also plans to cut
public expenditures by 0.7 percent, which could help bring about a
budget surplus of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inflation would be 1.4 percent this year and unemployment would
be lowered to 4.6 percent, from 5.6 percent of last year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Pudong New Area (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year is the
tenth anniversary of China's opening up and development of the
Pudong New Area in eastern Shanghai. To help readers have a better
understanding of Pudong, Xinhua will release a series of
backgrounders beginning today. The following is the first.
</P>
<P>
On April 18, 1990, the Chinese government declared the opening-
up and development of Pudong in a drive to rejuvenate Shanghai's
status as an international financial and trade center, and turn
Shanghai into a locomotive to promote economic development of the
Yangtze River valley.
</P>
<P>
After 10 years of joint efforts by the central and local
governments, who offered favorable policies, the 522-square-
kilometer Pudong, on the eastern bank of the Huangpu River which
cuts Shanghai into two parts, has become one of the most
attractive foreign investment zones in the country.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 5,942 overseas companies were
operating in Pudong. These overseas-funded firms involve a total
investment of 29.44 billion U.S. dollars, including contractual
overseas investment amounting to 11.57 billion U.S. dollars. About
100 of the world's 500 leading multinationals are among the
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The United States was the leading overseas investor in Pudong
area last year with 266 million U.S. dollars of investment,
followed by Japan with 134 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 5,183 Chinese companies flocked to Pudong
with a total registered capital of 19.4 billion yuan (about 2.34
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Businesses in the Pudong New Area are mainly engaged in
automobiles, information technology, iron and steel, household
appliances, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Pudong's products
are now sold to more than 130 countries.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Pudong New Area (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pudong is also a hot spot for bankers. Recent official
statistics show that 42 overseas banks have opened subsidiaries in
the area, with combined assets of 13.31 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some big names there are CitiBank, Standard Chartered Bank, and
Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited.
</P>
<P>
Apart from foreign currency transactions, 24 of the overseas-
funded banks have been approved to engage in yuan business.
</P>
<P>
Pudong is composed of four parts: Lujiazui Financial and Trade
Zone, Jinqiao Exports Processing Zone, Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone, and
Zhangjiang High-Tech Park, with a population of 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Pudong reported a gross domestic product of 80 billion yuan (
about 964 million U.S. dollars) in 1999, compared with 600 million
yuan a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, China has invested billions of dollars
in infrastructure construction, including bridges, expressways,
deep-water berths, telecommunications facilities, power plants,
water supply and drainage projects, and an international airport,
to develop Pudong.
</P>
<P>
The area, which was ignored for centuries, has changed
completely. Shanty towns are disappearing and nearly 200
skyscrapers, including China's tallest building, the Jinmao Tower,
are now part of the landscape.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Aircraft Producer Delivers Boeing Tail Part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CHENGDU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- An airplane manufacturer in
Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, today
delivered a No.48 session, one of the Boeing tail parts, to
American Northrop Grumman Corporation (NG), based on a subcontract
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Chengdu Aero Industrial Corporation signed an
agreement with NG to produce tail parts for the Boeing 757-200,
involving vertical tails, horizontal tails, and the No.48 sessions.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders here note that the No.48 session is the
hardest of all tail parts to make, and the Chengdu company first
successfully fulfilled this task when it delivered a vertical tail
and horizontal tail in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to Boeing experts, the Boeing 757 aircraft, with two
engines and a single aisle, has the lowest seat-mile costs.
</P>
<P>
Boeing began its cooperation with China in the 1970s, and key
parts fitted in 3,100 Boeing planes now in service around the
world were produced in China.

<HEADLINE> "Taiwan Independence" Doomed to Fail: Non-Communist Parties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Two major non-Communist parties
in China lodged harsh criticism today against Annette Lu of Taiwan
for her recent remarks advocating "independence" of the island.
</P>
<P>
"Separatist forces angered the entire Chinese people, and are
doomed to fail," spokesmen for the Taiwan Democratic Self-
Government League (TDSGL) and the Jiu San (September 3) Society
said in separate statements.
</P>
<P>
Members of the TDSGL are mostly Taiwan natives residing on the
mainland, the TDSGL spokesman said. "Our parents, brothers and
sisters, relatives and friends live there, but we cannot get
together because of man-made reasons."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the reunification of the motherland has been
the common desire of all the Chinese people, including the Taiwan
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The Jiu San (September 3) Society is composed mainly of senior
and middle ranking intellectuals in the scientific and
technological circles in China.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the society said that Taiwan has been an
inalienable part of China since ancient times, and the people
across the Taiwan Straits are members of the same family.

<HEADLINE> Ministry Pleased with Employment for Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education said
today it was pleased with the report of high employment rates for
this year's 1.07 million college graduates.
</P>
<P>
Postgraduates and students from well-known universities are
being actively pursued by employers, Qu Zhenyuan, an official with
the ministry, said at a briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
University graduates are in great demand in developed provinces
and cities in eastern and coastal areas, but the need is far less
in the underdeveloped western region, Qu said.
</P>
<P>
Postgraduates are most sought-after, the number of students
with bachelor's degrees is equal to the employment needs, and the
supply of junior college graduates has exceeded the demand,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He said that job fairs on college campuses have been the main
venue for linking graduates with employers. Currently, 70 percent
of students meet their future bosses at these events.

<HEADLINE> Armed Opposition Group Busted in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran said that its security forces
on Thursday smashed a group of members of the military opposition
Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO) who infiltrated into Iranian
territory from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Intelligence Ministry said that the MKO members were
identified and busted before committing any criminal acts, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Foreign currencies, different types of rifles and pistols,
grenades and fake documents were confiscated from the group, the
ministry said, without giving more details.
</P>
<P>
The MKO launched two mortar attacks in the Iranian capital of
Tehran in February and March, injuring a number of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO was a main political group which had fought
against the former Iranian shah regime, but it was outlawed in 1981
due to sharp differences with the Iranian clergy regime.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, the MKO launched various attacks on
Iranian interests inside and outside Iran. In retaliation, the
Iranian armed forces also bombed the MKO bases in Iraq several
times.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Sets Tone for Liberal Party Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard set the tone for the ruling Liberal Party national
conference Thursday night with a plea for the corporate community
to do more to help those in need.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which starts Friday in Melbourne in Southeast
Australia, will focus on the government's social policies,
especially Howard's push for mutual obligation and a new social
coalition in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who will deliver two keynote speeches at the conference,
Thursday night launched a CARE Australia corporate roundtable,
where business leaders have offered support for the work of the
international aid agency.
</P>
<P>
He said CARE's initiative was a perfect example of how business
could become more involved in philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
"In launching the corporate council, I'm associating myself
very enthusiastically with the notion of what I've called the
social coalition," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
"That is based on a belief that the goals we want to achieve in
our community can't be achieved by the individual sectors of our
community operating in isolation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The business community and its prosperity and its wealth is
vital to the economic growth of our nation and the employment of
its people," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Liberals will also use the conference to help raise funds
for the next election, with business delegates paying 5,000
Australian dollars (3,100 U.S. dollars) a head to listen to the
debates and to receive policy briefings from senior ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Liberals reportedly want the convention to be a showcase of
unity after a recent party split over mandatory sentencing laws in
some parts of Australia.

COLOMBO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were killed
and 67 others injured in a grenade attack on a musical show in
Eastern Province of Sri Lanka Wednesday, police here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred in a stadium in Trincomalee Town, 260

people had gathered there to watch the show, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
The injured have been admitted to local hospital. At least 10 of

</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack
which came on the eve of the traditional new year.
</P>
<P>
However, police authorities have blamed Tamil rebels for the
attack. The rebels, who have been fighting against the government
for a separate Tamil state in the country, have made similar
attacks in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka took on a festive atmosphere Thursday when the

<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China will take a series of
measures to encourage foreign capital to flow into the country's
agriculture sector, an official of the State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
SDPC and related departments are revising foreign investment
regulations to give preferential treatment to foreign investment
in the agriculture sector, said Zhang Xiaoqiang, director of the
Commission's Foreign Capital Utilization Department, at the China
Agriculture Forum.
</P>
<P>
These policies include cutting import taxes, income taxes and
various fees, he said, adding that foreign capital may come in to
the sector in several forms such as joint ventures, solely owned
ventures, and owning of stock shares.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has witnessed a surge of foreign capital
in its agriculture sector, and last year the contracted foreign
investment in the sector jumped 22 percent to 1.5 billion US
dollars despite the fact that total contracted foreign investment
dropped 21 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that foreign capital has played an important role in
the construction of agricultural infrastructure, the advancement
of agro-technology, and the restructure of the rural economy, and
has gained good economic returns.

of agriculture, and that China's huge agriculture market will
created unprecedented opportunities for foreign investment after
the country joins the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
China will further improve the environment for foreign
investment and trade in agriculture and promote cooperation
between Chinese enterprises and their foreign counterparts, said
Wang Baorui, China's vice-minister of agriculture, at the opening
ceremony of the ongoing International Agro-Foodtech Expo, which
attracted over 300 agriculture-related companies from 17 countries.
</P>
<P>
While visiting the expo, Joyce Quin, minister of state of the
British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, said that
China's agriculture market is large and important and Britain will
enhance cooperation with China in the areas from dairy, livestock,
and cereals to agro-research and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
"China's accession to the WTO will increase trade in both
directions and intensify cooperation between the UK and China,"
she said, adding that she expects more British companies will
invest in China.
</P>
<P>
Her views were shared by many foreign companies at the expo.
Sabine de Beaudrap, Asia Area Manager of the French Association
for the Development of International Exchanges of Food and
Agriculture Products and Technologies, said that French companies
take great interest in China's agriculture market, and that she
believes more business opportunities will arise when trade
barriers are lowered after China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoqiang noted that foreign investment in agriculture
will be decided by the market, and foreign companies can cooperate
with Chinese companies under all kinds of ownership, including
private enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Suggest Applying High-tech to Control Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have suggested
introducing high-tech methods to control the deteriorating
desertification of northwest China, which has caused several
severe dust storms this spring.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech should include biotechnology, chemistry and water-
saving technologies, said Shan Lun, an academician with the Soil
and Water Conservation Institute under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Shan, who has spent years studying soil conservation in western
China, said the sand-fixing methods developed by Chinese
scientists in their fight against the desert have been proved
effective.
</P>
<P>
Without the forest shelter belts covering over 30 million
hectares in northwest, north and northeast China, the dust storms
would have been even more violent, said Shan.
</P>
<P>
Since the trees planted in the last ten years are still young,
it will take eight to ten more before they play a full role, Shan
said.
</P>
<P>
A new chemical material which can absorb and release a large
quantity of water has been developed, and if the production costs
can be lowered, it can be used in agriculture and afforestation in
the western region, said Shan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, water-saving technologies should also be applied
in industries, agriculture, and people's daily lives, Shan added.

history from 403 B.C. to the Northern Song.
</P>
<P>
The scroll offered is a Preface, or a record of a gathering of
12 retired officials who were all over 70 years of age in 1082.
</P>
<P>
As there are only three other known pieces by Sima Guang, the
scroll will undoubtedly generate enormous interest from the public,
says Christie's.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Christie's will bring some 42 pieces of works of
Chinese oil paintings, including works by renowned artist Chen
Yifei, at the Spring Auctions.

<HEADLINE> HK's Building Quality Reform Plan Okayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Housing Authority of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has formally
embarked on the road to construction reform with the endorsement
Thursday of a two-phase implementation plan containing 50
recommendations on ways to enhance building quality.
</P>
<P>
Rosanna Wong, chairman of the Housing Authority, said this is
an important step forward in translating the authority's
determination into action.
</P>
<P>
Addressing immediate public concerns, Phase One of the reform
covers areas vital to customer and building safety and will
provide a conducive foundation for the execution of subsequent
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Some of these measures have already kicked off and the
remainder will commence immediately, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
Phase Two of the package, which involves the re-engineering of
critical processes and systems with an aim to achieve partnering
on all fronts, will roll out progressively from June 2000.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Authority said a multi-disciplinary
departmental task force has been set up to oversee and steer the
implementation plan mapped out after a two-month public
consultation exercise which ended last month.
</P>
<P>
"The overall response to the consultation has been very
encouraging. Most of the stakeholders and respondents agree that
there is an urgent need to uplift building quality and partnering
is the key to success in this reform," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Trial on Iranian Jews Accused of Espionage Adjourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The first session of the closed-
door trial on 13 Iranian Jews accused of spying for Iran's arch
foes of the United States and Israel was adjourned Thursday and
postponed to May 1.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Ali Amiri, head of the justice department of the
southern Fars province, said the trial was put off upon the request
of a defense lawyer, though the accused had announced readiness for
defense.
</P>
<P>
He said the court made the decision with respect to the ideology
of the Jews and views of the accused that the timing of the trial
coincided with the Jewish feast of Passover, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The trial started Thursday morning in a conservative
revolutionary court in Shiraz, the capital city of Fars province,
the center of Iran's 35,000-strong Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
The families of eight Jews have chosen their defense lawyers and
the court have appointed lawyers for two others, while the three
who were released on bail have not appointed any lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers called for a postponement of the trial as they
have limited time to go through details of the case, which has
aroused grave concern from the U.S., Israel and other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israel have denied any link between their
intelligence services and the Iranian Jews and have repeatedly
urged Iran to release the Jews since their arrest in March and
April last year. But Tehran has rejected the appeal as "
interference" in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian conservative judiciary has promised a "fair and
open" trial for the Jews and some judicial officials said that not
all of the 13 Jews will be charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iranian laws, the defendants might be sentenced to
death if they are convicted of spying for foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Angola Suspends All Diamond Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
suspended all contracts on the purchase and sale of diamonds, the
Angolan Deputy Minister of Geology and Mining Carlos Sumbula said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Luanda-based "Ecclesia" Radio, Sumbula
said that of the over-400 million-dollar annual revenue from the
sale of diamonds, only five million U.S. dollars go to the state
budget.
</P>
<P>
The decision to cancel the contracts is part of a strategy to
correct the irregularities existing in trading the precious stones
and to control the illegal diamond trafficking, said the deputy
minister.
</P>
<P>
The move had been confirmed earlier by the president of the
board of managers of the Angolan National Diamonds Company
(Endiama), Agostinho Gaspar, when addressing a program on the
state-owned TPA television.
</P>
<P>
Gaspar added that of the four ongoing projects for diamonds
mining in the country, the most profit one is the "Catoca"
project, which is located in the diamond-rich Lunda-norte province
and supported by companies from many countries including Russia,
Britain and Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Missions in Tanzania Urged to Verify Opposition's Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government has
asked foreign missions to Tanzania to treat with caution claims on
human rights abuses by the opposition camp in the run-up to the
general elections in October.
</P>
<P>
When debating the proposed constitutional amendments in the
House of Representatives on the Indian Ocean island on Wednesday,
Zanzibar Deputy Chief Minister Omar Ramadhani Mapuri said the
foreign missions should in the first place verify the claims with
relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
The minister said some foreign missions were the source of the
Isles political conflict which surfaced after the 1995 general
elections by siding with the opposition party of Civic United
Front (CUF).
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued last Thursday, the European Union
representatives in Dar es Salaam accused the Zanzibar government
of harassing CUF and being unwilling to implement an agreement
signed in June 1999 between the ruling Tanzanian Revolutionary
Party (CCM) and CUF aimed at resolving the political deadlock
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mapuri cautioned there was a growing tendency for the
opposition to act irresponsibly and rush to the embassies accusing
the government of harassing it.
</P>
<P>
Experience has shown that supporters of opposition parties
purposely contravened the country's laws under the pretext of
multi-party democracy, Mapuri said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of State of Zanzibar President's Office
Mohamed Ramia told the House that the government has invited the
new Commonwealth Secretary General to Tanzania to be elected soon
to have a first-hand experience of the implementation of the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commonwealth brokered accord, the Zanzibar
Electoral Commission should be reformed before the general
elections in October.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's ruling CCM party, under President Salmin Amour,
claimed a narrow victory over the CUF in the 1995 elections, but
CUF questioned the result.
</P>
<P>
Political situation has become tense on the semi-autonomous
island off mainland Tanzania after 18 CUF activists have been put
in detention since December 1997 on sedition and treason charges.

<HEADLINE> China Treats All Ethnic Minorities as Equals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China pursues a policy of treating
all ethnic minorities as equals and accords minorities with
special care, a Chinese official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 56th session of the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights, Alternate Representative of the Chinese
delegation Li Baodong said that the minorities in China, like the
Han majority, enjoy not only the full range of civil rights
granted by the Chinese Constitution and other laws, but also the
rights legally privileged to them.
</P>
<P>
China is a unified multi-ethnic country, and her 55 ethnic
minority groups make up for 8.98 percent of the total population,
Li told the 53-member commission. All 55 ethnic minority groups,
irrespective of their population size, have their own
representative in the National People's Congress and the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
China has established the system of autonomous government in
areas where minorities are concentrated, he said. By now, there
are five autonomous regions, over 30 autonomous prefectures and
120 autonomous counties in China. According to the law, the
chairman or vice-chairman of the people's congress of a minority
autonomous area or the governor, prefecture and county magistrate
of this area has to be assumed by a citizen belonging to this
minority.
</P>
<P>
There are also legal protection and state promotion of
religious belief of minorities, their customs, traditional
cultures and the use and development of their languages, Li said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 18 million Islam followers and more
than 30,000 mosques in China, out of which over 20,000 mosques and
8.1 million Moslem are in Xinjiang, representing 56.3 percent of
Xinjiang's total population. In Tibet, there are over 1,700 sites
of religious activities for Tibetan Buddhism and over 46,000
resident monks and nuns.
</P>
<P>
To promote economic development and social progress of these
regions, Li said, the state renders support to minority groups in
terms of capital, technology and talents. For example, to speed up
the economic development of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, the
Chinese Central Government allocates annually over 3 billion yuan
(361 million U.S. dollars) from its budget for Tibet's development.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting focused on minorities' right. Li said tat in
1999, the central government made a major decision to speed up the
development of the western part of China.
</P>
<P>
"This strategy is bound to provide a strong impetus to
enhancing the economic development of Tibet, Xinjiang and other
regions in western China, and promoting people's enjoyment of wide-
ranging rights there and contributing to the common prosperity of
all ethnic minority groups in China," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to better services to
investors from outside, five foreign-funded projects have been
approved to set up in the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR)
of China in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The projects are related to shoe-making, consultation service
of trading and construction, manufacturing of magnetic disk and
pharmaceutical production, Lee Peng Hong, president of the Macao
Trade and Investment Promotion Institute (TIPI), said at a press
conference Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The projects involve planned investment of 76.93 million
patacas (about 9.62 million U.S. dollars) and are expected to
create more than 720 new jobs, Lee said, adding that another 10
projects are undergoing procedures of approval.
</P>
<P>
He noted that better investment services have been provided to
investors since the establishment of the SAR in last December. And
a special investment committee comprising members from 10
government departments has been set up.
</P>
<P>
Lee Peng Hong also acts as the head of the 10-member committee.
In this sense, the institute can make more efficient contacts with
various government departments and investors do not have to go
through procedures one after another all by themselves.

<HEADLINE> Israel Plans to Develop New Missiles and Pilotless Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel is planning to develop
three new types of long-range missiles and two types of anti-
ballistic missile unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to boost its
defense capability.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Air Force (IAF) will allocate approximately 30
billion U.S. dollars' budget for the research and development plan
in the next decade, the Ha'aretz daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the IAF is to upgrade its Python air-to-air missile to
a new generation, Python 5, with improved range and enhanced
precision and anti-electronic jamming capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Another air-to-air long-range missile with approximately 90
kilometers' range is also being planned.
</P>
<P>
A third type of missile will be an air-to-ground guided missile
aiming to destroy enemy's missile launchers.
</P>
<P>
To form a complete striking set, a type of UAV is currently
under IAF development, which is designed to carry these missiles.
The design objective of these UAVs is reportedly to float in the
air for as long as 60 hours and carry 10 missiles.
</P>
<P>
The striking set is in accordance with IAF's new tactical
strategy, which aims to attack missile launchers rather than
intercept missiles in the air.
</P>
<P>
Another UAV, which would be a stealth type, is being designed
for high altitude, distant operations and will be guided to hit
moving targets.
</P>
<P>
Quoting United States journal Aviation Week, the report also
revealed that the IAF is negotiating with the U.S. Defense
Department for the purchase of 50 F-22s, which is scheduled to
enter service in 6-7 years' time.
</P>
<P>
It is a related development regarding the missile and UAVs
research, according to the report, as the F-22, which is currently
undergoing tests, is widely regarded as the most advanced fighter
in the future and will be integrated into IAF's long-term strategy.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for More Foreign Portfolio Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia critically needs foreign
portfolio investment (FPI) if it is to achieve a sustainable
economic growth following the privatization of its copper mines,
according to Lusaka Stock Exchange General Manager Charles Mate.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail on Thursday quoted Mate as saying that the
completion of the sale of the assets of Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM) is not the end of the road for the country's search
for money to stimulate its development.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign portfolio investment is the critical answer as it will
 contribute to filling the financial gap to complement the
domestic savings of the country. It will provide the necessary
foreign exchange to support growth and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mate said that the absence of the FPI will make the country's
growth very difficult as there are other hurdles that could come
especially in the area of Balance of Payments support.
</P>
<P>
He bemoaned the trend of a lot of money getting out of the
country over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
More foreign direct investment, institutional investment and
the guidelines on joint venture arrangements are some of the
pre-requisites to attracting FPI, said Mate.
</P>
<P>
Zambia recorded an increased net capital outflows and static
foreign direct investment (FDI) between 1996 and 1999 while FPI
maintained a negative trend, according to Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
FPI was negative 165 million U.S. dollars in 1999 and FDI
inflows were 200 million U.S. dollars, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Mate as saying mining, tourism, transport, energy and
 agriculture will play major roles in attracting FPI in the
post-ZCCM privatization period.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Motor Sales, Production Plunge in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Both the sales and production
of Romania's motor vehicles suffered a dramatic fall in the first
quarter this year to 50 percent and 30 percent respectively from
year-ago levels, the Nine O'clock daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time since 1992 that the sales of motor
vehicles have dropped so significantly," Paul Schiancu, President
of the Association of Automotive Manufacturers and Importers (APIA)
, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sales of vehicles during the period nose-dived to less than
half of the level a year earlier, from 33,000 to only 13,600 units,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Dacia and Daewoo, Romania's two major car producers,
registered drastic falls in sales, with the former posting a 62
percent fall and the latter 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The first quarter of this year has been very bad," Schiancu
said, adding that "there are no signals that the situation will
significantly improve."
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicle production plummeted over 30 percent in the first
three months of this year, compared with the same period of 1999,
totaling less than 21,000 vehicles, he said.
</P>
<P>
The production of Dacia cars plunged 36 percent mainly because
of the falling sales, which have caused a heavy stock and forced
the management to stop the manufacturing operations for variable
periods of time. The production of Daewoo cars and Roman trucks
dropped 7 percent and 28 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Schiancu attributed the dismal situation in the auto market to
the general decline of purchasing power of the population.

<HEADLINE> WTO: World Merchandise Trade to Grow Over 6.5 Percent in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The world merchandise trade growth
should reach 6.5 percent in the year 2000, the World Trade
Organization (WTO) predicted in its preliminary report published
here Thursday on trade developments in 1999 and the outlook for
this year.
</P>
<P>
Higher trade growth is possible, in particular, if the demand
in Western Europe and Japan pick up more strongly than currently
projected, according to the WTO report.
</P>
<P>
More robust growth of the world economy in 2000, together with
the carry-over effect due to the trade acceleration in the second
half of 1999, is projected to lead to export volume growth of at
least 6.5 percent, the WTO predicted in the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that most of this higher growth is expected to come
from Western Europe and to a lesser extent from Latin America, the
Middle East and the transition economies.
</P>
<P>
North America and the developing countries in Asia, which
recorded double digit import growth in 1999, are likely to expand
their imports less rapidly in 2000, and the projected deceleration
of North America's final demand should lead to less dynamic import
growth in 2000, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It cautioned that a sharp correction of the stock markets,
together with a marked slowing down of United States demand and
imports, could alter the trade forecast significantly. For example,
the United States merchandise trade deficit in 1999, at nearly 350
billion dollars, exceeded the total imports of Japan. And a
disruptive adjustment of the current external imbalances would
imply a major risk to trade growth in the near future, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The WTO said that the projections above were made on assumption
that the oil price will recede from its 30 U.S. dollars per barrel
level in the first quarter back to a range of 20 to 25 dollars and
that major financial market turbulence -- in particular a sudden
sharp correction of stock markets and the dollar rate -- can be
avoided in the remaining months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Global economic output is expected to accelerate from 3 percent
in 1999 to about 3.5 percent in 2000, the WTO said. In 2000, GDP
growth of industrial countries could expand by 3 percent or one
half percent faster than in 1999 as moderately lower growth in the
United States is more than offset by higher growth in Western
Europe and Japan. Latin America and the Middle East should see a
strong pick-up in their GDP growth after experiencing a stagnation
of output in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Higher growth is also projected for the transition and African
economies. GDP growth of the Asian developing countries is
projected to remain unchanged as the impact of the expansionary
fiscal policies and the rebuilding of inventories will be less
important in 2000 than in 1999, but offset by a strengthening of
fixed investment and private consumption.

PARIS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac on
Thursday inaugurated a new exhibition hall for master pieces of
primitive arts from Asia, Africa, Oceania, Arctic and America at
the Museum Louvre.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and former Prime Minister Alain
Juppe attended the inauguration at the 1,400-square-meter Pavillon

Wilmotte and gathers 117 pieces of sculptures.
</P>

The project was personally initiated by Chirac in 1995 and will
be expanded into a new museum of primitive arts, which is expected
to be built by 2004 near the Tower Eiffel by the Seine River.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Kerchache, Chirac's advisor for the future museum, said
that the exhibition is opened in the Louvre in order to show that
there is no difference in the value of arts across the world.
</P>
<P>
"In this museum where millions of people visit, it is to
demonstrate that there were great artists in all cultures, not
only in the West," he told the daily Le Figaro.

<HEADLINE> TV Projects Victory of South Korean Ruling Party in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling Millennium
Democratic Party (MDP) will become the biggest group in the
unicameral National Assembly, or parliament, by winning Thursday's
general elections, as showed by exit polls conducted by South
Korean TV stations.
</P>
<P>
The MBS TV predicted that the MDP will gain at least 127 seats
of the 273-member parliament while the main opposition Grand
National Party (GNP) will get 120 seats and the minor opposition
United Liberal Democrats (ULD) 17.
</P>
<P>
The MBS also showed that the Dear Democratic People's Party (
DDPP) will obtain three seats while other parties and independents
six seats.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint survey by South Korean KBS-TV and SBS-TV
forecast that the MDP will secure seats between 119 and 138 seats
and the GNP between 104 and 126.
</P>
<P>
Both televisions projected 12 seats for the ULD, one for the
DDPP, three for other parties and four for independents. The
margin of error for the KBS-SBS poll is plus or minus 3.1 to 4.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The three TV stations show that the MDP won all seats from its
political stronghold of North Cholla and South Cholla provinces
while the GDP got all from its political base North Kyongsang and
South Kyongsang provinces.
</P>
<P>
The general elections, the 16th in the country, began early
Thursday at 13,789 polling centers across the nation and ended in
the afternoon. A total of 1,176 runners are competing in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Television reports said that the turnout was the lowest in the
country's history with less than 60 percent of more than 34
million eligible voters casting votes.
</P>
<P>
The final result of the elections will come out late Thursday
or Friday morning.

KUWAIT, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Oman Football Association (OFA)
may withdraw from World Cup soccer qualifiers if the Asian
Football Confederation (AFC) turns down its request to host the
matches in their group, an OFA official said in Mascat, Oman on
Thursday.
</P>

The official said OFA had already agreed with Laos and the
Philippines for the Asian group one qualifiers to be played in
Oman in May 2001 but Syria had insisted on the matches being
played on a home and away basis.
</P>
<P>
"We talked to Laos and Philippines and they agreed to play all
the qualifying matches in Oman and the AFC approved it. However,
we now hear that the Asian soccer governing body might allow Syria
to have its way," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"It won't be fair if AFC turns down our request since the
majority of the teams in the group have already agreed to play in
Oman. If it does then we may have no choice but to reconsider our
participation to play the matches."

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Divers riding underwater
scooters will use sonar devices to scare away sharks at Sunday's
World Cup triathlon in Sydney Harbour.
</P>
<P>
However, event manager David Hansen said Thursday the divers
were there mainly to reassure international competitors who had
been worried by reports of shark attacks in Australia in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
Hansen said: "We don't see sharks as a problem. This is simply
a security blanket for the overseas competitors."
</P>
<P>
But he said the best deterrent for sharks was a large pack of
swimmers and the noise from motorised boats in place to shadow
athletes during the 1,500m swim from the steps of the Opera House.
</P>
<P>
A report commissioned by the Sydney Organising Committee for
the Olympic Games shows there has not been a shark attack in
Sydney Harbour in 208 years from May to November, and only one in
April.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's to Open Branch in China's Most Populous Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The world's fast food giant
McDonald's will open a branch in central China's Henan Province,
and gradually expand its business to China's northwest and
southwest markets.
</P>
<P>
McDonald's has signed a cooperation contract with Zhengzhou
Youyi (Commercial) Co. to set up Henan McDonald's Co., Ltd. in
this China's most populous province, which has a population of
some 93 million.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. fast food giant will bring its first investment of
five million U.S. dollars to this province in mid-April during an
international trade fair to be held here in the province.
</P>
<P>
McDonald's has chosen China as its important market for further
development in the year 2000, said Zhu Yuanhe, Vice-President of
McDonald's (China) Co., Ltd., who paid a visit to Henan recently.
</P>
<P>
Zhu believed that there would be a rosy picture for McDonald's
in Henan. McDonald's plans to open at least 30 restaurants in
seven cities in the province. The first restaurant is scheduled to
open in Zhengzhou, capital city of Henan, in July.
</P>
<P>
McDonald's is also considering setting up a distribution center
in Henan when the time is ripe. McDonald's purchasing people will
come to Henan to study the local cattle raising and other raw
materials processing bases.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yixiang, vice-governor of Henan Province, said that Henan
is a market with great potential and his provincial government
would create good conditions for bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
McDonald's has opened 25,000 restaurants in 119 countries and
regions since it opened its first one in the United States in 1955.
McDonald's has 257 restaurants in 17 provinces and municipalities
in China.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Canada has offered to take in some 15,000 Palestinian
refugees when a permanent status agreement between Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority is reached, a senior Israeli
government official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretian
made this offer to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak during his
visit here this week.
</P>
<P>
Chretian is the first leader to make such a concrete offer, but
Barak has said in the past that he hopes the international
community will all help with this complicated issue and that many
countries will offer haven to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- An agreement was reached Wednesday between the Finance
Ministry, the labor unions and the Union of Civil Servants to end
the strike of more than 10,000 civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Work will resume Thursday in government offices, although some
of the unions favor opening the odds to the public only on
Sunday, "to allow for preparations."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Security officials Wednesday ordered the release of 13 of the
15 Lebanese hostages being held in administrative detention in
Israel as bargaining chips for the freedom of captive Israeli
soldiers, following a Supreme Court decision upholding an appeal by
human rights attorney Zvi Rish.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who also holds the defense portfolio, said he respects
the court's decision, although he believes that Israel should
continue to hold the detainees for a certain period.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministry began preparing Wednesday for anticipated
petitions to the Supreme Court for the release of the remained two
prisoners Mustafa Dirani and Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid.
</P>
<P>
The state and military prosecutors believe that, unlike the
other detainees, it will be possible to convince the court that the
continued detention of Dirani and Obeid is necessary.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Members of One Israel and Meretz party were expressing a "
guarded optimism" Wednesday night on the chances of resolving the
coalition crisis in the wake of Wednesday's meeting between
Education Minister Yossi Sarid and his deputy minister Meshulam
Nahari .
</P>
<P>
It was the first one-on-one meeting between the two, of the
left-wing Meretz party and the ultraorthodox religious Shas party
respectively, since the escalation in recent months of the argument
over control of Shas's educational system.
</P>
<P>
Shas is demanding that Nahari be allowed to control the schools,
while Sarid insists he will not give Shas direct responsibility for
its own schools.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Moderate Culture Minister Resigns: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate Minister of Culture
and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani has resigned his post amid
speculation that President Mohammed Khatami is considering a
reshuffle of his cabinet, a local newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami had accepted Mohajerani's resignation and appointed
presidential advisor for higher education affairs Hadi Khaniki to
charge of the ministry, the conservative Tehran Times daily quoted
an informed source as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Mohajerani said on Monday at a press conference that he
had no intention to resign.
</P>
<P>
"My resignation would please certain dailies but I must say
there is no reason for them to be happy because I have not
resigned," he said.
</P>
<P>
The source declined to comment on Mohajerani's denial and gave
no specific reason for Mohajerani's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani held the post of deputy premier from 1985 to 1989.
After the post of premier was cancelled in 1989, he became vice
president in charge of parliamentary and legal affairs under former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, a founding member of the centralist Party of
Constructive Executives of Iran, has been under strong attack from
the conservatives who suffered serious setbacks in elections during
the past two years but still dominate most sensitive state organs.
</P>
<P>
He survived last May an impeachment motion by the conservative
Majlis (parliament) for his support of press freedom and vowed to
continue his policy to support the country's freedom-seeking press.
</P>
<P>
The minister said on Monday that his ministry would seek
legislation to annul the rights of any state organs to revoke the
licenses of any newspapers after the new Majlis with reformist
majority starts work in May.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been clouded by political tension since the sensitive
sixth parliamentary election in February, in which reformists
allied to President Khatami dealt a severe blow to the
conservatives by gaining more than 75 percent of the total 290
seats.
</P>
<P>
Pressure on the press has been building for the past few weeks
after the Iranian new year started on March 20, and several chiefs
and journalists of reformist newspapers have been summoned to
different courts while a chief-editor was put into prison.

<HEADLINE> Big Growth Seen in PSA Joint-Ventures in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Port of
Singapore Authority Corporation (PSA) Yeo Ning Hong told a press
conference Thursday that PSA's joint-ventures in China registered
significant growth in 1999 and their performance was "excellent."
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question at the press conference held to announce
PSA' annual performance for 1999, Yeo said throughput of the
Dalian Container Terminal (DCT), PSA's joint-venture project with
the Port of Dalian Authority (PDA) in Northeast China, hit 628,471
Twenty-feet Equivalent Units (TEUs) in 1999, an impressive 32.3
percent growth over 1998, and the Fuzhou Qingzhou and Fuzhou
Aofeng terminals, PSA's second port joint venture in China in
partnership with the Fuzhou Port Authority in Southeast China,
also saw significant growth in 1999, chalking an increase of 36
percent over 1998 with a throughput of 240,500 TEUs.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that customer's endorsement earned the DCT the
distinction of "Best Emerging Container Terminal" at the inaugural
LLoyd's List Maritime Asia Awards in November 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to PSA's annual report released at the press
conference, the Dalian Container Terminal and Fuzhou Qingzhou
Container Terminal won the titles of Best container Terminal and
the Excellent Container Port, respectively, at the China Freight
Industry Awards organized by the China Shipping Gazette. The
report also shows that the two enjoyed the highest growth rates
among PSA's 10 overseas ventures.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the significant growth of PSA's joint-
ventures in China to the strength of China's buoyant economy,
excellent support from the Chinese authorities and their customers,
as well as improvement in the terminal operations.
</P>
<P>
On PSA's general performance, Yeo said that the PSA Corporation
made good progress in 1999, registering 5.3 percent increase over
1998 with 15.9 million TEUs handled and the PSA Group reaped 1,103
million Singapore dollars (650 million U.S. dollars) in net profit
before tax, up 18 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Yeo said the year 2000 looks promising for the port and
shipping industry, citing that PSA Corporation handled a
phenomenal 4.2 million TEUs in the first quarter of this year,
representing a 15.4 percent increase compared to the same period
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Adopts Measures to Push Interest Rate Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Central Bank (CBN) has
reduced the minimum rediscount rate (MRR) from 18 percent to 17
percent in a bid to encourage borrowing.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, quoted a CBN
statement as saying Thursday that the essence of the downward
review was to influence indirectly the level and direction of
change in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
O.O. Akanji, director of Research of the Bank, said in Abuja
that the move was made in the light of the current fasting of
economic and market conditions, particularly the sustained decline
in the inflation rate and the inflow of funds into the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
Banking interest rate in the country, which stands as high as
about 30 percent in most cases, severely hindered the growth of
the manufacturing sector, said experts.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows More Than Half of Romanian Students Want to Work Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 13 (Xinhua) -- More than half of Romanian
students would prefer to work abroad after graduation, according
to a latest poll of Romanian university students.
</P>
<P>
The poll, published Thursday on Nine O'clock daily, surveyed 1,
598 students from 66 departments in 12 universities. The results
show that 67.5 percent of the students questioned in state
universities and 61.4 percent in private universities want to
emigrate.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the students interviewed would prefer to work
for foreign private companies, whereas only 12.4 percent would
prefer a Romanian private company and 11.3 percent said they would
like to work for a state company.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the poll carried out by the National Public
Opinion Institute, the Students Organization in the Bucharest
University organized a debate which was attended by Romanian
politicians. Participants in the debate said "brain drain" cannot
be stopped at present in Romania.
</P>
<P>
Romania's former president Ion Iliescu attributed the trend to
bureaucracy, the lack of stimulating work environments, and the
inaccessibility of education opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that young people do not have any prospective
to affirm themselves in the country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Merchandise Exports of Developing Countries Increase in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries' merchandise
exports in 1999 increased by 8.5 percent, about two times faster
than the global average, the World Trade Organization (WTO)
announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its preliminary report on trade developments in 1999, the
WTO noted that throughout the 1990s, developing countries' exports
rose faster than world trade, with the exception of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the share of developing countries was 27.5 percent for
merchandise exports and 23 percent for commercial services exports,
both more than 4 percentage points higher than those in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The global commercial services trade accelerated only slightly
in 1999, as the recovery in Asia and higher growth in North
America were partly offset by lower growth in western Europe as
well as a major contraction in Latin America and the transition
economies, the WTO said.
</P>
<P>
The global output and trade strengthened considerably in the
second half of 1999, thereby improving the prospects for higher
growth in the current year. The recovery in Asia and continued
high demand growth in North America contributed most to global
trade expansion last year.
</P>
<P>
World commodity output in 1999 increased by 1.5 percent, the
same as in 1998. A fall in mining sector output (in particular oil)
contrasted with stronger growth in the manufacturing sector (e.g.
electronic goods and automobiles). The global output of services
industries exceeded commodity output growth. The world GDP growth
increased from 2 percent in 1998 to 3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
World merchandise trade value increased by 3.5 percent in 1999,
faster than commercial services trade. Nevertheless, for the 1990-
99 period as a whole, the commercial services trade still expanded
slightly faster than merchandise trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Thursday it welcomes the simultaneous announcement of a summit
meeting between President Kim Dae-jung of the Republic of Korea (
ROK) and National Defense Committee Chairman Kim Jong Il of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
"As a long-standing advocate of direct dialogue between the two
Koreas," the 15-nation bloc said in a presidency declaration, the
EU considers that such a summit "would be a significant and
historic event" with considerable potential for easing tensions on
the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The EU reaffirmed its support for "the engagement policy and
for the proposals relating to peace and reunification in the
Korean Peninsula" made in Berlin on March 9 by President Kim Dae-
jung.
</P>
<P>
The EU also hopes that the summit will become "a milestone in
the process towards a lasting reconciliation on the Peninsula as
well as towards enhancing regional stability."
</P>
<P>
The declaration was made by Portugal, the current holder of the
EU presidency, on behalf of all EU member countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- People's courts at various levels
in Beijing accepted and heard 3,632 citizen-vs.-government cases
during 1990-1999.
</P>
<P>
Among these, 3,616 cases were concluded, and the citizens won
in 832 cases.
</P>
<P>
The citizen-vs.-government cases concerned all sorts of
administrative acts involving patents, trademarks, land and
mineral resources, foreign investment, supervision over
pharmaceuticals, management of state assets, unfair competition,
urban planning, education, and the press and publications.
</P>
<P>
China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress,
adopted the Administrative Procedure Law in 1989, stipulating that
if a citizen, corporation, or any other organization or entity
considers that lawful rights and interests have been infringed
upon by a specific administrative act, the complainant shall have
the right to bring suit before a people's court.
</P>
<P>
The courts in Beijing also tried more than 7,000 cases
concerning administrative organs asking the courts' help in
supervising the implementation of certain administrative acts.

<HEADLINE> WB Loans Help Chinese Cure Tuberculosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Tailor Liu Zhixi recently
recovered from tuberculosis and is now able to reopen his shop and
get back to work.
</P>
<P>
Whenever people say an admiring word to him, he always responds:
"It was the tuberculosis prevention project that saved my whole
family."
</P>
<P>
Liu lives in Guanqia Village in the Taihang mountainous area in
north China's Hebei Province. A few years ago he could not even
use his scissors to make clothes because of tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
A TV program about tuberculosis prevention brought Liu to the
local epidemic prevention hospital where he and his family members
received medical checkups. His two daughters were also found to be
suffering from tuberculosis, and the hospital offered free medical
treatment to the entire Liu family, who have now all recovered.
</P>
<P>
The tuberculosis prevention project that Liu mentioned is the
one implemented with World Bank (WB) loans and Hebei provincial
and local money beginning in 1991. The project has received a
total investment of 12.22 million U.S. dollars, 6.23 million of
which came from WB loans.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that the project has included nearly
600 million people across China.
</P>
<P>
The problem of tuberculosis resurfaced in recent years after
years of silence due to the spread of AIDs, and for other reasons,
and has been declared an emergency health issue by the World
Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The disease has been a long-time problem in Hebei, which has a
population of 66 million.
</P>
<P>
In 1991-1999, over 510,000 people in the province received
medical checkup, and more than 97 percent of the 120,000 people
who were discovered to have tuberculosis have now recovered after
medical treatment. Some 70,000 of them have also returned to work.
</P>
<P>
The province also has set up 156 out-patient departments for
tuberculosis patients over the past seven years, and more than 80,
000 doctors from villages and counties received tuberculosis
prevention training.
</P>
<P>
In northeast China's Liaoning Province, the tuberculosis
prevention project has benefited everyone, as more than 40,000
patients have recovered during the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
Along with Hebei and Liaoning, 10 other provinces and
municipalities including Sichuan Province and Chongqing
Municipality in the southwest have undertaken tuberculosis
prevention with the aid of WB loans.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Int'l Shipping Center in Shanghai (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Confronted with fierce
competition from surrounding international ports, Shanghai, the
largest port in China's mainland, has stepped up efforts to
achieve its goal of becoming an international shipping center.
</P>
<P>
Ruan Yanhua, deputy director of the Administrative Committee of
the Pudong New Area, said that the city is now launching the third
stage of the newly developed Waigaoqiao Port Area in Pudong, while
preliminary preparations for the fourth stage are underway.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, billions of dollars have already
been spent on deep water berths in the city, said Gu Gang, deputy
director of the Int'l Shipping Center Construction Administration
under the Shanghai Municipal People's Government.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Gu said that a
feasibility study is being conducted on a new large-scale
container wharf between the Dayangshan Island and the Xiaoyangshan
Island in the East China Sea, 27.5 km from the city.
</P>
<P>
Investors from the United States, Britain, Denmark and a dozen
other countries have contacted Shanghai, expressing interest in
planning, designing and constructing the wharf.
</P>
<P>
Now operating container shipping routes to more than 120 ports
across the world, Shanghai aims to increase container handling to
8.5 million TEUs (twenty-feet equivalent units) by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say this will not only accelerate the city's endeavor
to become an international trade center but also be conducive to
the development of the Yangtze River area and developing the
western part of the country.

<P>
FUZHOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province is
making effort to provide 98 percent of its 15,000 villages with
access to telephone by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province has carried out a series of key
telecommunications projects to erect phone lines to 92.5 percent
of its villages.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial telecommunications department
official, by the end of the third quarter this year, the
provincial government will invest 60 million yuan (about 7.23
million US dollars) to open telephone service in 110 villages in
remote poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
"This will allow us to bring the economic developments as well
as technological priorities to most villages," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Although telecommunications in the province's urban areas have
experienced a booming era in recent years, the rural areas are
still rather backward, the official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Four consecutive years of
severe drought have evaporated the drinking water of nearly 1.5
million people in north China's Hebei Province which surrounds
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Hebei is facing a shortage of 800 million cubic meters of water,
said Wang Jun, deputy director of the provincial flood control and
drought relief office.
</P>
<P>
About 2.8 million hectares of cultivated land is now endangered
by the long drought, and 380,000 head of livestock are also in
dire need of water.
</P>
<P>
The province has transferred more than 200 million cubic meters
of water from China's second largest river, the Yellow River. Some
counties, such as Zhangjiakou in the northern part of the province,
have bought water from the neighboring province of Shanxi in order
to save the local crops.
</P>
<P>
This year's Spring has been dry and hot, with more sand storms
than in normal years, a combination making the drought much worse,
Wang Jun said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-three laid-off workers
have become nurses qualified to look after women during their
month of confinement after giving birth.
</P>
<P>
They are the first group of professional nursery maids in China.
After receiving professional hospital training, they are able to
help young parents take care of new born babies scientifically,
and help relieve the parents' burdens.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that nearly two-thirds of the 284 people polled
said they would like to have such aid at home when they have a
baby.
</P>
<P>
This month of confinement is of special importance to Chinese
women after they give birth, and traditionally grandmothers are
invited to take care of the mother and her baby during the first
four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
About 506,000 laid-off workers in Liaoning, China's traditional
heavy industrial base in the northeast, found new jobs last year,
and about half of them have become housekeepers.

<TEXT>
<P>
Analysts say that Shanghai has had to compete with many other
Asian ports such as Kobe, Tokyo and Yokohama and Pusan in the
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai needs to take immediate measures to resolve two major
problems, namely, a shortage in container berths and a relatively
shallow navigation channel at the mouth of the Yangtze, where the
port is located.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics indicate that Shanghai's container
handling capacity has fallen behind the needs of clients although
it has been surging at an annual rate of 25 percent over the past
decade, with capacity reaching 4.21 million TEUs, ranking seventh
in the world. Hong Kong ranks first with over 16 million TEUs.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that the prospect of China's entry into the World Trade
Organization has called for even faster expansion and upgrading of
the port. "If we don't speed up the construction of the
international shipping center, multinational shipping companies
will turn to other ports," Gu said.
</P>
<P>
To date, overseas shipping companies, including the world's top
20 container shipping companies, have established over 80
subsidiaries in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
China's three biggest shipping companies, the Container
Transport Company of the China Ocean Shipping Corporation, the
China Shipping Group, and Sinotrans Container Shipping Company
have all moved their headquarters to Shanghai.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Employment opportunities in urban
areas of China are shifting from public sectors to private sectors
at an accelerating pace, official figures show.
</P>
<P>
According to a national survey conducted by the National Bureau
of Statistics (NBS), The number of self-employed individuals in
urban areas in 1998 was 53 times greater than 20 years ago.
Meanwhile, the proportion of public sector employees was nearly
half of that in two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the self-employed accounted for 11 percent of all
urban employment, compared with 0.2 percent in 1978.
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1998, employees in government-run sectors
decreased from 78.3 percent to 43.8 percent. The growth rate of
self-employed persons has far exceeded that of the urban
employment.
</P>
<P>
Over the 20 years, urban employment increased by 1.2 times to
206.8 million. More than 22 million of them are self-employed, and
over 90 million of them are in public sectors.
</P>
<P>
Employees in urban collective enterprises slumped from 21.5
percent to 9.5 percent in the same period.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Dumping Against ROK, Japanese Steel Products Takes Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China has implemented today
temporary anti-dumping measures against cold-rolled stainless
steel sheets imported from the Republic of Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
said in an announcement that from today, all importers of cold-
rolled stainless steel sheets originally made in the Republic of
Korea and Japan, covering six taxable items, will have to hand in
a certain amount of cash as guarantee money to Chinese Customs.
</P>
<P>
The amount of guarantee money to be handed in should suit the
degree of dumping as determined by the preliminary ruling of the
Chinese authorities, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary ruling jointly made by MOFTEC and the State
Economic and Trade Commission says dumping does exist, and has
resulted in substantial injury to relevant Chinese industries.
</P>
<P>
A MOFTEC announcement on June 17 last year said that China had
decided to begin an anti-dumping investigation into imported steel
sheets. Over the subsequent several months, MOFTEC and the General
Administration of Customs investigated the import trade, and the
State Economic and Trade Commission and other relevant Chinese
departments launched investigations into the damage done by
dumping.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investigation Results for Bombing Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia Unacceptable: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The accountability review results
provided by the United States concerning the U.S. bombing of the
Chinese embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia last May are
not tenable and the Chinese side found them unacceptable, said
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi here today.
</P>
<P>
At a regular press conference, Sun said the U.S. bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia on May 8, last year, was an
extremely serious international unlawful act which infringed
gravely on China's sovereignty, greatly hurt the dignity of the
Chinese people and severely damaged Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side repeated its version of investigation results it
provided to the Chinese side in June last year, admitting only
that the U.S. side used an inappropriate methodology to locate the
target and that the review process at every level failed to find
the mistake, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The explanation that the entire review process went wrong in
the same link because of the negligence of a number of people is
obviously not tenable, and hence unacceptable by the Chinese side,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S government should have a clear understanding of China's
solemn stand and position on the issue, and conduct a
comprehensive and thorough investigation into its bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, bring the perpetrators to justice
and give the Chinese Government and people a satisfactory
explanation, and remove the serious negative impact of issue on
Sino-U.S. relations, Sun said.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Palace Museum has added more
than 240,000 treasured relics to its collection since the founding
of the People's Republic of China in 1949, according to a recently
published data book.
</P>
<P>
The book is published by the Beijing Forbidden City Publishing
House and provides readers with specific information on as many as
240,888 items, most of which were donated by governmental organs.
</P>
<P>
According to the book, the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage (SACH) gave 101,772 relics to the museum and another 21,
875 were donated by individuals.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the reserves were bought by the museum from antique
shops, auction houses, and private collectors.
</P>
<P>
The relics include some priceless items such as masterpieces
created by well-known calligraphers and painters including Wang
Xianzhi, Li Bai, Han Huang, Gu Hongzhong, Lu Ji, Zhan Ziqian,
Zhang Xian, Shen Zhou, and Shi Tao.
</P>
<P>
As the imperial residence of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (
1644-1911) dynasties, the Forbidden City, another name for the
Palace Museum, remains China's largest group of ancient structures.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) added the Palace Museum to its World
Heritage List in 1988.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Man-Raised Sturgeons Born in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- About 13,000 sturgeons were born
to an eight-year-old man-raised sturgeon in Beijing recently. This
was the first time Chinese experts succeeded in producing such
sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
The experiment was made by the National Fresh Water Fishery
Research Center, and the Beijing Science and Technology Committee,
according to today's Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
The sturgeon, which is considered a "living fossil," has been
in existence for more than 200 million years. Elements drawn from
its cartilage can help prevent cancer, and its meat and internal
organs can also be made into medicines, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Sturgeon roe is famous as "black caviar," and its skin can be
made into expensive leather.
</P>
<P>
Companies in Beijing began to raise this fish of high economic
value using artificial methods in 1996, but they had to buy the
roe or fries from European countries.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the success of the artificial reproduction of
sturgeon may help local companies find a cheaper way to raise the
rare fish.

<HEADLINE> Dangerous Cult Exposed in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A dangerous religious cult has
brainwashed at least 70 youths in Cypriot capital of Nicosia and
more in southern coast town of Limassol, the Cyprus Mail newspaper
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Andreas Phylachtou, speaking Wednesday at a news conference
organized by the Pancyprian Union of parents, confirmed he "had
lost" his daughter to the Disciples of Christ.
</P>
<P>
Phylachtou said with tears in his eyes that he had found out
almost two years ago that his 27-year-old daughter was part of what
he claimed was a devious, money-orientated cult that hid its
identity behind offshore companies operating on the island.
</P>
<P>
Phylachtou, on behalf of parents whose children had fallen
victims to the cult, said "our children were normal until they lost
control of themselves and their personalities."
</P>
<P>
He said their children suddenly decided to give up their studies
and dealt with nothing else than the cult's organization and its
frequent meetings. If they miss one meeting they will receive
dozens of phone calls from the organization chief.
</P>
<P>
"They hold the Bible acting as if they were hypnotized and try
to draw more people into the cult in gyms, colleges and other
learning institutes," Phylachtou said, noting that the children
have paid money now and then to the cult.
</P>
<P>
Phylachtou said he had managed to infiltrate a cult meeting two
weeks ago, and had found out that a policeman was involved in the
cult's organization.
</P>
<P>
He exposed that some foreign young people from the U.S. and
other countries are spreading the religion. The cult paid their
tuition fee at the University of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
According to the Pancyprian Union of Parents, the Disciples of
Christ are known internationally as a highly dangerous cult, and
based their beliefs on readings of the New Testament.

<HEADLINE> Iran Starts Trial on Jews Accused of Espionage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative revolutionary
court on Thursday started a controversial trial on 13 Iranian Jews
charged with spying for Tehran's arch foes of the United States and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The state-run television reported that the closed-door trial was
opened in Shiraz, the southern Fars province where the defendants
were arrested with eight Iranian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The families of eight Jews have chosen their defense lawyers and
the court have appointed lawyers for two others, while the three
who were released on bail have not appointed any lawyers.
</P>
<P>
However, defense lawyers have called for a postponement of the
trial as they have had limited time to go through details of the
case, which arouses grave concern from the U.S., Israel and other
European countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israel have denied any link between their
intelligence services and the Iranian Jews and have repeatedly
urged Iran to release the Jews since their arrest in March and
April last year. But Tehran has rejected the appeal as "
interference" in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian conservative judiciary has promised a "fair and
open" trial for the Jews and some judicial officials said that not
all of the 13 Jews will be charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iranian laws, the defendants might be sentenced to
death if they are convicted of spying for foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt to Lower Medicine Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
given itself six months to bring down prices of medicines in the
country as part of the Estrada administration's efforts to make
life-saving health care available to all Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Romualdez, secretary of the Department of Health (DOH),
said Thursday his office and the Department of Trade and Industry(
DTI) are studying several measures to achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
"We are now considering some approaches so we can bring down
the prices of medicines in the next six months," Romualdez said in
a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada earlier noted that prices of medicine
in his country cost 10 times more than in other Asian countries,
such as India.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez said his office has been meeting with representatives
of the pharmaceutical industry to find ways of bringing down
medicine prices.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, DTI Secretary Mar Roxas disclosed that the government
is
finalizing negotiations with foreign drug manufacturers to bring
in low-priced quality medicines into the country.
</P>
<P>
Roxas said medicine manufacturers from India were the first to
discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
The DTI chief noted that aside from accelerating the process of
bringing in low-priced medicines into the country, the government
is also making sure that quality control is strictly observed in
the importation of these goods.
</P>
<P>
To ensure these imported medicines do not get into the hands of
private distributors who may sell them at the usual steep prices,
the government will pass them on to the DOH, which will, in turn,
hand them out to government hospitals, Roxas said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Step Up Cooperation on Immigration Matters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines on Thursday urged
its fellow members in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (
ASEAN)to strengthen cooperation on immigration and consular
matters and in fighting transnational crime, reports reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the ASEAN high level experts group
meeting on immigration and consular matters in Lapu-Lapu City in

development of an ASEAN plan of action on immigration and consular
matters, a directory of immigration focal points and a regional
approach for confronting the problem of human trafficking.
</P>
<P>
He said that the meeting will concretize strategies and action
plans to enhance further cooperation on immigration and consular
matters which will be presented for final approval at the 4th
meeting of ASEAN director-generals of immigration departments and
heads of consular divisions to be held in the Philippines in

<HEADLINE> World Conservationists Opposed to Reopening Turtle Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Fund for Animal
Welfare (IFAW) is completely opposed to relaxing the ban on trade
in hawksbill turtle, according to a statement released here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and Dominica have submitted two proposals to the ongoing
11th meeting of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES) held in Nairobi on April 10-20.
</P>
<P>
They demanded transfer of hawksbill turtle from Appendix I,
which bans any trade, to Appendix II, which permits regulated
trade. They also seek approval to make one shipment of 6,900
kilograms of shell stockpile to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The conservation organization feared that the resumption of
international trade will stimulate the stockpiling of shell by
other countries and the illegal killing of hawksbill turtles
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
More than 135 respected sea turtle experts and conservationists
from over 40 countries have also publicly opposed to the Cuban
proposals, signing on to a petition drafted by the IFAW.
</P>
<P>
"Reopening the trade in this already critically endangered
turtle will encourage further illegal trade of shell," said IFAW's
species campaigner Sarah Tyack. "Turtle conservation projects
throughout the Caribbean as well as the hawksbill will suffer if
the proposals are passed."
</P>
<P>
The issue on hawksbill turtle trade has maintained on CITES
Appendix I since 1977.

<HEADLINE> SADC Members Urged to Increase Fish Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) have been urged to increase
fish production so as to reach the international consumption
standard.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a SADC workshop on a proposed fisheries protocol
here on Wednesday, Zambian Fisheries Permanent Secretary Russell
Mulele said the region has potential to increase fish production,
Zambia Daily Mail reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mulele said the main challenge faced by SADC states is that of
low fish consumption which stands at nine kilograms per person per
year as opposed to the World Health Organization's recommended
consumption of 17 kilograms per person per year.
</P>
<P>
Mulele said that the importance of increasing production and
productivity of the fisheries sector as well as sustainable use of
the fish resources should not be underrated as this can contribute
positively to the overall economic growth and development of the
SADC region.
</P>
<P>
He said since most of the fisheries resources are shared among
member states in terms of lakes and river systems, a legal
protocol should be introduced for the benefit of rapid growth of
the fisheries sector.

SEOUL -- More than 34 million South Korean voters are going to
the polls Thursday to elect the 16th National Assembly, or
parliament, of the country, with no single party likely to win a
great majority.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's poll to elect 273 legislators, including 46
distributed to parties in proportion to voters, out of 1,176
runners, is believed a watershed for political stability for the
remaining tenure of President Kim Dae-jung, which will last to
early 2002.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Kim Dae-jung's government may become a lame duck
if his ruling Millennium Democratic Party (MDP) loses by a wide
margin to the biggest opposition Grand National Party (GNP). (

<HEADLINE> China Adjusts Glucide Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A nearly 50-year-old glucide
production line has been dismantled here recently, marking the
beginning of China's effort in a nation-wide adjustment in glucide
production.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has learned that over the past decade, repeating
construction of glucide production enterprises doubled the output
of glucide, reaching 30,000 tons annually.
</P>
<P>
Excessive sales of glucide caused 125 sugar plants stop
production, with 125,000 workers losing their jobs, and badly
harmed the interest of 15 million sugar farmers.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has set a good example for the nation-wide adjustment
by dismantling the production line, the first of its like in China,
said Shi Wanpeng, vice-minister in charge of the State Economic
and Trade Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
To protect an orderly competition among sugar production
enterprises and promote the normal development of rural economy,
the SETC has decided to close nine of the country's 14 glucide
production enterprises.
</P>
<P>
After the adjustment, China's annul glucide output will be
reduced to about 1,400 tons, about 28,600 tons less than now, and
the annul glucide output capacity will be kept at 18,400 tons,
according to the SETC.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Government of southwest China's
Yunnan Province has made an financial-aid plan to provide 18
million yuan (2.16 million US dollars) per year as tuition for 120,
000 poverty-stricken pupils.
</P>
<P>
These primary school students are living in 123 villages and
townships of 25 counties bordering Vietnam, Laos and Burma.
</P>
<P>
In the new semester this year, each of the students received
150 yuan aid from the provincial government as education tuition
and fees on books and studying utensils.
</P>
<P>
A local educational official said that the plan aims at helping
the poverty-stricken students, especially ethnic pupils living in
border areas, complete the country's nine-year compulsory
education.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has set up a special education fund
in 1996, which offers 2.55 million yuan annually to poverty-
stricken students in border counties, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The province's border line totals 4,060 km long. Thanks to the
effort of local educational departments, 99 percent of the school-
aged children in the border areas can now attend school, he added.

<HEADLINE> Women Ask for The Same Pension as Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Women's federations in China
have been receiving letters from women intellectuals who want the
same retirement pay as their male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) have already sent
letters to the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) and the Ministry of Personnel requesting them to
reconsider existing regulation concerning the retirement age and
pension for men and women.
</P>
<P>
 Regulations stipulate that female intellectuals should retire
at 55 years old, while their male counterparts can retire at 60.
Retired women receive less pension because they retire earlier.
</P>
<P>
 Employees, who work for the government or state-run
enterprises for more than 35 years can enjoy a pension, which is
88 percent of their salary, according to state regulations. But
those who work for more than 30 years can only receive 82 percent
of their original salary after retirement.
</P>
<P>
 Some local governments have issued policies to change the
current situation. For example, Shanghai has issued regulation
which extend jobs for those with higher degrees.
</P>
<P>
The Wuhan municipal government has issued regulations
allowing female government employees to enjoy the same pension as
their male counterparts though they will still retire at 55.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Personnel said that they are
waiting for decisions from the NPC Standing Committee to make
revisions to existing regulations.

<HEADLINE> Food Contamination Often Ignored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Contaminated fruit and vegetables
are often consumed by people without realizing that they have been
sprayed with poisonous pesticides.
</P>
<P>
A 1998 study of fruit and vegetables on the market in Beijing
revealed that 20 percent of the samples contained pesticide
residues that exceed the state standards, according to "China
Youth Daily".
</P>
<P>
Lu Xirong, a poisoning control expert with the Chinese Academy
of Preventive Medicine blames poor production management, citing
that some growers have no idea about the pesticides they use. Some
even intentionally spray banned pesticides on vegetables and fruit.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 cases of food poisoning caused by poisonous pesticides
were reported to the Ministry of Health last year. More tan 100
people died and 5,000 people fell seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
Lu urged governmental departments concerned to regulate the
pesticide market and give more instructions to both manufacturers
and users.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Bee Industry Threatened by Pest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's bee industry is
being threatened by a pest called "Varroa bee mite."
</P>
<P>
Television New Zealand reported Thursday that the New Zealand
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) is investigating the
case to determine the scale of infestations.
</P>
<P>
Recent discovery of the Varroa bee mite in hives on South
Auckland properties has resulted in MAF declaring Wednesday a
biosecurity alert for a large area in and around the Auckland
region on the country's North Island. MAF fears the bug may have
also spread to Otago on South Island.
</P>
<P>
The Varroa bee mite is spread by bees and in time kills the
entire hive. The bug is regarded as the most serious threat ever
faced by the multi-million-dollar industry in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has an about a million U.S. dollar trade in
exporting live bees, and a more than 10 million U.S. dollar honey
industry.
</P>
<P>
Until now, New Zealand and Australia have been considered the
only major bee-keeping countries free of the Varroa mite.
</P>
<P>
MAF believes the mite may have been present undetected for up
to five-years. It was reported that major outbreaks in Britain and
the United States have wiped out over half of bee populations
there.

<HEADLINE> Huge Gap in Annual Salaries for CEOs in China's State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey by the National
Statistics Bureau (NSB) shows a blaring discrepancy in annual
salaries for CEOs in state-owned enterprises, which range from 2,
000 to more than one million yuan, China Business has reported.
</P>
<P>
The survey was carried out among company heads in Beijing,
Shanghai and Chongqing municipalities, and in provinces of Jiangsu,
Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Guangdong and Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
The gap in annual salaries for CEOs varied from region to
region and from company to company.
</P>
<P>
In southwest China's Sichuan Province, the highest annual
salary for a CEO stood at more than one million yuan, 200 times
the average income of employees in his enterprise. The lowest
annual salary for a CEO is 25,000 yuan, only 5.8 times that of
his employees.
</P>
<P>
The difference is smaller in Henan Province, where the top pay
was 54,000 yuan, five times the average income of employees, and
the lowest only 3,720 yuan, the same as employees.
</P>
<P>
The payment system, in which payroll is calculated in annual
term, has been in place in some state-owned enterprises in those
provinces and municipalities in recent years. The system was
designed to encourage creativeness and improving management skill
among CEOs while helping bring forth a talent contingent of
entrepreneurs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh to Face Criticism from Donors  (by Pan Xiaozhu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The government of Bangladesh is
likely to face a wave of criticism from donor countries at the
Bangladesh Development Forum meeting that begins in Paris Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is attended by representatives of bilateral donors
and multilateral agencies contributing to Bangladesh's socio-
economic development. Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria leads
the Bangladesh official delegation to the meeting arranged by the
World Bank (WB) which is the official coordinator for the donors.
</P>
<P>
Pervasive corruption, the thorny political scenario, slow pace
of institutional reforms, fragile economic situation and lack of
infrastructure facilities are some of the issues that might create
the ground for the likely grouse of donors, the daily Financial
Express reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Donors have already indicated that the aid flow to Bangladesh
in the coming fiscal year would hover between 1.8 billion U.S.
dollars and 2.2 billion dollars. The development partners,
meanwhile, hinted that the level of assistance would depend mostly
on the pace of reforms.
</P>
<P>
"This assistance could be significantly higher if the pace of
reform was accelerated," said a letter from the WB's Country
Director in Bangladesh, on behalf of the donor countries and
agencies, to the Bangladesh's finance minister by the end of the
last month.
</P>
<P>
It said that "the development partners emphasized that the
realization of even the lower figure will depend crucially on
accelerated progress in policy and institutional reform and faster
utilization of existing aid in the pipeline."
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, under almost any circumstances, the
fiscal performance of the country in the current fiscal (1999-2000)
year is likely to decline as compared to that in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal performance in 2000 so far shows signs of a further
deterioration, said the WB, urging the government of Bangladesh to
expedite its revenue collections through special efforts and take
austerity measures in case of expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The country's macro-economic situation was almost sound during
most of the 1990s. "However, there has recently been some slippage
in the macro-economic framework," the WB's letter said.
</P>
<P>
The external current account deficit was on average below three
percent of GDP during the fiscal 1990-1998 and the foreign
exchange reserve level was at over three months of imports. The
overall budget deficit averaged around 4.8 percent of GDP per
annum, with domestic financing limited to 1.1 percent of GDP per
annum.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth has also dropped to 4.8 percent in fiscal 1999
from the average growth rate of 5 percent during 1990-1998. The WB,
however, expected a 5.4 percent growth in current fiscal thanks to
another bumper crop.
</P>
<P>
To generate productive employment and reduce poverty, the WB
highlighted the urgency for accelerating the country's export-
oriented manufacturing and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing growth, according the WB, continues to remain
weak due to loss of competitiveness, infrastructure bottlenecks
and lack of social stability.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector recently lost some of its dynamism
after growing impressively at 7.7 percent per annum during fiscal
1990-98.The growth dropped sharply to less than 3.2 percent in
fiscal 1999 and this sluggishness continued into the fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
The letter attributed this to "higher cost of doing business
and loss of competitiveness" both in the domestic and
international markets due to increased political instability and
slower reform.
</P>
<P>
The export growth, however, recovered to 7.2 percent through
December 1999. The recovery could continue during the rest of the
fiscal year if Bangladesh can take advantage of strong growth
momentum of exports volumes in North America, Europe and Asia, the
WB letter said.
</P>
<P>
Besides progress in institutional reforms, the most discussed
issue at the Paris meeting will be the rampant corruption in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Donors believe that if Bangladesh could reduce corruption level
to those prevailing in countries with the highest reputation for
honest dealing could add between 2.1 to 2.9 percent to the annual
per capita GDP growth, the WB letter said, adding that this could
lower the country's poverty by 25 percent. The judgment is that
per capita income in a corruption free Bangladesh could have
nearly doubled to 700 U.S.dollar instead of 350.
</P>
<P>
Donors will also discuss the country's political situation. The
Financial Express Thursday quoted a paper prepared by the Local
Consultative Group of donors as saying that political disruption
in the country "affects the prospects of democratic transition and
the climate for foreign investment."
</P>
<P>
The donors also expressed their willingness to hold the
discussions at the soonest for the assessment of their possible
assistance for the next parliamentary elections in the country
scheduled in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Belgian King in Good Condition After Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Belgian King Albert II was
operated early on Thursday for a heart bypass remedy and was in "
good" condition, his doctor said.
</P>
<P>
The operation took two and a half hours at the Hospital Onze
Lieve Vrouw d'Alost, where Doctor Hugo van Ermen announced the
result of the operation and the condition of the king.
</P>
<P>
"The king is doing well," said the doctor, chief of the
hospital's cardio-vascular department.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt has decided to halt his
vacation at Toscane and return to Brussels Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The king and Queen Fabiola had scheduled to receive the
visiting Jordanian king Wednesday, but only the queen and Prince
Laurent received the Jordanian king and his family instead.
</P>
<P>
King Albert II and Queen Fabiola just paid a state visit to the
Netherlands, the second royal visit in more than 40 years. The
Belgian royals last visited the Netherlands in 1959 while an
unofficial visit was made in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
During the April 4-6 visit to the Netherlands, the Belgian king
and queen visited an urbanization project, a humanitarian project
for disadvantaged children, the headquarters of the Organization
for the Protection of Chemical Weapons and the Hague Municipal
Museum.
</P>
<P>
They also met with Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok.

<HEADLINE> Credit Consumption Heating up in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- As more and more people in
south China's Guangdong Province favor insurance and security
markets or buying real estate, private consumption using credit
loans soared 26.8 percent to reach 2,577 yuan per capita last year.
</P>
<P>
Housing, medical and pension systems reforms have had a huge
impact on the way people manage and spend their money. There has
been a shift from bank deposit to credit consumption, said
economic analysts.
</P>
<P>
The per capita bank deposit in Guangdong averaged 2,075 yuan
last year, up only 0.1 percent over the previous year while the
total money drawn from deposits grew up by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The per capita insurance expenditure last year stood at 221
yuan, up 230 percent over that in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong boasts the largest group of high-income families in
China. The averaged household disposable income of this group was
18,000 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Banks in China are devoted to providing loan services through
simplifying formalities in offering loans.

<HEADLINE> South China Rare Birds Bred in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese ornithologists have
successfully bred a number of rare bird species, which inhabit in
semitropical areas in south China, in Shanhaiguan, a famous scenic
spot in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The rare species, which include peacock, silver pheasant,
thrush and parrot, have been multiplied in the city's bird
breeding center, said an ornithologist.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, the center has bred 15 silver pheasants, 60 parrots,
150 thrushes and more than 300 peacocks. Many of the birds have
moved to live in the city's bird park, attracting hundreds of
tourists and residents every day.
</P>
<P>
The center was set up last April for the aim of breeding
Chinese rare birds to increase their number. At the same time, it
will provide valuable reference for scientific research and
protection on other rare plants and animals.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Political Parties Locked in Close Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 34 million South Korean
voters are going to the polls Thursday to elect the 16th National
Assembly, or parliament, of the country, with no single party
likely to win a great majority.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's poll to elect 273 legislators, including 46
distributed to parties in proportion to voters, out of 1,176
runners, is believed a watershed for political stability for the
remaining tenure of President Kim Dae-jung, which will last to
early 2002.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Kim Dae-jung's government may become a lame duck
if his ruling Millennium Democratic Party (MDP) loses by a wide
margin to the biggest opposition Grand National Party (GNP).
</P>
<P>
The result of the poll is expected to critically affect
President Kim's political and economic reform and even the
scheduled inter-Korean summit on June 12-14.
</P>
<P>
At present, the MDP controls 98 seats of the parliament while
the GNP occupies 120 and the small opposition United Liberal
Democrats (ULD) 48.
</P>
<P>
Voters' attention is focused on which of the two parties will
become the largest group in the unicameral parliament for a four-
year term.
</P>
<P>
Both the ruling and opposition parties are expected to win some
100 seats and the ULD and and independents are likely to share the
remainder.
</P>
<P>
The ruling MDP has pleaded for voters to back its candidates,
saying its defeat would hamper the drive reform by President Kim
while the opposition Grand National Party has called for voters to
pass "stern" judgement on Kim's "mismangement of state affairs."
</P>
<P>
Observors said the outcome of the elections in politically
natural Seoul and Kyonggy province is crucial, given that most
voters cast ballots by regional lines.
</P>
<P>
On the strength of overwhelming support from their respective
political strongholds of the Cholla and Kyongsang provinces, the
the MDP and the GDP were locked in a fierce battle to dominate the
capital city and its vicinities, which account for 43 percent of
the total 227 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the historic agreement signed in Beijing for an
inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang on June 12-14 this year will help
the ruling party's candidates.
</P>
<P>
The MDP promised a better life for the middle class and the
needy, saying that President Kim need popular support to continue
his reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Voters should give us the power so that President Kim can
produce accomplishments in the inter-Korean summit and keep
working for the people and the country," said MDP Chairman Lee In-
je.
</P>
<P>
However, the GNP has dealt a blow to the ruling party with the
astronomical amount of the national debt and other economic
matters.
</P>
<P>
"Voters should back the GNP as it is the only force that could
effective hold the ruling camp in check," said GNP secretary Suh
Chung-won.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ULD President Lee Han-dong said if the MDP and
GNP secured a majority, the next parliament would be thrown into
even deeper confusion.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Banned From Traveling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But a member of Soeharto's lawyers Juan Felix Tampubolon in an
interview with Xinhua Thursday morning said that his side has not
received any letter issued by the attorney's office in connection
with the decision.
</P>
<P>
"We have yet seen the letter. We just know from the media,"
Tampubolon said.
</P>
<P>
Director of Corruption Affairs, Chairul Imam said Wednesday
night that the travel ban was imposed in order to simplify the
investigation process, and his side has sent the letter to
Soeharto's family.
</P>
<P>
"The ban is to ensure that Soeharto could fulfill every summons
and be met with anytime," Imam was quoted by the Jakarta Post as
saying, adding that the restriction was made in anticipation of
news that Soeharto's family had planned to take the former strong
man abroad for further medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Rumors had been rife that Soeharto's family had recently
applied for the U.S. visa and had bought a house in the U.S., the
Post quoted a source as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Tampubolon disclaimed such rumors saying that the
rumors is created by the attorney's office to "legitimate the
imposition of the travel ban."
</P>
<P>
"We consider the ban as an overacting decision. Because as long
as we know, Soeharto has no intention to leave the country and
take medical treatment abroad," Tampubolon said.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, the attorney's office failed to question
Soeharto over his alleged involvement in corruption, collusion,
and nepotistic practices during his 32 years rule.
</P>
<P>
An independent medical team set up by the attorney' office
along with Soeharto's medical team observing Soeharto's health
condition in the course of investigation process, declared that
Soeharto was not in a good shape to face questioning.
</P>
<P>
They advised the prosecutors not to launch further questioning
as they were worried if Soeharto underwent investigation he could
fall in to stroke again for the second time.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors of the attorney's office early this month has
questioned Soeharto, but they didn't get sufficient information to
confirm suggestion that Soeharto committed abuse of power when he
still was in power.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attorney General Fails to Get Deal on Cuban Boy's Custody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno failed late Wednesday to work out a deal after meeting
relatives of the six-year-old Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian
Gonzalez in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Reno had a three-hour meeting with the relatives, but failed to
persuade them to bring Elian with them to Washington to be
reunited with his father Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was hosted by Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin in Miami
Beach. An Associated Press report quoted her as saying that Reno
suggested the relatives fly to Washington Thursday for a meeting
with the boy's father.
</P>
<P>
However, the relatives in turn suggested that the father travel
to Florida for a meeting because of the illness of a family member.
</P>
<P>
The attorneys of the father and the Miami relatives will talk
by phone with Reno either late tonight or early Thursday morning,
O'Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin
said in Washington that Reno is planning to work out a resolution,
trying to meet with the parties concerned to seek a cooperative
settlement in this case.
</P>
<P>
Marlin said Reno would meet with the Miami relatives who is
taking care of Elian and community leaders in Miami, where angry
Cuban exiles have vowed to prevent the boy's return to his father.
</P>
<P>
Carole Florman, a spokeswoman of the Justice Department, told
reporters that the department plans to send a letter later on
Wednesday on transferring Elian to his father from his Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to encourage that the adults meet. At the same
time, we are moving forward with finalizing the letter which we
expect we will send by early afternoon unless other events make it
unnecessary," Florman said.
</P>
<P>
However, she added that even if the Justice Department sends
the letter instructing that the transfer occur at a specific date
and time, it could be changed later if the father and the boy's
Miami relatives reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are not backing off the position that a transfer needs to
happen quickly," she said, stressing that a meeting between the
boy's Miami relatives and his father would be "desirable" if a
resolution can be reached.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gregory Craig, the attorney for Elian's father,
accused Lazaro Gonzalez, a great uncle of Elian, who is taking
custody of the boy in Miami, of backtracking on an agreement he
said they had reached on Tuesday to hand over the boy voluntarily
on Wednesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for the Justice Department to instruct Lazaro
Gonzalez to follow the law and do the right thing. This son needs
his father," Craig told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He added that while the father had come to the United States
expecting to take custody of his child, he had now been here for a
week.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 last year after his mother and
other 11 people died when their boat capsized in the sea off
Florida. His relatives in Miami then took custody of him.
</P>
<P>
The relatives insists that the boy should remain in the United
States even after the boy's father came to the U.S. to pick up his
son.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department ruled earlier this year that the
boy belongs to his father and should be returned to Cuba.

</P>
<P>
The South Summit, which opened here Wednesday morning, is the

evaluation of the development in bilateral relations, saying that
there is vast potential for further cooperation between the two
countries.

bilateral cooperation in all fields, he said.
</P>
<P>

friendly relations between Nigeria and China.

the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin, said that he was
deeply impressed with the economic development in China.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is willing to further strengthen all-round cooperation
with China, Obasanjo said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Predicts Recovery This Year in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 12 (Xinhua)- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) predicted a financial recovery this year for most Latin
American countries, although there still exists a potential for
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
Recovery will be realized by the increase in domestic demand,
investments and exports, said an IMF report from Washington.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed anticipated improvements to policies
following recent crises, the introduction of solid structural
reforms and firm financial and fiscal procedures.
</P>
<P>
IMF said that in spite of the fact that many governments in
the region have reduced their tax deficits to attract foreign
investment, there still exists difficulty for them in gaining
international financing.
</P>
<P>
Possible assistance will be vital for some countries, like
Brazil and Argentina, whose financial needs exceed by 90 percent
the value of their exports, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The greatest negative factor for recovery in Latin America
comes from potentially unfavorable events in advanced countries'
economies, such as an eventual increase in interest rates in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The fragility of Latin American banking systems is another
factor contrary to the growth in production, which is expected to
rise by three percent this year, according to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The institution said that Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and
Colombia will register an account deficit of about 55 billion
dollars.

</P>
<P>
This was said here by Czech Education Minister Eduard Zeman who
added that there were two problems blocking Internet development
in the Czech Republic, namely the lack of money and qualified
professionals.
</P>
<P>
The Czech government's decision aims to shorten the gap between
the Czech Republic and western developed countries in information
technologies, he noted.
</P>
<P>
So far, only 81 percent of elementary and middle schools in the
country have access to the Internet. Many schools have no
computers, and they have no money for the application of the
Internet too. Still worse, most school teachers have little
knowledge about information technologies.

<P>
PANAMA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian thermo-electric company
Enron will build an underwater pipeline between Colombia and
Panama to provide natural gas to this Central American country's
thermoelectric companies.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Panama's Domestic Trade, Ernesto Fernandez,
said Wednesday that the pipeline will help stabilize oil prices,
which often affect the power sector.
</P>
<P>
"With this, thermoelectric firms will be prevented from being
disadvantaged when fuel prices go up, as these run on diesel" he
said.
</P>
<P>
The 480-kilometer pipeline, which runs between Cartagena,
Colombia and Colon, Panama, will be constructed in three stages in
18 months, at a cost of 360 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the company hasn't set the date to start the project,
Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the pipeline will also benefit the industrial

Fu, suffering a shaky second dive, was upset by Guo in the
women's three-meter springboard final at the Chinese national
championships Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"I did not perform well. I lost to myself," said the diminutive
diver. "But my form is better than last year when I first returned
to competition. I will bid for anther Olympic gold medal, in
individual or synchronized event."
</P>
<P>
Platform and springboard golds in Atlanta Games made her the
first woman in 36 years to win both Olympic events. She also won
the platform at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Guo's 0.2 point higher difficulty routines in
five attempts, Fu said her routines are the same as she had
performed at the Atlanta Olympics. "I have no plan to improve my
difficulty degree and learn other new routines," she said.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who won her first world title at 12, quit the sport shortly
after Atlanta because she was "tired mentally". Now 22, she is
studying economics at China's prestigious Qinghua University and
returned to the national team last month.
</P>
<P>
Fu will also team up with Guo for the synchronized springboard
in Sydney.
</P>

"It is hard to win the synchro in Sydney because Russian duo
Irina Lashko and Yulia Pakhalina are very competitive. Guo and I

<P>
HARBIN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven military maps drawn
by the Japanese troops during their invasion in northeast China
confirm once again the iron-clad fact of Japanese invasion of
China during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
Xun Xinwu, an 82-year-old resident in Harbin, northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, discovered the maps on the site of the
Japanese troops command in the city after they retreated.
</P>
<P>
All the railway lines, roads, and the deployment of the Chinese
warships on the Songhua River were marked explicitly in both
Japanese and Chinese. And most of the names of cities, mountains,
and rivers in the maps were more or less the same with today's.
</P>
<P>
"The maps tell almost everything about the topography and
mineral resources there and show the strategy of Japanese military
troops in northeast China," said Cheng Penghan, research fellow in
the Northeast Memorial to Martyrs.
</P>
<P>
Xun decided to turn in all the maps to the local government as
he heard that Azuma Shiro, a former Japanese soldier was convicted
in a Japanese court for telling the truth about the war crimes
committed by Japanese troops.

CHANGCHUN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Another railway line has opened
linking Hunchun in northeast China's Jilin Province and Makhalino

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- State-owned enterprises in
Tianjin, the largest industrial coastal city in north China, have
been able to develop at a faster speed as a result of foreign
technological and financial help.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Otis Elevator Co. has upgraded its technology in
the 1990s in the last 15 years with the help of U.S. Otis.
</P>
<P>
" The joining of international capital will bring more
challenges, but in general, it has shortened the gap of Tianjin in
terms of technology with other countries. It is a feasible measure
to inspire state industries," said Meng Xianzhong, chief engineer
with the Tianjin Municipal Trade Committee.
</P>
<P>
Motorola (China) Co. has increased its annual output of
cellular phones from 27,000 in 1992 to nearly nine million today,
and it is now exploring another generation of mobile phones to
realize the combination of telecommunication and multimedia in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Novo Nordisk China Biological Technologies, Denmark's largest
project in China, has grown into the second largest producer for
biological products and enzyme for industrial use in the world.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have shown their continuous confidence and
enthusiasm in China by expanding their business. China's entry
into the World Trade Organization may result in less preferential
policies, while human resources and infrastructure conditions will
continue to attract investors, said Niels Muymann who is in charge
of production in the Novo Nordisk.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that over 200 world-known enterprises
and multinationals have invested a total 4.6 billion U.S. dollars
in the city, with 63 among the world top 500.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China will speed up production of
special-purpose automobiles to meet growing demand during the
country's 10th Five-year Plan period (2001-2005), the State
Administration of Machinery Industry has said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic automakers plan to produce 340,000 special-purpose
automobiles annually during the period, aiming to export 150-
million-U.S. dollar worth of these vehicles at the same time,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The sector will focus on the development of hi-tech products,
including special automobiles for high-grade highway
transportation and maintenance, bridge checking, oilfields and
airports, to satisfy domestic demand and engage in world
competition.
</P>
<P>
Investments in the sector's technical upgrading will mainly
come from state loans.
</P>
<P>
As China is seeking entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO),
domestic manufacturers will have more opportunities to gain
foreign investment and advanced technologies.
</P>
<P>
The government will also accelerate the sector's restructuring
in the form of alliance, merger, reorganization or cooperation
with private manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the domestic special-purpose auto makers are joint
ventures.

<HEADLINE> Experts Study New Trends to Protect Patents, Copyrights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Areas protected by patents and
copyright systems should be expanded, officials and experts with
the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) said at a symposium
in Beijing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, scheduled to close today, was jointly sponsored by
SIPO and the Intellectual Property Department of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Yin Xintian, director of the Legal Affairs Department under the
SIPO, said that SIPO was studying new trends appearing in the
United States and Japan to protect more items, including creative
business ideas, with patent systems.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 officials, experts and scholars from the Chinese
mainland, Hong Kong and Macao took part in the symposium.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the importance of intellectual property,
experts warned that inventions and creations should not be
protected at the cost of curbing rapid science and technology
developments.
</P>
<P>
The latest development of patent protections, new methods to
deal with intellectual property disputes, and publicizing
intellectual property knowledge were also discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Selby, director of the HKSAR's Intellectual Property
Departments, said the intellectual property system must be
adjusted to meet the challenges of globalization and the fast
development of information technologies.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale education campaign was also performed in Hong
Kong, Selby said, adding that the mainland should intensify its
mass education to increase public awareness of intellectual
property protections.

<HEADLINE> Students Aid Deaf by Learning Sign Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Every weekend, Wu Xin, a student
from Zhejiang University, and his classmates gather in a local
square in Hangzhou to talk in sign language with the deaf and
distribute pamphlets urging people to learn the system of hand
gestures.
</P>
<P>
"Using sign language does more for deaf people than just giving
them sympathy," said Wu, who became a volunteer after reading a
notice on campus asking people to assist the local deaf population
by learning to sign.
</P>
<P>
Currently more than 10,000 university students in this capital
of eastern Zhejiang Province are involved in the program.
Participants wear a red cap printed with the slogan: "Aid the Deaf
with Love."
</P>
<P>
Su Lihui, from the Zhejiang Engineering Institute, is a veteran
of that school's Sign Language Service, which is the first of its
kind in China and has over 40 members who often go to streets,
shops to serve as go-betweens in matters involving deaf people.
</P>
<P>
The service is helpful on more than one level, Su said.
</P>
<P>
"In any situation where there is one hearing person who knows
sign language, a deaf person gets another opportunity to
communicate with someone on an equal footing," Su said.
</P>
<P>
Many people in the provincial capital and other cities have
responded to the students' call for volunteer signers, and local
media, government departments and enterprises have taken up the
cause.
</P>
<P>
Sign language training centers, composed of members from local
disabled people federations, Communist Youth League committees,
and volunteers, are sending teams to different parts of the
province to help the public learn the hand language.
</P>
<P>
China has 60 million handicapped people. In Zhejiang, the
number stands at two million, including 900,000 deaf people.
Official statistics show the deaf population is increasing in the
country because of population aging, environmental pollution and
accidents.

<HEADLINE> 4-5 Pct Growth Expected in 2nd Quarter in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Based on the projection, the gross domestic product (GDP) could
expand 3 or 4 percent for the year, according to Bank Indonesia
Governor Sjahril Sabirin.
</P>
<P>
He said the growth will be triggered by consumer demand both
from the private sector and from the government.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin identified stability in macroeconomic indicators and
progress in banking and corporate restructuring programs would be
key factors for growth.
</P>
<P>
"We're quite optimistic that the 3 percent to 4 percent GDP
growth target in 2000 will be achieved," Sabirin was quoted by
national newspapers Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been battered by the region-wide economic
contagion which first struck in mid-1997. The economy contracted
more than 13 percent in 1998, but showed slight growth of 0.23
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
"The economy continued to expand in the first quarter (2000).
Despite the (remaining political) disturbances, the real sector
has started to roll on because of the macroeconomic stability,"
Sabirin said.
</P>
<P>
He noted inflation remained relatively low for sometime, the
exchange rate of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar was stable and
the domestic interest rate continued to decline.
</P>
<P>
"All these factors are positive for the business sector. So
despite the disturbances, businessmen see stability in the economy,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Warning of a weakening rupiah, Sabirin said that the exchange
rate of the rupiah to the U.S. dollar should be taken into account
as a weakening of the local currency would cause imports-generated
inflation as imported raw materials would rise in cost.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rupiah's recent weakening to about 7,500 to
the greenback to a brief delay in the implementation of economic
reform programs promised by the government to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in January.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm optimistic that the rupiah will soon strengthen to a
more reasonable level of around 7,000 per dollar," he said.

</P>
<P>
Carole Florman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, told
reporters that the department plans to send a letter on Wednesday
to Elian's Miami relatives on his transfer to his father.
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraging the adults to meet. At the same time, we
are moving forward with finalizing the letter, which we expect we
will send by early afternoon unless other events make it
unnecessary," Florman said.
</P>
<P>
However, she added that even if the Justice Department sends
the letter instructing the transfer occur at a specific date and
time, it could be changed if the father and the boy's Miami
relatives reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are not backing off the position that a transfer needs to
happen quickly," she said, stressing that a meeting between the
boy's Miami relatives and his father would be "desirable" if a
resolution can be reached.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gregory Craig, the attorney for Elian's father,
accused Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great uncle who is taking custody
of the boy in Miami, of backtracking on an agreement he said they
had reached on Tuesday to hand the boy over voluntarily on
Wednesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for the Justice Department to instruct Lazaro
Gonzalez to follow the law and do the right thing. This son needs
his father," Craig told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He added that while the father had come to the United States
expecting to take custody of his child, he has now been here for a
week.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 last year after his mother and
other 11 people died when their boat capsized in the Atlantic off
Florida. His relatives in Miami then took custody of him.
</P>
<P>
The relatives insist that the boy should remain in the United
States even after the boy's father came to the U.S. to pick him up.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department ruled earlier this year that the
boy belongs to his father and should be returned to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> NAM Chairman on Principles in North-South Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The eradication of poverty and the
attainment of sustainable development in the South calls for "a
constructive and purposeful relationship" between the developed
North and the developing South, Thabo Mbeki, Chairman of the Non-
Aligned Movement (NAM), said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Speedy movement forward towards their accomplishment requires
a constructive and purposeful relationship between ourselves and
the countries of the North," Mbeki said at the four-day South
Summit of the Group of 77 (G-77) that opened here.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the largest gathering of heads of state and
government from 133 countries since the founding of G-77 in 1964,
is focused on the North-South relations and the South-South
cooperation among major topics.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who doubles as South Africa's president, noted that a
sound North-South relationship should be based on the alleviation
of debt, guarantee of effective capital flows into developing
countries, and transfer of technology to the South.
</P>
<P>
It must address "the alleviation of the debt burden carried by
many of our countries, including its cancellation, an effective
mechanism to ensure a substantial increase in capital flows into
the developing economies as this is a prerequisite for development,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said, "if the technology divide between the North and
South grows in the wake of rapid advances in communication and bio-
technology, then all will suffer and not just the developing world.
"
</P>
<P>
The North-South relationship should also cover "the reversal of
the trend resulting in a sharp drop in official development
assistance, and the opening of the markets of the developed
countries to our products, including agricultural products, "
Mbeki added.
</P>
<P>
The NAM leader urged the developing countries to step up
cooperation, saying, "we are faced with the challenge to reinforce
the interaction and exchanges among ourselves as the countries of
the South, to strengthen South-South cooperation."
</P>
<P>
NAM, founded in 1961 in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade,
currently groups 113 countries.

<HEADLINE> America's Young Adults Turning to Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Internet is quickly
displacing older media, such as television and newspapers as the
prime source of important information for the U.S.'s young adults,
according to survey results released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide telephone poll of more than 1,000 households
commissioned by the Round Table Group (RTG), a U.S. consulting
firm of university professors, said that 67 percent of Americans
aged 18-24 live in households that use the Internet to gather key
information, compared to a nationwide average of just 46 percent
who use the Internet for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
Among those young adults, 59 percent say their households
currently receive more "useful information" from Internet than
from newspapers. Fifty-three percent say they receive more "useful
information" from the Internet than from television.
</P>
<P>
"Traditional media has a right to feel fearful of these rapidly
changing demographics," said RTG CEO Russ Rosenzweig. "The
changeover is happening much more rapidly than anyone predicted."
</P>
<P>
According to the study, 84 percent of young adult Internet
users say their families are more likely to use the Internet to
retrieve useful information than they are likely to go to the
public library, and 68 percent of the those households are more
likely to consult some specific questions on the Internet than
turn to a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three percent of Internet households in the 18-24 age
group say they have used the Internet to retrieve work-related
information. And 47 percent of that age group say that someone in
their household would probably be interested in taking an
educational course over the Internet for work or for other
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The study found the slowest groups to log onto the Internet
have been the elderly, the poor and those with the least education.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. broadcast executives went on the offensive
against those who predict the imminent death of traditional radio
and television. Speaking at the ongoing annual convention of the
National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) in Las Vegas, NAB chief
executive Eddie Fritts said that "broadcasting stands before a
door that is opening, not one that is closing."
</P>
<P>
Executives from newspapers, magazines and other traditional
media also said that the Internet was changing traditional media,
but not replacing them.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China has made a breakthrough in
detecting transgenetic products.
</P>
<P>
By using a genetic screening technique called the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) test, the Jiangsu Entry-Exit Inspection and
Quarantine Bureau in east China has successfully detected
genetically altered soybeans in imports from the United States,
Brazil, and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
A source with the bureau said this success will accelerate
China's efforts to inspect other transgenetic products.
</P>
<P>
The achievement will also be conducive to the formulation of
related laws and regulations in China, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, scientists have been arguing about whether or not
genetically altered products are harmful to health and the
environment, and many developed countries have tightened controls
on the production, processing, and sales of these products.

<HEADLINE> Wine Named after Tavern in Literature Sells Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- "Xianheng," the trademark of
rice wine produced by a company in Shaoxing in eastern Zhejiang
Province, has been evaluated as worth more than 154 million yuan,
as the name originates from the novels of prestigious Chinese
revolutionary writer Lu Xun (1881-1936).
</P>
<P>
In Lu's novels "Kong Yiji" and "Medicine," Xianheng is the name
of a little tavern in Shaoxing, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
Rice wine produced by the company is selling well both at home
and abroad, and Zhang Shangming, general manger of the Zhejiang
Xianheng Industrial Group, attributes the booming business to the
name "Xianheng," which he said could not only reflect the history
of Shaoxing wine, but also has a great association with important
Chinese literature.
</P>
<P>
The company has patented the trademark in China and some foreign
countries including the Republic of Korea, Japan, Singapore, and
Thailand.

<HEADLINE> China News Digest: West on the Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China has adopted a strategy of
developing its vast western part, making it a key task in the
national economy this year and in coming years. The central
government and all provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities have taken substantial steps to implement the
central government strategy. Following are major stories on the
development in the western regions this week.
</P>
<P>
East-West Seeks Win-Win Cooperation
</P>
<P>
The five-day Investment and Trade Fair for Cooperation Between
East and West China closed on Sunday, clinching contracts worth
100 billion yuan (12 billion U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The combined value of contracts and investment signed at the
fair was 2.5 times more than the previous session. Over 60 percent
of the contracts were infrastructure, high-tech and tourism
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Jia Zhibang, vice-governor of Shaanxi Province, described the
fair as a win-win cooperation between east and west China under
the strategy of accelerating economic development in western China.
</P>
<P>
China Steps up Fiscal Transfer to Western Areas
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is promoting fiscal transfer as a major
financial support to accelerate development of the enormous
western territory.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Finance Jin Liqun said here on Monday that
fiscal transfer will become the major channel for facilitating
development of west China, as the short-term pro-active fiscal
policy is going to be phased out.
</P>
<P>
China now is funding projects in the west with money earned
from treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
China to Build First Cross-Desert Expressway
</P>
<P>
China is to build the country's first cross-desert expressway
in Shaanxi Province, as part of the efforts to implement the
central government's strategy to boost the economy of western
China.
</P>
<P>
The expressway will stretch from Yulin City to Jingbian County,
cutting across the 10,000 sq km Mu Us Desert, on the borders of
Shaanxi and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The 118-km-long expressway is expected to cost 1.9 billion yuan.
Early-stage preparations have been completed, and construction has
commenced on certain sections. Its upper speed limit will be 100
kph.
</P>
<P>
East China to Get More Electricity From West
</P>
<P>
China is trying to tap the huge power resources in its western
regions in a bid to provide more electricity for energy-short
eastern China.
</P>
<P>
Hydropower resources in west China tops 270 million kw,
accounting for about 72 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
China's strategy of transmitting electricity from west to east
is of significance for improving the country's energy structure
and ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Provinces and cities in east China should provide more markets
for electricity transmitted from the west by speeding up the
readjustment of energy structure and closing down small thermal
power plants. The west should improve its investment environment
to ensure adequate power supply to the east.

<HEADLINE> Laid-off Do-gooder Applies for Guinness Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A 52-year-old man is applying for
entry into the world record book for his good deeds over the past
38 years.
</P>
<P>
Shen Yongbin, a laid-off worker in Harbin in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, began to help others in 1962 when he
rescued a boy who fell into the water in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Since then he has done 130 good deeds, he says, including
collecting anti-flood signatures in 1998, participating in long-
distance running to commemorate the return of Hong Kong and Macao,
and posting telephone numbers for the public good at his own
expense.
</P>
<P>
Shen has had his good deed notarized and is ready to apply for
confirmation by the Shanghai Office of the Guinness Book of World
Record.
</P>
<P>
On March 5, 1963, late Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong called on
the whole nation to learn from Lei Feng, a soldier who was always
ready to help others and died in 1962 at the age of 22.
</P>
<P>
Shen's decision has stirred some argument. Some believe he is
only fishing for fame and compliments, because Lei Feng never
boasted of what he had done for others. But others support Shen
for his good deeds, saying there is nothing shameful about it at
all.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The China International Commerce
Commission established a subgroup Wednesday to promote e-commerce,
China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Headed by Chen Wei, vice director of China Merchants Bank, the
China E-commerce Commission will enhance communication between
companies and the government. It will also co-ordinate agreements
to develop on-line shopping.
</P>
<P>
"But since many of our merchants don't really know what e-
commerce is or the opportunities it provides, we may also launch
an education campaign," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Li Jun, board chairman of the Intec International Group Ltd and
a consultant to the commission, regarded the founding of the new
group as a momentum to the growth of e-commerce in China.
</P>
<P>
"Various trades can work together, drawing more of the
government's attention and promoting related legislative work," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
The e-commerce commission's first members come mainly from
banks, industry and trade companies, and more specialized e-
commerce enterprises will come aboard the commission later,
according to Chen.

<HEADLINE> Social Work Education Develops Rapidly in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Social work has become a hot
specialty in many Chinese universities and polytechnic schools in
recent years, according to a meeting held in this capital city of
east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 30 schools of higher learning and a dozen
polytechnic schools in the country offer majors in the field,
enrolling some 3,000 students annually.
</P>
<P>
Ten more universities and colleges are applying to open this
concentration, it was announced at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Teaching of social work was introduced in China in the 1920s
from western countries, but was eliminated from college
curriculums in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
In the years that followed, China operated under a planned
economic system under through which government organizations and
various work units, especially the civil affairs departments at
all levels, were responsible for resolving social problems and
helping needy people.
</P>
<P>
With the progress of China's economic reform since the late
1970s, it became necessary to develop social work education.
</P>
<P>
In 1986 China's education authorities gave approval to Beijing
University to add a social work and management major to the
curriculum. In 1993, the China Youth Political College became the
first college in the Chinese mainland to form a department of
social work and management.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the country's reforms have
produced numerous social problems such as increasing redundant
workers, surplus rural workers pouring into cities, a sharp rise
in the number of single-parent families, and the growing aging
population.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of social work education just epitomizes
these changes, social scientists here noted.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Customs Cracks Down On Frozen Meat Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The smuggling of frozen meat
into China has increased since the beginning of the year, as the
country tightens quarantines on imported meat to keep out
livestock with vesicular disease.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou Customs in south China's Guangdong Province seized
700 tons of smuggled frozen meat in the first three months, and
customs officials told Xinhua that the smuggling is mixed into
general trade, which includes frozen chicken, pork, and beef.
</P>
<P>
Customs authorities in Guangdong handles the largest imports of
fresh and frozen meat in China, and more than 1,200 tons of
smuggled frozen meat worth 8.67 million yuan (about one million US
dollars) have been detected at the customs since last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts said people who eat the smuggled meat have greater risk
of contracting vesicular disease, which was detected in livestock
in the Republic of Korea and Japan this year. The disease, which
is better known as hoof-and-mouth disease, is highly communicable
and is as harmful to human beings as to animals.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration for Entry-Exit Inspection and
Quarantine has banned direct imports of frozen meat from the ROK
and Japan since April 3, and Guangzhou Customs has pledged to
mount a continuing fight against smuggling.

HEFEI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province will
invest 30 billion yuan to build seven expressways in the Tenth
Five-Year Plan period (2001-2005).

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Personal Credit (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The lack of an efficient personal
credit system and effective methods to estimate personal credit
have become a main obstacle to the promotion of consumer credits
in China, according to the "Financial News".
</P>
<P>
On March 3, 1999, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced
that all Chinese commercial banks will have access to consumer
credit business.
</P>
<P>
Personal credit system enables people to conduct purchasing,
investing and managing activities on credit.
</P>
<P>
The healthy run of personal credit system usually depends on
the support of strong computer networks, a strong legal system,
and cooperation of other concerned government departments. In
western countries, consumer credit has covered 30 percent of all
credit services.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks can decide whether or not to provide a person
with credit loans or mortgage concessions by calling out his
credit record according to his particular credit number.

<TEXT>
<P>
A complete personal credit system will greatly raise the
efficiency of taxation and financial services. But the lack of
knowledge about applicants' credit record seriously affects the
promotion of China's personal credit.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that China's personal credit enterprises
need to advocate the real-name system for savings deposits and
financial assets, and set a credit record system.
</P>
<P>
On March 31 this year, China issued a regulation on adopting a
real-name system for individual bank accounts to protect the legal
rights and interests of the depositors.
</P>
<P>
The next step will be promoting the real-name system for
financial assets, and tax policies.
</P>
<P>
Another important precondition for establishing a personal
credit system is to have credit records of clients. But over-
strict credit terms has greatly discouraged Chinese people to set
up their own credit record.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that a person who never borrows money will
never have any credit record. They suggest that credit card
services should provide larger overdraft lines, lower credit
interest ratios and interest-free terms to help Chinese people
borrow money on credit.

CAIRO -- The Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid on

the Golan Heights as "a provocative act" that will obstruct the
Middle East peace process.

Abdel-Meguid said in a statement that the construction of new
housing units on the strategic plateau that Israel captured from
Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war "blocks the windows" of the
peace process.

Israel said on Tuesday that it had approved the building of 200

The announcement was issued following an ruling of Israel's
Supreme Court earlier in the day, which ordered immediately release

years as bargaining chips for missing Israeli soldiers.

court said Israeli law does not give Israeli defense ministry the
authority to hold these Lebanese citizens in administrative

<HEADLINE> Lewis Stripped of WBA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- British boxer Lennox Lewis has
been stripped of his World Boxing Association belt, meaning he is
no longer the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC report, New York judge Lewis Kaplan
declared the title vacant Wednesday and ordered Lewis to hand back
the belt immediately.
</P>
<P>
The decision is the result of a row between the British fighter
's camp and American promoter Don King over who the first defense
of the title should be against.
</P>
<P>
Panos Eliades, Lewis's promoter, said: "It's a bloody liberty,
and I'm preparing to appeal against what is a diabolical decision.
</P>
<P>
"They tried to rob us in the ring in New York last March when
Lennox was adjudged to have only drawn with Evander Holyfield, and
now they have succeeded. In my view, the judge is totally
incompetent, but we will fight on. The battle isn't over yet," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Lennox is very disappointed, although he still has the WBC and
IBF belts," he added.
</P>
<P>
The row centers around a proviso in Lewis's deal when he fought
Evander Holyfield for the second time last year to earn his
undisputed title.
</P>
<P>
It said that Lewis's first defense of his WBA belt would be
against the number one contender, Henry Akinwande, who is managed
by King.
</P>
<P>
Failing that, it should be against the highest-rated available
contender. But it has since been revealed that Akinwande has
hepatitis B and Lewis refused to fight him on health grounds.
</P>
<P>
He signed to fight Michael Grant instead on 29 April in New
York, when both the WBC and IBF belts will be at stake.
</P>
<P>
The WBA sanctioned this fight, but King was unhappy about it
and asked that Lewis be stripped of the title.
</P>
<P>
Frank Maloney, Lewis's manager said: "To lose a title in a
courtroom when you've been chasing one for 10 years is a real
knockout blow and a huge disappointment for boxing. But the real
fans know who the champion of the world is."

<HEADLINE> UEFA President Snubs Leeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- European soccer governing body
UEFA president Lennart Johanssen said on Wednesday that Turkish
fans should be allowed to travel to Leeds for the second-leg of
their UEFA Cup semi-final match.
</P>
<P>
The British club has called for a ban on Galatasaray supporters,
following the murder of two Leeds fans in Istanbul, prior to last
week's first-leg.
</P>
<P>
Feelings are running high in the city and the Leeds United
board,after consultations with the Football Association and West
Yorkshire Police, have voiced concerns about the safety of any
travelling fans.
</P>
<P>
Johannsen said: "There are Turks all over Europe and one way or
another they will see to it they get a ticket for the match. So in
many respects it's wishful thinking from Leeds to play just in
front of their home fans."
</P>
<P>
"I think the Turkish supporters are also shocked about the
events in Istanbul. I predict there will be absolutely no problem,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He also added that incidents outside stadiums were often beyond
the control of the governing body and the delay in making the
decision, which is now due on Thursday, was down to the complexity
of the arguments being considered.
</P>
<P>
UEFA has received written submissions from Leeds, the Football
Association and the relevant local and national security
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Galatasaray will now be given a chance to respond. Once its
report has been submitted, UEFA will decide whether to switch the
tie to a neutral venue.
</P>
<P>
Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale has hinted his club may pull out
of the competition if UEFA choose a neutral venue.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Move up to Fourth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Chelsea moved up to the fourth with a 2-1 victory over Coventry
City on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, on a high after a 3-1 defeat of Barcelona in their
Champions League quarter-final first leg last week, went behind to
an 18th-minute goal from Coventry midfielder Gary McAllister in
wet conditions.
</P>
<P>
For a while Coventry, struggling in the lower half of the table,
seemed capable of notching up their first away win of the season --
they are the only club in the league not to have won away this
term.
</P>
<P>
But Coventry's Scottish defender Colin Hendry put the ball into
his own net in the 53rd minute as Chelsea picked up their game in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
Just five minutes later Italian striker Gianfranco Zola struck
the crucial winner which helped Chelsea to replace their London
rivals Arsenal in fourth with 58 points.
</P>
<P>
In the tight battle for Champions League places next season
Chelsea are now two points behind third-place Leeds United and
four points behind second-placed Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Reigning champions Manchester United have a massive 11-point
lead over Liverpool at the top.
</P>
<P>
Fifth-placed Arsenal are one point behind Chelsea but have a
game in hand.
</P>
<P>
Relegation-threatened Sheffield Wednesday secured three vital
points with a 2-0 victory at lowly Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
A 39th-minute goal from Belgian international striker Gilles De
Bilde helped Wednesday on their way before Gerald Sibon scored a
second in the 88th.
</P>
<P>
The defeat puts pressure on Wimbledon who are just above the
relegation zone.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Wanchope scored two second-half goals, including an 89th-
minute winner, to help West Ham to a 2-1 defeat of Newcastle
United in London.
</P>
<P>
Gary Speed gave Newcastle the lead in the 48th minute but
Wanchope equalized for the Londoners in the 60th before hitting
the dramatic winner to help the Londoners move up one place to
eighth.

<HEADLINE> Tyson May Fight in Scotland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- American controversial boxer Mike
Tyson could be on the verge of agreeing to fight in Scotland after
his promoters visited the national stadium, Hampden Park.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Frank Warren's Sports Network company
travelled to Glasgow, with a view to staging Tyson's next fight at
the revamped stadium.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Scottish Football Association, which has
taken over the running of the debt-ridden stadium, said: "Hampden
was visited over a possible staging of a Mike Tyson fight. This is
at a very early stage and no details, including any possible dates,
have even been discussed yet."
</P>
<P>
He added: "We are waiting to hear back from the promoters."
</P>
<P>
In January the former undisputed heavyweight world champion
defeated Britain's Julius Francis in front of 22,000 fans at the
Manchester Evening News Arena in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
But critics said the boxer should not have been allowed into
the country due to his conviction for rape in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who created a storm of criticism when he bit the ear of
his opponent Evander Holyfield in 1997, is set to face Lou
Saverese in Milan on 20 May.
</P>
<P>
Ibrox stadium, home of Glasgow Rangers Football Club, was also
in the running to stage the fighter's next bout, but was ruled out
when a suitable date could not be found.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Sports Network said: "We looked at Hampden and
it is one of a number of other venues around Europe that are being
checked out."

<HEADLINE> Weizman Calls for Greater China Role in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
Wednesday called on China to play a more important role in
promoting the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We expect China, a very important and responsible country which
aims at peace and stability in the world and has good relations
with all the countries in the Middle East, to assist in encouraging
the process," Weizman said at a dinner in honor of visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is paying a state visit to Israel beginning Wednesday, the
first visit by a Chinese president to the country.
</P>
<P>
Weizman noted Jiang's visit takes place at a time when efforts
are being made to further the Middle East peace process on its
various tracks, citing intensive negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that, in the not too distant future, we will be able
to achieve a comprehensive peace with all our neighbors and I will
do all in my ability to ensure this," Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
Israel is the first leg of Jiang's five-nation visit, which will
also take him to Palestine, Turkey, Greece and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Hopes Middle East Question Be Settled Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin here Wednesday expressed his hope that confrontation will
come to an end, disputes be settled and hostilities be removed in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a welcoming dinner hosted by Israeli President Ezer
Weizman, Jiang said he hoped that concerted efforts will be made so
that all the countries in the region will be able to concentrate on
economic and cultural undertakings and all the peoples there will
enjoy a peaceful and better life.
</P>
<P>
He said that to settle the Middle East question at an early date
is the unshirkable historical responsibility of the peoples of all
countries in the region, as well as all the peace-loving and
progressive people in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The settlement lies in peaceful negotiations rather than force,
in cooperation rather than confrontation, and in mutual
understanding rather than mutual exclusion," said Jiang, who is on
his first state visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
This has increasingly become a consensus drawn from past
experience and lessons, he said.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the Middle East is at a historic turning point.
Peace, stability and development have become a strong and common
aspiration of all the peoples in the region," said the Chinese
leader.
</P>
<P>
He said that due to reasons of history and the realities, there
is no easy solution to the Middle East question which involves
complicated contradictions.
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East, ethnic conflicts, territorial disputes and
endless flames of war have over the years taken countless lives and
displaced numerous people. That has severely dampened the economic
and social development of the region and affected world peace and
stability, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Now thanks to the joint efforts of all the parties concerned,
much progress has been made in the Middle East peace process," he
said. The relevant U.N. resolutions and the "land-for-peace"
principle have become the basis for negotiations among the parties.
</P>
<P>
And leaders of the Middle East countries, with the vision and
courage of statesmen, in a historical perspective and bearing in
mind the greater interests of peace and development, are working
hard for an early settlement of the Middle East question, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
China consistently pursues an independent foreign policy of
peace. The Chinese people have always cherished deep sympathy and
friendly sentiments towards the people of all the Middle East
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has made unremitting efforts to help
advance peace in the Middle East and facilitate amicable
coexistence of all the peoples in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president arrived here earlier Wednesday on the
first leg of his five-nation tour that will also take him to
Palestine, Turkey, Greece and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for Fair New World Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin on Wednesday called for joint efforts of the people of all
countries to establish a fair and equitable new international
political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the purposes and
principles of the U.N. Charter and other universally recognized
norms governing international relations, far from being outdated,
should constitute the basis of the new order, Jiang said at the
welcoming dinner hosted by Israeli President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to put into practice the principles of mutual
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-
aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also reiterated the importance of persistent peaceful
settlement of international disputes, sovereign equality of all
countries, respect for the national conditions of countries,
seeking common ground while shelving differences, and closer
mutually-beneficial cooperation for common development.
</P>
<P>
"All these principles should be observed by each and every
country," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"Big countries, or blocs of big countries, shoulder major
responsibility for facilitating the establishment of the new
order," he said.
</P>
<P>
They should pay close attention to the demands and interests of
the developing countries and make due efforts to safeguard peace,
promote development of these countries and narrow the gap between
North and South, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that political multipolarity serves world peace and
development, and conforms to the aspiration of all the peoples.
</P>
<P>
With the collapse of the centuries-long colonialist system and
the end of half-a-century Cold War, it has become increasingly
difficult for hegemonism and power politics to go on and for the
very few big powers or blocs of big powers to monopolize
international affairs and control the fate of other countries,
Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said peace and development represent the trend of the times,
and with the accelerated political multipolarization and economic
globalization and the dynamic advances in science and technology,
humanity is faced with not only rare opportunities for development
but also grave challenges.
</P>
<P>
"Regional conflicts and local wars have broken out one after
another, and the gap between North and South in development and
wealth continues to widen instead of narrowing," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The pace remains slow in improving the quality of life of the
people in developing countries, who account for two thirds of the
total world population, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, we have always emphasized that the maintenance
of lasting world peace requires greater efforts and that there is
still a long way to go before the objective of common development
for all countries is attained," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"All in all, opportunities outnumber challenges and hope
outweighs difficulties," Jiang said, adding that as long as the
people of all countries work together, they will keep advancing the
lofty cause of world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, backwardness, ignorance and evils in all forms will
be conquered and progress, science and justice will prevail. This
is an irresistible law of history, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived in Israel earlier Wednesday on the first leg of
his five-nation tour, which will also take him to Palestine,
Turkey, Greece and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Visit to Israel a Historic Event: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
first state visit to Israel is a historic event in the relations
between Israel and China, said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Speaking a dinner he hosted in honor of the Chinese president,
Barak said both Israel and China are ancient countries in the world
with rich culture and civilization and the Israeli government
attaches great importance to the development of friendly relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation in various fields between the two countries has
a bright future and the Israeli government will continue to strive
hard to further enhance such cooperation in the future for the
benefits of the two peoples, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of moving the Middle East peace process forward,
Barak said his government is determined to make "painful and hard
decisions" in order to realize peace with the Palestinians, the
Syrians and the Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
To strike peace deals with the three sides will also create
peace and stability for Israel, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Jiang said an early settlement of the Middle East
question is the shared aspiration of the international community
and it is the strategic choice made by all parties concerned to
embark on the road of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"It is a long way to go and an arduous task to accomplish to
bring about a just and lasting peace to the Middle East," Jiang
said, adding that "to remove difficulties and obstacles in the
peace process and to work for continued progress in the peace
talks, requires wisdom and courage from political leaders in the
region and unremitting efforts from the parties concerned."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China believes the middle East peace process will
succeed in the end and that region will eventually become one of
peace, prosperity and dynamism, so long as the parties concerned
engage themselves in the talks in a serious and realistic manner
and on the basis of the relevant U.N. resolutions and the principle
of "land for peace."
</P>
<P>
He said the people with vision in different countries are all
seriously pondering over how to further promote interaction between
different nations and cultures in the world and advance the lofty
cause of world peace and development in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the so-called "clash of civilizations" argument,
Jiang said that "in our view, all civilizations in history were
created by people and are the common assets of all mankind."
</P>
<P>
It is possible for people of different civilizations to have
exchanges, learn from each other, seek common ground while shelving
differences and live in peace and harmony with each other, Jiang
added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president arrived in Israel Wednesday on a state
visit. This is the first stop of Jiang's five-nation tour that will
also take him to Palestine, Turkey, Greece and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Protecting Turkish Nationals in Britain Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
has urged British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook to take measures to
protect Turkish nationals residing in Britain, reported the
Anatolia News Agency on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The strong request came following the recent attacks against
Turks living in Britain, an apparent retaliation for the killing of
two British Leeds United soccer fans in Istanbul last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two Leeds United supporters died of stab wounds as violent
clashes erupted with fans of rival Turkish team Galatasaray.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Cook, Cem expressed his sorrow at the regrettable
incidents which took place before the first leg of the UEFA
semifinals between the Turkish Galatasaray and Leeds United in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed Turkey's extreme unease at the racially
motivated attacks against Turkish citizens, stressing that Turkey
expects the British authorities to take all necessary measures to
prevent any repetition of such incidents.
</P>
<P>
Cem argued that the Turkish authorities had acted immediately
following the incident to bring the culprits to justice.
</P>
<P>
He noted in his letter that the general feeling of goodwill and
friendship between the peoples of the two countries must be
preserved.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government to Help Schools Connect Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) will give 2.25 billion U.S.
dollars to schools, libraries and communities nationwide to help
them connect the Internet this year, the FCC announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The FCC program has received more than 36,000 applications
requesting 4.7 billion dollars in aid for equipment and services.
</P>
<P>
Although the FCC will not be able to fulfill all those requests,
the new funds for the third year of the project should allow some
significant progress toward the goal of connecting every classroom
to the Internet, said FCC Chairman William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice President Al Gore said the additional funds would
ensure that a total 1 million classrooms would be connected.
</P>
<P>
"By connecting all our children to the Internet, we will put a
whole new world of knowledge and information at their fingertips,"
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 82 percent of the public schools and over half of
the public libraries in the United States received discounted
services, with more than 53,000 urban schools and more than 25,000
rural schools receiving support.

<HEADLINE> Italy Reiterates Debt Cancellation to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a conference panel titled "Summits, compromises and
cooperation," Danielli made public his governments announcement to
cancel over 2.5 billion US dollars of foreign debt to Third World
countries.
</P>
<P>
In this amount Mozambique's debt to Italy is included.
Mozambique has been recently hit by serious flooding, with a great
number of casualties and material loss, which caused international
help to be asked for.
</P>
<P>
As an answer to this situation, Italy decided to cancel the
total amount of this African nation's commercial re-structurable
total debt amount, before the Paris Club, according to Danielli,
received favorably Italy's decision.
</P>
<P>
The multilateral financial institution, on the other hand, will
suspend Mozambique's debt payments, as a first step towards a
definitive debt cancellation, said the Vice Foreign Minister.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the Paris Club's objection to this decision, the
Italian official said that Italy is ready to act unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
According to Danielli, the Italian initiative, is among the
efforts of the South Summit, which is taking place here, with the
participation of 122 developing countries, which are asking the
rich North for a financial relief and a possible debt elimination.
</P>
<P>
As the Cuban President, Fidel Castro said during the Summit's
opening, asserted Danielli, "foreign debt is one of the main
obstacles for poor countries' development."

<HEADLINE> Russia: UNSCOM Staff Who Abused Their Positions to be excluded in UNMOVIC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Sergei Lavrov, Russia's
Ambassador to the United Nations, stressed on Thursday that his
country wanted to make sure no personnel from the United Nations
Special Commission(UNSCOM) who had abused their positions would be
included in the new U.N. arms regime for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the United Nations Security Council
this morning approved the organizational plan presented by Hans
Blix, Executive Chairman of the United Nations Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission(UNMOVIC) which was created
by U.N. resolution 1284 to replace now defunct UNSCOM, for this
new arms regime.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Lavrov said Iraq's cooperation with the
United Nations would depend on how U.N. resolution 1284 would be
implemented and whether criteria for a suspension of sanctions
against the country would be clarified.
</P>
<P>
Unilateral actions, such as U.S.-British daily bombing raids
over air exclusive zones would continue to hamper compliance, and
the exclusive zones were not authorized by the Security Council,
Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
"To see this resolution implemented, we need all to be within
decisions of the Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said he would prefer to see a stronger political
and legal component which would allow the commission to solve
potential crises as they start working in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said Richard Butler, Executive Chairman of UNSCOM, in the
past did not really try to solve problems but would always run to
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council which was formally
presented early this week, Hans Blix recommended that UNMOVIC be
strong on experts and technical personnel rather than political
functionaries. He has not decided the new inspectors for UNMOVIC.
</P>
<P>
U.N. arms inspection in Iraq has been suspended since the U.S.-
led military strikes against the country in December 1998. Iraq so
far has refused to accept Resolution 1284,saying lifting sanctions
is the precondition for U.N. arms inspectors to return.

<HEADLINE> South Countries Tied to Up-to-date Technology : G-77 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The heads of state of the Group of 77 (G-77) met at Havana,
continued on Thursday their debates on the most important issues
related to the South countries situation, among which is access to
up-to-date technology by the South.
</P>
<P>
It is known that modern technology allows the income of
millions of U.S. dollars in investment capital and the creation of
advanced industries.
</P>
<P>
World Trade Organization's figures show that computer and
telecommunications technology advances give great advantages to
North countries.
</P>
<P>
According to these data, 88 percent of all the Internet users
are located in industrial nations, while the 10 top transnational
business control 70 percent of the computers industry, and up to
86 percent of the telecommunications industry. Of these companies,
not one has its headquarters in the South.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization admitted that 1999 was a bad year
for raw material exporting nations, basically in the South, due to
the price fall, which affects capital investment attraction to
acquire up-to-date technology.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army to Buy Over 1,000 Anti-Missile Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Army hopes to expand the number even more, perhaps to about
1,300, if the cost can be covered, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The new PAC-3 system has upgraded its radar and the firing
station in which troops operate the system. It also has a newly
designed missile that destroys its target by ramming into it at
high speed.
</P>
<P>
The current Patriot missile uses a fragmentation warhead that
explodes near the target. The newer system, known as"hit-to-kill"
technology, is supposed to be more effective against enemy
missiles armed with nuclear, chemical or biological warheads. It
also is capable of hitting low-flying cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
The new Patriot system is expected to be ready for use in
limited numbers next year and will eventually replace the air
defense missiles now deployed with U.S. troops in South Korea,
Germany as well as in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Patriot is the only weapon now available to U.S. forces for
shooting down ballistic missiles like the Scud missiles that Iraq
launched against Saudi Arabia and Israel during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon claimed that an increasing number of countries
hostile to the United States will acquire ballistic missiles in
the future.

<HEADLINE> South Summit Debates over Debt, Trade and Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign debt condonation, free
trade access to North markets and a further development of South-
South cooperation are some of the issues that had more attention
on Thursday by Third World leaders gathered at Havana.
</P>
<P>
Some twenty heads of state spoke on Wednesday before the
committee of the whole of the Group of 77 (G-77), and a similar
amount of participants was expected to speak to participate on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting taking place in the Conventions Palace, at Havana,
will be over on Friday, with the signing of the Havana Declaration
and the approval of the Action Program containing those projects
aimed at developing South-South cooperation for the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Opinions related to foreign debts are unanimous in the sense
that countries with few resources must receive a special treatment,
and this way, some leaders have pledged for foreign debt immediate
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
Those African heads of state who spoke on Thursday said that
Sub-Saharan countries' foreign debt has increased threefold during
the last 20 years, which translates to 350 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Regarding to foreign trade, there participated many speakers,
among them United Nations' Secretary- General Kofi Annan, insisted
in saying that industrialized countries should allow unrestricted
access to products from developing countries to their markets.
</P>
<P>
About South-South cooperation there were different points of
view by the different participants in the forum, yet a common
denominator was that there still exist unexplored potentials that
would allow a more effective cooperation among developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
As a proposal to oil exporting countries, Cuba's President,
Fidel Castro, suggested there should be a different oil price
system for the world's poor nations so that they are able to face
price increases without the need to further indebt their economies.
</P>
<P>
Another issue that was present all along, was that of armed
conflicts come to an end, and a reduction in military expenditure
as fundamentals to improve confidence among Third World countries
and the alleviation of their harmed economies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Approves Merger of BP Amoco, Arco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) on Thursday unanimously approved BP Amoco's 27.6-
billion-U.S.-dollar purchase of Atlantic Richfield Co. after the
company agreed to sell large oil holdings in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
The merger, approved by the commission in a 5-0 vote, will
create the second largest nongovernment oil company in world
behind Exxon Mobil, a merger that received FTC approval last
November. BP Amoco said it would move swiftly to conclude the
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
The approval requires BP Amoco to sell all of Atlantic
Richfield's oil holdings in Alaska within 30 days to resolve
anticompetitive problems. The FTC had opposed the merger because
of concern that the combination, without such divestitures, would
dominate the West Coast oil market.
</P>
<P>
BP Amoco already has agreed tentatively to sell the Atlantic
Richfield, or Arco, holdings to Phillips Petroleum Co.
</P>
<P>
"The sweeping wholesale divestitures called for by the consent
order resolve the competitive concerns that initially led the
commission to seek a preliminary injunction to block the proposed
transaction," Richard Parker, director of the FTC's Bureau of
Competition, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
BP Amoco, based in London, had been in tense negotiations with
the FTC for months to try to work out an arrangement that would
resolve the federal agency's concerns about competition.
</P>
<P>
BP Amoco and Arco, which is based in Los Angeles, together
control about 70 percent of the oil production on Alaska's North
Slope, and FTC lawyers argued such dominance would be
anticompetitive and influence retail prices in the West Coast
gasoline market.
</P>
<P>
The FTC in early February moved to block the merger in federal
court, arguing that it would violate federal antitrust laws
because of the company's market dominance in Alaska. That move,
prompted additional concessions by BP Amoco, including the
divestitures that led to Thursday's approval.
</P>
<P>
The sale of Arco's Alaska holdings will mean that the new
company will continue to control about 45 percent of the oil
production on the North Slope. BP Amoco, under the consent
agreement, also must sell some pipeline and oil storage holdings
in Cushing, Oklahoma.

<HEADLINE> Moore Supports China's Accession to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- World Trade Organization
Director-General Mike Moore said here Thursday that China's
accession to the global trade body would not be affected by U.S.
decision on permanent normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. decided that it would not extend PNTR with China,
it is possible that China joins the WTO without U.S. approval,"
Moore said in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"This is an organization of all its members, and at that point,
the U.S. will lose a lot of opportunities that it has helped
create through its negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's overwhelmingly in the interests of U.S. businesses and
workers that China joins the WTO," he said.
</P>
<P>
Warning the U.S. Congress against rejecting the Clinton
administration's trade agreement with China, Moore said the U.S.
risked losing the benefits of the agreement if Congress rejects
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China.
</P>
<P>
If Congress rejected the trade pact, Moore said, U.S.businesses
may not receive the same trade benefits as other WTO members.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House and Senate are expected to vote on the PNTR
legislation in late May and in the first week of June respectively.
</P>
<P>
Moore also spoke highly of China's economic reform and opening
to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"Never before in history has one country lifted so many of its
people from poverty," he said. "A policy of greater openness in
China has been instrumental in lifting 120 million people out of
extreme poverty over the past 20 years."

<HEADLINE> WWF: Marine Turtles Faces Danger of Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Despite decades of conservation
efforts, six of the world's seven species of marine turtle are
still in danger of extinction, the World Wide Fund (WWF) warned in
a new publication issued here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its report, 'Wanted Alive! Marine Turtles in the Wild', the
conservation organization emphasized that threats such as over-use
mean that no population of marine turtle can be considered
completely safe, even when currently stable as a result of long
term conservation and management.
</P>
<P>
Despite the precarious state of the species, WWF said, Cuba and
Dominica have proposed that the Convention on the Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) reopen the
international trade in tortoiseshell coming almost exclusively
from the critically endangered Hawksbill turtle.
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't be reopening the trade because controls in the
main importing country, Japan, are inadequate, the status of the
turtle populations in the Caribbean is unclear, and regional
management is patchy," said Elizabeth Kemf, Species Information
Manager at WWF, and co-author of the report. "Hawksbills, like
other marine turtles are facing ever growing numbers of threats."
</P>
<P>
Turtles all around the globe are hunted for their shells which
are used in jewelry, and their hides which are cured for leather,
according to WWF.
</P>
<P>
WWF estimated that up to 300,000 turtles are killed each year
as 'bycatch' in trawling nets, shrimp nets and longlines for tuna
and swordfish.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is also a major threat to turtles, said the
conservation organization. The construction of seawalls, hotels,
marinas and the entire infrastructure associated with coastal
tourism and commerce have destroyed large areas of turtle nesting
beaches around the world.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Stronger South-South Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China said here Thursday that it
is particularly imperative and urgent for developing countries to
carry forward the spirit of solidarity and enhance the South-South
cooperation at a time when they are faced with common challenges.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, head of
the Chinese Government delegation, took the floor at the first
South Summit of the Group of 77 since its founding in 1964.
</P>
<P>
"The South-South cooperation is, first and foremost, a
solidarity spirit," he said. "It is also an important way for
developing countries to seek greater strength and pursue common
development."
</P>
<P>
The founding of the Group of 77 more than three decades ago
significantly symbolizes this important solidarity spirit and is
of great importance and far-reaching influence, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since then, developing countries have spoken in one voice in
the international political and economic arena, fought
unremittingly for their legitimate rights and interests as one
strong force and made a remarkable contribution to the efforts to
change the irrational international political and economic order,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is particularly imperative and urgent for us to carry
forward the spirit of solidarity and enhance the South-South
cooperation at a time when we are confronted with common challenge,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"To get united is the only way for developing countries to
enhance their status in the North-South dialogue, effectively
participate in making decisions related to world economy and
safeguard their own interests to the maximum in the course of the
globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Though the economic globalization has presented us severe
challenges, it has also afforded us a big room for cooperation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must seize the opportunity to continuously strengthen
coordination and cooperation in the financial, trade, debt and
other important economic areas, give play to our respective
strength to make up for our deficiencies, and broaden the sphere
of cooperation so as to tap the potential of the South-South
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proved that while continuing to deepen our
cooperation in traditional fields, we can very well expand it into
science and technology, education, investment and hi-tech
industries so as to inject new vigor and vitality into the South-
South cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The new situation requires new thinking and new approaches to
the South-South cooperation," he said. "To expand such cooperation
calls for vigorous support and big input from the governments of
all countries as well as the participation of the business
community and other quarters of society."
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary for all governments to formulate more pro-
active policies in the light of their specific national
conditional conditions, and support enterprises engaged in the
South-South cooperation with incentives," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The South-South cooperation should be open, allowing the
participation of international organizations and developed
countries," he said. "In the meantime, we should actively engage
ourselves in regional and sub-regional cooperation, which will in
turn help deepen and expand the South-South cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The South-South cooperation is among the four theme under
discussion at the South Summit, which opened here Wednesday to map
out a strategy for common development in the South in the new
century.

<HEADLINE> Global Development Calls for Fair, Rational New World Order, Li Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China said here Thursday that the
sound global development demands the establishment of a fair,
rational new international political and economic order as
developed countries are dominant in setting "rules of the games"
for world economy and most developing countries gained little from
the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, head of the Chinese Government
delegation, made the statement in his speech at the first South
Summit, the largest gathering of heads of state and government of
the Group of 77 (G-77).
</P>
<P>
"The current world is undergoing major changes," Li said. "It
is moving towards multipolarity and generally towards relaxation."
</P>
<P>
"But it is by no means a world of peace and prosperity," he
said."The cold war mentality is still lingering on and hegemonism
and power politics are exerting themselves in new manifestations."
</P>
<P>
"The world has not acquired universal peace and economic
globalization now places development in a complex situation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, economic globalization has
been developed rapidly, with a high growth of international trade,
increasingly bustling worldwide investment activities, accelerated
development of financial globalization and expeditious progress in
high-technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, "due to disparities in economic, scientific and
technological strength and development level, especially the
irrationality of the current international economic and political
order, the 'dividends' of the globalization have not been fairly
shared between the developed countries and developing countries,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Developed countries have benefited most from the globalization,
for they are in a dominant position in setting the "rules of the
games" for world economy, while most developing countries have
gained little from it and some are even being marginalized," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the gap between the North and the South is being
widened further, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"A shortage of development funds, heavy debt burden, worsening
trade terms and other such long-standing problems are still
plaguing the developing countries," he said. "Increasingly risks
of financial crises and the inadequacies in the international
financial system make things even worse for developing countries."
</P>
<P>
"They are faced with tremendous pressure and grave challenges
in terms of both economic security and economic sovereignty," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic globalization should benefit all countries and
peoples and should facilitate the common development of the whole
world," he said. "Its sound development calls for, more than ever,
the establishment of a fair and rational new international
political and economic order."
</P>
<P>
In such a new order, all countries should foster their mutual
relations in accordance with the purposes and principles of the U.
N. Charter and other universally recognized norms governing
international relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
In such a new order, all countries should have the right to
choose their social systems and development models in the light of
their respective national conditions and to fully participate in
making policies and regulations for world economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
In such a new order, all members of the international community
should, in a responsible manner and in a risk-sharing spirit, work
together closely to build a sounder and more effective
international
financial system and a more rational and balanced international
trade system, he said.
</P>
<P>
And in such a new order, the role of the United Nations should
be strengthened in the world economic policy-making process, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic globalization has made all countries in the world
more interdependent," he said. "To minimize the negative impact of
economic globalization, eliminate poverty and narrow the gap
between the North and the South are what developing countries are
striving to do and are also what developed countries must face
squarely."
</P>
<P>
"The wealth of the North should not and cannot be built on the
poverty of the South in a long run," he said. "Developed countries
must demonstrate their political will and adopt effective measures
to help developing countries out of difficulties."
</P>
<P>
"They should honor their commitments to reverse the declining
trend in providing official development assistance and provide
financial and technical support to developing countries without
attaching any political strings so as to help the latter increase
their capabilities for development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They should fully implement the Uruguay Round agreements and
carry out to the letter provisions concerning special and
differential treatment to developing countries and give full
consideration to their concerns and interests in a new round of
multilateral trade negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They should also reform the international financial system,
effectively monitor the hot money and help developing countries
enhance their ability to forecast and guard against financial
crises," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the South Summit, Li said that this is a "pioneering meeting.
"
</P>
<P>
"In the interest of safeguarding world peace and promoting
development, let us look back over the past and forward into the
future and work together in a cooperative spirit to map out a
strategy for common development in the new century," he said.
</P>
<P>
The South Summit, which opened here Wednesday, is believed to
be conducive to the stronger South-South cooperation to
collectively face the challenge of globalization.

WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presumptive
presidential nominee George W. Bush met gay Republicans in Texas
Thursday in a bid to attract moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
The Texas governor declared that he was "a better person" for
hearing their stories although he said they still disagree on such
subjects as gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome gay Americans into my campaign," Bush said at a
press conference after the meeting. "It's important for the next
president to listen to people's real-life stories."
</P>
<P>
The Texas governor has been trying to moderate political image
after his appeals to religious conservatives helped him win South
Carolina's primary in February.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member invited gay group includes former Representative
Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin, and David Catania, District of

</P>
<P>
"We went in with the hope and expectation that we would raise
his consciousness on certain issues," Catania said, "We think we'
ve done that."
</P>
<P>
Bush "was very interested in the idea" of having a gay speaker
at the Republican National Convention, Catania said.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Offers $10 Million To Caribbean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was stated Thursday by Mark Malloch Brown, UNDP General
Administrator, during a working breakfast with the press in the
Southern Summit, that brought together 122 delegations of the
Group of 77.
</P>
<P>
Brown said that this project is supported by the Italian
government, adding that the donation is announced in a special
opportunity, in a summit that has the potentiality to have the
world commit itself in full with the desires of the poor countries.
</P>
<P>
"The debate can be moulded on the development for the new
millennium and obtain results in terms of a sustained human
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
UNDP reaffirmed Thursday its commitment to halve the figure of
the world population in poverty by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
This occurs at a time in which the industrialized world
financial assistance to the poorest part of the planet has dropped
to less than 0.24 percent of the rich countries' gross domestic
product (GDP), compared to 0.33 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the UNDP had at that time 1.2 billion dollars,
dropping to only 700 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Brown described six fields in which the UNDP expects to offer
advice on policies, and at the same time strengthen the national
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the first place the legislative institutions,
judicial systems, and municipal governments must be strengthened,
followed by the securing of a better performance of the government
directed to guarantee a bigger economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said that to reduce poverty by 50 percent the developed
world as a whole needs to reach a per capital annual growth of at
least four percent, which would demand a global growth of some
seven percent.
</P>
<P>
In the third place, the widening of the gap between the rich
and the poor must be avoided, by means of the coordinated work of
the latter with UNDP and other world agencies, and expand the
public and private associations that will encompass the North and
the South, in the fourth place.
</P>
<P>
In the fifth and sixth places are the need not only of
increasing the national income, but also of eliminating illiteracy,
giving better opportunities to women and assuring human rights,
and in last place, to advance in the field of South-South
cooperation.

HAVANA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China Thursday voiced its
willingness to work together with other developing countries to
further cooperation with them for the common development in the
world in the new era.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, head of the Chinese Government

cooperation with them and work for the common development and
prosperity of all countries in the process of economic
globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Being a developing country, China once experienced the same
suffering as other developing countries and is now faced with a
common task of development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China has for decades pursued an independent foreign policy of
peace, no matter how the international situation has changed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We in China have based our diplomatic work on enhanced
solidarity and closer cooperation with developing countries,
unswervingly stood by and cooperated with developing countries and
peoples and made unremitting efforts in opposing hegemonism,
promoting world multipolarization and facilitating the
establishment of a fair and rational new international political
and economic order," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has long supported and actively participated in the South-
South cooperation in many fields in accordance with the principles
of equality and mutual benefit, stressing practical effects,long-
term cooperation and going in for joint development, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has rendered material, technical and financial assistance
to more than 130 countries and dispatched a large number of
professionals and technicians to them and set up professional
training centers there to offer technical training for free, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"By making full use of its advantages, we have also engaged in
technical cooperation with them in both research and production."
he said.
</P>
<P>
To explore new ways for the South-South cooperation in the new
era, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation will be held in Beijing,
capital of China, this year at the Chinese initiative, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people fought a sanguinary war, won national
independence and liberation and founded the People's Republic of
China in the mid-twentieth century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, tremendous changes have taken place in
China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Particularly, in the last two decades since the adoption of
the reform and opening-up policy, China's overall national
strength, its social productive forces and the living standards of
its people have all improved or increased by a large margin and
eye-catching achievements have been scored in the building of its
material and spiritual civilization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we are soberly aware that there are still many
difficulties and challenges on our way ahead," he said. "Our per
capital GNP (gross national product) is still relatively low in
the world."
</P>
<P>
China has a huge population, and tens of millions of people are
still living below poverty line although a great number of people
shake off poverty every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The economic structure is undergoing strategic transformation,
"he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, to build socialism with Chinese characteristics is
indeed a great cause, and also an arduous task," he said. "To
succeed in this cause, we need to make unremitting efforts for a
long time to go."

<HEADLINE> Tech Stocks Continue Falling In Fourth Consecutive Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A fear of inflation shattered
the technology stocks' advance Thursday, dragging the Nasdaq
composite lower in the fourth consecutive session.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the technology heavy Nasdaq composite
index fell 92.85 at 3,676.78. The composite rose as much as 145
points earlier in the trading.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell 201.58 at 10,923.55 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 26.66 at 1,440.51.
</P>
<P>
The stocks fell after a government report on rising wholesale
prices sparked fears of inflation. A big selloff started in the
blue chip sector and spread technology stocks later.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that U.S. wholesale prices shot
up 1 percent in March, a worse showing on inflation than the 0.5
percent rise analysts have expected earlier.
</P>
<P>
Investors have jettisoned technology stocks in recent weeks,
driving the Nasdaq index down 27 percent as of Thursday from its
peak on March 10. This means the index has entered bear-market
territory, generally defined as a drop of 20% or more.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq's failure to sustain its early advance indicates
that investors were still nervous about prospects for technology
stocks which skyrocketed in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The late-day selloff overshadowed some good news on corporate
earnings for tech firms. Advanced Micro Devices, a leading
computer chip maker, reported its earnings at 1.15 U.S. dollars a
share in the first quarter, nearly twice 59 cents in expectations.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 9.64 at 644.61 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 11.56 at 915.23. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 4.22 at 489.22.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-8 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,721 down, 1,251 up and 486
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 1.03 billion shares from 1.14 billion
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> China Calls on South Countries to Give Top Priority to Development of Science and Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Havana, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China Thursday called on
developing countries to give top priority to the advancement of
science and technology in order to achieve a swift economic and
social development amid the trend towards globalization.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, head of the Chinese Government
delegation, made the statement at the first South Summit of the
Group of 77, which opened here on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"It is a new issue facing developing countries to keep abreast
with the development of world science and technology and grasp
opportunities presented by knowledge economy while responding to
its challenge," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, science and technology have developed
unprecedentedly fast, he noted. "Knowledge and technology are
becoming a major driving force for economic growth, exerting
profound influence on the industrial structure and even on people'
s thinking and way of life."
</P>
<P>
"Mankind is gradually moving away from an era of industrial
civilization to that of knowledge economy," he said. "In the wave
of knowledge economy, developing countries face challenges far
greater than before."
</P>
<P>
Lack of capability for science and technology and technological
capabilities, a shortage of talents and capital, restrictions by
developed countries on technology transfer in the name of
protecting intellectual property rights and other such factors
have left developing countries generally behind in the field of
knowledge and technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Particularly, those developing countries that have not started
industrialization are threatened with the danger of being
marginalized by knowledge economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve a swift economic and social development amid the
trend towards globalization, we developing countries should give
top priority to the advancement of science and technology, placing
the promotion of scientific and technical progress and innovation
high in their development strategy, adapt to and participate in
the process of building an information-based world and facilitate
the rise of new industries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should attach great importance to education, make education-
related policies and laws, increase input in this area and make a
big effort to turn out and attract more innovative talents,"he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We should make full use of the conveniences available in the
information age to fully tap human resources and build up their
capacities with a view to advancing science and technology," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, we should increase scientific and technological
exchanges and cooperation among us so as to complement, support
and help each other, which will be conducive to gradually
increasing the content of science and technology in our economic
growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, most of the sophisticated science and technologies
are in the hands of developed countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They have got this edge, to some extent, by making use of
professionals from developing countries and by the wealth they
have amassed through unfair trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they have the obligation and responsibility to help
developing countries in the field of science and technology, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"They should take effective measures to transfer technology to
developing countries, render them financial aid and assistance in
personnel training, increase cooperation with them and explore
ways for joint research and development so as to create a
favorable external environment for progress in science and
technology in developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Knowledge and technology are top on the agenda of the current
South Summit, which is intended to map out a strategy for the
developing South to achieve economic and social development in the
new century.
