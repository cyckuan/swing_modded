<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Guinean Parti de L'unite
et du Progress (PUP) has congratulated Jiang Zemin on his
re-election as general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the CPC accepted unanimously Deng
Xiaoping Theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, said PUP general secretary Aboubacar Sompare on
behalf of Guinean head of state and PUP president Lansana Conte.
</P>
<P>
Applying the Chinese people's rich experience in culture and
technology, the CPC's new collective leadership will lead China
smoothly to the 21st century and help it become an economy magnet
in the modern world, Sompare added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people will surely accomplish the sacred task of
unifying the motherland, because following Hong Kong's return,
Macau will do the same and Taiwan will be reunified with the
motherland, Sompare believed.

<HEADLINE> Qian: China to Deepen Reform, Widen Opening-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China will carry out a
policy of deepening its reform and opening wider to the outside
world, Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen told the delegations at
the 52nd session of the United Nations General Assembly today.
</P>
<P>
China is also determined to step up national development and
promote the cause of world peace, said Qian, who is also China's
foreign minister, in addressing the UN session.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China came to a triumphant conclusion in Beijing. The Congress,
holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, charts the
future course of China's development with a blueprint, and
displays the resolve to carry forward the cause of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Qian also said that the resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1 wiped out China's national
humiliation of one and a half centuries and opened up a new
chapter in the nation's peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past two months or more after its return, Hong Kong
has enjoyed social stability and economic prosperity, which fills
the people in Hong Kong, China and the world at large with great
joy," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Deng Xiaoping's concept of "one country, two
systems" becomes reality in Hong Kong carries a profound
significance, he said. "Firmly adhering to this concept, we will
keep up the peaceful reunification of our motherland by ensuring a
smooth return of Macao and eventually resolving the Taiwan
question."
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed, "Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese
territory and the Taiwan question is purely an internal affair of
China. Any country that attempts to use the Taiwan question to put
pressure on China or even clamors for `two Chinas' or `one China,
one Taiwan,' has acted in total contravention of the purposes and
principles of the UN Charter and the relevant General Assembly
resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Such behavior will be absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese
people as well as all the justice-upholding countries in the
world, stated the Chinese vice premier.

<P>
LUSAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has urged developing countries
to give high priority to agriculture to attain sustainable
growth.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here today UNCTAD said despite being the
most important economic activity in the developing countries,
agriculture has failed to keep pace with population growth.
</P>
<P>
The report said weaknesses in the agriculture sector of such
countries is a result of poor government policies.
</P>
<P>
There has been a lack of political commitment to an efficient
institutional agriculture framework in the developing countries,
it noted.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD also urged developing countries to promote food
security especially in rural areas where most of the people
depend on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that the most effective policy to
increase food security in certain developing countries is the
promotion of peace because food insecurity in most developing
countries is caused by internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The serious obstacle to agricultural development in developing
countries is lack of credit facilities for farmers, said the
report.

ABU DHABI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Oman's Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs Yousef Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah said today that
Oman will continue to support a peaceful settlement to the
stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the Omani news agency that his country
insisted on a peaceful settlement to the deadlock in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the current status of the Middle East
peace process would benefit nobody but those extremists and all
enemies of peace.
</P>
<P>
The minister also stressed that a return to the negative
Arab-Israeli relations could never contribute to the stability
in the Middle East region, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has been in deadlock since March
this year due to the Israeli construction of a new settlement in
East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want to be the capital of
a future state.
</P>
<P>
The move has triggered violent clashes between Palestinians
and Israel.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Expanding military
blocs and enhancing military alliances under new circumstances can
do little to bring about greater security, Chinese Vice Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 52nd session of the General Assembly of the
United Nations, Qian said relations between states should be based
on the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and
peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
"Each country has the right to choose a road of development
according to its own national conditions and no country should
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries on whatever
ground," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This must serve as the political prerequisite for global and
regional security," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the economic foundation for global and regional
security, all countries should increase their mutually-beneficial
cooperation in the economic field, eliminate unequal practices in
trade and economic relations and do way with discriminatory
policies.
</P>
<P>
As a practical way to achieve global and regional security, all
nations should step up consultation and cooperation in the
security field, increase mutual understanding and trust and settle
whatever differences and disputes they may have through peaceful
means, he added.
</P>
<P>
Giving examples of new models of security cooperation, Qian
mentioned the agreement signed by the five countries of China,
Russia, Kazakstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan in the first half
of the year on mutual reduction of military forces in the border
areas.
</P>
<P>
Other examples include the four-party talks involving China,
the United States, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and
the Republic of Korea to bring about a new peace mechanism on the
Korean Peninsula, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
Regional Forum which introduced a preliminary form of cooperation
on security issues featuring equal participation and negotiated
consensus.
</P>
<P>
He said China feels concerned about the recent setbacks in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that the relevant U.N. resolutions should
be complied with, agreements reached among the parties concerned
in the peace process should be honored, the principles of `land
for peace' should be adhered to and terrorist activities should
stop," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the Conference on Peace in the Middle East
will resume at an early date, he said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Africa, he said China is deeply concerned about the
incessant conflicts and turmoil which have plagued the continent
since the beginning of this year and wishes the African nations
steady progress along the road of peace and development.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China today called for
an overhaul to the discriminatory and exclusive non-proliferation
regimes.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the 52nd session of the General Assembly of
the United Nations, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said it is
necessary to have a universal participation in the
non-proliferation process.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. should see that it accomplishes something in this
regard," said Qian who is also vice premier.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, no one should try to monopolize the market under
the name of preventing proliferation and to interfere in the
economic and technological cooperation of other countries,
developing countries in particular," he said.
</P>
<P>
Continued efforts should be made to advance the process of
multilateral arms control and disarmament and the universality of
international arms control treaties should be strengthened and
their complete adherence ensured," Qian added.
</P>
<P>
"The target of disarmament should not be shifted to developing
nations as countries with the largest and most sophisticated
arsenals bear a special responsibility for disarmament," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Turning to China's disarmament move, he drew the Assembly's
attention to China's recent announcement of a unilateral step in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the reduction of 1 million troops in the 1980s,
China will further reduce its military by 500,000 troops within
the next three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a move of major importance in the field of
disarmament," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Forge Cross-Century Ties with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng said here today that China is ready to work with Kazakhstan
to forge a comprehensive and cooperative partnership toward the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Li, speaking to reporters along with Kazakh President Nursultan
Abishevich Nazarbayev after their talks, added that to develop
long-term, stable and good-neighborly ties with Kazakhstan
constitutes an important part of China's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Li and Nazarbayev attended the signing ceremony of an oil
contract following their talks.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the oil contract "opened a new page" in the
bilateral relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
China's increasing demand of petroleum due to its economic
growth and the rich oil reserve in Kazakhstan predict further
expansion of cooperation in the petroleum sector between the two
countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev noted that Kazakh-Chinese relations have been
growing steadily in recent years. He added that the
"cross-century" cooperative agreement signed today will fuel the
development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He said China's rapidly-growing economy provides a big market
for Kazakhstan. He added that his country will take this
opportunity to enhance the economic and trade ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's policy is to establish friendly relations of
mutual trust and all-round cooperation with China, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan-China trade volume in 1996
was over 500 million U.S. dollars. He predicted this figure will
be in billions of dollars in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Li, who had just attended the annual meetings of the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund in Hong Kong, said the
meeting left him with the impression that the world economy is
becoming more and more inter-dependent.
</P>
<P>
To further strengthen relations with Kazakhstan and other CIS
states will benefit the development of economy and improvement of
the people's living standards in China and all these countries,
and will be conducive to the world trend of multipolarization as
well, the premier said.

UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier
Qian Qichen today called on the international community to help
stabilize the world financial market and ensure a steady economic
growth of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian, also minister of foreign affairs, made the call in his
speech at the 52nd session of the General Assembly here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the overall situation of the world economy
has been good, he said. Economic links and mutual penetration
among countries and regions are on the constant increase.
International cooperation should be given a fresh evaluation of
its importance with a view to making it broader, closer and more
fruitful, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries are most vulnerable to the impact of
adverse environment because of their weak economic foundation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the international community, developed countries in
particular, will honor their pledges of providing funds and
transferring technology to the developing countries so as to
translate the declaration of partnership into real action," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also called the attention of the member states to many
"trans-boundary issues" such as poverty, unemployment, refugees,
drugs and crime, which, he said, need to be addressed through
consultation by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"Work of the United Nations in the social field needs to be
strengthened," he said.
</P>
<P>
The international community should get down to practical work,
the first of which is to help developing countries with their most
urgent difficulties, he said. China will continue to support the
United Nations in its work in the social field and make greater
contribution to social progress around the world, he added

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Enforce Tight Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
(RBZ) today announced its intention to maintain a tight monetary
policy for the remainder of this year in light of the underlying
inflationary pressures that continue to rock the southern African
economy.
</P>
<P>
RBZ Governor Leonard Tsumba said in a monetary policy
statement that the conduct of monetary policy would continue to
be dictated by developments on the inflation front.
</P>
<P>
"The conduct of monetary policy for the remainder of the year
and part of next year will be influenced, to a large degree, by
pressures on the growth in money supply which will be a function
of the financing of the 1997/98 budget deficit and the impact of
wage settlements," he said.
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the monetary policy would be to reduce the
growth in reserve money with a view to controlling monetary
expansion and inflation which was pegged at 18 percent in August,
Tsumba said.
</P>
<P>
Inflationary pressures arising from increases in fuel and
education fees, together with high growth in money supply,
prompted the Central Bank to tighten its monetary policy stance
in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The announcement today came on the back of recent measures to
curtail money supply expansion which saw the Central Bank
introducing new clearing and settlement arrangements for
commercial banks.

<HEADLINE> Rapid Economic Growth Predicted for Sub-Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has projected
that countries in sub-Sahara Africa are poised for rapid economic
growth in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
In a report titled "Global Economic Prospects and the
Developing World for 1997" reaching here today, the bank said 25
countries in the sub-region have achieved economic growth of
nearly seven percent in the past successive three years.
</P>
<P>
The report said sub-Sahara Africa, which suffered negative per
capita income growth over the past decade, is projected to
achieve positive growth in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for developing countries looks much more
favorable over the next 10 years than in the previous decade," it
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, the international economic
environment for the developing countries remains favorable,
characterized by broadly stable world macro-economic conditions,
increasing flow of private capital to them.
</P>
<P>
Private capital flow to developing countries reached a record
245 billion U.S. dollars last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"In sub-Sahara Africa where some 25 countries are undertaking
structural adjustment and economic reform, recent growth has
exceeded four percent in the past two years, economic growth was
nearly seven percent for the third year in a row," the report
added.
</P>
<P>
Three developing regions that suffered negative per capita
income growth over the past decade, namely the sub-Sahara Africa
and Middle East, North Africa and East Europe, as well as Central
Asia, are projected to achieve positive growth in the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
The next 25 years will see an unprecedented boost in the
prominence of developing countries in the world economy and five
of these countries -- Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and Russia
-- are projected to fundamentally change the way the world does
business, the bank predicted.

and Development (UNCTAD) today urged the world's most impoverished
nations to prioritize their often neglected agricultural sector if
they want to attain and sustain high growth rates.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the most important economic activity in the
LDCs, the UNCTAD noted in "The Least Developed Countries (LDCs)
Report-1997" launched here today.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture provided about one-third of their collective gross
domestic product (GDP) and employed two-thirds of the labor force
at the start of the 1990s, but its performance has failed to keep
pace with population growth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that a robust agriculture policy is also a key
to an integrated poverty alleviation strategy, as the poorer
people in the LDCs tend to live in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the LDCs report has been launched
outside Geneva and in Dhaka, capital of the largest of the 48
countries designated by the United Nations as least developed.
</P>
<P>
The visiting UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens Ricupero said at
the launching ceremony that his organization has chosen Bangladesh
for releasing the report to pay tribute to its championing role in
the causes of the LDCs.
</P>
<P>
He praised Bangladesh for raising a strong voice in addressing
the problems of the LDCs and stressed that some integrated
approaches must be adopted for better access of LDCs' products to
world market.
</P>
<P>
The LDCs report pointed out however that growth among the
world's LDCs remained relatively robust at an average of 4.7
percent in 1996 compared with 5.2 percent in l995.
</P>
<P>
The slight decline is due mainly to a slowdown in the average
growth rate of the 33 African LDCs, from 5.4 percent in 1995 to
4.6 percent in 1996, the report continued. For the LDCs in Asia
and Pacific islands, the average growth rate rose slightly from
4.6 percent in 1995 to 4.8 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report said institutional and economic reforms were
generating strong growth in many LDCs and pointed out that the
Asian LDCs have benefited from their location in the world's
fastest-growing region.
</P>
<P>
The largest LDC, Bangladesh, has not performed as well as might
have been hoped, the report said, adding that this is partly due
to a delay in the implementation of economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The 213-page report pleaded for urgent action by the
international community to help the LDCs tackle their widespread
problems such as economic and social regress and internal conflict
on a priority basis.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Refuses Israeli Charges Over Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bethlehem, Palestine, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat today denied the
Israeli charges that he should be responsible for the recent two
suicide bombing attacks in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question at the joint news conference with
visiting Czech President Vaclav Havel, Arafat said that the
Israeli investigations into the July 30 Mahane Yehuda bombing and
the September 4 Ben Yehuda bombing in central Jerusalem showed
that the terrorists came from Area B and Area C under
"overridding Israeli responsibility" instead of Area A under the
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Israel announced that it had uncovered the
identities of four of the five suicide bombers carrying out the
two Jerusalem bombing attacks that killed 25 people and wounded
300 others. They all came from the Azira Shamalya village, near
Nablus in West Bank, which is within Area B under Israeli total
security control.
</P>
<P>
They, all members of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas),
had been jailed by the PNA last year, but later escaped from
prison to go underground until carrying out the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel still held Arafat for being responsible for the
bombings because the planners behind the attacks came from Area
A. Deputy Israeli Defense Minister Silvan Shalom asserted in the
Knesset (Parliament) that the terror cell that planned the
bombings are living in Area A which is under total Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between Israeli and Palestinian security
officials held in Ramallah Tuesday night, Israel handed over a
list of terror suspects to the Palestinian side to demand for
their arrests.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Israeli charges that he is not doing enough to
combat terror, Arafat insisted that he is doing 100 percent
efforts to fight terrorism according to the obligations of the
signed peace accords, but he could not guarantee 100 percent
results.
</P>
<P>
Arafat added that he should not be responsible for the two
Jerusalem bombings just because the suicide bombers were those
who escaped from Palestinian prisons. "They escaped, what could
I do?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the media rumors about his deteriorating
health, Arafat said that he did not need to answer the question
because Israelis were also against him, his authority and his
people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli security forces continued the sweeping
crackdown against suspected terrorists in Azira Shamalya and
other villages in the West Bank, arresting dozens more Islamic
militants. Israel Radio said that Palestinian police have also
detained 20 Hamas activists.
</P>
<P>
The latest arrests brought to over 600 the number of Islamic
militants who have been detained by Israel since the Jerusalem
bombings for being involved in terrorist activities against
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that the
universality of human rights should be respected, but their
realization must be integrated with national conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The realization of human rights is the common ideal of
mankind," said Qian in addressing the 52nd session of the United
Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Qian said all countries have made great efforts to this end,
with both achievements and lessons. "We maintain that the
universality of human rights should be respected, yet their
realization must be integrated with the conditions of each
country."
</P>
<P>
A review of the UN practice in the past 50 years and more shows
that when countries or regions do likewise, they will enjoy social
stability, economic development and popular contentment, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Conversely, society will face disintegration where people will
lose their most basic human rights and freedoms, and gross
violations of human rights will even take place when chaos erupts
as a result of war," added Qian.
</P>
<P>
It is quite natural for people to differ on the human rights
issue and the question is how to deal with these differences, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Only dialogue can enhance mutual understanding and
cooperation. Confrontation on the other hand can only lead to
further estrangement and do nobody any good. We are pleased to see
that more and more countries are in favor of dialogue in handling
the human rights issue," the Chinese vice premier said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government attaches importance to human rights and
is dedicated to promoting and protecting human rights of its
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Having repeatedly suffered from foreign aggression in the
past, the Chinese people know full well how state sovereignty and
territorial integrity fundamentally guarantee the realization of
their human rights," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We in China, taking upon ourselves the task of
feeding, clothing, sheltering, educating and providing travel
facilities to our 1.2 billion people, know full well how vitally
important our right to subsistence and right to development are."
</P>
<P>
To enable the Chinese people to lead a freer, happier and more
democratic life, "we focus our utmost on the development of
economy and the improvement of democracy and legal system," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier declared that China will soon sign the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and
is studying earnestly the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
"We stand ready to work with other countries in a continued
effort to promote cooperation in the international human rights
field," said Qian.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues in Key Afghan Border Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between the Afghan
Taliban militia and their rival forces was continuing to rage in a
strategic Afghan town bordering Uzbekistan today, Afghan sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Forces loyal to the anti-Taliban northern alliance today
launched a three-pronged attack on Hairatan, which separates
Afghanistan from its Central Asian neighbor Uzbekistan, said the
Afghan sources in Peshawar, Northwest Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The alliance, which comprises forces led by ethnic Uzbek
warlord Abdul Malik, Tajik warlord Ahmad Masood and the Shiite
Hezb-e-Wadhat, has claimed that it had captured Sheiak City near
Hairatan from the hands of the Taliban, who entered the town last
week, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban immediately denied the claim and said they
had repulsed the alliance's offensive and were now moving toward
Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold of the anti-Taliban alliance,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Hairatan, situated 60 kilometers north of Mazar-e-Sharif, about
300 kilometers north of Kabul, is a key town located on the banks
of the Amu Darya (Oxus River) on the Uzbek border.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the Taliban, who control two-thirds of Afghan
territory and the capital of Kabul, briefly controlled the
Mazar-e-Sharif airport, but were forced to retreat in a few days.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier on UN Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The reform of the
United Nations is to strengthen the world body and should reflect
the common interests of all member states, said Chinese
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen here today.
</P>
<P>
As the most important inter-government organization in the
world, the United Nations occupies an irreplaceable position in
international life, Qian said in addressing the 52nd session of
the U.N. General Assembly this morning.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, an evolving situation has called for reform
of the United Nations, added Qian, who is also China's foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
"We are in favor of reforming the United Nations, " he said.
"The purpose of the reform is to strengthen the role of the U.N.
and enhance its efficiency. Measures taken in this regard must
reflect the common interests of all member states and the results
must be able to stand the test of time."
</P>
<P>
Qian said that U.N. reform is the shared cause of all member
states. It should allow full play to democracy, heed the voice of
all sides and take into account the interests of various parties.
The reform plan should be widely acceptable to member states.
</P>
<P>
For the purpose of enhancing efficiency, the Chinese
vice-premier said, "An appropriate reduction of personnel and
expenditure is necessary. What is important, however, is for the
reform to give greater emphasis on development issues with a view
to strengthening, rather than weakening, the U.N.'s role in the
promotion of economic and social development."
</P>
<P>
Qian also said the reform should help preserve the diversity in
the United Nations which is a microcosm of the diverse world.
"Only when world diversity is recognized and respected, can
different countries live in harmony and make progress together."
</P>
<P>
Further, he said, the reform should stress practical results,
value quality and progress in an incremental manner.
</P>
<P>
On the enlargement of the Security Council, he said, it should
follow the principle of equitable geographical distribution and
ensure a proper balance between the developing and developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council will better perform the lofty mission
entrusted to it by the U.N. Charter only when it becomes more
broadly representative," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. membership dues, Qian said, to pay one's assessed
dues is a bound obligation for every member state under the U.N.
Charter. "We urge the countries concerned to unconditionally pay
off their arrears as early as possible so as to put the United
Nations on a sound financial basis for normal operation."
</P>
<P>
Countries around the world need the United Nations. So does the
United Nations their support, the Chinese vice-premier stressed.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Returns Home From Russia Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak returned home this afternoon, concluding a three-day visit
to Russia for talks with his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin on
the Middle East situation.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa who accompanied Mubarak
to Russia told Egyptian reporters in Moscow that the visit is
"positive" at both political and economic levels, the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russia has reaffirmed its commitment to the land-for-peace
principle adopted at the U.S.-Russian sponsored peace conference
in Madrid in October 1991, and its full awareness of the negative
role of the Israeli policies that has led the peace process come
to a standstill since March, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side had clearly said that the current situation
required an urgent initiative to rescue the peace process, and
that Russia would join efforts for that end, according to Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Another outcome of the visit is an upcoming Middle East tour
by Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov in the coming weeks,
which includes Egypt, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
In the economic domain, seven bilateral agreements had been
signed between the two countries, particularly with regard to
prevention of dual taxation and investment guarantees, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Mubarak's talks in Moscow with U.S. Vice President Al Gore,
Moussa said the talks covered several issues, including bilateral
relations, the Middle East peace process and the continued
international sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
As for the U.S. disregard of the Arab League decision to
alleviate sanctions against Libya, Moussa said that the
alleviation of sanctions fell within the terms of reference of the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He demanded Arab states, the Organization of African Unity and
the non-aligned countries make efforts for lifting the siege on
the Libyan people, which was imposed in 1992 for Libya's failure
to hand over two suspects allegedly involved in the bombing of a
Pan Am jetliner over Lockbie, Scotland in 1988, which killed 270
people on board.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister left Moscow today for New York
to attend the U.N. General Assembly.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World
Food Program (WFP) today announced that its two staff members had
been shot dead and another staff escaped unwounded in Ethiopia's
Central Ogaden region.
</P>
<P>
A news release issued here today said three WFP personnel were
travelling late Friday afternoon from Kebre Dehar to Jigiga after
a field mission when their vehicle was stopped by armed men at a
place, 55 kilometers south of Degeh Bur.
</P>
<P>
After the gunmen led them away from their vehicle, one of the
three men managed to escape and fled to the nearby town of Birkot
where he reported the incident to the local authorities.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that security teams were immediately
dispatched to the place where they found no trace of the two WFP
staff and located only the vehicle which had been vandalized.
</P>
<P>
Catherine Bertini, WFP Executive Director, condemned the
brutal incident, saying the number of attacks on humanitarian
workers worldwide had been on the rise, making it increasingly
difficult to deliver relief assistance.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the area of Central Ogaden in Ethiopia
had been increasingly insecure over recent months due to tensions
on the border region between Somalia and Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Qian, Albright Meet for Chinese President's US Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen Tuesday night met with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the preparation for
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's up-coming state visit to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reviewed the recent positive progress in the
bilateral relations and agreed that more efforts are needed for
greater progress in the commonly concerned areas so as to ensure
the visit successful and boost Sino-U.S. relations to a new stage
of development.
</P>
<P>
Qian and Albright discussed in depth relating matters effecting
the bilateral ties. They agreed to keep such regular contacts,
which would benefit the improvement and development of the
relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held that peaceful utilization of nuclear energy
conforms to the common and long-term interests of the two peoples.
They agreed to continue their efforts for an early implementation
of the Sino-U.S. agreement on the cooperation in peaceful
utilization of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
On China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO),
they agreed that the two sides should redouble their efforts to
settle their differences in the bilateral talks to achieve
substantive progress.
</P>
<P>
Qian reiterated China's position on the question of Taiwan. He
stressed that the question of Taiwan has always been a key issue
in Sino-U.S. relations. China hopes the U.S. will honor the
principle enshrined in the three joint communiques, handle the
question of Taiwan with prudence, and no longer allow this
question to interfere with the progress and development of the
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin restated China's
principled position on the question of Taiwan at the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China. "Peaceful reunification
and one country, two systems" remains the principle of China in
resolving the question of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that the U.S. side understands China's concern
over the question of Taiwan and will handle the question with
prudence.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the U.S. government will adhere to the
principle of the three joint communiques and clearly and
unmistakenly pursue a "one China" policy, that will be the basis
in its China policy and in handling the question of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
She stated that the United State will never be for "two
Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan" or Taiwan's independence, nor
support Taiwan's attempt to gain access to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
She declared that her country will only have non-official
contacts with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on the United Nations and
other international and regional issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Future ACP-EU Relations Held in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A seminar deliberating
on the future relations between African, Caribbean and Pacific
(ACP) countries and the European Union (EU) following the expiry
of the Lome IV Convention in the year 2000 was held here today.
</P>
<P>
Opening the seminar which was organized by the Ethiopian
Chamber of Commerce, Aschalew Haile, vice-president of the
Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce said the Lome Convention
consolidated ACP-EU relationship which was largely based on the
existence of mutual interests between the then members of the
European Community and of the ACP group.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the globalization of the world economy has
upset the relationship.
</P>
<P>
Haile said Ethiopia has been signatory to the Lome Convention
since Lome I, 1975 and ever since then, the country has benefited
considerably from the various aid instruments provided under the
cooperation framework.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he noted, in the area of trade, although the
convention grants non-reciprocal free access to the community
market, Ethiopia could not make use of the advantage because of
the structural rigidity of its export sector reflected on lack of
export diversification.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the seminar, Italian Ambassador to Ethiopia
Maurizio Melani said ACP countries' share in the world market is
now only two percent and Africa's share in the world investment
sector is not more than four percent.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Leader Calls for Reduction of Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian
Vice-President Omar Ali Juma today called for a reduction of road
accidents in the country.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents in Tanzania cost the government about 11
billion Shillings (17.5 million US Dollars) per year, leaving
alone the sufferings inflicted on the victims and value added to
reflect grief and pain to the relatives, said Juma in a speech
read at a function here today.
</P>
<P>
Juma noted that despite the government's initiatives to
introduce speed limiters and severe penalties to reckless drivers
to reduce the rate of road accidents, the measures have not
succeeded to alleviate the problem.
</P>
<P>
Special attention must be given to more effective training,
testing and licensing procedures to flush out bad drivers from
the roads, he said.
</P>
<P>
Juma urged drivers, transport operators and other road users
to observe traffic rules and regulations and respect other road
users.
</P>
<P>
He warned drivers not to drive when in fatigue or under the
influence of alcohol or drugs.

<HEADLINE> Latvian PM Visits NATO Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Latvian Prime Minister
Guntars Krasts said today that only the North Atlantic alliance
together with the European Union can guarantee the security of the
Baltic state.
</P>
<P>
Krasts made this remark at the end of his first visit to the
headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He
described his visit as an "historical moment."
</P>
<P>
"Only NATO and the European Union can guarantee Latvian
development in the future in a stable and secure atmosphere," he
said at a post-visit press briefing.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit, the Latvian prime minister met and
discussed bilateral relations with NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana and delivered a speech to a North Atlantic Council session.
</P>
<P>
While addressing NATO council members, the Latvian prime
minister said that he was glad to visit the NATO headquarters but
his nation's ultimate goal is to reach further than being just a
visitor.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country is making NATO-oriented adjustment and
he believed that one day Latvia will be among those who are at the
NATO headquarters to welcome him.
</P>
<P>
Krasts exchanged views with Solana on what to do to improve the
current military hardware of Latvia so as to meet the accession
requirement of NATO.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief briefed the visitor about the latest development
of the NATO agenda that could well include the accession
negotiations currently underway between Hungary, Poland, the Czech
Republic and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Like Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, the three Baltic
countries also applied for NATO membership. Yet Russia is firmly
opposed to the accession to NATO by Baltic states Latvia, Estonia
and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Tuesday in New
York that Russia will be responsible for the security of the
Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on Primakov's statement, the Latvian
prime minister said that the issue of Latvian security is a rather
complicated one.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on the scenario of just one Baltic state
joining the 15-nation military alliance, the NATO chief said that
Madrid is only the beginning of the NATO enlargement. It is not
the end of it, he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO invited Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to join the
North Atlantic alliance at its Madrid summit held on July 8 and 9.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief, who praised Latvia for its positive
participation in the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia
and Partnership for Peace program, reaffirmed at the briefing that
those countries that wish to join and are qualified to join can do
so in future, in that enlargement is an open process and the
alliance will welcome other newcomers.

<HEADLINE> UAE Completes Amendments to Copyright Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) has completed amendment to the Copyright Law to make it
tougher for violators, the WAM News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The amended copyright law would be implemented after being
approved by UAE'S Council of Ministers at the end of this year,
the agency quoted a senior official of the Ministry of Information
and Culture which was responsible for the work of amendment.
</P>
<P>
"We have prepared the amendments because it is obvious to us
that some articles should be changed to match international
agreements," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The WAM report gave no details about the amendments, which
observers here said would most likely include some modifications
in current penalties for violators.
</P>
<P>
UAE drew up in 1992 the Copyright Law which allows a one-year
grace period for violators to amend their status.
</P>
<P>
Foreign businessmen, however, claimed that the law was less
than strict and effective for violators.
</P>
<P>
"The current penalties are not effective. We have seen
companies which committed piracy seven times and the Ministry (of
Information and Culture) knows them well," said Sharma, spokesman
of the Business Software Alliance in Middle East based in Abu
Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
He said "The UAE should impose harsher penalties on second or
third violations. This could make the law meet international
agreements."

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Talyor is unable to attend the current session of the U.N.
General Assembly due to "insecurity", a report reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted state-controlled radio ELBC as saying
Tuesday in Monrovia that the senate, which normally approves
foreign trips of the president, declined to give permission to
Taylor to go to New York, where was expected to address the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The senate reportedly said in a letter to Taylor that the
decision was based on "the peculiarities and uncertainties
surrounding the president's safety and security during his visit
to the U.S.."
</P>
<P>
The report implied that Taylor would not travel to the U.S.
because an arrest warrant issued by a Massachusetts court was
awaiting him.
</P>
<P>
Taylor broke out of a Boston jail in 1984, where was being
held pending extradition on charges laid by the then Liberian
government that he had embezzled some one million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But reports reaching here earlier said a district court in
Boston has already dismissed the extradition request on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It said Monrovia earlier this month sent a note to the U.S.
authorities saying it had "withdrawn its request for the
extradition of Mr. Taylor."

UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to
contribute to restoring the peaceful process in the Middle East,
according to Qian Qichen, Chinese vice-premier and foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the pledge during his talks with David Levy, deputy
prime minister and foreign minister of Israel, here this

</P>
<P>
Qian said that China hopes to see new progress in the peace
process of the Middle East and a proper resolution to the issues

He told his Israeli counterpart that Chinese President Jiang
Zemin is looking forward to the forthcoming official visit by
Israeli President Ezer Weizman at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Qian added that maintaining contacts and exchanges by the two
foreign ministers is conducive to enhancing the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that his country is watching closely China's
development. He greeted China's smooth resumption of the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the successful convening of the
15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. He said

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- India says the most
important target of the United Nations should be the promotion of
sustained economic growth in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kumar Gujral expressed the stance in his address
to the 52nd session of the U.N. General Assembly here today.
</P>
<P>
The target will lead to the eradication of poverty and will
erase the tensions and pressures leading to the collapse of
governance and social order in several states and to conflicts,
Gujral said.
</P>
<P>
"International peace and stability will be enhanced only when
all countries enjoy a minimum standard of economic
self-sufficiency and well-being," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The thrust of any reform proposals in the U.N. should make the
promotion of sustained economic development the principal
cross-sectoral issues for the Secretariat's programs," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said India is supportive of all reform proposals aimed at
strengthening the U.N. and its capacity to respond effectively to
the principles identified by the overwhelming majority of U.N.
member states.
</P>
<P>
Gujral reiterated India's request to become a permanent member
of the U.N. Security Council.

ADDIS ABABA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Abdulreshid Dulane,
Ethiopian Vice-Minister of Water Resources today warned that only
160,000 of the country's 3.5 million hectares of potentially
irrigable area has so far been developed through irrigation.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement when opening a workshop here.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia enjoys various potentially irrigable basins which are
capable of significantly contributing to undertakings of small
and medium scale agricultural development projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's agricultural sector, dominated by small scale
holders, may cause increased problem of food security when
compared with the fast growing population.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister called for increased efforts in soil and
water protection in drought prone areas, planting of fast growing
crops, and employment of modern agricultural inputs as
intervention measures to combat reduction of food production.
</P>

The workshop was organized to support the capacity building
effort of the Somali Region Sustainable Development of

<HEADLINE> World Needs UN More Than Ever: France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at the 52nd session of the General Assembly, Hubert
Vedrine said the need for a universal regulating body had never
been so apparent as the world had left the era of bipolar
confrontation to enter a new stage in which 185 states cooperated,
made alliances with one another or competed in stable or shifting
combinations.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that at the global level, the world
needed a coherent, effective United Nations with the resources
necessary to carry out its mission, and it was the task of this
body to help the smooth organization of international relations
and to determine universally recognized rules of law. To carry out
the major role, the United Nations must retain or reacquire the
means to take decisions and to act.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of the Security Council, the foreign minister
said the current composition of the security Council was no
longer an accurate reflection of the political geography of the
world today, and it had to be reformed and enlarged to become
more representative.
</P>
<P>
On financial reform, he said the United Nations should not be
living precariously and therefore under a system of financial
and budgetary dependence with respect to its debtors, and France
believed that solution to the problem could be found if the
basic principles were taken: What was owed the United Nations
must be paid in full, on time and unconditionally and payment of
assessment should not be a way to exert pressure on the
Secretary-General and the other member states.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said France backed the logic measures to
restructure and regroup the institutions of the Organization, and
France welcomed the establishment in Vienna of a center dedicated
to addressing such new transitional dangers as organized crimes,
drug trafficking and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
France also welcomed the appointment of Mrs. Mary Robinson to
the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights and the integration
of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the
Center for Human Rights into a single entity, added the foreign
minister.

<HEADLINE> Canada-US Dairy Dispute Expected to Flare Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A long-running dispute between
Canada and the U.S. over dairy products is set to flare up again
next week when Canada is included in a U.S. list of countries
targeted for trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky is expected to
include the Canadian dairy industry's new export pricing system in
the "301 list" to be subject to U.S. trade actions, said a report
today.
</P>
<P>
Canada's dairy industry adopted a new pricing system for milk
in 1995, which prices milk used for products being exported much
lower than milk used in its domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dairy industry has demanded that Barshefsky file a
complaint with the World Trade Organization, arguing that Canada's
pricing system is a disguised subsidy.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Canada's cheese exports to Japan increased 717
percent in the first half of this year because Canada undercuts
U.S. cheese prices by 500 U.S. dollars a ton, the industry argued.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Canada refuses to allow the U.S. dairy
industry any substantial access to its domestic market and uses
tariffs as high as 350 percent to keep out imports, it added.
</P>
<P>
"We note that Canada's dairy trade balance went from a deficit
of 19 million dollars in 1993 to a surplus of 68 million dollars
in 1996," the industry said.
</P>
<P>
Under industry pressure, Barshefsky is widely expected to
launch the complaint against Canada, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the U.S. lost a NAFTA panel ruling that
found Canada's new import tariffs on dairy did not violate the
free trade agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Presidential Emissary
for Cyprus, Richard Holbrooke, said today that the United States
is trying to define the substance of the Cyprus issue, Cyprus News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are not on the edge of a historic breakthrough. We are not
in the middle of a Camp David or a Dayton type negotiation. We are
trying to define the issues." He said after meeting with Cypriot
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides in New York.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said the parties involved in a settlement to the
Cyprus problem are now in a more productive mood than they were
early this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said that it is important that Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides and the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash will meet in Nicosia to discuss security issues.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities on the
divided island are scheduled to hold talks Friday seeking an
agreement on security issues as demilitarization of the island.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke expressed U.S. support for Cyprus' bid to join the
European Union (EU), but he said it is up to the EU members to
discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet Clerides when he visits New York in
October to address the U.N. General Assembly, according to the
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops on the Mediterranean island and took over the northern
third in the wake of a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Turkey, which is
deploying 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus.

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Germany's imports also increased by about 15 percent

July trade surplus was 11.1 billion marks (6.2 billion dollars)
compared with 10.2 billion (5.7 billion dollars) a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first seven months of 1997 as a whole, the country's

the first seven months rose from 52.8 billion (29.5 billion
dollars) to 68.6 billion marks (38.3 billion dollars).
</P>

current account deficit, which also included trade in services,
was reduced to 7.8 billion marks (4.4 billion dollars) in the
first seven months of this year from 12.2 billion marks (6.8
billion dollars) a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Accused of Demolishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli human rights
group today accused the Likud government of launching a punitive
campaign of destroying Palestinian houses since the July 30
double suicide bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here, spokesman of Israeli Information
Center for Human Rights in Occupied Territories (BTSELEN) said
that in August, Israel destroyed 29 homes in the West Bank, four
times more than that of July and left 163 Palestinians homeless.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that since the beginning of the year,
about 110 Palestinian structures have been demolished in Area C
in the West Bank, which is under sole Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past 10 years, some 1,800 homes of
Palestinians have been demolished in the territories, leaving a
total of 11,000 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has asserted that most of the
demolished buildings were uninhabited incomplete structures and
some of the residential and industrial buildings were destroyed
as buildings without necessary permit.
</P>
<P>
However, Yuval Inbal, a BTSELEN official, argued today that
the reason for the demolition in Area C is not purely
administrative, saying that the demolition has a lot to do with
such considerations as keeping Palestinian buildings away from
Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the illegality of the buildings, Inbal said that
these houses were built without permit, but getting a permit was
practically impossible, because Israel wants to avoid Palestinian
representation in the area.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Palestinian population in the West
Bank has an annual increase of 6 percent, and people living there
have to build new homes.
</P>
<P>
After capturing the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East War,
Israel declared much of the area "state lands" and routinely
rejects Arab ownership claims.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Condemns Terror Attacks in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League today strongly
condemned the attacks by terrorist gangs against innocent
civilians in Algeria and called for international efforts to
eradicate terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, the Cairo-based organization
described the crimes as "contradictory with heavenly doctrines and
humanitarian principles and values."
</P>
<P>
The 22-member Arab League voiced support to the Algerians in
their efforts in uprooting terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
The statement also urged the international community to
eradicate terrorism worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Cairo-based Arab Human Rights Organization also
condemned the massacres in the Algerian capital of Algiers that
claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
In an appeal circulated today, the organization called upon
violent groups in Algeria to cease the vicious cycle of violence
that threatens the country's future.
</P>
<P>
It urged all parties and civilian community organizations in
Algeria to clearly proclaim their absolute rejection of violence
and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five people -- some reports put the number at 200 --
were killed and 69 others injured in the latest massacre in the
vicinity of Algiers Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic militants launched their insurgency in 1992 after
the army canceled a parliamentary vote the Islamic Salvation Front
was poised to win. More than 60,000 people have died in violence
ever since.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Foreign Minister on UN Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITRED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Mexico, a founding
member of the United Nations, reiterated its full readiness to
contribute to the efforts to reform the Organization, Angel
Gurria, minister of foreign relations of Mexico, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 52nd session of the General Assembly, the
foreign minister said Mexico had attacked since 1945 the very
concept of a division between permanent and non-permanent members
of the Security Council, basically because the existence of the
two categories established a discriminatory situation which is
accentuated by giving the permanent members the right of veto, a
privilege which had been abused.
</P>
<P>
He said the need to increase the capability of the United
Nations to prevent conflicts and resolve those that exist required
not only reform of the Security Council and its working methods,
but also a strengthening of the mechanisms for resolving conflicts
through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said reform of the Security Council was
needed in order to correct the imbalances in its current position,
improve the decision-making mechanism and make the conduct of its
work more transparent.
</P>
<P>
On the financial situation of the Organization, the foreign
minister said that it stemmed from a failure to comply with the
obligations derived from the Charter. The current financial
situation had no link with the assessment system. The road to deal
with it was full, timely and unconditional payment of the
assessments the General Assembly assigned to the member states.

<HEADLINE> EU Says Agreement on US Anti-Cuba Law Hard to Reach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Trade Commissioner Sir
Leon Brittan of the European Union (EU) said today that it was
still difficult to settle a dispute with Washington over a U.S.
law aimed at curbing foreign investment in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law seeking to punish companies investing in
confiscated Cuban property, and the D'Amato Law seeking to curb
investments in Libya and Iran were hurting trans-Atlantic
relations, Brittan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"This dispute should be brought to an end," Brittan said. "It
is damaging the relationship and it is damaging the rest of the
world."
</P>
<P>
It would be difficult to reach agreement before the October 15
deadline, Brittan said. "I am not saying that the agreement on
Helms-Burton and D'Amato is even within sight as yet. We have a
long way to go in the talks."
</P>
<P>
During a two-day visit to Washington and New York, Brittan
discussed Helms-Burton and other trade issues with U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky and a number of members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
He met with Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, who led
U.S. negotiations on Helms-Burton, and was to meet with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in New York this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law, enacted last year after Cuba shot down
two small planes being flown by Cuban exiles from Miami, targets
companies profiting from property seized by the Cuban government
after the revolution in 1959.
</P>
<P>
The law was widely condemned by the world community including
the U.S. close allies such as the EU, Canada and Japan. The EU
filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Last April, the two sides agreed to try to reach a negotiated
settlement in order to avoid a damaging fight in the WTO, which
the U.S. said had no jurisdiction in what it saw as a national
security issue.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
took no further action against the commander of the U.N. Observer
Mission on Georgia (UNOMIG) for paying a ransom to secure the
release of two hostages, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Harun Ar-Rashisd of Bangladesh was recalled to
the U.N. Headquarters over the weekend to explain why a total of
7,000 U.S. dollars was paid to obtain the release of a U.N.
military observer and a local interpreter taken hostages by
unknown elements days ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, the spokesman said, "We merely
reaffirmed to him the policy of not paying ransom and not
negotiating over hostages, and hearing his complete account of how
things happened, we felt there were mitigating circumstances."
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned about the precedent, which is why we
called him here," added the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A total of 115 U.N. military observers are stationed in the
country, where a large Russian-led peacekeeping force fielded by
the Commonwealth of Independent States has been patrolling a
buffer zone of Georgia and the breakaway region of Abkhazia.

<HEADLINE> Irish FM Says Mind Needs Decommissioning for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Irish Foreign
Minister Ray Burke said today that an ultimate settlement of the
Northern Ireland conflict required a mind change among the
parties, not only the laying down of weapons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a breakfast meeting with reporters prior to talks
with U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger here, Burke gave
an upbeat assessment of prospects for progress at all-party
Northern Ireland peace talks in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The Irish and British security forces detected "absolutely no
breakages" in the truce declared by the Irish Republican Army in
July, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Burke said persuading the Irish Republican Army to hand
over arsenals that have fueled a 28-year war on British rule was
only part of the key to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
"This talks process is about decommissioning a mind-set rather
than just decommissioning the weapons. What we want to ensure
is... paramilitary factions on both sides will feel the outcome is
a fair and honest compromise," Burke said.
</P>
<P>
Burke, who met President Bill Clinton briefly in New York late
Sunday, said he had expressed Dublin's gratitude for U.S. support
for the Northern Ireland peace talks.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Junta's Talks Offer Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The offer of Sierra Leone's
military junta to hold talks with ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
on the current political impasse in the country was refuted today.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of Kabbah's government, Desmond Luke, said the
offer only indicated the junta's attempt to "play for time" for
continued stay in power.
</P>
<P>
The official, who was negotiating with the rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) at the time of the coup on May 25 which overthrew
the Kabbah administration, has been in Conakry, capital of neighboring
Guinea, with the ousted president.
</P>
<P>
"They (the junta) have trying to play for time, purely waste time
in order to continue killing, stealing, looting people's property,"
Cluke said, quoted by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The junta reportedly asked for talks with President Conte in early
August to resume peace negotiations that failed in Abijan, Cote
d'Ivoire in July after the junta announced to stay in power until
2001.
</P>
<P>
The international community has urged the junta to return power to
Kabbah without delay and the west African peacekeeping force has
enforced economic embargo on the country for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure, the junta confirmed Tuesday that military
leader Major Johnny Paul Koroma wanted a peaceful solution to the
country's crisis through talks with Kabbah and RUF leader Foday
Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
But Luke had no trust in the junta, saying that the military
government was not serious about any negotiations for an immediate
handover as required by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"They indicated twice that they wanted to talk with President
Lansana Conte (of Guinea)...but they have not been earnest in the
least right at the start," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the junta, which has put Sierra Leone back for
50 years, only wanted to continue to run the country instead of
return power to the ousted civilian government.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Publishes LDCs 1997 Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Although growth rates for the
least developed countries (LDCs) fell in 1996 from 1995, growth
has been relatively robust, and many LDCs have performed well
enough to have recorded real increases in output and real
increases in per capita income.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens Ricupero made the statement in
an overview of the Least Developed Countries, 1997 Report
published here today.
</P>
<P>
The average GDP real growth rate for all LDCs in 1996 was 4.7
percent, less than the rate of 5.2 percent in 1995, according to
the 1997 report, prepared by UNCTAD, the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a very slight difference between the
performance of African and Asian LDCs," Ricupero said. "The LDCs
are an extremely heterogeneous group, however, and the most
significant disparities in performance exist not at a regional but
at a country level, with a difference of over 20 percent between
the highest and lowest GDP growth rates for LDCs."
</P>
<P>
Ricupero believed that the future is looking decidedly brighter
for LDCs in Africa than has been the case for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
Many African countries, including LDCs, have experienced higher
growth rates since 1994: 19 African LDCs have had growth rates in
excess of 4 percent, and 10 of those have had GDP growth rates
higher than 5 percent although the average GDP growth rate of 4.6
percent for African LDCs in 1996 is less than the rate of 5.4
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
There are indications that this trend is set to continue,
Ricupero said. In many countries, export production has been
increased, inflation rates have been reduced and reform has been
consistently well implemented since the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Asian LDCs have seen their average GDP growth rate rise from
4.6 percent in 1995 to 4.8 percent in 1996. They are believed to
have benefited from their location in the world's fastest-growing
region.
</P>
<P>
The recent dynamism of the larger Asian economies, in
particular India and China, has spilled over into neighboring
LDCs. The output expansion in Cambodia and Laos have been
particularly rapid. The largest LDC, Bangladesh, has not performed
as well as might have been hoped. This is partly due to delays in
the implementation of economic reforms, Ricupero noted.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Declares Robben Island National Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today declared the Robben Island, his former prison, a
national monument and a museum, the South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had been kept in the island off Cape Town for 18 years
before he was set free by former president F. W. de Klerk in February
1990.
</P>
<P>
Mandela today opened the Robben Island Museum and unveiled a
national monument plaque.
</P>
<P>
He said in a speech that South Africa's cultural institutions,
particularly its museums, are still portraying blacks in a demeaning
manner and were not reflecting the country's diverse heritage, SAPA
reported.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's museums and monuments had reflected the experiences
and political ideals of a minority to the exclusion of others during
colonialism and apartheid, he said.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is also leader of the
Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, and several other cabinet ministers
and parliament members were invited to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Also invited were former veterans of the notorious prison.
</P>
<P>
However, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, president of the National party,
which implemented ultra-racist policies during the apartheid era, was
not invited, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Robben Island, a lepers' colony for some time, became a major
political prison to house anti-apartheid activists in the apartheid
era.
</P>
<P>
Arts and Culture Minister Lionel Mtshali said the island is
also a candidate for a world heritage site.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Least Developed Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The least developed countries
(LDCs) are the poorest countries in the world. They are officially
designated as "least developed" by the General Assembly of the
United Nations on the basis of a number of agreed criteria.
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the General Assembly approved the first list of LDCs,
24 countries in all: Afghanistan, Benin, Bhutan, Botswana,
Burundi, Chad, Ethiopia, Guinea, Haiti, the Lao People's
Democratic Republic, Lesotho, Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Nepal,
Niger, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda, the United Republic of
Tanzania, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), Samoa and the Republic
of Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently the following countries were added to the list:
Bangladesh, the Central African Republic, Democratic Yemen and
Gambia in 1975; Cape Verde and the Comoros in 1977; Guinea-Bissau
in 1981; Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe,
Sierra Leone and Togo in 1982; Vanuatu in 1985; Kiribati,
Mauritania and Tuvalu in 1986; Myanmar in 1987; Mozambique in
1988; Liberia in 1990; Cambodia, Madagascar, Solomon Islands,
Zaire and Zambia in 1991; and Eritrea and Angola in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The criteria used to determine the countries in greatest need
were per capita GDP, share of manufacturing in total GDP, and the
adult literacy rate. In the following years, the criteria were
revised and refined to include the augmented quality of life
index, the economic diversification index and population size, but
at the same time the number of countries included in the list rose
steadily, reaching 48 in 1994. It was of course hoped that, as
development efforts had an impact, countries would one by one
"graduate" from the LDC group as their level of development rose,
but in fact in the last 25 years only one country, Botswana in
1994, has succeeded in doing so. (Source: UNCTAD)

<HEADLINE> U.S. Offers $2 Million Reward for Mexico's Drug Kingpin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September (Xinhua) -- The U.S. authorities today
stepped up its pressure on Mexico's most violent drug kingpin by
offering a reward of more than two million U.S. dollars and adding
him to the FBI's most wanted list.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, FBI Director Louis Freech said
Ramon Arellano Felix, 33, the head of security for a gang run by
five brothers, is charged with drug conspiracy and smuggling in a
sealed federal indictment in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
"He and his associates are responsible for directing numerous
murders in Mexico and the United States" and setting the price of
cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine and heroin throughout the
U.S., said Thomas Constantine, head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Arellano Felix is the most violent of the brothers in the gang,
coordinates recruitment of its well-armed and well-trained guards
and commands its armed operations, according to Constantine.
</P>
<P>
Freeh used the news conference to push legislation, now before
a House committee, giving his agents access to the keys to
commercial encryption devices and software used to scramble
telephone conversations and computer transmissions.
</P>
<P>
"If a workable national solution to the encryption problem is
not enacted soon...we simply will loose our most effective tool
with respect to drug interdiction," Freech said.
</P>
<P>
The two million U.S. dollars reward was posted by the State
Department for the arrest or conviction of Ramon Arellano Felix.
The FBI added a 50,000 U.S. dollars reward as well.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Slams Russia's Missile Deal With Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A Senior Turkish official
today criticized Russia's missile deal with Cyprus, according to
local TV and radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-Cypriot missile deal will negatively affect the
stability of the region, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Ismet
Sezgin said while meeting a Russian military delegation here.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation is here to attend the Third
International Defense Industry and Civil Aviation Fair '97, which
opened Tuesday and attracted more than 200 industrial companies
from 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia's decision to sell missiles to Cyprus is not consistent
with the deep-rooted Russian-Turkish friendship, Sezgin said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been accusing Russia of signing an agreement in
January to sell hundreds of missiles to the Cypriot government. It
has threatened to use all necessary means to block the delivery of
the missiles.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side, however, said it has no intention to drop the
missile deal, adding that the Cypriot government has the right to
buy weapons which it needs.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island following a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Turkey, which has
deployed 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Diplomats to Return to Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
decided to send back its diplomats to Sudan, which, however, did
not mean any change in poor relations between the two countries,
the State Department officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have determined that the security situation permits
American diplomatic staff to be reassigned to Khartoum," an
official said.
</P>
<P>
But that would only be a small, mid-level group of diplomats
that will station in the capital of Sudan while U.S. ambassador
Timothy Carney and some other staff will continue to stay outside
Sudan, making periodic visits there, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. diplomats left Sudan in Feb. 1996 for fear of "threats and
possible attacks upon American diplomats." the Sudanese government
denied that Americans were in danger and urged Washington to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the U.S. diplomats has not led to a
break-down of the relations with Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the return of American diplomats
implied no change in Washington's poor relations with Sudan, and
the United States is seeking to contain the Islamic African
country by increasing military assistance to Sudan's neighbors.

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, September 24 (Xinhua) --Fighting goes on today in the
Congolese capital Brazzaville and it has become the center of
heavy artillery battles.
</P>
<P>
People in the capital fear that the situation may completely
get out of control, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Some 4000 people are reported to have been killed since
fighting started in June when the Congolese government forces
tried to disarm militiamen loyal to former President Sassou
Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Congolese citizens have fled the country since
several peace talks aimed at ending the civil war in the country
failed.
</P>
<P>
As fighting continues in the capital, police in Kinshsa, the
capital of the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, have
tightened control of those refugees crossing the Congo River and
ordered refugees from Brazzaville to register with authorities.
</P>
<P>
Police also closed three Congo River crossing points.
</P>
<P>
Reports said a United Nations refugee agency camp held at
least 20,000 refugees from the fighting in Brazzaville.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- France is set to attain the
public deficit at 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) quota
in 1998 to qualify for the European single currency euro,
according to an austerity draft budget law presented today by the
Socialist government.
</P>
<P>
The public deficit will be cut by 26.951 billion francs (4.5
billion U.S. dollars) as compared with 1997, to be limited at

</P>
<P>
Public spending in 1998 will be restricted at 1,585.3 billion
francs (264 billion US dollars), 1.36 percent more than 1997,
while inflation is expected at 1.3 percent in 1998 and stood at
1.4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The government will raise 14 billion francs (2.3 billion US
dollars) from new taxes to be imposed on households and
enterprises, while all taxes to be collected will take 45.9
percent of the GDP next year.
</P>
<P>
Defense spending will be cut by 8.9 billion francs (1.5 billion
US dollars) in conformity with the professionalization process of
the French armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Officials Prepare for Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir today ordered preparation for negotiations with the main
rebel force operating in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on ending the country's 14-year-old war
expected to be held in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi next month
under the sponsorship of the Inter Governmental Authority on
Development and Drought (IGADD).
</P>
<P>
The October negotiations were agreed upon by Sudanese Minister
of Federal General Office Ali Mohammed and Commander Nhial Deng of
the largest rebel faction Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) at
the sideline of an IGADD meeting in Nairobi Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IGADD meeting was attended by the foreign ministers of
Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
IGADD, which embraces Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea,
Somalia and Djibouti, has played a mediatory role between the
Sudanese government and John Garang, leader of the SPLA.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed and Deng also expressed in a joint statement their
acceptance of the IGADD's declaration of principles of 1994 for
resolving the southern Sudan question.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government had earlier rejected the IGADD
principles which call for separating religion from politics and
upholding political pluralism in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sudanese Vice President el Zubeir Mohammed Salih who
is currently on a visit to southern Sudan addressed an appeal to
Garang to join the peace process in the best interests of security
and stability in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has already signed peace agreements
with seven rebel factions in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Over a million people have died in violence since 1983 when the
southern rebels took up arms for greater autonomy from the Islamic
North for the Christian and animist south.

UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Qian Qichen, Chinese
vice-premier and foreign minister, told his Dutch counterpart,
Hans Van Mierlo, today that China hopes to develop relations with
the European Union countries including the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is one of China's major trade partners in

Nations General Assembly.
</P>

Qian said, though differences exist on some questions, the two
countries could develop their relations healthily and normally, so
long as they respect each other and show their good faith.
</P>
<P>
Mierlo agreed with Qian on the bilateral relations. He said
that the two countries have a long history of exchange and the
Dutch Chinese have made important contributions to the development
of his country.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Turns Out First Home-Made Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The first made-in-Nigeria car
produced by the local Izuogu Motors Ltd. made its debut Tuesday in
Imo state, South Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to the company Managing Director Ezekiel Izuogu, the car,
modeled Z-600, was built in about eight years, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The manager did not give further description of the car, but said
the engine was one "that could be put to other uses like agricultural
mechanization, standby electric generators, tricycle manufacture,
among others".
</P>
<P>
He said about 200 million Naira (about 2.4 million U.S. Dollars)
will be needed to put a production line in place and go into mass
production of about 30,000 cars a year.
</P>
<P>
When in mass production, he said, it will cost the average Nigerian
between 150,000 and 180,000 Naira (about 1,800-2,200 U.S. Dollars) per
unit.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the car, Chief of General Staff Oladipo Diya, the
number two person of the country, said the even marked "the
commencement of our march toward industrial self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
He called on Nigerians to work hard for the relentless task for
self actualization and realization of the country's potentials for
industrialization it possess.
</P>
<P>
Due to the underdevelopment of industry, Nigeria has to depend on
imported manufactured goods to meet its needs ranging from
sophisticated machinery to some daily necessities such as metalware.
</P>
<P>
Cheap fuel has made Nigeria a flourish market for automobiles,
mostly second-handed.
</P>
<P>
Currently the country's biggest car producer is the Peugeot
Automobile Nigeria Ltd, a joint venture with France.
</P>
<P>
But due to the sluggish market, the company only operated at 10
percent of its annual 35,000 unit capacity.

<HEADLINE> Republican Majority Leader Says House to Take Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Republicans will bring
legislation to overhaul campaign finance rules to the floor of the
U.S. House of Representatives this fall, Majority Leader Dick
Armey said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Senate leaders, under prodding by President Bill
Clinton, agreed to consider the bipartisan bill sponsored by
Senators John McCain, a Republican, and Russell Feingold, a
Democrat, before adjourning for the year.
</P>
<P>
Armey said "I can't tell you what the configuration will be. I
can't tell you what the timing will be. We will have something on
the floor this fall," he said.
</P>
<P>
Democrat Representative George Miller called Armey's statement
"encouraging." Miller, along with other House democrats, have
been pressuring Republican leaders into allowing a floor debate on
a bill to ban "soft money" -- unregulated large donations to
political parties that have been the focus of campaign overhaul.
</P>
<P>
Armey said that a provision limiting unions' use of members'
dues for political activities would probably be part of any
Republican campaign finance overhaul bill.
</P>
<P>
Many Republicans were angered by the 35 million dollars the
American Federation of Labor and congress of Industrial
Organizations (AFL-CIO) spent last year on behalf of Democratic
causes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton threatened in a letter to Senate leaders Tuesday that
he would keep the Senate in session until the McCain-Feingold bill
got full consideration. Democrats have been concerned that
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi might bring it up just
before adjournment.
</P>
<P>
Armey described Clinton's threat as a hollow "political point."
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the matter is Senator Lott had indicated his
desire to put something on the floor on campaign finance reform
last week and I had indicated that I had the expectation that we
would do it in the House last week," he said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Admits Poor Controls over Beef Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Admitting that its meat controls
are not strict enough to block the banned British beef exports,
Germany today called on its 16 federal states to conduct more
thorough and frequent surveillance of their slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Bonn, German Health Minister
Horst Seehofer also accused Britain of not carrying out proper
meat controls of its own and called on the European Commission to
first of all keep a close watch on meat export surveillance in
that country.
</P>
<P>
Seehofer made the remarks in reaction to a EU report on Tuesday
which called for the closure of a German firm after inspectors
found suspected British beef imports in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has been a staunch backer for maintaining the export ban on
British beef which was imposed by the EU in 1996 after Britain
admitted that there was a possible link between the so-called mad
cow disease and its human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A top U.S. official said
on Wednesday that Washington would not give any assistance to
Congo unless President Laurent Kabila fulfills his promises of
cooperation to investigate massacres of Rwandan refugees.
</P>
<P>
David Scheffer, ambassador-at-large for war crimes, said U.S.
officials have been pressuring Kabila "almost daily" to fulfill
promises of cooperation he made three months ago.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has not provided assistance to Congo," he
said. "Such assistance is contingent on cooperation with the
U.N. investigating team."
</P>
<P>
"Kinshasa has nothing to gain and much to lose if it
continues to obstruct," he added.
</P>
<P>
The massacres occurred during the uprising that overthrew
President Mobutu Sese Seko in May.
</P>
<P>
The investigating team arrived in Kinshasa, capital of Congo,
almost a month ago but has not been able to begin to work.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Teachers Split over Returning to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A major split surfaced
today in the ranks of the 18,000-strong Teachers Union in Sierra
Leone following a recent communique issued by the Teachers
National Executive Committee banning teachers from returning to
the classroom in October.
</P>
<P>
A 15-man Special Committee of Educational Stakeholders had
agreed that primary schools should reopen on October 6 and
secondary schools on October 19 but a communique by the Sierra
Leone Teachers Union National Executive urged teachers to "ignore
both dates and continue to stage a stay-home defiance".
</P>
<P>
The executive said teachers will only return to their jobs "if
the military government returns power back to the civilian
government it ousted and all outstanding salaries and allowances
of teachers are paid."
</P>
<P>
A new group, the Committee of Concerned Teachers, opposed to
the stand taken by the National Executive saying in a six-point
statement today that "majority of teachers are ready to serve the
nation in conjunction with any government of the day."
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed by Abubakarr Bangura as Chairman and
Moses Konteh as Secretary General, observed that "since 1991 to
date, there has not been an absolute breakdown in the educational
process even though there has never been a stable political
climate."
</P>
<P>
The statement accused the executive of "sending a document to
the Government Treasury to deduct nearly two dollars as Union
dues from teachers salaries nationwide against their wish instead
of the normal one dollar. If this is allowed, we will continue
the strike against the unjustifiable decision of the executive."'
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Alpha Timbo, secretary-general of
the Union, rejected the charges saying "We are doing everything
for the good of all teachers."
</P>
<P>
Observers said that although some teachers have been paid up
to June, others are yet to receive salaries and allowances
stretching as far back as March. The military government had
promised to pay all their salaries when it took over in May.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 150,000 school children have been idle since May when
all schools were shut down in the west African state.

<HEADLINE> US Forgives Jordan New Amount of Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States today forgave
Jordan a new batch of debt valued at 63.4 million U.S. dollars,
Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Jordan Wesley Egan and Jordanian Deputy
Prime Minister and acting Finance Minister Jawad Anani signed here
today an agreement on the debt forgiveness, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
This is the third and also the last agreement between the two
countries to fulfill a U.S. promise to forgive Jordan a debt
totalling 700.4 million dollars. The previous two agreements were
signed respectively in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Anani told the press that the debt
forgiveness showed that the U.S. government recognized the
success Jordan had achieved in its monetary and fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed appreciation for the U.S. efforts in debt
forgiveness for Jordan and hoped that Jordan's other creditor
nations would consider such forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
The United States has become a strong financial supporter of
Jordan by granting millions of dollars of aid, forgiving its debt
and helping the kingdom rescheduling of its huge foreign debt
payment.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the main receivers of U.S. aid, along with
Israel and Egypt, in the Mideast. In the past seven years, the
U.S. has provided it with some 1.5 billion dollars in economic and
military aid and debt forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
This year, the U.S. has so far granted an aid of 200 million
dollars to Jordan. And the U.S. Congress is reportedly trying to
increase it to 250 million dollars, despite of its overall plan to
cut down foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that it is the important role of Jordan in
the Mideast peace process and in supporting the U.S. dual
containment policy against Iraq and Iran that prompt the U.S. to
provide Jordan with large amount of aid.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty and established diplomatic
relations with Israel in 1994, becoming the second of the only two
Arab countries in the Mideast to have signed peace treaties
with Israel after Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Showcases Role of Financial Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has won itself
increased fame as an international financial center by
successfully hosting the World Bank/IMF meetings and visiting
international financiers have become more convinced of its
important role in the global financial sector, commentators said
today.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the September 23-25 W.Bank/IMF annual meetings
agreed there is every reason to believe that Hong Kong's status as
an international financial sector will be ever consolidated and
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers and central bank governors from countries all
over the world gathered in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of China, for the World Bank/International Monetary
Fund (IMF) annual meetings and the relevant seminars which ended
today after a week of lively discussions.
</P>
<P>
The views expressed by the participants reveal the
growing confidence they place in Hong Kong after they have seen
for themselves how the SAR is functioning under the concept of
"one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for the W.Bank/IMF meetings to take place
in China, and also the first time for them to be hosted by a
financial center. The meetings provided a golden opportunity for
Hong Kong to showcase its excellent achievements and its strong
potential as an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
The meetings coincided with the closing of the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China. The important decision
made at the Congress to press ahead with China's economic
restructuring sent a strong message to participants that China is
wholly committed to creating a socialist market economy and that
as a SAR of China, Hong Kong will surely enjoy an even brighter
future.
</P>
<P>
The meetings took place only two-odd months after Hong Kong's
return to China, participants saw with their own eyes the
post-handover prosperity and stability in this metropolis.
</P>
<P>
As Chinese Premier Li Peng told the opening of the meetings:
"Seeing once is better than hearing one hundred times." What the
participants saw were a prosperous economy, a stable financial
situation and local people's confidence in their future.
</P>
<P>
Both Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji stressed time
and again during their stay in Hong Kong that the policy of "one
country, two systems" will be firmly carried out. Chinese finance
officials also explained the significance of one country, two
currencies, two monetary systems and two monetary authorities in
maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial
center.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus' words were widely
representative of the participants: "What better opportunity could
we have to see for ourselves the potential of Hong Kong to become
an even more prosperous place, an even more dynamic center for the
benefit of Southeast Asia within the framework of 'one country,
two systems'?"
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, while some southeast Asian countries
were hit by the serious financial turbulence, Hong Kong stood
firmly. With a sound financial supervision system and sufficient
foreign reserves, plus proper preventive measures, Hong Kong
calmly defeated speculative attacks and maintained the stability
of its currency.
</P>
<P>
Many participants expressed their appreciation for Hong Kong's
calm handling of the test.
</P>
<P>
Participants noted that Hong Kong's banking system is becoming
mature and increasingly diversified. At present Hong Kong has 182
licensed banks and 62 restricted license banks. In addition, it is
host to more than 360 banks from more than 40 countries, including
some 80 of the world's top 100 banks.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Hong Kong gave its support to the IMF's rescue
effort with one billion US dollars to help Thailand, and it also
joined other lending arrangements. Hong Kong is also a member of
both the International Clearing Bank and the World Trade
Organization. All these clearly show Hong Kong's determination and
ability to promote international financial and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Participants also noted that, headed by Tung Chee Hwa, the SAR
government is both pragmatic and efficient in administering Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Finance Robert Rubin said it is particularly
fitting for the meetings to be held in Hong Kong, a city which has
become such a strong symbol of the dynamism and openness that has
transformed Asia these past three decades.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the presence of the entire international
financial community here speaks to the importance of Hong Kong
sustaining its commitment to hard work in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, when the World Bank and the IMF chose Hong
Kong as the venue for the meetings, many people were still
sceptical about its future. Seeing is believing. Today's Hong Kong
remains prosperous and energetic, and if there is any change, it's
the absence of scepticism.
</P>
<P>
Many World Bank and IMF officials pointed out at the meetings
that the holding of the meetings in Hong Kong and the record
number of participants are themselves a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a beautiful and bustling city, said President of
the World Bank James Wolfensohn. It exemplifies the openness,
dynamism and optimism of so much of Asia today, he said.
</P>
<P>
Few would doubt that Hong Kong will continue playing an
important role in the international financial sector.

<HEADLINE> Drafting Process of 15th Party Congress Report (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, head of the
third generation of leadership of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), delivered a keynote report at the opening session of the
15th CPC National Congress held at he Great Hall of the People on
September 12.
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "Hold High the Great Banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory for an All-Round Advancement of the Cause of Building
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics to the 21st Century," was
deemed the political declaration of the Communists as they
approach the new century and also the Party's guide to action.
</P>
<P>
The CPC, at its 14th National Congress in 1992, outlined the
principle of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and
determined that the theory was to be the Party's guiding ideology.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the report to the 15th National Congress was
drafted, Jiang and other members of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee announced that the
theme of the congress would be to hold high the great banner of
Deng Xiaoping Theory for an all-round advancement of the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The theme was chosen based on the needs of the times and the
people's aspirations.
</P>
<P>
The well-written report has laid a foundation and serves as a
guarantee for the success of the congress held by the CPC at the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with the writers of the draft report in December
1996, Jiang said the report should focus on this theme, and
expound on the tasks faced by the CPC and the Chinese people at
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
It should also mobilize all members of the Party and the entire
Chinese people to improve their morale and work with the same
goals in mind, thus attaining the strategic objectives for the
second phase of China's modernization and advancing toward the
third phase, so as to bring a prosperous, democratic and civilized
China into the 21st century.

<P>
During the meeting, Jiang elaborated on the historic
significance of the 15th Party National Congress, and reviewed the
development of the Chinese nation over the past 100-plus years,
especially the 50 years since the founding of the People's
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, he
said, the CPC had convened three national congresses, supplying
theoretical answers to a number of major issues of how to build
socialism in China.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have built up Deng Xiaoping Theory on building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, formulated our Party's
basic line of taking economic construction as the central task
while adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and upholding the
reform and the opening-up policy, set the objectives for
establishing a socialist market economic structure and formulated
the three-phase strategy for achieving modernization."
</P>
<P>
The report should review the major events of the past century,
particularly the five years since the 14th Party National
Congress, and look at the first 50 years of the next century, and
draw a blueprint for China's economic and social development by
the year 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of New China,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He declared his position on many issues including holding high
the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, the basic line and
program for the primary stage of socialism, on economic, political,
cultural and diplomatic development, reunification of the
motherland and the CPC in the new period.
</P>
<P>
He urged the writers of the report to conscientiously study
Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory and
stick to the principle of emancipating the mind, seeking truth from
facts and making bold explorations under correct theoretical
guidance.
</P>
<P>
The 10-month drafting process was carried out under the direct
leadership of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of
the CPC Central Committee. Jiang always attached great importance to
the work and offered suggestions on much of the material to be
included.
</P>
<P>
In a May 29 speech at the graduation ceremony of the Party
School of the CPC Central Committee, attended by ministry-level
officials, Jiang explained the four main ideas of the report to
the 15th National Party Congress, stressing the issue of following
Deng Xiaoping Theory is of utmost importance as it represents
China's political orientation and image.
</P>
<P>
The writers of the report made revisions to their work
based on Jiang's May speech.

<HEADLINE> China Cracking Down On Drug "Ice" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China is planning some strong
measures to deal with crimes involving the drug "ice", and to curb
sales of the drug.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting on crimes related to the drug held in this
southeastern Chinese city today, government public security,
transportation and medical officials called for increased
co-operation in controlling the raw materials used to manufacture
"ice", and for increased study and information on crimes related
to it.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the relatively small number of cases so far and the
small number of addicts and because of its relatively late
development in China, the potentially large markets in neighboring
countries and regions and the extremely high profits from the drug
may mean an increase in the number of crimes in the country in
future, the officials warned.
</P>
<P>
Increased efforts should be made to curb the growth of the
drug, and public awareness should be increased, the officials at
the meeting stressed.
</P>
<P>
They recommended that the experience gained by Guangdong and
Fujian provinces be used to help the rest of the country in the
fight against the drug-related crimes.

<HEADLINE> Feature: WB/IMF Officials, Bankers Say Bye to HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- With a good impression of
Hong Kong, finance officials and bankers from 181 countries said
good-bye to Hong Kong after the doors of the Annual Meetings of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) closed
here today.
</P>
<P>
Before the closing session of the meetings this morning, World
Bank President James Wolfensohn told reporters: "I have been
coming since 1962. And so far as I can see, there is zero
difference in the way people are conducting themselves today as
against six months ago."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong returned to China on July 1 after 156 years of
British rule, and has since become a special administrative region
of China under the "one country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn explained, "It seems to me not because of the
statement of (Chinese Premier) Li Peng but because of what I
observed that there is little or no change either in the pace of
life here or in the way people are operating."
</P>
<P>
"I might also say that the reaction it seems to me of everybody
at the meetings is just to accept the 'one country, two systems'
statement," the World Bank chief said. "So far there does not
appear to be any evidence that things are not going to continue as
they are today."
</P>
<P>
Rogelio Novey, alternate executive director of the
Inter-American Development Bank for Panama and Venezuela, said: "I
am deeply impressed by Hong Kong's wealth, and its modernization."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for him to come to Hong Kong, he said.
"Hong Kong people are really diligent and efficient. The meeting
is well-organized and the convention center is the best one I have
seen," he commented.
</P>
<P>
Edisor Ortiz-Duran, a banker from Equador, told Xinhua that he
had attended the Annual Meetings of the World Bank-IMF for ten
years "in a row."
</P>
<P>
What impressed him most this year in Hong Kong is that the
entire arrangements for the meetings and their security as well
have been conducted in a smooth and orderly way.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Singaporean Finance Minister Richard Hu
said he had seen with his own eyes that Hong Kong remains "exactly
the same" as what it was before the historic handover on July 1
this year.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the meetings were held in Hong Kong is of
symbolic meaning, he pointed out, indicating that the two
international organizations pay great attention to the
Asian-Pacific region and, particularly, to China and its special
administrative region Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"This year's Annual Meetings have set for us, Africans, good
examples -- Asia and, particularly, China," said Frank Douamba,
who comes from Cote d'ivoire and now serves as a representative in
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "We can learn from you (the Chinese people) how to
accelerate the economic growth and achieve development in
science-technology and culture." He told reporters that he likes
Hong Kong as well.

The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Despite an American call for a "time out" on new Israeli
housing in the West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanayahu promised Wednesday to build 300 new homes for settlers
and vowed that the Jewish presence in the West Bank would grow.
His remarks caught Ms. Albright by surprise.
</P>
<P>
-- Alleging that powerful business interests were jeopardizing
Russia's economy, President Boris Yeltsin said the state's role in
the economy would have to increase in order to insure free
competition. His remarks were largely aimed at the financial
oligarchs who helped bankroll his re-election, but whose business
empires have flourished and who some suspect of corruption.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- The upper chamber of the russian parliament unanimously
approved legislation today restricting the rights and activities
of minority religions, brushing aside Western objections and
sending the bill to President Boris Yeltsin. The U.S. Senate has
threatened to cut off U.S. aid to Russia if the bill becomes law.
</P>
<P>
-- Another brokerage powerhouse was born on Wall Street
Wednesday when Travelers Group announced it will acquire Salomon
Inc. and merge it with its Smith Barney unit, creating the
nation's second largest investment bank.
</P>
<P>
The wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. and Japan extended "open skies" negotiations into
next month after failing to agree on the details of a tentative
pact for U.S. airlines seeking new routes to Japan.
</P>
<P>
-- A U.S. commitment on Bosnia was sought by European allies
following a speech by a top administration official suggesting
some troops should stay following a scheduled June pullout. In
Bosnia, two rival Serb leaders reportedly have struck a deal to
settle their power struggle with elections.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Asks Civil Servants to Help Fight Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today instructed all civil servants to help cope and fight the
haze and forest fire disasters.
</P>
<P>
"The president is instructing all civil servants and government
officials in the country to cooperate in the effort to overcome
the disaster," Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said after
meeting with Soeharto at the Merdeka Palace.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said it is urgent that the whole nation should help
deal with the haze and fire disasters as they are already
affecting flight operations and people's daily activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coordinating Minister for the People's Welfare Azwar
Anas said the forest areas that got burned have reached 71,770
hectares in Kalimantan and around 11,562 hectares in Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, State Minister for Environment Sarwono Kusumaamadja
said that at least 300,000 hectares of forest have been destroyed
by fires since mid-August.
</P>
<P>
According to officials sources, the Japanese government has
provided assistance worth 430 million rupiah (about 150,000 U.S.
dollars) in the form of 300 pieces of jet shooter equipment,
medicines and masks.
</P>
<P>
The French government has also expressed its intention to send
experts to help Indonesia extinguish the forest fires.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have also offered assistance to deal with the
forest fires this afternoon, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Forest fires, which started in mid-August, have now caused
choking smog, which began engulfing areas as distant as the
popular Thai resort of Phuket and the Philippine capital of Manila
a few weeks ago while Malaysia and Singapore have been severely
affected by the haze.
</P>
<P>
The haze has exposed 20 million people to the danger of
respiratory problems in the country as well as in neighboring
countries.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Vice-chairman Meets Taiwan Entrepreneurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Communist Party's
15th National Congress has provided good business opportunities
for Taiwan investors, who can look to more rapid business
developments in the mainland, according to Wan Guoquan,
Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Wan made the remark at a meeting today with a group of Taiwan
businesspeople, headed by Liao Han-min, who has made investments
in Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
Most Taiwan-funded businesses in the motherland are making a
profit and are in turn contributing to the inland area's economic
growth, Wan told the group.
</P>
<P>
The Party Congress stated that China's reform and opening-up
policy will remain unchanged and that the newly elected leaders
with Jiang Zemin at the core will hold the banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory high and push socialism with Chinese characteristics well
into the next century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Compatriots across the Straits are very much concerned about
the reunification of the motherland. "One country, two systems" is
a feasible choice to achieve this goal, Wan said, adding, "We
shall not undertake to renounce the use of force." This is not,
however, directed against compatriots in Taiwan, but against
forces inside and outside Taiwan that would split the country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Economic Prospect of African LDCS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The 33 African Least
Developed Countries (LDCS) attained a growth rate of 4.6 percent
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1996, compared to 5.4 percent in
1995, according to "LDCS 1997 Report" just issued here by the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
This is a satisfying performance for Africa's most
impoverished countries for the second consecutive year since
1995.
</P>
<P>
An UNCTAD forecast said, the future is looking decidedly
brighter for these African LDCS. This is because many African
LDCS have experienced higher growth rates since 1994. Nineteen
African LDCS enjoyed growth rates of over 4 percent and 10 other
LDCS enjoyed GDP growth rates higher than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are indications that this trend is set to continue. In
many countries, export production has been increased, inflation
rates have been reduced and reform has been consistently well
implemented since the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth in African LDCS has far-reaching
significance for the eradication of poverty both in Africa and
the world as a whole. Of the world's 48 LDCS picked out by the
United Nations organization, 33 are in Africa, which takes up
over 62 percent of all African countries. Therefore, poverty
eradication in the world is directly linked with development of
these African LDCS.
</P>
<P>
The economic performance of African LDCS in 1996 was shaped by
factors of peace and stability prevailing in these countries, the
positive impact of economic reforms, the devaluation of the CFA
Franc and more favourable weather for agriculture, especially in
east and southern Africa. The recovery of the agricultural sector
from drought in 1995 contributed to economic growth in countries
such as Ethiopia, Mozambique and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Output growth in the nine LDCS which are members of the CFA
Franc zone is estimated to have averaged 4.2 percent in 1996,
lower than the 5 percent for 1995. All the CFA zone LDCS achieved
positive GDP growth in 1996, and all except Chad, Mali and Togo
registered an acceleration of growth rate over the 1995 levels.
</P>
<P>
While outside the CFA zone, the economies of several of the
LDCS which have been consistently implementing economic reforms
for a number of years continued to make progress in 1996, with
growth rates of 4.5 percent or more recorded in Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritania, Uganda and Tanzania. These countries also improved
their economic performance in terms of export earnings, lower
inflation rates, and consolidated gains made in 1994/95.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are several favourable factors for the
development of African LDCS. First, world prices for tropical
beverages rose steeply in the first half of 1997, and this will
provide a major boost to export earnings, government revenue and
domestic savings in many African LDCS.
</P>
<P>
Second, the good weather which is forecast for 1997 should
allow favourable agricultural harvests.
</P>
<P>
Third, the economic recovery in many of the African LDCS, as a
result of the sustained implementation of economic reforms, has
begun to gain some momentum over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the commitment to reforms which governments in the
region have demonstrated should enhance confidence among private
sector business and provide a stimulus to investment.

<HEADLINE> Australian FM to Visit Allies, Business Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer is to visit Australia's allies the United States
and Japan and its important regional business partners -- the
Republic of Korea, Hong Kong and the Philippines in the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Downer announced here today that he will talk with his U.S.
counterpart, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Secretary
of Defense William Cohen on October 8 in Washington as part of the
annual Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations on a wide-range of
issues.
</P>
<P>
They will exchange views on priority issues such as the U.S.
and Australia's relations with East Asia, bilateral defense
relationship and a range of issues on the global agenda, Downer
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This year's consultations will continue with the positive
momentum in the Australian-U.S. relationship which was generated
from last year's successful consultations," the foreign minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Australia strengthened its military cooperation with the United
States last year as part of the major policy adjustment by the
government of John Howard, which took office in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the forthcoming consultations would be "timely" as
they will begin shortly after high-level U.S.-Japan consultations
and precede a U.S.-Chinese summit.
</P>
<P>
"I will undertake my first bilateral visit to the Philippines
on October 10-12, as a demonstration of my strong commitment to
strengthening the relationship," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"On October 13 I will be taking part in the Japan-South Pacific
Forum Leaders Summit in Tokyo," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The summit will focus on the economic circumstances of Pacific
island countries and opportunities and challenges for development
cooperation and assistance, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have been invited by the World Economic Forum to deliver a
keynote speech at this year's East Asia Economic Summit in Hong
Kong on October 15," Downer added.
</P>
<P>
As his last leg of the tour, Downer will pay a visit to the
Republic of Korea (ROK) on October 16-17, which "underlines the
priority the (Australian) government attaches to close bilateral
cooperation with ROK," Australia's second largest market, fourth
largest trading partner and a growing source of foreign
investment.

HONG KONG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The 52nd Annual Meetings of
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were fruitful
and important for prioritizing the future work of the two
international financial institutions, a senior Chinese official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Good progress was made in some major issues at the three-day
World Bank/IMF meetings which ended in Hong Kong earlier today,
Chinese Vice-Finance Minister Liu Jibin told Xinhua in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
The achievements of the meetings are important for setting
priority of the future work of the World Bank and the IMF and for
the growth of the global economy and international financing, Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches made at the opening of the World Bank/IMF
meetings and a series of seminars prior to the meetings
respectively, Premier Li Peng and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji briefed
the audience on the brilliant achievements China has scored in its
reform and opening-up as well as the major policies decided at the
just-ended 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China,
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leaders also reiterated China's determination to
implement the principle of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong
and maintain its prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The six propositions Premier Li expounded in his speech
reflected the aspirations of the developing countries and won wide
acclaim from representatives of the developing world at the
meetings, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meetings discussed in detail the current
international economic situation and reached some consensus, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing grave concern about the recent currency turmoil in
Southeast Asia, they believed that the effects of the financial
turbulence could be tapering off if vigorous measures are taken
and bilateral and multilateral international cooperation is
conducted on the basis of drawing lessons from the event, Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
The participants were all optimistic about Asia's economic
growth in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Important decisions were made at the meetings on the policies
of the World Bank and the IMF. Agreement was reached on an
increase in the quota of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA) and on the distribution of the 21.4 billion Special
Drawing Rights (SDR)of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of implementing the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative, members of the Paris Club agreed to
speed up the process of reducing these countries' debts.
</P>
<P>
China, as a creditor nation, also promised to actively get
involved in this initiative, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The annual meetings also made headway in the fields of
promoting international capital flows and enhancing financial
surveillance.

<HEADLINE> British Press Watchdog Unveils Guidelines on Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's press watchdog the
Press Complaints Commission (PCC) today unveiled a series of new
tough privacy guidelines for the newspaper industry in the wake of
the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines were drawn up as part of an urgent review of the
industry's Code of Practice, which began on September 1 just one
day after the death of Diana in a car accident, allegedly caused
by chasing photographers known as Paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the
guidelines, the main points of which are:
</P>
<P>
Banning publication of pictures obtained illegally or through
"persistent pursuit."
</P>
<P>
Placing editors under obligation to check how pictures were
obtained.
</P>
<P>
Introducing measures to prevent so-called media scrums and
collective harassment.
</P>
<P>
Introducing new guidelines specifically for the children of
figures in the public eye, such as Princes William and Harry.
</P>
<P>
Widening the definition of private property on which individual
can expect not to be photographed.
</P>
<P>
However, Roger Gale, a Conservative MP, warned that the
proposals would have to be backed up by strict sanctions and fines
if they were to have any effect.

<HEADLINE> Turkey bomb Kurdish rebel camps in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish fighter-bombers today
carried out a bombing strike on suspected Kurdish rebel camps in
northern Iraq, the semi-official Anatolia news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Bombs were unleashed on 15 rebel camps, near the Iranian and
Syrian borders, where some 1,000 Kurdish militants recently
converged from Iran and Syria, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate report of casualties of the militants.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party, which has
been fighting a 13-year-old separatist war, use the area as a
springboard to launch attacks into Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted high-ranking Turkish military sources, who
declined to be named, as saying the bombing was aimed at blocking
them from infiltrating into Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Some 8,000 Turkish troops, backed by about 130 tanks, have
entered northern Iraq in a cross-border operation against the
rebels. The General Staff of the Turkish military confirmed this
move but refused to check the numbers.
</P>
<P>
The sources stressed that the recent attacks were not a
large-scale military operation like the one in May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli
confirmed today's attack, describing it as "routine and limited."
The government troops can take such an action if they think it
necessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last May Turkey sent as many as 50,000 troops, backed by
hundreds of tanks and heavy artillery, into northern Iraq to wipe
out rebel camps, triggering strong criticism from Iran and
neighboring Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
In mid-June, the military began withdrawal but a portion of
troops apparently have remained there.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Iraq called on Turkey to immediately withdraw
its troops from northern Iraq and stop military invasion into
Iraq's territory.

<HEADLINE> Iran Releases 46 Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran today unilaterally
released 46 Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs) in a bid to show
its goodwill toward its former enemy, Iran's official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier General Abdullah Najafi, head of Iranian commission
in charge of POWs, said at the releasing ceremony that this
unilateral move is carried out in the light of Iran's
humanitarianism and Islamism and it is the decision of Ali
Khamenei, supreme leader and commander-in-chief of Iran's armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Iran took such humanitarian measures many times in the past, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Najafi said that the number of Iraqi POWs released by Iran was
9,650 more than that of Iranian POWs released by the Iraqi regime,
expressing regret that the Iraqi government had not reciprocated
Iran's humanitarian measures.
</P>
<P>
"Not even a single Iranian POW had been released by the Iraqi
regime in the past five years," Najafi was quoted by IRNA as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi regime is holding Iranian POWS for political
purposes, he noted, adding that this practice run against
international laws.
</P>
<P>
Some 75,000 POWs have been exchanged since the end of the
Iran-Iraq war in 1988. But Iran has claimed that Iraq still holds
more than 5,000 Iranian POWs according to the documents it has.
However, Iraq has also stated that Iran still keeps some 20,000 Iraqi
POWs while rejecting the Iranian claim.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said that it released all the Iranian POWs in 1990
and repatriated them to Iran under the supervision of the
international committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Exchange of POWs and the remains of the missing soldiers during
the 1980-88 war between the two countries are still main obstacles
to the normalization of bilateral relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States
are discussing the possibility of opening a direct
telecommunications hotline linking leaders of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's regularly scheduled press conference,
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang said that maintaining
contact and dialogue between the leaders of the two countries will
help deepen understanding between the two sides and facilitate the
the development of improved bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that the two countries are engaged in wide-ranging
dialogues in many areas, including the economic, trade and and
political sectors.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that as two big countries, China and the United
States bear major responsibility for maintaining peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific Region and the world as a whole. He
noted that certain disagreements exist between the two countries
due to different values, social systems, levels of economic growth
and cultural heritages.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Chinese side has always believed that the
common ground and interests shared by the two countries are far
more significant than differences.
</P>
<P>
The turn of the century is rapidly approaching and the two
countries should develop a sound, healthy, cooperative and
mutually beneficial relationship.
</P>
<P>
Shen pointed out that the relationship is in no way aimed at a
third country. It is not a relationship of alliance, said Shen.
</P>
<P>
He said it will be a new and solid bilateral relationship which
will ensure that disagreements can be resolved through friendly
negotiations and dialog.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out both sides recognize the vital importance and
significance of bilateral relations, and are fully cognizant of
the huge common ground they share.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that exchange visits by leaders of the two nations
will greatly enhance the healthy development of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Taiwan issue is a key to Sino-US
relations, and he noted that major obstacles hindering the
expansion of bilateral relations can be attributed to the issue.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that bilateral relations will continuously improve
and expand so long as the United States strictly abides by the
principles of the three joint communiques between the two
countries.

<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin said here today that building strong
Sino-U.S. relations is crucial to global prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Rubin made the statement in his speech "Sino-U.S. Intertests
and Global Economics" presented to 200 students and teachers at
the Chinese People's University.
</P>
<P>
"China, the largest developing nation on earth, and the United
States, the largest industrialized nation, stand at the forefront
worldwide," said Rubin. He went on to say that the two nations
will have the two largest economies on earth in the not too
distant future, a fact which makes it absolutely essential to
build strong relations to ensure global prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
"People in the United States have enormous interest in seeing a
successful China. Our economies are becoming more closely linked
as China becomes more integrated into the global economy and we
should work together on wide-ranging fronts," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin's report to the recent 15th National
Congress emphasized greater openness and integration into the
global economy, said Rubin, adding that this will require opening
markets to trade and investment, and greater participation in
international organizations, China has been much more active in
such organizations over the past few years and is currently playing
an important role in the IMF, World Bank and APEC.
</P>
<P>
Rubin attended the 52nd Annual Meetings of the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund prior to beginning his first visit
to China as U.S. Treasury Secretary. He is visiting China at
the invitation of the Ministry of Finance.

LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The British government's
expectations of children's mathematics abilities may be too low,
said a report published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, launched by Chris Woodhead, chief inspector of
schools, found too little attention being given to children's
mental arithmetic ability.
</P>
<P>
In a school surveyed, only one pupil per class in the
seven-year-old grade could write down a two-digit number expressed
in words, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Woodhead said primary schools had to aim above the present
national targets if sufficient improvement were to be made.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the government to keep the standard of national
tests under review.
</P>
<P>
"If we are not expecting enough in the tests, then clearly we
are not stretching children enough and aren't going to make up the
gap with our international competitors." he said.

"Let us hope that India responds positively to the constructive
approach that Pakistan has adopted," said the spokesman at a
weekly briefing while responding to questions about the future of
Indo-Pak talks after the inconclusive third round held in New
Delhi last week.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan reiterated its commitment to continue the
talks and prime ministers of Pakistan and India had agreed on
Tuesday for a continuation of the process in their meeting in New
York, where they were attending the UN General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
However, said the spokesman, "we must underline that Kashmir
has a fundamental place in the talks and it cannot be relegated to
a lower place."
</P>
<P>
He said that a methodology had to be agreed upon how to take up
different issues during the course of negotiations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reaction by Indian leadership regarding a
"no-war pact" between the two countries, the spokesman said "we
are very surprised that Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral
did not react to the host of proposals of Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif."
</P>
<P>
"These were positive proposals, but Gujral did not make any
reference to them during his meeting with Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, " the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, "We remain committed to the broad range of dialogue in
a positive spirit, " he said, adding that the proposals would be
raised under appropriate items under the agenda for talks.
</P>
<P>
About India's efforts for getting a seat in the UN Security
Council, the spokesman said that India was pursuing a
"universalistic approach" in this matter.
</P>
<P>
He said that India has not implemented the United Nations
resolutions which have been accepted by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"A respect for the UN charter and resolutions should be
considered fundamental for those seeking permanent membership of
the United Nations Security Council," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Lesotho Complete First Phase of Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Residents in South
Africa's Gauteng Province could soon have an alternate source of
water supply as a dam in Lesotho began to gush its first liters
to the province on Wednesday, "The Star" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The release of the water marked the completion of the first
phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water project, a 19-billion-Rand
joint venture between South Africa and Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The project was supposed to build two dams in Lesotho to
supply water to South African households and industries and at
the same time generate electricity for Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
However, the future of the follow-up phases of the project
still hangs in the scale as the South African side is reluctant
to go ahead with it.
</P>
<P>
While jubilation flowed among thousands of villagers when the
sluice gates were opened, South African officials were notably
absent.
</P>
<P>
Adults in their Sunday best and children in school uniforms
stood for hours on hilltops to wait for the opening of the
sluices, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
South African Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal has said that
his country was committed only to the first phase of the project
and that future decisions would be made only after all water
resources had been researched, The Star said.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for Wide Use of Nicotine Replacement Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Tobacco control experts
Wednesday called on countries "to allow proven nicotine
replacement products to be more widely available through
relaxation of regulations governing the use of these products."
</P>
<P>
At the end of a three-day roundtable meeting, the experts,
including doctors, lawyers and sociologists, adopted a series of
economic and legal policy recommendations aimed at reducing the
human toll caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the existing smoking control policies focus
on prevention and cessation, but more attention is needed on
smoking reduction through alternative nicotine delivery systems
(ANDS).
</P>
<P>
They suggested new strategies which allow addicted smokers
access to safe nicotine products.
</P>
<P>
They also called for a comprehensive nicotine regulatory
approach that "gives the greatest relative advantage to the least
harmful products."
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held under the auspices of the United Nations
Focal Point on Tobacco or Health based at the U.N. Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD).

<HEADLINE> Sessional Paper on AIDS Passed at Kenyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The National Assembly of
Kenya has passed a Sessional Paper No. 4 of 1997 on AIDS in a bid
to help the government formulate strategies to curb the spread of
the disease over the next 15 years and beyond.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation today reported that the paper, among other
things, recommended that anyone wilfully infects another with the
deadly virus be held guilty of man-slaughter.
</P>
<P>
During the debate on the paper, two members of parliament
proposed that the AIDS scourge be declared a national disaster,
enabling the government to allocate more resources to combat the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Health Assistant Minister Basil Criticos told the parliament
that the government was determined to stop the spread of AIDS but
was constrained by slow attitude and behavior change toward
casual sex by the public.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed calls for isolation of AIDS victims, saying it
would not be possible to round up all the infected people.
</P>
<P>
Alego-Usonga MP Otieno Mak'Onyango asked the government to set
up an AIDS Control Fund to help minimize the spread of the
disease and support its victims.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the elevation of the AIDS research unit,
currently under Kenya Medical Research Institute, to a
fully-fledged body.
</P>
<P>
Karachuonyo MP Phoebe Asiyo appealed to the government to
subsidize drugs for complications arising from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The disease has already killed 230,000 Kenyans aged between 15
and 39 years and the AIDS deaths will rise to one million by the
year 2000 in the country with a population of 28 million.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate by the Regional Director of the Aids
Control and Prevention Project, more than 1.7 million Kenyans
might be infected with the AIDS virus by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 World Population Data Sheet has ranked Kenya among 30
countries in the world whose future population projections will
be affected adversely by the HIV/AIDS scourge.

<HEADLINE> Three Mine-workers Injured in Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Three mine workers from
the East Driefontein Gold Mine were injured when a fairly strong
earthquake rocked the area in the small hours this morning, the
South African Press Association (SAPA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The effect of the tremor, measured at 4.2 on the Richter
scale, was felt in Johannesburg, more than 50 kilometers away
from the epicenter.
</P>
<P>
The three miners suffered head, leg and back injuries, but
they were in a stable condition at the Leslie Williams Mine
Hospital, SAPA quoted mine management spokesman Andrew Davidson
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The mine dismissed speculations that deep level mining had
caused the quake.
</P>
<P>
"The seismic monitoring station at West Driefontein determined
the epicenter at 3,300 meters below surface, which is almost a
kilometer below the deepest level workings of East Driefontein,"
Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
The injured were working 2,300 meters below ground level near
the mine's No. 4 sub-vertical shaft.
</P>
<P>
"A full investigation into the effects of the seismic incident
will take place. Damage was caused to the shaft and underground
installations, but possible production losses cannot be
quantified at this stage," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
No employees were missing as a result of the incident, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Demands Turkish Troop Pullback from North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today called on Turkey
to immediately withdraw its troops from northern Iraq and prevent
from repeating aggression of Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Iraqi government rejects
absolutely Turkey's excuse to defend its invasion of northern
Iraq, which run against international laws as well as the United
Nations charter.
</P>
<P>
"Pursuit of the rebels can not be the excuse for Turkey's
violation of Iraq's territorial integrity," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
This new aggression contradicts totally Turkey's earlier claims
that it adheres to the principle of respecting the sovereignty of
Iraqi territory, he added.
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 Turkish troops backed by more than 100 tanks
crossed into northern Iraq on September 22 to join the Turkish
forces there.
</P>
<P>
They were reinforcing in the attack on Turkey's fugitive
militants of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party, which has been
fighting for an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey
since 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
On May 14, some 50,000 Turkish troops entered northern Iraq in
a cross-border military operation against the Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military said on June 19 that it had pull out most
of its forces from northern Iraq, but never announced a complete
withdrawal from the area.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Mulls Privatization of SA Airways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- An interministerial
cabinet committee will decide on the process of privatizing South
African Airways (SAA) next month, the "Business Day" newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a spokesman for Public Enterprises Minister
Stella Sigcau as saying on Wednesday that no decision has been
made on the percentage stake for sale, but the committee will
decide on October 16.
</P>
<P>
However, Saki Macozoma, managing director of SAA's state-owned
parent group Transnet, said in London on Tuesday that the South
African government will probably sell 25 to 30 percent of SAA to
a strategic equity partner.
</P>
<P>
Several carriers have expressed interest in acquiring a stake
in SAA, including British Airway, Deutsche Lufthansa and Virgin
Atlantic, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Macozoma said the restructuring of the national flag carrier
is a priority as the country's privatization drive moves into the
transport sector.
</P>
<P>
He said Transnet and SAA are looking for a privatization
adviser for the sale, which might be completed next year. In the
interim, they have been using HSBC, the overall adviser on
restructuring state assets.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's privatization program, often attacked as too
slow, has picked up speed this year following the sale of a 30
percent stake in a telecom company, Telkom, to a U.S.-Malaysian
consortium.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the government sold 100 percent of a small
regional carrier, Sun Air, to a local consortium.
</P>
<P>
Plans are also advanced for the part privatization of the
Airports Company which operates Africa's busiest airport in
Johannesburg, along with airports in Cape Town and Durban and six
regional airports.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 30 million Nigerians are
at the risk of being blind unless onchocerciasis or river
blindness is effectively controlled, according to the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
About 10 million Nigerians are already afflicted with the
disease with 15,000 blind as a result, the New Nigerian reported

</P>
<P>
The official newspaper quoted UNICEF Project Officer Emmanuel
Gemade as saying that river blindness is a major cause of severe
blindness in northern Nigeria, while the southern population are
faced with the problem of skin impairment.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has received 4.6 million ivermectin tablets valued at
16.8 million U.S. Dollars for the control of the disease which it
has used to treat 2.7 million people.
</P>
<P>
The organization needs 1.9 million Dollars to push the
onchocerciasis control program in Nigeria to its peak by 1999
when foreign funding is expected to ease, Gemade said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, 17.6 million people the world over are
afflicted with river blindness and Africa has 99 percent of the
figure.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Forex Rating Outlook Downgraded to Negative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A leading credit rating
agency today downgraded Malaysia's long-term foreign currency
rating outlook from "stable" to "negative," dealing a fresh blow
to confidence in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-based Standard &AMP; Poor's said in a statement issued
here today that the negative outlook is based on the growing
possibility of a downgrade. It said the country's rapid credit
growth was "financing an unsustainable boom in investment," now at
more than 40 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The agency said that with the economy operating at capacity, it
would put pressure on the inflationary level.
</P>
<P>
It forecast Malaysia's current account deficit to exceed 6
percent of the GDP this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the rating agency, there was also likelihood that
bank asset quality would deteriorate significantly next year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from that, total credit to the private sector and public
enterprises -- a leading indicator of asset-quality problems -
will exceed 170 percent of the GDP in 1997, indicating very high
private-sector leverage, it added.
</P>
<P>
It warned that in particular, the financial sector's exposure
to the property market underscores the system's vulnerability to
slowing economic growth, adding that potentially large loan losses
in the financial sector would weaken the government's financial
position as well as the economy's medium-term growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's future rating hinges on effective steps, starting
with the 1998 budget proposal to be presented in October, to slow
excessive demand, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today urged
international environmental groups to come forward to help put out
the forest fires in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said today
this was the time for the groups who have been vocal about forest
conservation to prove that they really love the environment.
</P>
<P>
If they do not respond it will show that they have vested
interests when they cry out for preserving the environment, he
told reporters here after opening a workshop for companies
investing in the forestry sector abroad.
</P>
<P>
The minister said so far not a single environmental group had
come forward to help douse the fires which have been alleged the
main cause for the current haze in this region.
</P>
<P>
The fires got out of control in Sumatra and kalimantan due to
the current dry climate and non-enforcement of the laws relating
to open burning by the Indonesian authorities, Lim said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has been seriously affected by the haze with the air
quality for the whole country having deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
In Sarawak where a state of haze emergency was declared a week
ago, the Air Pollutant Index in the state capital Kuching today
remained at the hazardous level, according to a statement by the
Department of Environment.
</P>
<P>
The air quality in 14 other areas including Kuala Lumpur today
remained at the unhealthy level.

<HEADLINE> Former Prime Minister Rao to Face Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian former prime
minister P.V. Narasimha Rao will face trial in the multi-crore MPs
bribery case as a Delhi court formally framed charges against him
today.
</P>
<P>
19 of his cabinet colleagues and several former MPs will face
the same trial early in November this year.
</P>
<P>
Special judge Ajit Bharihoke, who had passed an order on May 6
this year for framing of the charges against the accused, today
completed the formality after the plea of the accused was rejected
by the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court to stay the
proceedings in the Trial Court.
</P>
<P>
Bharihoke in his May 6 order said that there were sufficient
prima facie evidence against the accused persons to proceed with
the trial for allegedly paying and accepting bribes to defeat the
no-confidence motion against the Rao government in July 1993.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French Minister of Finance and Economy Dominique
Strauss-Kahn Wednesday presented the 1998 budget which conforms to
the requirement for France's joining the European monetary union.
</P>
<P>
-- The announcement to start a unilateral ceasefire on October
1 by the Islamic Salvation Army, armed wing of the Islamic
Salvation Front of Algeria, could be a victory for Algeria's
military, although it is highly questionable whether it will end
the violence.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, signed on September 21, was not made public
by the Algerian government until a big massacre of civilians took
place this week near Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac has expressed concern over the
reduction of defense spending in the 1998 budget presented by the
Socialist government, which will stop laying off state employees,

<HEADLINE> Israel Wants No Change of Joint Exercises Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel does not want a change
of the date of the planned mid-November joint naval exercises with
the United States and Turkey, an Israeli embassy spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Nissan Amdor told Xinhua on telephone that the three sides are
trying to fix a final date for the military exercises which had
been projected in eastern Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Local English newspaper Turkish Daily News today quoted
U.S. military sources in Pentagon as saying that the planned
Israeli-Turkish-U.S. joint naval exercises had been postponed
until next January.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the reason behind the delay was that
another joint military exercises between the United States and
Israel would be held at the same time and the same area.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that Israel has received such reports, Amdor said
that the Israeli government has never asked for a postponement of
the three-way war games.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, a senior official from
the Turkish Foreign Ministry, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that they have not reached any official consensus
on the postponement yet.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has not made any statements
regarding the issue so far, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy here was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Turkish-U.S. joint naval war games were scheduled
to be held on November 16 off the Israeli coast in the eastern
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The planned maneuvers had prompted severe criticism from some
Arab nations, which accused Turkey, a Muslim-dominant country, of
betraying the interests of the Muslim world by siding with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government, however, has been trying to placate its
Arab neighbors by assuring them the exercises are not directed
against any other country but merely "a search-and-rescue
operation" devoid of any strategic importance.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Discuss Jiang Zemin's Report  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
pledged to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory and
strive for the basic accomplishment of modernization by the middle
of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The scientists made their pledge today during a meeting on the
report Jiang delivered during the 15th National Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was jointly sponsored by six science and technology
departments, including the State Science and Technology Commission
(SSTC), the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for
National Defense, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and the
Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE).
</P>
<P>
SSTC Minister Song Jian said the national Party congress
introduced the principle that the promotion of science and
technology is a key factor for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's report pointed to the fact that Chinese scientists and
technicians, as well as people from the circle have learned their
responsibilities and historic mission, Song said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Daheng, an academician with both the CAS and the CAE, said
Jiang's report outlined the action program for China's science and
technology development.
</P>
<P>
The most important task is to adhere to the Party's leadership
and following the correct road for building socialism, and the
Party has clearly defined the correct path, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Jiang Zemin has paid great attention
to basic scientific research which is regarded as the theoretical
basis for solving wide-ranging problems.
</P>
<P>
Ba Denian, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences
said that the study of Jiang's report has helped emancipated the
minds of scientists.

<P>
Wang Xuan, director of the Beijing University Computer Research
Institute, voiced his total agreement with Jiang's contention that
realizing diversified forms of public ownership is fully possible.
</P>
<P>
He said that further understanding public ownership will
promote efforts to upgrade state-owned enterprises and
hasten the establishment of modern regulations for enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Beijing University Founder Group Corp., a
share-holding company attached to Beijing University, has been
listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 1995, and that its
market value has soared from one billion yuan (12 million US
dollars) to over five billion yuan (about 600 million dollars) in
less then two years.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Beijing University is the major
stockholder in the company, with substantial shares also held by
businessmen from Japan, the United States and Great Britain.
</P>

<P>
MANILA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Health Secretary
Carmencita Reodica today directed all hospitals in the country to
be well prepared for possible cases as aftermath of the haze
brought about by the forest fire in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The haze, expected to worsen air pollution particularly in
Metro Manila, has covered southern and western Philippines
including Palawan, Zamboanga, Davao, General Santos and other
parts of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals and health offices should have enough stocks of
oxygen and bronchodilators to meet the demands of increasing
incidence of upper respiratory tract infection, Reodica said.
</P>
<P>
They were also told to monitor and report to the office of the
Health Secretary any unusual increase in the number of the said
ailments.
</P>
<P>
The health chief also directed hospitals and offices to conduct
information campaign as to how the public avoid the health hazard
of the haze especially the high risk individuals such as the very
young, elderly and asthmatics.
</P>
<P>
Reodica earlier asked the people living in areas severely
affected by smoke haze to stay indoors as much as possible and to
wear dust masks or wet cloth when necessary or when going outside
the house.
</P>
<P>
Motorists are also told to exercise extreme caution whenever on
the road to prevent accidents.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos Wednesday mobilized government agencies to deal
with the haze and offered the Philippines' help for its more
seriously affected Southeast Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Environment and Natural Resources said the
haze could affect Metro Manila in two days. The sky in Manila was
generally overcast in recent days.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Canal Meets Requirements of Water Flow, Navigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The open-cut canal built near
the Three Gorges after damming of the main stream of Yangtze River
has met requirements for water flow and navigation, according to
local sources.
</P>
<P>
Beginning on October 1, all ships will sail on the man-made
canal instead of the main river course of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
China plans to cut off the main stream of the Yangtze from
early November to construct a gigantic water control dam at the
Three Gorges site, located on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze. An open-cut canal and a temporary ship lock have been
built to facilitate smooth navigation on Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the southern bank of the river, the canal is 3,726
m long, 350 m wide at the bed and 58 m deep. Both its width and
height exceed the famed Suez and Panama canals, according to
experts.
</P>
<P>
Ships will be able to sail safely on the canal when water flow
speed falls within 20,000 cu m per second. Under this condition,
the canal, which was filled with water on May 1, will be open for
safe navigation for an average of 272 days in a year.
</P>
<P>
The temporary ship lock and lift attached to the northern bank
of the Yangtze will be put into service for five months of the
year when flood season begins and the water flow speed is higher
than 20,000 cu m per second.
</P>
<P>
The ship lock, which is capable of hauling a fleet with 3,000
DWT (dead weight tonnages) at a time, is now under construction
and will be operational next April.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia today offered to
help Indonesia tackle its disastrous forest fires which have
blanketed much of Southeast Asia in a thick haze.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told the Australian
Parliament that he had instructed Australia's Ambassador in
Jakarta John McCarthy to make a detailed assessment of the
situation and report on the kinds of help Australia could deliver.

<P>
Firefighters from Victoria are on stand-by to fly to the region

<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Beijing University, one of

Xiaoping Theory for its four-year students.

Zhao Cunsheng, vice-secretary of the CPC committee of the

Theory.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy: Oslo Dream Turning Into Nightmare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The outgoing U.S.
Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk said that the Oslo peace process
which began four years now seems to be turning into a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspapers today, Indyk, addressing the
Israeli Council for Peace and Security here Wednesday, said "it
is clear to all of us that something is fundamentally wrong here."
</P>
<P>
He said the peace process has deeply disappointed both Israel
and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), adding unilateral
actions taken by the Israeli government and the terror attacks
against Israelis are the reasons.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time of the U.S. envoy to openly criticize
the Israeli government for harming the Oslo peace process. His
remarks make big headline stories in local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Indyk said to blame for the current crisis of the Middle East
peace process was not the issue, but rather "how to get out of
this mess." He called on both Israel and PNA to abandon a
"zero-sum game mentality" in which one side's loss is the other
side's gain.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
urging for PNA President Yasser Arafat to make "100 percent
effort" in fighting terror, and pledged continued American support
for the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng's Warnings "Timely": Indian Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- India's economic daily The
Observer in an editorial today praised Chinese Premier Li Peng's
speech Tuesday at the opening ceremony of the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meeting held in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng's warnings to the industrial countries against their
unhelpful attitude toward the developing countries have been
"timely", the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Asia, as Li Peng pointed out, is the growth center of the world
and the industrial countries should not treat it lightly, the
editorial said, adding that Li Peng has sought active
participations of the rich in the development of the poor and has
advised the industrial countries to keep their markets open.
</P>
<P>
There is no room for threats and trade sanctions by the rich
against any poor country on pretexts like dumping when the lives
of millions are involved in the export industries of the poor
nations, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that Li Peng has pointed out that "the
prosperity and affluence of a small number of countries on the
basis of poverty and backwardness of the majority cannot last."
</P>
<P>
"Li Peng is also right that under no circumstances should the
industrial world impose its ideology or its social system on
others," it concluded.

the first all-race elections in South Africa in 1994, will get 20
to 30 percent of the votes in the 1999 general elections, PAC
President Stanley Mogoba predicted on Wednesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> South Korea Slams Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling New Korea
Party (NKP) has expressed deep concern over the modified
Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines, saying that it has
paved the way for Japan to become a military power.
</P>
<P>
Deputy spokesman for the NKP said Wednesday the fact that the
guidelines had expanded the scope of Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation to cover the whole of the Asia-Pacific region would
invite rebuff from those neighboring countries subjected to
Japanese aggression during World War Two.
</P>
<P>
He said the guidelines was a link in the U.S. global strategy
of defense, but with the development of the situation in this
region, it might turn out to be the cause of new hegemonism of the
two countries and Japan's military expansion.
</P>
<P>
He said South Korea is following the developments very closely.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Oriental Daily News also published a commentary
today, saying that Japan and the U.S. must take into account the
concern of the neighboring countries over the guidelines, and that
Japan must not use the guidelines as a pretext to embark on the
road of militarism.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Promises To Bolster Settlements In West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said last night that his government will
continue to bolster the Jewish settlement in the west bank,
Israeli Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of the
renewal of Jewish settlements last night in Gush Etzion, south of
Jerusalem, Netanyahu said that his government plans to build an
additional 300 housing units for Jewish Settlers in Efrat, near
Gush Etzion.
</P>
<P>
He said the area of Gush Etzion and Efrat is an inseparable
part of Jerusalem and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's announcement of the new housing settlement plan in
the West Bank was really a surprise to all and will surely cause
more confrontation between Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Radio today quoted U.S. State Department spokesman
James Rubin as saying that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright does not regard this plan as consistent with that kind
of climate for negotiations in the Middle East that she hopes
to create.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that Netanyahu even did not mention that plan
during his telephone call early in the day with Albright and she
wanted to see the details before making a final decision.
</P>
<P>
Albright made a mediation trip to the region earlier this month
in a bid to revive the deadlocked Middle East peace process. But
she failed to persuade the Israelis to stop building Jewish
settlements in Arab East Jerusalem. Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks stalled in March when Israeli government began building Har
Homa settlement which sparked Palestinian and Arab protests and
violence.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) has given its support for Cambodian Co-Prime
Ministers Ung Huot and Hun Sen at the United Nations General
Assembly in New York, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile ASEAN foreign ministers in New York plan to meet
ousted Co-Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who claimed the
vacant seat for Cambodia at the U.N. General Assembly, the Bangkok
Post quoted Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn as saying.
</P>
<P>
The decisions were made as ASEAN foreign ministers met on the
sidelines of the 52nd U.N. General Assembly session in New York to
discuss the Cambodia issue, Prachuab told the newspaper in a
telephone interview from overseas.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's support for Hun Sen and Ung Huot was promoted by
Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk's approval for them to represent
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China National Day Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Culture has
announced that a number of highly rated performances will be
staged in Beijing, the Chinese capital, to celebrate National Day
on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has organized a major evening theatrical
performance in the Great Hall of the People to praise the
country's flourishing economy and look forward to continuing
prosperity in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Major art troupes will stage ballet, drama, Western Opera and
traditional Beijing Opera performances during the
festival. Various repertories will highlight the 15th National
Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and the return of Hong
Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
National Day will provide local artists with a rare opportunity
to exhibit their talents in the Chinese capital. One of the most
popular events is expected to be a Shanghai Children's Theater
production of a drama about Deng Xiaoping's childhood.
</P>
<P>
"The Qiong Flower Fairy", the most expensive puppet show in the
country with production costs of one million yuan (120,000 US
dollars), will premiere in Beijing. The artists from Yangzhou,
China's "Home of Puppets" in east China's Jiangsu province, have
prepared the show for four years.
</P>
<P>
A number of enthusiastic artists from the eastern province of
Shangdong will stage a local Lu Opera entitled "The Beijing Opera
for Shandong Natives". The troupe expressed the hope that staging
the opera during National Day holiday will promote a nationwide
understanding of Shangdong culture.
</P>
<P>
Artists from Russia, Germany and Israel will also stage
performances to further enhance the festive air in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Jiang Zemin's remarks that socialist modernization should
include both a flourishing economy and flourishing culture have
greatly inspired Chinese artists who believe that cultural
undertakings will witness further prosperity," according to a
ministry spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> Least Developed Countries' Average Growth Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic
product (GDP) growth rates in the world's 48 least developed
countries (LDCS) averaged 4.7 percent in 1996, compared with 5.2
percent in 1995, a latest U.N. report has revealed.
</P>
<P>
According to "The Least Developed Countries 1997 Report"
published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) here, the slight decline of LDCS' GDP growth
in 1996 is due mainly to a slow down in the average growth rate
of the 33 African LDCS, from 5.4 percent in 1995 to 4.6 percent
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It also said growth in 1996 in the LDCS group was mitigated by
the fall of several key commodity prices during the last three
quarters, and, more broadly, the continuing steep decline in aid
flows to LDCS.
</P>
<P>
Despite some successful attempts at increasing their export
and diversification of their export commodities, the report
pointed out, many LDCS continue to be highly vulnerable to
commodity price movements in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Most of African LDCS were affected by declines in tropical
food prices (15 percent), minerals (13 percent), coffee (26
percent) and copper (20 percent), according to the report.
</P>
<P>
African LDCS remained over four percent economic growth last
year as a result of their economic policy reforms, while the
average growth rate of Asian and Pacific island LDCS rose
slightly from 4.6 percent in 1995 to 4.8 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report believed that the Asian LDCS have benefited from
their location in the world's fastest-growing region, saying that
the recent dynamism of the large Asian economies, in particular
India and China, has spilled over into neighboring Asian LDCS
such as Laos, Burma, Cambodia and Nepal, etc.
</P>
<P>
The report foresaw that the growth in the world economy is
expected to remain steady during 1997 and the current sharp rise
in tropical beverage prices will benefit many LDCS.
</P>
<P>
"There is reason to be cautiously optimistic about the
prospects for the majority of the LDCS," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the future of African LDCS is "looking decidely
brighter" because export production has been increased, inflation
rates reduced and reform constantly well implemented in many
African LDCS since the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
However, the report stressed that peace and stability is the
condition of economic development in all LDCS since civil wars
and coups had sent one quarter of LDCS' economies to drop at a
rate of over 20 percent during the period between 1980 and 1994.

</P>
<P>
The new property is one of the 54 hotels and resorts of

</P>
<P>
At a cost of 120 million US dollars, the Beijing International

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Teachers Committed to October 1 Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya National Union of
Teachers (KNUT) has issued a seven-day strike notice, saying that
teachers all over the country would down their tools on October 1
if their demands were not met by September 30.
</P>
<P>
The new notice sent to Teachers Service Commission (TSC) on
Wednesday followed the expiry of a 21-day notice of strike issued
on September 3.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to TSC, KNUT Secretary-General Ambrose Adongu said
that the strike would go on if the recommendations of the
Teachers Service Review Commission (TSRC) will not have been
implemented in full at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The TSRC recommended a salary increase ranging between 150 and
200 percent for the teachers in the east African country and the
minimum pay should be increased from 1,880 Kenyan Shillings
(about 30 U.S. Dollars) per month to 5,640 Shillings (some 90
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the Kenyan government agreed to give the teachers an
increment ranging between 10 and 28 percent, which the teachers
union rejected, terming it as "an insult".
</P>
<P>
Most KNUT branches in the country have supported the national
strike call and have vowed to mobilize all teachers to down their
tools from October 1.
</P>
<P>
The KNUT said in the fresh notice that the strike action would
continue until a full settlement was reached on their demands.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday the union met with the officials from the education
and labor ministries to sort out the industry dispute and
Minister of Education Joseph Kamotho is expected to meet KNUT and
TSC officials to discuss this issue further.
</P>
<P>
Kamotho said earlier this month that "surely it is not
realistic for anybody to ask for a 200 percent hike," adding that
workable solution should be found to avert the planned national
strike.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Tries to Ease Tourism Crisis on Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Three Kenyan cabinet
ministers and Police Commissioner Duncan Wachira are to arrive at
the coastal city of Mombasa today in an attempt to stem the sharp
drop in tourist bookings which threatens to destroy the industry.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, Messrs Protus Momanyi, Katana Ngala and Jackson
Kalweo, are respectively responsible for tourism, lands and
settlement, as well as internal security, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to meet stakeholders in tourism on the
coast, which attracted about 70 percent of the visitors touring
the east African country last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Tour operators will use the meeting to request the government
for a six-month moratorium on all tax collection including
value-added taxes, telephone and electric charges.
</P>
<P>
The tax waiver is expected to allow the industry to survive
and maintain jobs for Kenyans. Many hotels have laid off staff.
</P>
<P>
The violence at the coast, which has claimed more than 60
lives since August 13, has led to massive cancellation of
bookings in the overseas market.
</P>
<P>
As a result, coastal hotels suffered an unprecedented drop in
bed occupancy rates. Before the violence started, the occupancy
rate averaged a peak of 80-90 percent. This dropped to a record
low of 0-25 percent this week.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Daniel arap Moi gave officials a dressing
down over their ineptness in pacifying the industry's players who
have been extremely anxious over the long-running violence at the
Coast.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Kenya Tourist Board Peter Mbugua has also
warned that if the industry collapsed, 150,000 jobs would be lost
together with 25.6 billion Shillings (413 million U.S. Dollars)
lost in foreign exchange earnings.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Enhances Educational Exchanges With Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign teachers are often
seen at many universities, middle and primary schools, and
kindergartens in south China's Hainan Province. Even some family
tutors are from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, however, foreign teachers were a rarity
on this island.
</P>
<P>
"Opening up in education is just as important for the growth of
the province as in the economy," said Yuan Lingnan, an official
with the provincial educational department of Hainan, China's
largest special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
Yuan's department has put information about their programs on
the Internet, so as to maintain close ties with overseas.
</P>
<P>
The province received more than 30 visiting scholars from
Germany, Canada and Britain, and introduced nearly 50 foreign
teachers during the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
"However, this still cannot meet the schools' demand," Yuan
said.
</P>
<P>
About 17 schools in Hainan have hired foreign teachers. Some of
the foreign professors even move their families to this scenic
subtropical island.
</P>
<P>
Five British universities signed cooperative agreements with
the province in April. Hainan University, Foreign Trade School and
Farming Machinery School have all had exchanges with institutes
from Canada, the US, Britain and Japan over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Youngsters are the biggest beneficiary of the province's
educational opening up. The coming of foreign teachers has
upgraded schools' educational quality, and raised students'
enthusiasm for learning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, students have had more opportunities to study
abroad. Since 1991, the province has sent nearly 200 students to
Japan to study automobile-manufacturing, food processing and
electronics. And more than 70 students have been sent to the US,
Britain and Singapore for further education this year.

<HEADLINE> New Technique Preserves RH Negative Blood Longer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Blood Center has
introduced a new international technique which can help prolong
the preservation period of RH negative blood from 21 days to two
years.
</P>
<P>
RH negative is a rare blood type. Only three to five people per
thousand have this type of blood. Patients with RH negative blood
should receive the same during transfusions, because it has a
special antigen.
</P>
<P>
Since hospitals had difficulty preserving the blood for a long
period, they usually asked RH negative blood donors to give blood
for storage in case of emergency, or made urgent pleas through the
mass media for suitable donors.
</P>
<P>
Such ways of collecting blood are both unpredictable and
inadequate for Shanghai's need of 150,000 ml of RH negative blood
a year, doctors at the center said.
</P>
<P>
The new technique may help ease the difficulty in obtaining
blood for urgently-needed transfusions and forge closer links
between blood donation and clinical use of blood, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Chittagong EPZ Thrives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- With low wages and other
facilities, Bangladesh's Chittagong Export Processing Zone (EPZ)
is on the move, creating opportunities for new units and
employment, the Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The workforce in the zone may rise to 80,000 in the next four
years, while the number of factories is expected to reach 150,
officials from the zone predicted.
</P>
<P>
The zone created 7,000 new jobs in 1996-97, bringing the total
number to 41,000, the officials stated, adding that some 66
percent of them are female.
</P>
<P>
There are now 76 factories in operation, while seven more are
expected to go into production by December this year.
</P>
<P>
"The main attraction for the foreign investors is cheap labor
and other facilities," a zone official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
An apprentice worker gets 22 U.S. dollars a month, unskilled
worker 38 dollars, semi-skilled 45 dollars, and skilled 63
dollars, according to official reports.
</P>
<P>
Trade union activities are completely banned in the zone,
according to the rule governing the zone.
</P>
<P>
Adding to it all are such incentives as a ten-year tax holiday
and duty-free import and export facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong export processing zone became operational in
1983. So far, 343 plots have been developed, of which 55 percent
have already been allotted for factories, the official stated.
</P>
<P>
The zone has attracted investors from various countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
The products manufactured by the zone include electronics,
garments, textiles, toys, computers discs, leather products, caps
and bicycles.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are two export processing zones in
Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Opposition Enforces Countrywide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) today observed a dawn-to-dusk general
strike across the country in protest against government repression
on political rivals and ban on street rallies and processions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, the opposition on the same plea enforced a
12-hour general strike in the capital of Dhaka, which was observed
peacefully barring some stray incidents.
</P>
<P>
However, with the ruling Awami (people's) League's decision to
show its strength on the streets today, the political situation
may worsen further, according to local observers.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Wednesday, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia demanded
withdrawal of all "false" cases and release of all arrested
leaders and workers of the BNP.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister also alleged that the government
broke all pledges given to the people while it was busy protecting
the interests of their masters who helped them assume power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling party's workers have been instructed by
the party high command "not to leave city streets to others for
unruly activists."
</P>
<P>
At least 117 persons were injured and many others arrested on
Wednesday when the pro and anti-strike activists clashed in
different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Today's general strike will be the fifth by the opposition BNP
against the 15-month-old government of Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina, the arch rival of Khaleda Zia for the last six years.

<HEADLINE> African Coffee Losing Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- African coffee is
steadily losing its competitive edge to Latin American and
Southeast Asian rivals, according to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
Africa's lack of competitiveness has considerably eroded its
share in world robusta's market over the past 20 years, dropping
from 78 to 44 percent, to the advantage of Latin American and
Southeast Asian growers, said a report published by the
International Cooperative Alliance regional office for eastern,
central and southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the sharp decline is historical in that
African growers no longer establish new plantings on fertile
virgin soil, adding that "since 40 percent of African plantations
date from before independence and have not been renewed in many
instances, land is exhausted."
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia, which is a new comer to coffee growing, has
new plantations producing heavy coffee yields. Latin America has
been through both phases and is now investing in modernization of
its coffee-growing by using improved varieties and advanced
growing techniques including pruning and use of fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, many African countries have used coffee income on
parastatal infrastructure to manage coffee exports while at the
same time allowing middlemen a virtual monopoly.
</P>
<P>
"This has left growers at a disadvantage and without
incentive. As as result, coffee harvests of the boom years of the
1970s brought very little benefit either from increased income or
from state involvement," the report said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Says World Bank-IMF Meetings Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus said here today
that the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the IMF, which
closed here this morning, were "quite fruitful."
</P>
<P>
"I am very satisfactory with the meetings" and "we are ready to
further international cooperation" in the financial sphere, said
Camdessus at a news conference in the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center following the closing session of the World
Bank-IMF Annual Meetings.
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, "we have had extensive
thought-provoking discussions about the challenges of global
markets," he said. "We have made substantial headway in equipping
the IMF to help its members meet these challenges."
</P>
<P>
"Recent developments in several Southeast Asian markets have,
of course, been ever present in our minds," he added.
</P>
<P>
As to the results of the meetings, Camdessus said he had
outlined "four points and a half," without specifying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing session, he said that many participants
of the meeting had expressed their conviction that global opening
and integration offer the only path to greater global prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He said the time had come to give the IMF a mandate to promote
the orderly liberalization of capital movements, and a solid
multilateral system for surveillance and financial support is
necessary to be established.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the necessity of anti-corruption and good
governance, adding that the IMF must be ready to respond with its
financial support, if its member-countries need. He praised
Africa's progress in the economic sphere and hopes the Africans
"do more and better."
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief also thanked the Chinese government and the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
for good preparation and organization of the World Bank-IMF Annual
Meetings.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the closing session, World Bank President James
Wolfensohn told a news conference earlier this morning that the
Annual Meetings were "remarkably successful."
</P>
<P>
"We were able to point out the importance of having these
meetings here in Hong Kong, both to demonstrate the remarkable
achievements of Asia, many discussions about what other parts of
the world could learn from the Asian experience and then, of
course, the reality of the currency situation which reminded us
all that there are some problems that occur from time to time in a
growth pattern and that we have to be ready to deal with them," he
said.

BRASILIA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Beto scored two goals as
Gremio of Brazil rallied to draw with Colombia's Atletico Nacional
2-2 in a Group 4 match of the Supercopa soccer tournament in Porto
Alegre on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Nacional jumped to a 2-0 lead on goals by Luis Carlos Perea in
the 30th minute and Carlos Castro in the 41st minute.
</P>
<P>
But just when it looked like Gremio would end the first half
without a goal, Beto scored the first goal in the 45th minute.
</P>
<P>
Gremio seemed sluggish through much of the second half. Even
after Nacional's Dumas Rueda was expelled in the 62nd minute, the
Colombians managed to provide tight coverage.
</P>
<P>
But Beto added second goal in the 79th minute to tie the match.
</P>
<P>
In Group 4, both teams remain without a win. Nacional has a
record of two losses and a tie, while Gremio has tied its three
matches.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Plans to Boost Electricity Generating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to boost its electricity generating capacity by
constructing more power plants to meet the increasing demand in
the country, according to an official source here.
</P>
<P>
The government has initially planned to construct plants that
will have the capacity to produce an additional 12,522 megawatts
of electricity by the end of the sixth five-year development plan
(1994-1999), the Indonesian National Development Information
Office said in its latest publication on Indonesia's economic
condition.
</P>
<P>
"Of the total, plants with the ability to generate 9,522
megawatts will be constructed by State Electric Company (PLN) and
another 3,000 megawatts will be provided through private power
operation," said the publication.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia previously relied on oil in the total energy mix, as
reflected by the fact that oil accounted for 86 percent of
installed power capacity in 1984.
</P>
<P>
But today, the oil share is around 40 percent, and is destined
to further drop to around 31 percent by the sixth five year plan,
the office said, adding that the share of coal in the energy mix
at the same time continued to increase.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Thai
foreign ministers today met at U.N. headquarters here and
exchanged views on the economic and political situation in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen, also China's vice premier, told his Thai
counterpart, Prachuab Chaiyasarn, that China, as one of Thailand's
friendly neighbors, is closely watching the financial disturbances
in the Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that countries in that region, including
Thailand, will overcome the difficulties and get their economies
back on a normal track.
</P>
<P>
Prachuab briefed Qian on the efforts being made by the Thai
government to stablize the economy and restore economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people, who, he
said, had extended their sympathy and help to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
On the Cambodian situation, Qian said Cambodia's internal
affairs should be handled independently by the Cambodian people.
</P>
<P>
The general election in the country should be carried out in a
just and smooth manner and on schedule, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that different parties would abide by the
spirit of democratic and peaceful solutions advocated by King
Norodom Sihanouk and seek an early restoration of peace.
</P>
<P>
He also showed his appreciation for the efforts made by the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in seeking
solutions to the Cambodia issue.
</P>
<P>
On regional security, Qian said that China encourages the
increased use of dialogue to promote mutual understanding and
establish mutual trust, which will eventually lead to regional
security.
</P>
<P>
The choice of a military alliance will only achieve the
opposite results, Qian added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The 52nd Annual Meetings of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) closed
here today, with good organization work of the Chinese government
and the authorities of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) highly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing session, World Bank President James
Wolfensohn first thanked China and the HKSAR for the environment
and hospitality they have provided.
</P>
<P>
He described the meeting as one related to poverty, to the
"challenge of inclusion".
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is a problem not only for poor countries, but for all
of us," he noted. He urged member countries to address such
fundamental issues as education, health, social development,
environment and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Let's not wait, waiting doesn't help. Let's try to focus on
the issues now," he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank president summed up the topics widely discussed
at the meetings, including the recent financial crisis in East
Asia, involvement of the private sector and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the IMF Michel Camdessus in his concluding
remarks spoke highly of "the excellent facilities our hosts have
provided us and the way they have organized everything so
splendidly."
</P>
<P>
"During the past few days, we have had extensive,
thought-provoking discussions about the challenges of global
markets. And we have made substantial headway in equipping the IMF
to help its members meet these challenge," he said.
</P>
<P>
Four major themes emerged from the "fruitful" meeting, he noted.
</P>
<P>
First, the conviction has been expressed that global opening
and integration offer the only path to greater global prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Second, it is reconfirmed that time has come to give the Fund a
mandate to promote the orderly liberalization of capital
movements, and thereby add a new chapter to the Bretton Woods
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The third is the vital importance that is attached to good
governance in all its dimensions.
</P>
<P>
And finally, members have emphasized that when problems do
emerge, as surely they will continue to do, the Fund must be ready
to respond with its financial support.
</P>
<P>
At around 10:40 a.m. Chairman of the Annual Meetings Mohammed
K. Khirbash, who is also governor from the United Arab Emirates,
announced the meetings adjourned.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Poverty Eradication Succeeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's poverty
alleviation effort is on track, as evidenced by the fact that the
number of poor families in the archipelago is continually on the
decline, according to a census issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The census conducted recently by the government on Indonesia's
43 million families showed that only 19.41 percent are considered
poor -- a drop of 23.38 percent compared with the 41 million
families polled last year.
</P>
<P>
A family is considered poor if it is unable to meet its basic
food, clothing and housing needs, said the census.
</P>
<P>
Since the first Five-Year Development Plan (1969-1974),
Indonesia has continually boosted development with an emphasis on
the improvement of people's welfare and the attainment of high
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Under a 1993 presidential decree, the government provided each
of the 22,000 backward villages in the country with interest-free
loans totaling 20 million rupiah (6,600 U.S. dollars) per year as
working capital for a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto issued another decree in 1996 to speed up
the poverty alleviation effort through the so-called prosperous
family movement program.
</P>
<P>
Through its poverty alleviation program, Indonesia has been
successful in slashing the number of poor people from 25.9 million
(13.6 percent of the total population) in 1993 to 22.5 million (11
percent) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government hoped that no Indonesian will live in poverty by
the end of the Seventh Five-Year Development Plan (1999-2004).

<HEADLINE> Massive Cheating in Italian Disabled Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one in every four people
receiving a government subsidy for the disabled in Italy is doing
so by pretending to be a handicapped person, the Italian Ministry
of the Treasury said after a national survey.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's own doctors were dispatched throughout the
country to conduct the survey. By the end of June, they had
administered health examinations to more than 71,000 reportedly
disabled people.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, the doctors found that about 24 percent of these
people, or 17,000 of them, were not handicapped. Their subsidies
have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
The survey is part of the government's strategy to cut the
financial deficit.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money saved from discontinuing the subsidies
following the survey is estimated to be about 200 billion lire
(about 110 million U.S. dollars); so the ministry has decided to
continue the health check.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry has also begun to conduct another
national survey on the use of government vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: More Countries Offer to Fight Fire in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- More countries are now
offering help to Indonesia in fighting forest fires raging in
Kalimantan, Sumatra and other places in the country, official
sources from the Ministry of Forestry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The forest fires, which started in mid August, have now caused
choking smoke to begin engulfing areas as distant as the popular
Thai resort of Phuket and the Philippine capital of Manila.
Malaysia and Singapore were affected by the haze of forest fires
in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Japan donated 300 sets of jet shooters and water
pumps, and is considering dispatching an emergency relief and
forest fire expert team to help fight fires in the two islands
(Sumatra and Kalimantan), the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysia also decided to send air force transport
planes to water-bomb forest fires and dispatch extra personnel to
reinforce 1,200 fire fighters dispatched on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos on Wednesday ordered a
government mobilization to tackle the smoke from forest fires and
asked Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon to meet his counterparts
from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei to determine what
they can do to settle the problems.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Forest Minister Djamaludin Suryohadikusumo claimed
Wednesday that fire fighters deployed to put out the blaze should
soon have the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
The ministry deployed 8,437 fire fighters divided into 560
teams in 17 provinces to handle the fires in forest concession
areas and industrial timber estates, he said.
</P>
<P>
With their expertise backed by various equipment, the fire
fighters could keep the fire under control, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also reportedly set aside 1.07 million US
dollars to handle the forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Data showed that until September 19, more than 400,000 hectares
of forest areas had been destroyed in the fires since mid August.
More than one hundred plantation firms in the country were accused
of using fire in land clearing which was believed to be the major
cause of the widespread fires.
</P>
<P>
The smog has put 20 million people in danger of respiratory
problems in the region. It has left two dead in Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
The smog has already halted air traffic, causing 800 flight
delays and at least seven boat collisions on central Kalimantan's
Mahakam river in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tourism official Wuryastuti Sunarto said Wednesday
the Tourism Promotion Board was already predicting that Indonesia
would fall short of its 1997 tourism target of 5.7 million foreign
visitors as a result of the haze.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and French
foreign ministers held talks here today on bilateral relations
between their two countries during a meeting at the United Nations
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen, also Chinese vice premier, said that during the
May visit to China by French President Jacques Chirac's, leaders
of the two countries decided to establish partnership links that
would be beneficial to both countries in the 21st century. The
newly formed French government reaffirmed that France would
continue to engage in fulfilling this target, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that as the world grows in diversification, it is of
mutual interest and significant to the world for the two countries
to set up such a partnership, especially since China and France
are permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that because of frequent visits by the leaders of the
two countries, bilateral relations are growing. Cooperation in
economics, trade, science and culture has been very
successful.
</P>
<P>
Qian also said he hoped that China and the European Union could
work together equally and with mutual respect in joint efforts to
carry out more exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine agreed
on Qian's view of the world situation, saying France and China
should strengthen their ties in the changing world. He emphasized
that the French government will continue to carry out its goodwill
policy towards China and place the development of a well-rounded
partnership with China in an especially important position.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Panama would derive a
great deal of benefit from establishing a diplomatic relationship
with China, a Panamanian economist said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Panama-American, a local newspaper,
Chairman of the National Research Center of the Panama University
Juan Jovane said that China occupies a decisive position nowadays
in the international community.
</P>
<P>
This can be demonstrated by China's economic growth and its
role as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, Jovane
said.
</P>
<P>
He said every country should accept the fact; otherwise there
is no way to discuss international relations.
</P>
<P>
Panama currently has no diplomatic relations with China. But
Jovane said China would play a crucial role in Panama's future
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics reveal that of the five billion
U.S. dollars worth of imports registered by the Colon Free Zone
during the first six months this year, 1.3 billion dollars were
from China's Hong Kong Special Administration Region.
</P>
<P>
Jovane also pointed out that it was unwise for some countries
to maintain "diplomatic relations" with Taiwan for merely
immediate interest.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Clark
Development Corporation has sealed off at least 12 danger spots at
the former US Air Force base, which were found to have varying
degrees of toxicity, local newspaper The Philippine Star reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Romeo David, president of the corporation, said that the Clark
risk areas have been cordoned off and covered with new topsoil and
plastic "to prevent dermal contact, ingestion and inhalation of
the contaminants" by humans.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Star Weston International, which conducted the
toxicity tests at the former Clark Air Base, identified three
sites as "potentially high risk", five as "medium risk" and four
as "low risk", the Star said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a former commanding officer of the US aircraft
carrier USS Midway and the Pacific-US Task Force expressed belief
that the Subic Bay Freeport, formerly a US naval base, might have
more serious levels of toxic waste contamination.
</P>
<P>
After the withdrawal of US military forces from the Philippine
territory in 1992, toxic waste and environmental damage were found
at the two former bases.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has requested the US to clean up
Subic and Clark, but so far has not received any reply from
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Asks for Meeting with Annan on UN Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen said today that he wants a talk with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the issue of his country's
U.N. seat before he could decide to go New York and attend the
on-going sessions of the 52nd General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"New York is still my goal, but I will go when the secretary-
general of the United Nations grants me a meeting" on Cambodia's
seat which the world body announced vacant last Friday, Hun Sen
said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian Foreign Ministry in a statement has accused the
the U.N. General Assembly of interfering in Cambodia's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's First Prime Minister Ung Huot left Sunday for New
York to press his government's case at the General Assembly. Hun
Sen would follow Ung Huot as planned originally.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen threatened that Cambodia might reject a U.N. role in
monitoring its general elections due on May 23, 1998 if its seat
in the General Assembly is kept vacant.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to give the U.N. a coordinating role in
overseeing the elections," he said. But "I do not see how the
United Nations can play this coordinating role since it has
decided to leave our seat empty. It should think if it wants to
play a certain role and work with us."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also said that Prince Norodom Ranariddh and former
Finance Minister Sam Rainsy were welcome to return to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said that he will ensure their safety if they choose to
return.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh is welcome to come back to Cambodia and
participate in the elections as he has not been charged in court,
he said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese meat market is
large and has great potential, and extensive international
cooperation is needed to push the meat industry to a new stage of
development, said a senior Chinese official Wednesday at the world
meat congress in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Meat production in China has grown faster than anywhere else
in the world. Both production and consumption in China make up
one-fourth of the world's total, with an annual output of 58
million tons last year, said He Jihai, vice-minister of internal
trade, at the special China topic session Wednesday afternoon.
The three-day World Meat Conference which will be closed today.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that projected growing demand and increased
rate of consumption in the future will mean great potential and
new opportunities for foreign capital in trade, processing and
technology cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The meat industry has been a major area of foreign investment
since economic reforms were launched, and the level of foreign
capital utilization has been improved," the vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that about 1,000 joint ventures or
solely foreign funded meat processing enterprises have been set up
around the country, involving more than 2,000 cooperation projects
with 200-odd Chinese companies being registered as meat export
businesses.
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the world meat conference, "Meat+Tec
China '97" opened at the World Trade Center in Beijing Wednesday.
The four-day specialized meat show for both the poultry and red
meat processing industries will provide Chinese meat processors
with a very good chance to communicate with such international
companies as Tetra-Laval Food, W.R. Grace, Unisono and Stork. More
than 20,000 specialists were expected to visit the show.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's Serb President
Biljana Plavsic and Serb member of the Bosnian presidency Momcilo
Krajisnik today agreed to stop bickering that would lead to the
split of Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The deal came as a result of the mediation of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, who met Plavsic and Krajisnik
earlier today to help end the current political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under their accord, Plavsic and Krajisnik agreed to take all
necessary steps to stop any conflicts that would threaten the
unity of Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to hold elections for the republic's parliament on
November 15, and for the presidency and the Serb member of the
three-man Bosnian presidency on December 17.
</P>
<P>
The current political crisis among the Bosnian Serb leadership
began in early July, when Plavsic dissolved the parliament despite
strong opposition from it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Plavsic's exposure of high-level corruption led to
further conflict with Bosnian Serb hard-liners, who expelled her
from the Serb Social Democratic Party and demanded her resignation
as president.

ROME, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Italy is threatened by a
phenomenon known as desertification as over a quarter of its
territory has the risk of being reduced to dry and barren lands.
</P>
<P>
Data released here today at a meeting show that 27 percent of
Italian territory is considered as risking desertification -- a
change of arable land into a desert from either natural causes or
human activity.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting, which was held in preparation for the first
world conference on desertification here next week, was.attended
by Italian Foreign Undersecretary Piero Fassino and Undersecretary
for Environment Valerio Calzolaio.
</P>
<P>
Calzolaio said that a plan of action for the Mediterranean
region will emerge from the United Nations conference to be held
from September 30 to October 10.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. figures, desertification causes an annual
revenue loss of 42 million U.S. dollars worldwide and affects 250
million people all over the world.
</P>
<P>
A billion more people are at risk, said Calzolaio.
</P>
<P>
In North America, desertification engulfs 74 percent of the
land while 73 percent of the African continent is threatened, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, Italy and Spain need to address the problem more
seriously and the risk of desertification in Asia and South
America is increasing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Italy has contributed 1,750 billion lire (one billion
U.S. dollars) to developing countries to fund anti-desertification
projects, said Calzolaio.
</P>
<P>
Next week's conference will be attended by more than a thousand
delegates including heads of state, ministers and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The conference aims to find ways to implements the
Desertification Convention adopted on December 29, 1996 and
already ratified by 108 countries.
</P>
<P>
The countries who signed the Convention pledge to work out a
long-term strategy to fight desertification based on international
cooperation.

<P>
HAIKOU, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Share-holding companies in
south China's Hainan Province has mushroomed in number,
contributing greatly to local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Some 130 share-holding companies have issued shares valued at
23 billion yuan, with 19 companies listed on stock exchanges at
home or abroad.
</P>
<P>
The rebirth of securities markets has provided local
enterprises with new sources of capital and has promoted the rapid
development in wide-ranging sectors, including energy, agriculture,
telecommunications, expressways and airports.
</P>
<P>
A series of major achievements has prompted the Hainan provincial
government to outline a general program calling for further
expansion of the share-holding system.
</P>
<P>
The program calls for the large-scale introduction of the joint
stock system and the expansion of infrastructure and pillar
industries.
</P>
<P>
A number of state-owned share-holding enterprise groups will be
formed to enhance competitiveness and raise economic
returns.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, located at the juncture of the South China Sea and the
Beibu Bay, is the nation's second largest island after Taiwan and
largest Special Economic Zone. Hainan was granted provincial
status in April 1988.

<HEADLINE> Panama's Congress Debates Jail Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Congress of Panama is
preparing to debate jail reform measures that will help alleviate
chaos in the country's overcrowded prisons.
</P>
<P>
The decision to debate reform measures was made after recent
prison riots resulted in the escape of 11 dangerous convicts from
one of Panama's top security prisons.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of State and Justice Raul Montenegro submitted a
draft bill package to the Legislative Assembly designed to improve
the country's penitentiary system.
</P>
<P>
One of the issues suggested in the draft bill is to release
unsentenced detainees, or those incarcerated as a preventive
measure, in order to put an end to the overcrowding and chaos in
the countryy's prison system.
</P>
<P>
Montenegro said the law, if enacted, would require the release
of thousands of unsentenced detainees who are languishing in
prison because of inefficiency and judicial procedures that have
bogged down.
</P>
<P>
"The draft bill should be a useful tool to alleviate current
turmoil in the penitentiary system, which lately has demonstrated
extreme violence and fierce riots," Montenegro said.
</P>
<P>
But he said the reform must not be regarded as an exoneration
act, nor a general amnesty. Penal action would continue in each
case until the judical processes were resolved.
</P>
<P>
"La Joya" jail, which bears the name of an island located in
the Pacific, was considered the country's top-security prison.
</P>
<P>
In January, a riot occurred there. The inmates took guards as
hostages and asked for negotiations to accelerate their judicial
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The inmates calmed down after authorities promised to review
the penitentiary system and improve jail conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, the riot occurred again early this week, during which
time 11 dangerous prisoners, incarcerated on charges of murder,
drug-trafficking and rape, succeeded in escaping.
</P>
<P>
President Ernesto Perez Balladares ordered the National Police
to intervene in the control of jails across the country that
harbor more than 7,600 inmates.
</P>
<P>
The Police Director Jose Luis Sosa regarded the presidential
measure as "accurate" and promised to bring the problems of
drug-trafficking, weapons and abuse of power in prisons under
control.
</P>
<P>
"I will carry out the president's command to bring discipline
to prisons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sosa also set a deadline for the 11 fugitives at large, urging
them to surrender.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Herdsmen Fight Against Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Herdsmen in northwest China's
Qinghai province have been busy planting new grass, setting up
fences to save parts of the grassland for spring or winter
herding, building sheds to prevent animals from suffering
illnesses from the cold or freezing to death.
</P>
<P>
These are some of a series of projects launched by Qinghua
province in the pastureland, aiming to improve defences against
natural calamities and raising herdsmen's living standards, acting
provincial governor Bai Enpei was quoted by today's China Daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai is one of China's five major animal husbandry
production bases. Its total meat output in 1996 reached 187,200
tons. However, the province's animal husbandry industry remains
vulnerable to natural disasters. To this high-land province,
winter and spring often mean that large numbers of domestic
animals dies as pastures wither. Frequent snowstorms only worsen
the situation. The disasters take a heavy toll on the herdsmen,
their families and their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Bai said that Qinghai also plans to spend another 10 years
constructing highways to link all villages and providing
electricity and water for all herders' families.
</P>
<P>
A total of 423 million yuan (51 million US dollars) was
invested in grassland infrastructure development from 1992 to
1996. Half the funds were raised by herdsmen and through bank
loans.
</P>
<P>
Currently 10.4 percent of herding families in the province have
benefited from these projects and 66,800 herding families, or two
thirds of the total in the province, have settled down.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the development of animal husbandry, provincial
authorities have promised herdsmen that the grasslands' policy of
household responsibility will remain unchanged for another 50
years.

<HEADLINE> Former Albanian Ruling Party Leaders Sentence Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian Court of Last
Instance is expected to review the guilty verdict meted out to
three former members of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the now defunct Albanian Party of Labor and to
possibly change the sentence to not guilty.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today reported that Foto Cami, Prokop Murra
and Muho Asllani, members of the political bureau, were expected
to re-enter a plea of not guilty as the Court of Last Instance
began to review their cases Tuesday. Prosecutors contend the men
had not committed crimes, because no such laws existed to cover
the charges they were accused of at the time.
</P>
<P>
The new hearing was the second one this week over the party's
former officials since the Labor Party, which has turned
Socialists, came to power in June after defeating the Democrats in
general elections.
</P>
<P>
The three men are accused of committing crimes of genocide and
crimes against mankind while they were in power. They were
previously sentenced to life imprisonment and imprisonment of 5-20
years by the Appeal Court.
</P>
<P>
A new court verdict on the three former officials is expected
to be decided by September 29.

<HEADLINE> Thai Private Sector Supports Opening Fish Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's private sector
supports the liberalization of trade in the fish and fish products
sector, according to the Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
The Thai private sector also supports free market in sugar,
canned and processed fruit and vegetables, gems and jewelry, and
pulp industries, according to Vithun Tulyanond, deputy
director-general of the Business Economics Department.
</P>
<P>
But Thailand's private sector and the Fisheries Department of
the Agriculture Ministry are opposed to New Zealand's initiatives
to include liberalizing trade in live fish and coral, for fear of
causing damage to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Import tariffs on fish, fish products and canned seafood would
be reduced ahead of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation's
(APEC's) deadline of 2010 for developed economies and 2020 for
developing ones provided APEC members submitted their proposals
before APEC's November meeting in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Vithun also said that Thai fish meal manufacturers also backs
liberalization of fish meal trade as local supply cannot meet
demand and the home-made product has a lower protein content than
that of imports.

<HEADLINE> North China Power Supplier Gets Exclusive-Dealer License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Power
Industry issued a power supply business license to North China
Power Group Co. Wednesday in Beijing, "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the license, the company has the exclusive right to
supply power to Beijing, Tianjin and northern Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
It is a significant step to reform China's power management
system, the Ministry of Power Industry is quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the Electric Power Law that officially went into
effect in April 1996, China will implement a new power supply
system in which a power supplier obtains a license from the
ministry and its subordinate institutions for being an exclusive
dealer of power supply to a certain region.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Power Industry is dividing the country into
different power supply business regions, a process that is
expected to be completed by the end of the year, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The new system will bring order to the power supply market,
avoid over-heated competition and coordinate the development of
large and small power grids, said the official.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to interconnect almost all of its power grids
before the year 2020. To achieve the goal, it created the China
Power Grid Development Ltd Corp. in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
To date, the country now has 11 power grids with an installed
generating capacity of over one million kilowatts each.

PARIS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic defeat Malta
1-0 in a World Cup European group six qualifying match on
Wednesday in Valletta, Malta. But two sides have no chance of
reaching the finals in France.

Radek Bejab broke the stalemate with a fine header just inside
the Maltese penalty area from a cross from Vladimir Smicer in the
32nd minute.

It was Malta's ninth defeat in nine games. Former coach Milorad
Kosanovic quit after a string of heavy defeats earlier this year,
including 6-0 away losses to the Czech Republic, Slovakia and
Yugoslavia.

The Czechs had allowed several key players to miss the match
but they are expected to return for the side's final match
against arch-rivals Slovakia on October 11.

PARIS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain's world number 20 Tim
Henman was beaten 4-6, 7-6 (3-7), 6-2 on Wednesday night by
Germany's 70th ranked Nicolas Kiefer in the second round of the

<P>
Kiefer, who had already hammered Henman in a challenger event

seed. Henman, who also had a hard first-round match against Czech
Daniel Vacek, could not afford the fierce shots from his rival.

Henman had some chances with his base-line ball in the second

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Parliament Adopts New Election Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet
(parliament) adopted a new election law today after a marathon
debate in the 450-seat legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The new electoral system, which has been debated 15 times since
November 1993, was passed with the backing of 230 deputies.
</P>
<P>
An element of proportional representation was introduced into
the electoral law. Under it, 225 members will be elected in
single-seat constituencies while the other 225 seats will be
allotted proportionally according to party lists.
</P>
<P>
The present single-seat constituency system has been blamed for
a proliferation of weak political parties and a disorganized
parliament where factional loyalties change frequently.
</P>
<P>
The old law invalidates any vote where the turnout does not
reach 50 percent or where the leading candidate does not get half
of all the votes cast.
</P>
<P>
The new system requires a minimum turnout of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Because the new law reserves half of the seats for members
elected from national party lists based on those parties' share of
the vote, the law was greeted with strong resistance from
unaffiliated lawmakers who want to keep the old system intact.
</P>
<P>
The old law tends to favor candidates who lack national party
ties but wield real power within their election districts.
</P>
<P>
"Party list will leave formation of the parliament in the hands
of party leaders rather than voters," said Mykhailo Chechetov of
the Social Market Choice. "It is party leaders who will decide
upon election who of their members should enter the Supreme
Soviet."
</P>
<P>
Party leaders, however, regard the new election law as a
progress toward a full-fledged multi-party democracy.
</P>
<P>
"We have to adopt the bill favoring parties if we want to have
a capable and effective parliament," said Rukh leader Vyacheslav
Chornovil.
</P>
<P>
Communist lawmaker Valery Mishura, who drafted the new law,
agreed that lawmakers without a party affiliation weaken the
legislature, saying that "half of our parliament is party members,
and the other half can be shaped to anyone's liking."

<HEADLINE> Firearm Law Reduces Armed Crime Incidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of crimes
involving guns decreased drastically during the first five months
of this year thanks to the effective implementation of the Arms
Control Law, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Between January and May, the number of crimes involving
firearms was 48.3 percent less then in the same period last year,
said Yuan Shaoli, deputy director of the Public Order Bureau under
the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
During the first five months, the number of murders committed
with guns dropped 37.1 percent, armed robberies 51.5 percent and
armed rapes 59.1 percent from the corresponding period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Arms control Law, which took effect last October, defines
over 20 types of crimes involving firearms and corresponding
punishments, which range up to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Punishments are much harsher and the right to bear arms
considerably more restricted under this law than the Management
Measures on Arms Control, promulgated by the State Council in 1981.
</P>
<P>
He stated that more than 80,000 small-calibre guns, 150,000
shotguns and 10,000 steel ball guns owned illegally were
confiscated in a nationwide firearms management and control
campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Over 800 underground firearms' manufacturing and trafficking
centres were banned, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of the strict Arms Control Law has
successfully curbed the rising tide of crimes involving guns, Yuan
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he suggested, the way each country works separately is
insufficient to deal with the increasingly serious problem of
cross-border firearms trafficking and related smuggling cases.
</P>
<P>
International co-operation should be strengthened to combat
crimes involving funs effectively, he said.

<P>
BUCHAREST, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded Carlos Moya and
Alex Corretja of Spain were both eliminated out of the
475,000-U.S.-Dollar Romanian Open tennis tournament here on
Wednesdsay.
</P>
<P>
The two main upset were produced by two all-spaniard
second-round matches.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Moya went down to Carlos Costa 0-6, 6-4, 4-6 while Alex
Corretja lost to Javier Sanchez 3-6, 6-4, 5-7.
</P>
<P>
Moya, ranked 5 by the ATP, played poorly in the first set. He
seemed to recover in the second set when he broke Costa's serve
once, but his 87th ranked opponent prevailed in the last set.
</P>
<P>
The ninth-ranked Corretja and 58th-ranked Sanchez played a
balanced first two sets.
</P>
<P>
The match's main moment came in the third set at 6-5 for
Sanchez. Corretja waited too long to serve. German referee Roland
Herfer granted a point to his opponent as a penalty for time
violation.
</P>
<P>
The decision affected Corretja's concentration. He lost another
point and double faulted to forfeit the match.
</P>
<P>
In two other second-round matches, Mark Kevin Goellner of
Germany beat Norway's Christian Ruud 6-2, 5-7, 6-3, while Spaniard
Francisco Clavet defeated Tomas Behrend of Germany 7-6 (7-5),

"It is essential that the member states pay their contributions
on time," Foreign Minister Miguel Angel told the on-going 52-nd
session of the U.N. General Assembly here.
</P>
<P>
He said no country can refuse to honor the accepted obligation
or set conditions, as such conditions "represent a threat to the
equality of the states and the dignity of the world forum of which
we are a part."
</P>
<P>
Regarding the U.N. reform, he said an increase of the number of
permanent members in the Security Council should "be based on the
ultimate interests of the international community, including fair
distribution for all geographical regions."
</P>
<P>
He said Venezuela hopes that the upcoming special U.N. General
Assembly on drug trafficking to be held at the request of Mexico
will produce clear solutions ensuring a more successful battle
against drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Bonn to Decide on Eurofighter Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The German government will make
a decision on October 8 on whether to join Britain, Italy and
Spain to build a new-generation of fighter jets, called the
Eurofighter, for the next century, German Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Due to tight budgets induced mainly by its struggle to meet the
strict fiscal requirements for joining the single European
currency, the Bonn government has delayed a decision on the
Eurofighter project for several times.
</P>
<P>
The German Defense Ministry said that it was absolutely
necessary for the German air force to buy 180 Eurofighters to
replace the outdated Phantom jets currently in service. The
purchases are expected to cost Germany about 23 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
Although Germany's participation in the project is expected to
be approved by the government eventually, the strong opposition
from the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens
will make it relatively difficult to get an endorsement from the
German parliament, observers said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Working on Guidelines Details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and Japanese defense
ministers started their discussions on Wednesday on an agreement
on bilateral planning directives following their approval of the
new guidelines for U.S.-Japan defense cooperation in New York.
</P>
<P>
Before his talks with Japanese Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma at
the Pentagon, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters
that the bilateral planning directives "will instruct our military
to begin working together on details of future cooperation in
times of peace and in times of crisis."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he will visit japan later in November to review
whether there is any progress made for the implementation of the
new guidelines, which would allow japan to give key military
support to U.S. forces in what they call an Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, Japan would for the first time since the
World War Two engage in military activities outside its borders in
military conflicts involving the United States.
</P>
<P>
Kyuma said the expansion in U.S.-Japan military cooperation in
Asia would not violate Tokyo's restraints on use of its powerful
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"The guidelines are not going to alter the interpretation of
the Japanese Constitution. So I would see no problem of these new
guidelines in relation with our Constitution," Kyuma said in his
answer to a reporter's question.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines for future political decisions are not detailed,
and both Cohen and Kyuma said they would work quickly to draw up
firm contingency planning.
</P>
<P>
And the contingency plans would contain such specifics as
Japanese military and commercial ports or airfields would be
available to U.S. forces in a war in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries are watching warily the intensified security
ties between the United States and Japan. They are concerned the
"robust and dynamic military alliance" between Washington and
Tokyo could constitute grave threats to their security.

<HEADLINE> Argentina on Reform of UN Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The reform of the
Security Council of the United Nations should make the
organization a more democratic and representative body, D.Guido Di
Tella, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly,
the Foreign Minister said that the composition of the Security
Council in 1945 was consonant with the reality prevailing at the
end of the Second World War, and Argentina was in the view there
was not yet a general Agreement concerning the increase in the
number of permanent members.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the reform of the Security Council
should make the organization a more democratic and
representative body. To reach that goal, each region would need
to arrive at a compromise free of pressures or haste.
</P>
<P>
He said in the case of Latin America and the Caribbean, the
summit of heads of States of the Rio Group agreed that the
region itself would have to decide how to fill the seats
assigned to it, and Argentina was of the view that an open ended
mechanism of rotation needed to be established as it would
enable the participation of all those states who had shown their
commitment to and respect for the Charter.
</P>
<P>
He stressed this mechanism would avoid discriminations
against those states bearing greater financial responsibilities,
and those responsibilities could even be increased for the
rotating states.
</P>
<P>
He added that Argentina's position was only aimed at favoring
an ample participation by all the states of the region without
exclusions.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Approves Bill to Prepare for Euro Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The German cabinet today
approved a draft legislation designed mainly to prepare German
companies for the planned 1999 introduction of the single European
currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed law, which still have to be endorsed by the
parliament, Germany companies would be able to account their
shares and capital in the Euro from January 1, 1999, but this will
not be compulsory until 2002 when the Euro is due to formally
replace national currencies of its member states.
</P>
<P>
For all fiscal years after January 1, 1998, German companies
would also be allowed to do their annual accounts in the single
currency.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which matches the legal changes in other EU
countries preparing for the Euro, also paves the way for German
bourses to adjust to the single currency up from January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Given the widespread uncertainty and fears about the Euro
conversion, this law will provide the necessary legal certainty in
Germany," said German Justice Minister Edzard Schmidt-Jortzig
today in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also expressed the confidence that the Euro will
be launched punctually on January 1, 1999 with Germany as one of
its founding members.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today also made a talk to the
Euro, saying that he would never give in to the widespread
Euro-sceptism in his country.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on opinion polls in recent years which have
repeatedly shown that a majority of Germans are unwilling to give
up their rock-hard D-mark for the Euro, Kohl said: "Polling data
cannot hold us back from doing what has been recognized as right.
Otherwise, we would fail to fulfil our responsibility."

<HEADLINE> Ulster New Hope of Talks Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) - Most observers on Northern
Ireland expected today that Sinn Fein, the political party of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) will be allowed to stay in the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the chief party of the
pro-british majority Protestants, on Tuesday called for Sinn Fein
to be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
They described Sinn Fein leaders as "godfathers of terrorism"
and said they were angry that republicans were being allowed to
the table while guerrilla held on to their weapons in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
However, the observers expect that Sinn Fein will be allowed to
stay in the talks as Britain and Ireland are trying to broaden the
talks to lay the basis for a lasting settlement that would be put
to referendums next May.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Belfast said that a round-table session of the
talks was adjourned three times today to allow for fine-tuning an
Anglo-Irish proposal for moving current preliminary discussions
into full-scale negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Some sources at the talks predicted that the process was edging
towards a major breakthrough which could lead to talks on the
future of Northern Ireland by next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Substantive talks on the province moved a step closer as the
parties involved looked set to sign a deal to keep the UUP and
Sinn Fein at the table, according to a BBC report tonight.
</P>
<P>
The UUP appears to have softened their line on decomissioning.
Under the deal, which the UUP is expected to sign, arms will not
have to be handed over ahead of a settlement, BBC added.
</P>
<P>
Unionist spokesmen said they had made progress but denied that
they had watered-down their long-standing demand for an early
handover.
</P>
<P>
UUP leader David Trimble also said: "It's not ideal. But
decomissioning is a live issue that will not be sidelined."

<HEADLINE> France Sells 4 Mine Sweepers to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- France has sold four retired
mine sweepers to Turkey for about 50 million US dollars, said
Turkish and French officials today.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Turkish Defense Ministry and the French Naval
Construction Management International (DCNI) signed the contract
today in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The 500-ton "Circe" type mine-sweepers have just retired from
the French navy and will be handed over to the Turkish navy in
1998 after undergoing technological renovations at the Brest navy
shipyard.
</P>
<P>
The mine-sweepers will be equipped with a tactic information
treatment system, and sub-marine piloted vehicles for detecting
and destroying mines, said DCNI in a communique.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for France to sell armaments to Turkish
navy, which mainly buys its armaments from Germany and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that France is seeking contracts with the
Turkish army on the sale of assault helicopters, armored vehicles
and anti-tank missiles.
</P>
<P>
The Franco-German Eurocopter company signed with Turkey in
February a 430 million dollar contract ordering 30 Cougar back-up
and emergency rescue helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Eurocopter is competing with American, Italian and Russian
companies for a 3 billion dollar contract for a squad of 145
assault helicopters for the Turkish army.
</P>
<P>
The French army equipment producing group GICAT is also
competing with 10 other international companies for a 5 billion
dollar contract on the construction of 1,000 tanks with Turkish
companies.
</P>
<P>
The Aerospatiale airspace group is close to a contract with
Turkey on building short-distance Eryx anti-tank missiles for the
Turkish army, said French and Turkish officials.

<HEADLINE> Crete Summit Likely Another Chance for Greek-Turkish Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Greece today said that the
Balkan summit on Crete in early November might provide Athens and
Ankara with another chance to better their relations.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the summit of Balkan nations in Crete where there
is a scheduled meeting between Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
and his Turkish counterpart Mesut Yilmaz will bring results,"
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said here today.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey lost a chance to improve their strained
relations for decades following a fruitless meeting between Greek
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos and his Turkish counterpart,
Ismail Cem, in New York Tuesday night on the sidelines of the U.N.
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
It was the first high-level meeting between the two neighboring
countries since the signing of the Madrid communique in early
July, which drew broad guidelines for Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Reppas attributed the failure of the Pangalos-Cem meeting to
Turkey's stance, saying that Turkey refused to take the step which
would lead it to deal with the issue of the Aegean islet of Imia.
</P>
<P>
In January 1996, the two countries nearly went to war after
Ankara questioned Athens' sovereignty over the uninhabited islet
in the Aegean sea.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the Madrid communique indicated
that Turkey takes its claim over Imia to international
jurisdiction, which it has not done.
