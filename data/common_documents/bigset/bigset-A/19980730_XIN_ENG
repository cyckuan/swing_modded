<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Arrest 13 More Members Of Major Criminal Ring (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Public Security Ministry
reported today that 13 members of a gang of Hong Kong and mainland
Chinese criminals who got more than 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars
from two Hong Kong businessmen in ransom money were arrested today.
</P>
<P>
The gang is charged with smuggling large amounts of explosives
into Hong Kong, kidnapping two Hong Kong businessmen and
exchanging them for 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars, murdering one
mainland Chinese businessman and one Hong Kong resident, and armed
robbery at 7 Hong Kong gold shops.
</P>
<P>
On July 22, police arrested 18 members of the gang, including
its leader Cheung Chi Keung. In all, they have arrested 32 members
of the gang, 18 of them Hong Kong residents and 14 from the
mainland. One of them, Ma Shangzhong, a resident of Hebei
Province, had already been arrested for involvement in a murder
and an armed robbery case.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the police have seized some 40 million yuan in
cash, 11 automobiles, some 40 million yuan worth of real estate,
and guns and explosives.
</P>
<P>
The gang's major criminal activities are as follows:
</P>
<P>
On January 7, 1998, two Hong Kong residents, Chin Hon Sau and
Chin Hou Yip, smuggled more than 800 kg of dynamite, over 2,000
detonators, and 500 meters of fuse into Hong Kong at the request
of Cheung Chi Keung.
</P>
<P>
The explosives were brought in at Hong Kong's Lei Yue Mun Dock
and sent on to Lau Shu Heung Village in the "New Territories."
They were then handed over to Cheung Chi Keung, who hid them in
another village. On January 17, Hong Kong police seized the
explosives.
</P>
<P>
Back in 1996, Cheung Chi Keung and Yip Kai Foon, another Hong
Kong resident, had begun plotting to kidnap a Hong Kong
businessman. On the afternoon of May 23, 1996, after several
months of following the man around, 9 gang members kidnapped him
and held him for more than a billion Hong Kong dollars, 438
million HK dollars of which went to Cheung and the rest to the
other members involved.
</P>
<P>
In February, 1997, Cheung was in Guangzhou, the capital of
Guangdong Province, and several other cities, plotting the
kidnapping of another Hong Kong businessman.
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of September, 1997, after several months of
shadowing the man, 10 armed gang members, headed by Cheung,
kidnapped the man and locked him in a room they had rented in the
"New Territories."
</P>
<P>
On October 4, after paying 600 million Hong Kong dollars in
ransom, the businessman was released. Cheung's cut was 300 million
Hong Kong dollars, and the rest went to the other members involved.

Back in January 14, 1995, Yip Kai Foon and his several
accomplices had kidnapped a businessman from the city of Tianjin
in northern China and taken a bill of lading belonging to him for
2,500 tons of steel products. But the deal went wrong when the
man, whose name was Li, suffocated to death on the way to
Guangzhou because of the adhesive tape that been used to seal his
mouth and the quilt that was used to cover his head.
</P>
<P>
On November 27, 1995, Yip shot a Hong Kong man named Cai to
death, with several accomplices present, because he thought that
Cai had betrayed him.
</P>
<P>
Back on June 9, 1991, after careful planning on the mainland,
Yip Kai Foon and his accomplices, wearing face masks and armed
with submachine guns and handguns, robbed five gold shops one
after another on Hip Wo Street in Kwun Toon in Hong Kong,
getting away with more than 5 million yuan worth of gold jewelry
after exchanging gunfire with Hong Kong police.
</P>
<P>
Ma Shangzhong was wounded by the gunfire, but managed to slip
back across the border to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1992, Yip Kai Foon and accomplices met in the Shenzhen
Special Economic Zone across the border from Hong Kong and planned
more robberies of Hong Kong gold shops.
</P>
<P>
On March 10, 1992, Yip and his partners robbed two gold shops
on Tai Po Road in Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong, getting away with a
million yuan worth of gold jewelry after shooting at Hong Kong
police who had responded immediately to an alarm.
</P>
<P>
Police on the mainland now have statements from the accused as
well as a large amount of evidence against them, the spokesman
says. They are from Hong Kong and the mainland and plotted the
kidnapping on the mainland and carried it out in Hong Kong. The
ransom money was taken partly to the mainland and laundered by
purchasing real estate there.
</P>
<P>
They will therefore be tried in mainland courts in accordance
with Chinese law.

<HEADLINE> S. African Chemical Workers Stage Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of chemical
workers went on strike Wednesday in major cities across South
Africa to demand higher pay, South African media reported.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 workers belonging to the Chemical Workers'
Industrial Union (CWIU) marched from central Johannesburg to the
chemical industrial headquarters north of the city to present a
memorandum to negotiators for the employers.
</P>
<P>
The protest action affected flights in and out of the
Johannesburg International Airport, the biggest airport in the
country, reports said.
</P>
<P>
A South African Airways flight from Johannesburg to Miami was
reportedly delayed and would not depart until midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This followed last Wednesday's strike by apron service workers
at the airport which virtually saw air traffic throughout South
Africa grind to a halt.
</P>
<P>
CWIU spokesman Ronald Mafokeng said the workers wanted a 10.5
percent across-the-board wage increase, six months maternity
leave and pensions based on salaries and shift allowances
combined. Employers have offered an 8.5 percent hike.
</P>
<P>
Mafokeng said the union was prepared to strike as long as it
took and if its demands were not met, 40,000 chemical workers
would strike as from Monday, which would affect petrol supplies
to the public.
</P>
<P>
Chemical employers' coordinator Fanie Ernst accepted the
union's memorandum. But he insisted the employers' offer was
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
In Durban, the busy seaport on the Indian coast, more than
6,000 chemical workers marched through the streets, slightly
disrupting traffic in the city center.
</P>
<P>
Union members also staged protests in Cape Town, Pretoria,
East London and Port Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
If the strike continues, many industries will be affected,
including manufacturers of industrial chemicals, consumer goods
like detergents and cosmetics, industrial rubber, pharmaceuticals
and glassware.
</P>
<P>
The fuel industry assured the public Wednesday that it had
made contingency plans to ensure the supply of fuel would not be
affected, although garages reported a higher than normal number
of motorists lining up for petrol.
</P>
<P>
The South African Chemical Workers' Union, which began its
strike last Monday, had expressed support for the CWIU.
</P>
<P>
The South African Workers' Union and National Engineers' Trade
Union were also considering joining the strike as from Monday.
</P>
<P>
Salary negotiations between the affected industries and their
unions started in May and ended in deadlock earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Maintain Watch On Yangtze As Flood Peak Passes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- In the city of Jiujiang in east
China's Jiangxi Province, people were on alert as the third flood
peak this year on the Yangtze River passed.
</P>
<P>
At 9:00 this evening in this tourist and industrial city of
440,000, water levels on the Yangtze were 22.9 m, or 0.02 m higher
than in the morning, and above the 22.2 m record of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The city's embankments have been designed to withstand floods
with a maximum of 23.5 m, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 10,000 civilians and over 3,200 soldiers
and armed police watching the dikes to see if there is any danger
of their collapsing.
</P>
<P>
Local people are worried about the safety of the embankments
and phoned the city's flood headquarters repeatedly today.
</P>
<P>
One resident, Chen Shaohua, said, "We are not afraid of the
floods because the dikes are made of concrete and thousands of
people and soldiers are guarding them."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Denies to Hold Talks With Eritrean FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia denied Wednesday
that Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin will hold direct talks with
his Eritrean counterpart Haile Weldensae.
</P>
<P>
''The statement by Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Weldensae
that he will hold direct talks with Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin is a complete fabrication,'' Ethiopian government
spokeswoman, Selome Taddesse, said here.
</P>
<P>
He noted that ''such lies, designed to mislead and misinform
the international community have been the main thrust of Eritrean
diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
The government spokeswoman said in a news release that ''the
Ethiopian position has remained the same throughout, ensuring the
withdrawal of Eritrean troops from Ethiopian territory, as has
been proposed by the facilitators and was endorsed by the
Organization of African Unity and the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
''Ethiopia has repeatedly said there will be no negotiations
with Eritrea while Eritrean troops continue to occupy parts of
northern Ethiopia,'' Taddesse said.
</P>
<P>
''This position has not changed,'' she said, adding that ''yet
again the Eritrean government is deliberately frustrating the
peace process by avoiding the real issue of troop withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
Hundreds died between May 6 and June 11 when a border dispute
between Ethiopia and Eritrea flared into violence. The dispute
remains unresolved although mediations were made by African
leaders and the OAU.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders and the OAU will hold new consultation on
the crisis in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso on August 1-2, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Roundup-- UK Is Heading for Recession Unless Cut in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) - Business leaders in Britain have
called for a cut in interest rates to counter a collapse in
confidence among manufacturers which could herald a slide into
recession.
</P>
<P>
With the slump in export orders spreading to domestic markets,
optimism about the economic climate has fallen to a seven-year
low, according to an industrial trends survey by the Confederation
of British Industry (CBI) published here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said that there was growing evidence of an economy-wide
slow-down. It is the first time the influential organization has
called for lower interest rates in almost three years.
</P>
<P>
The call came as two academics at the London Business School
released details of a study showing that official statistics may
be under-estimating growth in manufacturing productivity.
</P>
<P>
This means that the Bank of England's pre-occupation with
rising manufacturing earnings may be misplaced, according to Neil
Blake and Paul Robson, the authors, as earnings increases
accompanied by similar improvements in productivity do not tend to
be inflationary.
</P>
<P>
In their study, the two academics argue: "Manufacturers have
been unnecessarily targeted by the Bank, while other evidence
suggests that the services sector is the guilty party."
</P>
<P>
Andrew Buxton, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs
committee, said: "The risk of a sharper slowdown outweighs the
risks of higher inflation. The CBI has therefore decided to call
for a cut in interest rates of 0.25 percentage points...."
</P>
<P>
CBI director-general Adair Turner also said it was clear that
economic growth was decelerating. But there was a danger that the
slowdown would be sharper than expected, hence the need for an
interest rate cut from the present level of 7.5%.
</P>
<P>
"If you look back at macro-economic policy-making, there's
quite a history of acting too late in either direction," warned
Turner.
</P>
<P>
The CBI's call for a rate cut was warmly received by other
industry figures, many of whom have been lobbying for lower
interest rates for some months.
</P>
<P>
The British Chambers of Commerce said that CBI's survey
confirmed the severe problems facing industry. The Bank of
England must now cut rates at the earliest opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Economic observers here believe that the growing calls from UK
industry for a rate cut could take Peter Mandelson, the
newly-promoted Industry Secretary, into direct conflict with
Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson is expected to face mounting pressure to side with
the industrialists and push for lower interest rates while Brown
has staunchly defended his decision to give the Bank of England
the power to set rates.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republican Lawmakers Plan to Push for Trade Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Republicans
announced plans Wednesday for a vote in September on controversial
trade legislation that ran ashore last year when President Clinton
met with strong opposition from his Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The Republican plan to vote on giving the president "fast
track" authority to negotiate new international trade agreements
raised the possibility of a battle that could splinter Democrats a
few weeks before the election.
</P>
<P>
While Clinton favors the bill, administration officials haven't
pushed for its passage this year and reacted coolly late Tuesday
to word of the developments.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the president supports fast track," spokesman Barry
Toiv said. "But we're not interested in seeing it come up merely
as an attempt by the Republicans to gain political advantage, and
that's what we've seen here recently."
</P>
<P>
"If Republicans really want to help our economy, they'll
approve funding for the IMF. That's our first priority, he added.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would restore authority for the president to
negotiate international trade treaties without having to subject
them to amendments by Congress. This process, under which
lawmakers can only accept or reject deals in their entirety, is
known as "fast track." Every president since Gerald Ford has had
such authority, although it has lapsed. President Bill Clinton has
tried to renew it after it expired in 1993.
</P>
<P>
It was reported by AP today that White House Chief of Staff
Erskine Bowles met recently with business officials to try to cool
their interest in a vote on the bill this year. Bowles cautioned
those in attendance that Republicans intend to condition the trade
measure in some way on concessions from the White House on its
call for additional support for the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The trade legislation was pulled from the House floor late last
year when Clinton became concerned he lacked the votes to pass it.
Many Republicans favored it, but only about 40 Democrats supported
it at the time, less than one-quarter of the rank-and-file.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Finance Committee last week approved the fast track
bill, combining it with House-passed legislation to extend trade
benefits to countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

<HEADLINE> CIQ Tiff Lingers Between Singapore and Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singapore, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore said Thursday that
Malaysia had rejected its offer of an interim arrangement for the
relocation of Malaysia's Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ)
operations and warned of inconvenience to rail passengers crossing
their borders as a result of Malaysia's insistence.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs in a statement released
Thursday said that "Singapore Immigration met its counterpart on
July 28, 1998, to try and resolve the issue. However, the talks
broke down."
</P>
<P>
This was "because Malaysian officials insisted that Malaysian
immigration should be located inside the building at Woodlands
Train Check Point (WTCP), " the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted Malaysian officials as saying that
Malaysian Immigration would remain at Tanjong Pagar Railway
Station if its Immigration could not be located inside the
building.
</P>
<P>
Under the interim arrangement, after Singapore moves its own
CIQ operation from the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station in its
southern part to the new Woodlands Train Check Point in its
northern border on August 1, Malaysia would be allowed to retain
its CIQ operations at Tanjong Pagar with Singapore officials
present to "lend their authority to Malaysian customs officials
during the interim period" and be allowed to put some desks for
Malaysian officers on the passenger platform at the WTCP so as to
be able to clear passengers for entry into Malaysia after
Singapore has cleared them for exit.
</P>
<P>
On July 25, Singapore Foreign Minister J. Jayakumar and his
Malaysian counterpart Datuk Seri Abdullah Badawi reached an
understanding on the issue during their sideline meeting at the
31st Asian Ministerial meeting in Manila, the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The fresh tiff over CIQ operations is the latest in a
protracted dispute over the operation of the Malayan Railways
services here.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Malaysian railway operator, Malayan Railways
(Kretapi Tanah Melayu), owns about 200 hectares of land within
Singapore under a 1918 agreement drawn up by the British, which
gave the operator the land for as long as it operated trains
services.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and Malaysia signed Points of Agreement in 1990
outlining the redevelopment of the Malaysian-owned railway land in
 Singapore, but the deal has not been implemented.

<HEADLINE> Obuchi Forms Economic Cabinet Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Newly-elected Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi formed an "economic reconstruction" cabinet
Thursday in the hope of lifting Japan from its prolonged economic
stagnation.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi appointed former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa as
finance minister and named well-known author and one-time trade
official Taichi Sakaiya as head of the Economic Planning Agency.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet lineup also features two surprises. Akito Arima,
former president of the University of Tokyo, was named as
education minister, and a 37-year-old political rookie, Seiko
Noda, was picked as posts and communications minister.
</P>
<P>
Noda, a two-term House of Representatives member and the only
woman in the 21-member cabinet, is the youngest politician to
occupy a cabinet post in Japan since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
As for other key cabinet posts, former State Foreign Secretary
Masahiko Komura was named as foreign minister, and former
Education Minister Kaoru Yosano took the post as international
trade and industry minister.
</P>
<P>
The defense portfolio went to Fukushiro Nukaga, a
journalist-turned politician who served as deputy chief cabinet
secretary in the cabinet of former Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
The choice of Miyazawa as finance minister apparently reflects
Obuchi's determination to lead the country out of its economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Miyazawa, 78, who served as prime minister between November
1991 and August 1993, is known for his expertise in economics and
is the author of an Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)-government plan
to set up a "bridge bank" system to liquidate failing banks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following his appointment, Miyazawa
pledged to outline his plans shortly on how to rebuild the ailing
financial sector and inject vigor into the moribund economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to share with the public on the ways and the
time span needed," to carry out specific policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi became Japan's 84th prime minister after the
LDP-controlled House of Representatives (lower house), which has
final say in selecting a premier, elected him into power with 268
of the 494 valid votes cast.
</P>
<P>
Japanese business leaders urged the new cabinet to exercise
strong leadership in pulling Japan out of its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Japanese economic structural reform is indispensable for
realizing an economic recovery led by domestic demand, the
Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The Obuchi cabinet should stabilize the financial system,
resolve the bad-loan mess, achieve drastic tax reform and promote
deregulation, the most influential business lobby in Japan said.

<HEADLINE> Privatization Process Hindered in Romania, Says Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Company debts are now the
strongest hindrance in the evolution of Romanian privatization,
Privatization Minister Sorin Dimitriu told Rompres news agency
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody purchases debts," said the minister, adding that the
financial gridlock in the economy is also blocking the
privatization process.
</P>
<P>
What is extremely dangerous is the fact that the financial
deadlock could affect companies that turned private only recently,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The often contradictory legal framework, commercial companies'
bad management compared with other countries ease of doing
business are other factors hindering the process, Dimitriu said.
</P>
<P>
The financial market's lack of available capital by brokers and
private individuals are other elements affecting privatization,
the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Of 1,200 commercial companies scheduled to be sold by the end
of 1998, only 304 sales contracts were signed in the first half of
the year.

<P>
The office added that however, the number of foreigners
resident in Germany continued to climb, reaching 7,366,000 in 1997
from 7,314,000 in 1996, as a result of a high birth rate.

<HEADLINE> hke073061 -WB on Nepal's Strategies to Attract Private Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government should
take a more proactive role in developing investment projects if it
wants to enhance the role of private capital in the country's
development and make it more productive, the World Bank said in a
press release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It noted that worldwide experience shows that competition among
interested investors tends to result in overall lower project
costs, allowing host governments to reap more benefits from the
involvement of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
To make better use of private financing, and especially foreign
direct investment, in the country's infrastructure, the press
release recommended that the government should develop a more
comprehensive strategy across all infrastructure sectors,
integrating the private financing option into the government's
overall development efforts.
</P>
<P>
Funding for the study was financed by the government of
Finland, the World Bank said in the press release.
</P>
<P>
The bank is a member of the Nepal Aid Group.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Deputy PM on Lessons From Asian Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong Thursday talked about the lessons drawn from the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a speech titled "the Asian financial crisis: challenges to
business management" he delivered at Alumni event here of the
Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development,
Lee said there are lessons from the Asian crisis that apply both
to corporates and governments
</P>
<P>
He said both governments and corporates should take a long view
of Asia's potential and prepare themselves for the next wave of
economic growth and assure a long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
Companies which are resourceful and go for the fundamentals can
still find rewarding opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the economic crisis has also brought home
the timely lesson that corporations and countries have to get
their fundamentals right.
</P>
<P>
The last year has shown that business in Asia also follows
"normal" rules and corporates are subject to the same financial
and economic constraints and risks as in America or the EU.
</P>
<P>
He also said tectonic shifts in the environment are possible
and can change the business proposition overnight.
</P>
<P>
He advised everyone to anticipate change and to prepare himself
for an uncertain and unpredictable world.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Prime minister noted that the Asian financial crisis
has generated greater uncertainty and challenges that companies
will need to manage.
</P>
<P>
He listed the challenges as sharp deterioration in business
environment, slump in market demand in Asia, breakdown in business
infrastructure and the rising risk of political and social unrest.
</P>
<P>
He said the prospects for Asia depend on the performance of the
largest economies, Japan and China, as well as developments in the
individual countries which are in difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He said thus far China has managed its economy with impressive
competence.
</P>
<P>
If the Japanese government succeeds in boosting economic growth
and restoring business confidence, economic prospects across the
region will improve, he said.

<HEADLINE> Blair Gives Government's "Annual Report" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Thursday delivered his "annual report" to the country by
renewing his pre-election contract with the British people.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the ministers and civil servants in No. 10
Downing Street, Blair said the government could be "genuinely
proud" of its progress in delivering its election pledges.
</P>
<P>
Of the 177 manifesto pledges, 50 had been met, 119 were well
under way and only eight had to be timetabled, he said.
</P>
<P>
In what was billed as an annual "State of the nation" event, he
brushed aside recent troubles over the economy and his cabinet
reshuffle and insisted the government was engaged in a "quiet
revolution" that would transform Britain.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also promised British voters his government
would learn from mistakes made in its first year in office.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we have made a good start. But it is only a start.
There is a lot more to be done," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the priority task of his second year in power,
Blair said it would be to ensure "the economy slows down in a way
that avoids a return to boom and bust."
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that welfare reform would remain the most
controversial area for his government but rejected claims that
plans for radical welfare reform had been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
"This is a radical reforming government. Sometimes the
revolution is a quiet revolution but a revolution, nevertheless it
is."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week Blair sacked his Social Security Secretary
Harriet Harman and her deputy, welfare reform guru Frank Field
quit, accusing Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown of
blocking his radical proposals.

<HEADLINE> Daimler Posts Record First Half Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- German industrial group Daimler-Benz
Thursday announced in Frankfurt that its profits doubled to a
record high of some 3.8 billion marks (2.1 billion U.S. dollars)
in the first half from the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Group turnover surged 21 percent to 67.7 billion marks (38.2
billion dollars), boosting net profits to two billion marks (1.1
billion dollars) from one billion marks (565 million dollars), the
level a year before.
</P>
<P>
Confident of continued good results in the second half of this
year, the concern hoped for a group turnover of at least 140
billion marks (79.1 billion dollars) for the whole of 1998, up
about 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Daimler attributed the increase in first half profits chiefly
to booming car sales, particularly in the United States, where
sales rocketed 68 percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
The company's total car sales increased by 27 percent to
428,000 cars. Daimler-Benz cars, the most profitable sector within
the group, posted sales of 30.6 billion marks (17.3 billion
dollars), up 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We are excellently prepared for the merger with Chrysler,"
Daimler-Benz chief Juergen Schrempp told reporters in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Daimler is to merge with U.S. automaker Chrysler to create the
world's third largest automaker. The company said it would release
more details about the planned merger next week.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of the two companies will decide on the planned
merger at separate meetings scheduled for September 18.

<HEADLINE> New Japanese PM Launches Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- New Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi named an "economic reconstruction" cabinet Thursday in a
bid to revive the ailing Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The choice of former prime minister Miyazawa as finance
minister apparently reflects Obuchi's determination to lead the
country out of its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Miyazawa, 78, who served as prime minister between November
1991 and August 1993, is known for his expertise in economics and
is the author of an Liberal Democratic Party-government plan to
set up a "bridge bank" system to liquidate failing banks.
</P>
<P>
Former State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura was named as
foreign minister, and former Education Minister Kaoru Yosano took
the post as international trade and industry minister.
</P>
<P>
Komura's appointment as foreign minister is apparently aimed at
helping Obuchi attain his goal of improving relations with Russia
and concluding a bilateral peace treaty by 2000 as agreed by the
two countries. He is noted for his personal knowledge of bilateral
ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet lineup also includes well-known author and one-time
trade official Taichi Sakaiya as head of the Economic Planning
Agency, former president of the University of Tokyo Akito Arima as
education minister, and a 37-year-old political rookie, Seiko
Noda, as posts and communications minister.
</P>
<P>
Noda, a two-term House of Representatives member and the only
woman in the 21-member cabinet, is the youngest politician to
occupy a cabinet post in Japan since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
The defense portfolio went to Fukushiro Nukaga, a former
journalist, serving as deputy chief cabinet secretary in the
cabinet of former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi became Japan's 84th prime minister after the House of
Representatives (lower house), which has final say in selecting a
premier, elected him into power with 268 of the 494 valid votes
cast.

<HEADLINE> S. African Correctional Services Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
Thursday accepted the resignation of Correctional Services
Minister Sipo Mzimela and appointed Ben Skosana to succeed him,
the government's communication service said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has agreed to a request from Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to withdraw Mzimela from the
cabinet, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Both Mzimela and Skosana are members of the IFP.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela tendered his written resignation to President Nelson
Mandela Wednesday evening, Mzimela's spokesman Bert Slabbert said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Mzimela had not given any reasons,
either in the letter or to him.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela's resignation followed his repeated clashes with the
party over his calls for a merger of the IFP with the ruling
African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
In January, the IFP's National Council adopted a formal vote
of no confidence in Mzimela, and earlier this month the party
axed him as its deputy national chairman.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi has also openly attacked Mzimela, saying that the
latter's political conduct is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Slabbert said Thursday that he did not know whether or not
Mzimela would stay on as an IFP member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
"These are the things I think will have to be negotiated," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Mandela, Buthelezi and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
held talks on Mzimela's position, and presidential spokesman
Parks Mankahlana later said the three were eager that any change
in the government should happen in the least disruptive manner to
the running of government affairs.

<P>
GENEVA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia has called for the
immediate launching of negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-off
Treaty (FMCT) within the Conference on Disarmament (CD).
</P>
<P>
Pushing for the immediate commencement of negotiations on an
FMCT " is among Australia's highest priorities for action" in the
CD, said Australia's ambassador for disarmament John B. Campbell
at the first plenary meeting of the third part of the CD 1998
session here Thursday,
</P>
<P>
The 61-member conference resumed on July 27 for the third and
final part of the 1998 session, which will end on September 9.
</P>
<P>
"A FMCT is a longstanding objective on the international
non-proliferation and disarmament agenda," said Campbell. "It is
the logical next step following the conclusion of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
</P>
<P>
He said recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan "have given
a further impetus to the need for an immediate start to
negotiations on a FMCT."
</P>
<P>
The Australian permanent representative to the United Nations
urged all members of the CD to reach an agreement on the
establishment of an ad hoc committee to negotiate a FMCT by the
end of the current session.

LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- English premier league club Aston
Villa was shocked when their new signing David Unsworth asked for
transfer, six days after he moved from West Ham.

million U.S. dollars) they paid to West Ham.

Unsworth, who played once for England in 1995, quit the Hammers

But after just one week in Villa, the 24-year-old told Villa
manager John Gregory he has made a "dreadful mistake."

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Informs King of Planned Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, Cambodia, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Co-Premier
Hun Sen, appearing set to be next prime minister, informed King
Norodom Sihanouk Thursday of the possible formation of a coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
According to Hun Sen, the king was pleased with the idea of a
coalition government. He said the king also approved of him as the
prime minister and his ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP)
controlling five important ministries.
</P>
<P>
The second prime minister also told the king that the next
government would apply the system of one prime minister to replace
the two-prime minister system practiced now.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has practiced the system of two premiers since 1993,
and in July last year had witnessed the ouster of the then
First-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh by his co-partner Hun Sen,
leaving a coalition in shambles.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, the would-be prime minister, said that each ministry
would see the appointment of a minister and a state secretary in a
power sharing system for partners in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said the five ministries to be controlled by the CPP
would be national defense, interior, finance, justice and foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"It would not be difficult to allocate the ministries" because
the system of one prime minister would allow him to be
authoritative, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If something (bad) happens, it would not the ministers to
blame, but the prime minister," he said, indicating he should take
the responsibility for state affairs.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said the CPP would like to form a coalition with both
Funcinpec of Prince Norodom Ranariddh and the opposition Sam
Rainsy Party (SRP).
</P>
<P>
He said that with seats of the CPP and Funcinpec added
together, it would be enough to form a coalition, but he would
like the SRP to join.
</P>
<P>
The CPP, Hun Sen said, would like to mobilize all political
forces and use all resources for the sake of political ability and
social security.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh and SRP leader Sam Rainsy, however, have made it
clear that they refuse to join a coalition government with the
CPP, claiming the election was "unjust and unacceptable" because
of fraud.
</P>
<P>
Partial results of Sunday's election showed that the CPP was
far ahead of Funcinpec and the SRP in terms of seats collected in
the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
According to the CPP's calculation of votes, it acquired 67
seats in the 122-member house, followed by Funcinpec with 38 and
the SRP 17.
</P>
<P>
Under Cambodia's constitution, a party needs a two-thirds
majority, or 82 seats, in the assembly to form a government. If no
single party meets the required quorum, a coalition government has
to be formed with the largest party naming the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Confers With Netanyahu, Erekat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU) envoy
Thursday met separately with the Israeli prime minister and
Palestinian chief negotiator to brief them on his latest shuttle
diplomacy in Israel, Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Angel Moratinos, EU special envoy to the Middle East,
told Benjamin Netanyahu about Syrian and Lebanese positions on
Israel's offer of withdrawal from south Lebanon and the resumption
of Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But according to the Prime Minister's Office, nothing special
has come out from the briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government decided in April to endorse the
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 and pull out of south Lebanon
provided security arrangements are worked out with Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon insisted that Israel must withdraw from south Lebanon
immediately and unconditionally, as called for by the
U.N. resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Syria said that it will restart peace talks with Israel from
where it had been left off, not from square one as asked by the
current Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos is currently on a shuttle diplomacy in Israel, Syria
and Lebanon, which is aimed at moving the Israeli-Lebanese and
Israeli-Syrian peace talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday he also met in Jericho, the West Bank with
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat and exchanged views with
him on the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their meeting, Moratinos expressed
cautious optimism about the ongoing peace negotiations between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
The direct talks, the first in about 16 months, were kicked off
July 19 by Palestinian peace negotiator Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen)
and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai in Tel Aviv, in
order to an agreement on Israel's acceptance of a U.S. proposal
calling it to yield 13.1 percent more of the West Bank in the
long-overdue second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
But Erekat said that no progress was made in the current
Israeli-Palestinan peace talks despite senior officials from the
two sides have met several times.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Israeli side proposed to have a 10
percent pullback and turn the other 3 percent into "nature
reserve," in which Palestinian construction should be approved by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has rejected this "10 plus 3" proposal.
The two sides are scheduled to meet again Thursday.

of China's Yangtze River is expected to continue for the next few

Drought Relief Headquarters, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Water levels on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze are
expected to remain dangerously high for a fairly long period of
time, and the water-logged dikes could give way any time, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters reports that water levels upstream from Hankou
have begun to fall now that crest has passed Wuhan, but levels
downstream are still high. Water levels on the river first went
above the danger line on June 27, and there have been three peaks.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.3 million people and soldiers have been working on
the embankments and dikes along the Yangtze. The headquarters sent
eight groups of experts to supervise the work.

Zhang said that prolonged rainfalls were the main cause of the
flooding, but that a build-up of sediment in the middle and lower

<HEADLINE> No Coalition Before Funcinpec's Demands Met, Ranariddh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Funcinpec Party will not
join any coalition before its demands are met, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, former first Cambodian prime minister and president of
Funcinpec, said Thursday at his residence in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec had already filed a formal complaint Wednesday to the
National Election Committee on alleged election irregularities.
</P>
<P>
It demanded that in some constituencies where major
irregularities occurred, such as Battambang, Kompong Cham and
Takeo, the elections should be reorganized and carried out with
proper procedures and observations.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said, "If the demands are not met, if we do not get a
satisfactory response, Funcinpec will never agree to form a
coalition with any other political party."
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Co-Premier Hun Sen, whose Cambodian People's Party
(CPP) is the apparent winner in the multi-party election on July
26, expressed his willingness to form a coalition Thursday with
his rival prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remark when he met with King Norodom Sihanouk
Thursday in Siem Reap. Hun Sen said the king was pleased with the
idea of forming a coalition government with Hun Sen as the prime
minister and officials of his ruling Cambodian People's Party
(CPP) controlling five important ministries.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe the King may be the only one able to resolve
the political stalemate if opposition figures Sam Rainsy and
Ranariddh continue their threat to boycott the election results.

<P>
The repeated repair of the dikes has protected the Yangtze
River Valley since 1954, Zhang says. He has been holding a routine
conference every morning to discuss flood control strategies.
</P>
<P>
The situation has become a national concern. Central government
leaders like President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji have
ordered local governments to use every means possible to fortity
the dikes, and Vice Premier Wen Jiabao has been inspecting flooded
areas for the past several days.
</P>
<P>
All State Council ministries have been told to contribute to
the flood control campaign, and large quantities of flood relief
materiel and funds have been sent to the flood hit areas.
</P>
<P>
The Central Meteorological Station forecast continued rainfall
for the lower reaches of the Yangtze today and tomorrow, and
storms are also expected in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang,
Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, but are expected to ease off after
August 1.

<HEADLINE> Black Announces Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Roger Black, who was dropped from
the British team for the European Championships next month,
announced his retirement from athletics on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Black, silver medalist in the 400m event at the Olympics, had
finished only fourth in the distance at Sunday's AAA (Amateur
Athletic Association) championships, the official trial event,
beaten by Iwan Thomas, Mark Richardson and Solomon Wariso.
</P>
<P>
The British team selectors named three members for the team,
denying Black a chance to race for an unprecedented third title in
the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
Black relinquished his role as British team captain and
announced that Sunday's Grand Prix meeting in Sheffield would be
his last.
</P>
<P>
"After what happened last week there is no way I could now
carry on as team captain," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first two finishers in Sunday's trial were guaranteed a
place in the team while the third spot was open to
selectors'discretion.
</P>
<P>
Despite Wariso saying he would rather run the 200 meters than
the 400, the selectors stuck with him.
</P>
<P>
Black said: "What is the point of having this rule...if ever
there was a case for looking at the fourth-placed finisher then
that was it.
</P>
<P>
"I was devastated when I heard the selectors' decision and I am
still devastated. I believe that my performance on Sunday showed a
major return to my Olympic form.
</P>
<P>
"But I guess 0.03 of a second is worth more than 13 years.
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to become European champion for the third
time...but I feel now that a part of me has been taken away.
</P>
<P>
"If they (selectors) had given me a chance...set me a target
for Sunday, told me to go out and beat everyone then at least that
would have been something...something to aim at, a last chance.
</P>
<P>
"But what they have never given me is a chance."

<HEADLINE> ROK Becoming Popular New Tourist Destination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Korea (ROK) is
expected to become a popular new tourist destination for Chinese
citizens, following a decision by the Chinese Government allowing
people to go there at their own expense.
</P>
<P>
This follows a similar decision for Thailand, Singapore,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Hong Too Pyo, the director of the Korea National Tourism
Organization, told a press conference here today that the number
of ROK visitors to China is expected to go from 1997's 780,000
to a million this year, and the number of Chinese visitors to
ROK to 210,000, with the development of Sino-ROK relations.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that the big devaluation in the Korean won
resulting from the Asian financial crisis has meant more tourists
and a revival of its economy.
</P>
<P>
China's first tour group will be from Guangzhou. There are
three flights from Guangzhou to the ROK every week and more
regular flights between the two countries are expected in the
future. ROK has assigned 35 travel agencies to handle Chinese
tourists, Hong says.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou is holding a tourism fair through August 7th with a
ROK tourist exhibition and promotions of tourist routes
there.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Total Deposits Rise In June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total deposits
rallied in June as more offshore deposits were repatriated to help
 ease liquidity in local banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) noted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Total deposits rose by 1.4 percent in June after two
consecutive months of decline, according to the latest monetary
statistics released by the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong dollar deposits climbed up by one percent in June,
while foreign currency deposits grew by 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA attributed the increase in total deposits to the
repatriation of funds into Hong Kong after the government decided
to exempt profit tax on interest income earned from corporate
deposits.
</P>
<P>
Time deposits posted a considerable increase of 3.7 percent as
depositors were attracted by higher interest rates offered by
banks, but demand and savings deposits fell by 1.9 percent and 7.1
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Total loans and advances declined by 1.8 percent in June due to
the slackening economic activities.

<HEADLINE> CPP Still Ahead in Cambodian Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 30 (Xinhua) -- With more than 50 percent of
about 5 million votes counted, Cambodian People's Party (CPP), the
ruling party, appears to be widening its lead against its rivals,
the Funcinpec party and Sam Rainsy Party, according to results
released by the National Election Committee (NEC) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NEC said that among the 2,948,076 votes counted, CPP has
won 1,218,333 votes while Funcinpec won 935,505 and Sam Rainsy
only received 541,265.
</P>
<P>
NEC spokesman Samraing Kamsan told reporters that out of a
total of 23 constituencies, eleven constituencies had finished
counting votes so far.
</P>
<P>
Complete initial results were expected to be released on August
1, but final results will not come until mid-August.
</P>
<P>
CPP aims to improve on its 1993 electoral showing when the CPP
won 51, that is 42 percent, out of 120 seats, while Funcinpec won
58.
</P>
<P>
With none of the three major parties expected to gain a
two-third majority of the 122 National Assembly seats, everyone
expects that the next Cambodian government will be another
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen has expressed his willingness to
form a coalition with his rival Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh has said his Funcinpec Party will not join any
coalition before its demands are met.

MANILA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
declared Thursday that his government will continue to adhere to
the one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan here, Estrada noted the Chinese government attaches
importance to China's relations with the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign Minister Tang's visit indicated China's sincere hope
for developing Philippine-Chinese ties," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the Philippines' readiness to make joint efforts
with China to push the two countries' relationship to a new high.
</P>
<P>
In reply, the Chinese foreign minister pointed out that
Sino-Philippine friendship enjoys a long history.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the relations between the two countries
have maintained the momentum of development in recent years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation of President Estrada's positive
attitude toward Sino-Philippine ties and his adherence to the
one-China policy.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sino-Philippine Relations Further Strengthened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan paid a two-day visit to the Philippines on July 29-30
after attending the Fifth ASEAN Regional Forum and the ASEAN
Post-Ministerial Conference held here.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Tang met Philippine President Joseph Estrada,
Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Senate President
Marcelo Fernan, and held consultations with his counterpart
Domingo Siazon.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said China attached great importance to the bilateral
ties and the Philippines is willing to work together to push the
relations onto a new stage. Estrada also reiterated his
government's commitment to "sticking to the One China policy."
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the bilateral relations have kept the momentum
of developing forward during the past few years, adding that China
is also willing to make joint efforts with the Philippines to
build a bilateral relationship of "good neighborliness, mutual
trust and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
It was Tang's first visit to the country after he assumed
office early this year. Analysts said the visit further promoted
the friendly relations and cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Philippine relations have been developing on a smooth
and healthy track in various fields since the establishment of
diplomatic ties in 1975, particularly during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
In November, 1996, Chinese President Jiang Zemin attended the
Fourth Informal Leadership Meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation hosted by the Philippines and made a state visit to
the country.
</P>
<P>
During the historic visit, President Jiang and the then
president Fidel Ramos reached consensus on a wide range of issues
of great importance to both countries, developing the bilateral
ties to a new and higher level and promoting peace and stability
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Besides the political field, the two countries also enhanced
their cooperation in economy.
</P>
<P>
According to data released by the Philippine National
Statistics Office, trade between the two nations grew at an
average annual rate of 30 percent from 1993 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Asian financial crisis which started in July last
year, the bilateral trade increased by 20 percent in 1997 to a
total of 1.67 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China has become the 10th biggest market for the Philippines.
For the first four months this year, China imported 132 million
dollars worth of Philippine products, an increase of 64 percent
when compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
China's commitment to maintaining the value of its currency
also contributes to the recovery of the Philippine economy, which
has been battered by the financial crisis and slowed down to a
five-year low.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the exchanges in culture and military between the
two countries also develop smoothly. During the past few years, a
total of 40 cultural delegations and troupes visited the
Philippines, which, in return, sent 23 delegations and troupes to
China.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, two Chinese battleships paid their first visit
to the Philippines and one of them came back in May this year to
attend the centennial celebration of the Philippine Independence.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Says King Pleased With Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, Cambodia, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Incumbent Co-Premier
Hun Sen said after meeting with King Norodom Sihanouk here
Thursday that the monarch "was pleased" with the July 26 election
despite complaints by some political parties.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told a press conference that he briefed the king on the
election and the monarch "was pleased with the peaceful
atmosphere" prevailing during the election.
</P>
<P>
The king's approval of the election seemed important as some
political parties criticized the election which they said was full
of "fraud and irregularities."
</P>
<P>
But international observers termed the election as "free and
fair to a certain extent, which enabled the Cambodian people, in a
credible way, to express their will."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, also vice-president of the ruling Cambodian People's
Party (CPP), lauded the king for his support of the election,
saying without the king's presence in the country, the voting
would not have been a success.
</P>
<P>
He said the king's role could not be replaced and that it was
because of his support that more than 90 percent of the registered
voters participated in the voting.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour meeting between Hun Sen and King Sihanouk took
place in the royal residence at this tree-shaded and quiet city in
northern Cambodia. The king greeted Hun Sen at the entrance, and
the two exchanged a traditional greeting ritual before posing for
pictures.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said the king would stay in Cambodia until the new
National Assembly convenes and the coalition government is formed,
probably in September.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen appeared set to become Cambodia's next prime minister
after partial results indicated the CPP was the winner in the
election. The CPP claimed winning 67 seats in the 122-member
assembly, to be followed by Funcinpec party of Prince Norodom
Ranariddh and the opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP).
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said he received the monarch's acknowledgement of his
plan to form a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
He said "the king was pleased with the idea of forming a
coalition government with Hun Sen as the prime minister and
officials of his ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) which
control five important ministries.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said he told the king that the next government would
apply the system of one prime minister to replace the two-prime
minister system being practiced now.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has been under a government of two premiers since
1993. In July last year, First Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh
was ousted by Hun Sen, leaving a coalition in shambles.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said that for each ministry he -- as the would-be prime
minister -- would appoint a minister and a state secretary in a
power-sharing system for partners in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said the five ministries to be controlled by the CPP
would be national defense, interior, finance, justice and foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said CPP officials would be ministers in the five
ministries, with officials of other parties being state
secretaries.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen noted that "it would not be difficult to allocate the
ministries" because the system of one prime minister would allow
him to be authoritative.
</P>
<P>
"If something (bad) happens, the ministers would not be blamed,
but the prime minister," Hun Sen said, indicating that he should
take the responsibility for state affairs.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said the CPP would like to form a coalition with both
Funcinpec of Prince Norodom Ranariddh and the opposition Sam
Rainsy Party (SRP).
</P>
<P>
He said that with the seats of the CPP and Funcinpec added
together, it would be enough to form a coalition, but he would
like the SRP to join.
</P>
<P>
The CPP, Hun Sen said, would like to mobilize all political
forces and use all resources for the sake of political ability and
social security.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh and SRP leader Sam Rainsy, however, have made it
clear that they refused to join a coalition government with the
CPP, claiming the election was "unjust and unacceptable" because
of fraud.
</P>
<P>
Under Cambodia's Constitution, a party needs a two-thirds
majority, or 82 seats, in the assembly to form a government. If no
single party meets the required quorum, a coalition government has
to be formed with the largest party naming the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy's refusal to cooperate with Hun Sen
raised speculation that Cambodia would be plunged into a political
deadlock after the post-election period.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hun Sen hinted that he would have to get the
constitution changed if his attempt for a coalition government
failed.

<HEADLINE> Riders Continue Tour under Somber Atmosphere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- 103 riders Thursday continued the
Tour de France cycle race from Aix-les-Bains in southeast France
under somber atmosphere and heavy doubt whether the tournament
could end on Champs-Elysee on August 2 or not.
</P>
<P>
The number seven of the general classification of the tour,
Italian Rodolpho Massi of the Casino team, was arrested Wednesday
night by police over suspicion of drug abuse, while some top
riders Thursday withdrew from the match in protest of repeated
police operations.
</P>
<P>
If the riders do not make a stoppage as they did on Wednesday,
they are expected to arrive at Neuchatel in Switzerland at 17:00
local time after a 218.5-kilometer drive with 40 kilometers per
hour.
</P>
<P>
French police also arrested the coach of the Francaise des
Jeux Marc Madiot and the doctor of the Spanish team Once for
suspected infraction of the law on drugs on Wednesday, despite
heavy protest from the riders and dismay of spectators.
</P>
<P>
Massi was reportedly arrested immediately after he arrived at
his hotel in Chambery in southeast France Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
European press has widely expressed pessimism over the chance
for the tour to go until the end.
</P>
<P>
The teams participating in the tour have also dropped from 21
to 15, with Kelme and Vitalicio being the latest to have announced
their withdrawal from the competition on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Virenque, one of the top riders of the outlawed Festina
team, said he would sue the organizer of the tour for damages.

<HEADLINE> China's Flood Control Law Makes Efforts More Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The law has apparently proven
more effective than ever before during the flooding on China's
Yangtze River this year.
</P>
<P>
This is an extremely serious flood, but flood control work has
gone more smoothly mainly because of the Flood Control Law, says
Liu Zhengmin, deputy head of the Flood Control Headquarters in
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
In July, Jiangxi was the first province to use the state of
emergency that is provided for in the law, which went into effect
on January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
This gives officials in charge of flood control efforts more
authority to mobilize manpower and relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
The province has already prepared a program based on the law in
the case of floods like the one that hit in 1954, which claimed
more than 30,000 lives and affected 30 million people.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of Jiangxi were hit by severe flooding in mid-June,
and flood control headquarters have organized 1.5 million
civilians and soldiers for the effort.
</P>
<P>
Headquarters in the provincial capital of Nanchang used one of
the law's provisions to suspend two-day weekends, and met with no
opposition. In another example of the law's usefulness, the city
of Fengcheng in western Jiangxi was repeatedly ordered to provide
sandbags for flood control and the city government moved the
needed materials to areas in the north without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
Zou Huoqing, director of the city's Water Resources Bureau,
says, "In the past, some people would have asked for higher prices
for the supplies, but now the law says everything must aid the
flood control effort."
</P>
<P>
Another example could be seen in Yushang County, where the
headquarters of Shangrao Prefecture decided to release water from
a local reservoir because the water level was dangerously high,
and the county took it philosophically and evacuated 37,000 people
overnight.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, those who failed to take the flood control
law seriously were disciplined. So far, 10 officials in the
province have been given serious Party disciplinary and
administrative warnings, dismissed from their posts, or detained
for dereliction of duty.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ignores Stronger Building Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
Thursday a little stronger, recovering from a dip below 61.00 U.S.
cents overnight, in largely range bound dealings.
</P>
<P>
Late in the local session the local currency jumped almost a
quarter of a U.S. cent, apparently boosted by early European
buying, according to traders.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed here at 61.36 U.S. cents from
61.27 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"All I can suggest is a little bit of European buying coming
into the market," Rothschild treasury manager Paul Macarounas said
of the late market move higher.
</P>
<P>
Weakness in the Japanese yen overnight had caused the
Australian currency to dip initially to 60.90 U.S. cents before
finding support and opening here at 61.66.
</P>
<P>
Macarounas said he expected overnight the Japanese yen would
weaken further against the U.S. dollar and in turn stop short any
rally in the Australian currency.
</P>
<P>
Strong buildings approvals data released by the Australian
Bureau of Statistics Thursday did not cause the market too much
concern.
</P>
<P>
Building approvals rose 8.0 percent in June after falling 6.8
percent in May. In the year to June 1998, building approvals rose
22.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the session here the Australian dollar was buying
87.32 Japanese yen from 86.60 and 1.0862 German marks from 1.0846.

<HEADLINE> China, Philippines Pledge to Intensify Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China and the Philippines Thursday
pledged to further boost their cooperation and solve the question
of the South China Sea peacefully.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press communique issued here after their
consultations here Wednesday and Thursday, Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs
Domingo Siazon agreed "to further intensify cooperation and make
common efforts in promoting a 21st century-oriented partnership of
good-neighborliness, mutual trust and cooperation" between their
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers exchanged views on the question of the South
China Sea and "reaffirmed their belief that the relevant dispute
shall be settled peacefully in accordance with the established
principles of international law, including the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea," according to the communique.
</P>
<P>
Both China and the Philippines claim sovereignty over certain
islands in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the two sides reiterated the importance they
attach to their economic relations and to their cooperation in the
field of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"They agreed to make concerted efforts in promoting the
exchanges and cooperation in the areas of trade, investment, and
science and technology," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides acknowledged the need for a more coordinated
approach and greater regional efforts to resolve the present
financial crisis which has been affecting the economies of East
Asia since July last year, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine side appreciated China's efforts to maintain the
value of the Renminbi.
</P>
<P>
On Cambodia, the two ministers hoped that with the conclusion
of the July 26 elections, "all parties in Cambodia, under the
leadership of King Sihanouk, would exert concerted efforts to
restore stability, promote unity in the country and develop the
economy in the spirit of national reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
Over the nuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan in
May, Tang and Siazon expressed "grave concern," saying the tests
"undermine international efforts to curb nuclear non-proliferation
and promote nuclear disarmament."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tang arrived here on July 26 to attend annual
meetings of the ASEAN Regional Forum and Post-Ministerial
Conference, at which China is a dialogue partner, and started
bilateral talks with Secretary of Foreign Affairs Wednesday at the
10th Foreign Ministry Consultations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to end his visit to the Philippines and leave
for Malaysia Friday.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis:  Housing Commercialization To Revitalize China's Property Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China will cease the decades-long
practice of distributing welfare housing to urban residents in the
latter half of this year. This indicates a substantial change in
the urban residential system.
</P>
<P>
Under the government plan, higher income earners can buy
magnificent houses at market price while middle class families are
provided with economical flats at cost prices. As for those with
financial difficulties, the government will offer them housing at
low rents.
</P>
<P>
China's urban residents have been living in housing allocated
free of charge by the government since New China was founded in
1949. People just paid very low rents each month to the government
and the government took care of all repairs.
</P>
<P>
The result of this welfare housing distribution policy was that
more and more residents had to wait for housing, despite the large
amount of money the government channeled to residential housing
construction every year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that now China has more than three million
families with less than four square meters of living space per
person.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, the government listed
commercialization of housing as one of the five major reforms for
1998 in a bid to expand domestic demand and promote economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Termination of the practice of welfare residential housing
distribution will bring about a major change: institutional
purchases will be reduced by a wide margin, while individual
homebuyers will increase, said a Chinese economist.
</P>
<P>
This move is expected to stimulate the development of China's
real estate market, which has been experiencing a recess for a
long time, and revitalize the nation's economy, he added.

tonnes per year to provide for Syria's increasing needs for this
substance, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two new factories will bridge the gap between Syria's
consumption of some 4 million tonnes per year and its actual
production of approximately 3 million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
A number of Egyptian experts will travel to Syria soon to
examine the implementation of this venture which will take 18
months to complete, chairman of the joint Holding Company for
Mining Mohamed Sayed Desouki said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The experts will also assist in the expansion and modernization
of Syrian cement factories, he added.
</P>

a total production capacity of 1,200 tonnes a day, Thursday's Arab
daily "Al Hayat" reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Atrab" general manager Ezzeddin Al Awad, the
new project, which pertains to a UAE national company, will be
established in Fujera emirate along the eastern coast of the UAE.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Use More Farm Machinery in Rice Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China is working hard to spread
the use of agricultural machinery in rice production to ensure
adequate grain supplies, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The measures include producing more small machines, providing
more services for farmers, and launching the use of agro-machines
on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
A research project, with total investment of 2.55 million yuan,
has developed seven types of new machines for rice farming since
it was listed as a state key project in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Rice, accounting for 40 percent of China's total grain output,
is expected to play an even more important role in China's grain
supplies. China now feeds 20 percent of the world's population
with seven percent of the world's arable land. To ensure grain
supplies, the country plans to produce some 500 million tons of
grain by the year 2000, of which, rice will account for nearly
half.
</P>
<P>
But rice-growing areas, especially those producing early rice
in the southern part of the country, have declined over the past
number of years. Statistics show that the planting area of early
rice this year dropped by 4.4 percent over that of last year.
</P>
<P>
An official from the ministry attributed the drop partly to the
low level of mechanization. Rice production requires more labor
compared with other crops such as wheat and corn. And only 2.8
percent of the transplanting of rice seedlings, and 3.7 percent of
the sowing of rice are done by machines.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the scarcity and comparatively high price of
machinery are the major reasons their use has lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that with improved living standards,
Chinese farmers are welcoming new and applicable machinery. The
good harvests for the past three years also has laid a solid
foundation for the spread of machine utilization.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, by the year 2010 machines will be used
on a large scale in economically developed and major rice-growing
areas.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis:  Housing Commercialization To Revitalize China's Property Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent sample survey of urban residents shows that 33 percent
of families own their residence and 61 percent live in housing
rented from their work units or from individuals.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body, requires a
readjustment of the housing investment structure, with an emphasis
on building more economical apartments for medium-and-low income
earners. Construction costs should be reduced to a level
affordable for ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Yu Zhengsheng, minister of construction, ordered that the
building of residential housing, especially economical housing, be
accelerated, and that the sector make a positive contribution to
meeting the state economic target of eight-percent growth this
year.
</P>
<P>
All commercial banks will issue housing loans to individuals in
cities, call off the limits on loans for residential housing and
prolong the term of housing loans.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth development of housing reform, the
People's Bank of China announced at the beginning of the year that
it will set aside 100 billion yuan as loans for housing purchase
and development. On July 1, the Bank reduced the interest rate for
savings deposits and bank loans.
</P>
<P>
With implementation of all these government policies,
economists predict that a new upsurge of high consumption centered
around housing will take shape in the next two or three
years. Then, over 50 trades such as construction and real estate
will be revitalized, forming a new aspect of economic growth in
China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier's Tour Of Flood-Ravaged Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao, the head
of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, on the
final day of his visit to flooded parts of China, asked people to
keep their spirits up as the year's third flood peak of the
Yangtze River passes.
</P>
<P>
Wen visited central and eastern provinces of Hubei, Hunan,
Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu from July 27-30 and said that the
battle against flooding was proof that China can survive various
natural disasters under the leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core and the State
Council, China's highest administrative body.
</P>
<P>
The people, People's Liberation Army soldiers and armed police
officers have won a great victory over the flooding and have
succeeded in protecting the embankments of the Yangtze, major
cities, and trunk transportation lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
But, he warned, the flood situation is still serious and water
levels are still high and the people and materiels have been
stretched to the breaking point after the month-long battle
against the flood.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more rain is expected in the Yangtze River Basin,
he said, and asked local people to be on their guard and to
continue to watch out for the embankments.
</P>
<P>
Wen asked local governments to look after the daily needs of
flood victims, taking care of food, clothing, drinking water,
lodging, medical services, and security.
</P>
<P>
He called on officials and people in flooded-affected areas to
rebuilt their homes and resume production promptly in the spirit
of self-reliance and working hard.

PARIS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Two Spanish teams, Kelme and
Vitalcio, quit Thursday the Tour de France, adding to five the
number that have pulled out of the race in protest of drug
investigation undertaken by the police.
</P>
<P>
The two teams joined ONCE, Riso-Scotti and Banesto in quitting
the drug-plagued competition.
</P>
<P>
The Festina was expelled by the Tour for systematic doping in
earlier stage, leaving 15 teams staying in the race.

Only the two World Wars have halted the world most prestigious
cycling competition since 1903.
</P>
<P>
But now almost 100 cyclists have left the race with just three
days away from the Paris finish line.
</P>
<P>
Competitors were angry with the investigation carried out by
the police who showed no respect to the entrants, the cyclists
said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the revolt, the 18th stage started on schedule shortly
after 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT) in Aix-les-Bains, France, and headed

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreign banks in South
Africa have believed that there are too many overseas financial
institutions in the country to make enough business, local daily
Business Day quoted a survey by Canadian academic Brian Metcalfe
as reporting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"More than 75 foreign banks have a presence in the South
African market, but 78 percent of those interviewed are calling
the market overbanked, with not enough business for everyone,"
said Tom Winterboer, who was involved in doing the survey.
</P>
<P>
Five of the 28 banks interviewed acknowledged that their
profit over the past three years was "less than expected".
</P>
<P>
There would be 55 foreign banks left in South Africa in five
years' time, the researchers predicted.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign banks that currently have only representative
offices here could close their doors due to high costs and
competition.
</P>
<P>
"Only the big foreign banks will be left and small niche
players," the survey said.

LAGOS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The West African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG has declared ceasefire in Sierra Leone, in response
to that announced last Saturday by rebel leader Foday Sankoh,
according to report from Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire order was given by Brigadier Maxwell Khobe,
commander of the ECOMOG force in Sierra Leone and newly-appointed
Acting Chief of Defense of Staff of the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front that
allied with the overthrown military regime of Major Johnny Paul
Koromah, appeared on state television last Saturday, calling on
forces loyal to him to observe ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
He made the call soon after returning to Sierra Leone from
Nigeria, where he had been in detention since last February.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG's response came amidst repeated calls from
international organizations and individuals suing for caution on
putting Sankoh on trial.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who was ousted by
Koromah and restored to power by ECOMOG last March, has been
urged to embark on dialogue and reconciliation to sustain peace
and stability.

stable good-neighbor cooperative relationship between the two
countries in the long run is in the fundamental interest of the
two nations and the two peoples, and such ties are also beneficial
to the peace and development in the Asia-Pacific region and the whole
world.

<HEADLINE> China to Issue First Convertible Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Convertible bonds are expected to
debut soon on China's capital market, with the Nanning Chemical
Co. Ltd in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region taking the lead by
issuing 150 million yuan's worth of them.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of the first such bonds is being hailed as another
important move to further explore the capital market, raise funds
for cash-strapped Chinese enterprises, and thereby facilitate
the reform of state enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that China will need trillions of yuan to
restructure the state-owned sector, and most of this money is
expected to be raised by the enterprises themselves.
</P>
<P>
Convertible bonds are designed as a fund-pooling product for
the capital market that promises both low risk and high yield.
The investors are able to realize principle and interest if the
bonds are not converted, and the return can be very high if the
bond-issuer becomes listed and the bonds are converted into stock
shares.
</P>
<P>
China sets the quota for convertible bond at four billion yuan
this year, right after the unveiling of a set of provisions
governing the management of such bonds. The convertible bonds
will be offered on a trial basis for the present, with the
companies mainly selected from unlisted key state
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Nanning Chemical Co. Ltd will issue 1.5 million units of
such bonds at a per unit price of 100 yuan. Public offering is
expected to begin in a few days. Right after the placement, the
bonds will be listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Mainly producers of chemical products such as caustic soda,
ethylene chlorid and dipterex, the Nanning Chemical Co.Ltd
realized a net per share profit of 0.13 yuan in 1997.

<HEADLINE> HK Red Cross to Raise Fund for Mainland Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Red Cross (HKRC)
on Thursday appealed Hong Kong residents to donate for victims in
flood stricken areas in China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held Thursday afternoon, HKRC Assistant
Secretary General Wilson Wong said that the HKRC hoped to raise 10
million HK dollars (1.28 million U.S. dollars) for 270,000 victims
in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi and Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
The funds raised could provide food and medicine for sustaining
victims' livelihood for one month, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
In response to appeals by the Chinese Red Cross, HKRC has
mobilized 600,000 RMB (72,290 U.S. dollars) and has sent 450,000
HK dollars (57,692 U.S. dollars) worth of medicaments to Hunan,
Jiangxi and Guangdong in support of the respective Red Cross
relief operations.
</P>
<P>
HKRC also sent staff to visit the disaster areas and conduct
relief distribution.
</P>
<P>
Ivy Wu, assistant director of HKRC, commented that this years'
flood was of a much bigger scale than previous ones, thus leading
to enormous destruction.
</P>
<P>
She added that the victims would face extreme hardship in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Red Cross has submitted an application for 3
million HK dollars (384,615 U.S. dollars) to the Hong Kong
Government Disaster Relief Fund in aid of the relief operations.
</P>
<P>
This Sunday, HKRC will organize a street fund-raising campaign,
where photos of disaster areas will be exhibited, at various
public areas.

<HEADLINE> S. African Blast Victims Members of Vigilante </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The two men who died in a
pipe bomb blast inside their vehicle in Cape Town early Thursday
morning were members of a vigilante group, People Against
Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad), a Pagad spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A third man, who was injured in the explosion, was arrested
and taken to hospital under police guard, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
SAPA said Pagad spokesman Cassiem Parker confirmed the
deceased, Mogammat Allie and Faziel Hendriks, were members of
Pagad.
</P>
<P>
"We have no problem acknowledging they were Pagad members, but
we take exception to the police's claim they were on their way to
bomb a house.
</P>
<P>
"Both men were neighborhood watch members and could have been
on patrol.
</P>
<P>
"From our own investigations we cannot conclude the explosion
was of their own making. We are saying that an explosive device
could have been thrown into their Bakkie (Afrikaans name for a
light delivery vehicle) when they stopped on the corner of Derby
and Walnut streets in Lansdowne," Parker said.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Wicus Holtzhausen said the vehicle was registered
in the name of the injured man.
</P>
<P>
"What we do find strange is that the number plates of the
Bakkie were removed. Why drive around in your own registered
vehicle and remove the number plates?"
</P>
<P>
Police found a revolver, a pistol and short gun, as well as
two mobile phones and a two-way radio inside the Bakkie.
</P>
<P>
"We are investigating the possibility that the men were on
their way to bomb a target when the device exploded. We are also
investigating a report that two prominent Pagad leaders were
noticed at the scene minutes after the explosion," Holtzhausen
said.
</P>
<P>
He said bomb fragments and the firearms would be sent for
forensic tests to establish whether they could be linked to
previous blasts and attacks on the Cape Flats.
</P>
<P>
Cape Flats, a residential area between Cape Town and Cape Town
International Airport, was notorious for gang violence.

<P>
JINAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Sun Yanzi, a fourth-grade student
in Tongyilu Primary School in Weihai, Shandong Province, has just
returned home from a beach-cleaning outing organized by her school.
</P>
<P>
Though feeling "tired," she said she was a willing participant
in the activity. "My feet will not be hurt next time when I go to
swim, because now the beach is clean."
</P>
<P>
In fact, Sun takes part in such activities nearly every
month. In addition to that, she, along with other primary school
students in this small coastal city, study a subject in school
called "Weihai's Nature."
</P>
<P>
There are pictures of Weihai's well-known mountains and rivers
in her schoolbook, along with a list of awards the city has
received from the central government: China's first State Hygienic
City, and State Park City. It was also named a national advanced
city for treatment of the environment and for planning.
</P>
<P>
Adults in Weihai may also receive instruction on environmental
protection from time to time. One can see along the streets
slogans such as "Good Environment Needs Your Protection."
</P>
<P>
"What we want to do is make our residents proud of their home
and to enhance their awareness of protecting the environment, "
said Li Shuchun, director of the Weihai City Environmental
Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Besides teaching residents to protect the environment, Weihai

"No matter how attractive the would-be profit, a project
with pollution is not our target," said Li, adding that the ideal
model for his city is an "ecological coastal city with high-tech
as the backbone industry."
</P>
<P>
With the efforts made by the residents and the local
government, all the city's environmental quality indexes have
remained above the country's average for years.
</P>
<P>
But a good environment hasn't hindered the economic development
of the city. Weihai has been listed as one of China's top 50
economic-strength cities and one of the top 40 investment
environment cities.
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has established trade relations with more than
70 countries and regions and approved some 2,000 foreign-funded
firms.
</P>
<P>
A survey made in 1997 shows that 90 percent of the foreign
investors were satisfied with the investment and living
environment in Weihai.
</P>
<P>
Weihai Hamada Printing Press Co. Ltd is a Japanese-funded
company. Factory director Susumu Iwase has been living in Weihai
for two years and said, "There's no difference between living here
and in my hometown in Japan, and I am used to living here."
</P>
<P>
While attracting many foreign investors, the pleasant
environment and the eye-catching landscape attracts tourists from
home and abroad. In the past ten years, the city has welcomed more
than 34 million tourists.

Talking about the Asian economic crisis, she said, "with
today's global market problems, (problems) in one place can and do
affect people every place," adding that "nations that export to
Asia are being hurt."
</P>
<P>
"But the potential costs are far greater than lost exports.
Misery can give rise to mistrust among nations; poverty can push
desperate people across borders."
</P>

Albright said no nation had been hit harder by the crisis than
Indonesia. "The United States is determined, and I know Australia
is, to help Indonesia meet the humanitarian needs of its people,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"We both hope Indonesia will emerge from this crisis not only
as strong and prosperous as ever, but with the commitment to
democracy it needs to stay strong and prosperous for good."
</P>
<P>
While talking about the U.S. relations with Australia, she
said, "obviously, we do not always see eye to eye, in some
economic sectors, we are competitors as well as partners."
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the South Asia nuclear tests, she said, "we
agree that the nuclear non-proliferation regime must be buttressed
and its value reemphasized. Every effort must be made to reduce
tensions and prevent a nuclear arms race in the region".

<HEADLINE> Egypt Threatens to Combat EU's Measure Against Its </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has threatened to cut its
trade with some European countries if the European Union (EU)
imposes anti-dumping duties on Egyptian unbleached cotton exports,
the Egyptian Gazette reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The EU's executive body is believed to have proposed
anti-dumping duties averaging 12 percent on imports of unbleached
cotton fabric from some countries including Egypt, India,
Indonesia and Pakistan, accusing them of unfairly selling their
products in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Egyptian Trade and Supply Minister Ahmed
Gowaili as saying that the concerned government agencies will take
firm measures and review its contracts with the EU states that
take an anti-Egypt stand.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's annual imports from the EU averaged 5 billion
U.S. dollars, while exports were about 1.7 billion dollars, of
which oil products alone account for more than 41 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Messalam, vice chairman of the state-owned Misr Fine
Weaving and Spinning, said that Egypt's threatened boycott should
target the entire EU.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Africa's largest cotton producer, exports about 20,000
tonnes a year of unbleached cotton worth about 147,000 dollars, an
industry official has said. "This is all more or less to Europe."
</P>
<P>
Under EU anti-dumping rules, the European Commission may of its
own accord impose provisional anti-dumping duties for six months
on goods it concludes are sold at unfairly low prices in the EU.
</P>
<P>
After that, the European Commission may ask for definitive
duties for five years, but needs the approval of a majority of EU
member states.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Relaxes Visa Rules for Indian Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has relaxed visa
rules effective from Thursday for Indian nationals visiting
Malaysia as tourists.
</P>
<P>
The move is on the recommendation of the National Economic
Action Council (NEAC) to contribute to the growth of the tourist
industry and promote related economic activities and the move
would not be prejudicial to national security, Deputy Home
Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
For Indian nationals, they could get multiple entry visas from
Malaysian diplomatic missions in India if they could prove they
were businessmen, tourists, VIPs or government officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
Multiple entry visas could also be issued to Indian permanent
residents in third countries and those holding employment/work
passes and also to close family members for a five-year period, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Indian nationals could also be issued with single entry visas
for a three-month period if the Malaysian diplomatic mission was
satisfied with their financial standing, he said.
</P>
<P>
They would however be allowed to stay only for a maximum period
of 30 days per entry and extension of the visit pass would only be
made by the immigration.
</P>
<P>
"Entry for the purposes of tourism or business need not be
sponsored by anyone whereas previously an applicant for a business
visit pass should produce a letter of invitation from his
Malaysian counterpart," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the applicant was not required to personally hand
over his application at Malaysian diplomatic missions abroad
unlike previously.
</P>
<P>
"These facilities are far better than that provided before when
those wishing to come as tourists should come in groups and have
sponsors. This is a big concession," he said.

NEW DELHI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- All six people, three crew
members and three passengers, of an Alliance Air Donier aircraft
were charred to death when the aircraft crashed while taking off
from the Kochi airport in the far southwest of India Thursday.
</P>

The aircraft was bound for Thriuvananthapuram, capital of
Kerala, from the port city of Kochi when the aircraft caught fire
and crashed, Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second report of aircraft crash this week. On
Monday a Mig-21 fighter plane crashed in India's eastern state of
Assam.
</P>
<P>
While four of the victims died on the spot, two were declared
dead at the hospital in Kochi city. Fire fighters fought the
flames in vain in an attempt to rescue all of them.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Issues National Bonds </HEADLINE>

<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian Great Hural Council
Thursday passed a resolution to allow the government to issue 20
billion Tugrik (about 24 million U.S. dollars) worth of national
bonds this year to alleviate the country's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
One third of the budget revenue was lacking in the first six
months and foreign trade deficit in the period reached 89.8
million U.S. dollars due to the financial turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's foreign exchange reserve had dwindled
to 75.7 million dollars by the end of June as against 120 million
last year, which led to a drop in the exchange rate of the local
currency against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Bureau predicted a national budget
deficit of 27.2 billion Tugrik (about 32 million dollars) for the
first half of the year.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Norway has decided to extend its
whale hunt by two weeks until August 14, said Norwegian Fisheries
Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The hunting season will end as originally planned on July 31 in
the North Sea, the Ministry added.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian whalers have captured 581 whales so far this year,
lower than the allowed 671 catching number, which is the highest
quota since the country resumed commercial whaling in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Following an international ban on the export of whale meat and
products, Norway consumes whale products domestically. Eager
interest at the beginning of the season in May has dwindled, and
prices for the meat have fallen to around 3.6 U.S. dollars per
kilogram from 5.33 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Obuchi Elected New Japanese Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party president Keizo Obuchi was elected Prime Minister by
Parliament Thursday despite dissent from the Upper House.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, 61, was named Prime Minister by the Lower House,
polling 268 of 494 valid votes in the LDP-controlled Lower House.
</P>
<P>
Naoto Kan of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) got 164 votes
and other opposition leaders split the remainder of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-dominated Upper House elected Kan as the Prime
Minister, who won a runoff election with 142 votes to Obuchi's 103.
</P>
<P>
Under the Japanese Constitution, the Lower House has the power
to reject the Upper House in the vote for Prime Minister. Obuchi
was declared the winner after a conference between the two
Chambers failed to come up with a compromise. It was the first
time the Chambers had split over who should be Prime Minister
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi succeeded Ryutaro Hashimoto, who resigned after two and
half years in power to take the blame for a major setback suffered
by the LDP in the July 12 Upper House election.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, who vowed to form an "economic reconstruction"
administration after winning a three-way LDP leadership race last
week, moved quickly to pick a cabinet, choosing former Prime
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa as Finance Minister.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi is expected to unveil the formal lineup of his cabinet
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's election took place on the first day of a 70-day
extraordinary Parliament session, which is expected to take up a
series of government bills aimed at putting Japan's financial
sector back on its feet.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Lower House Names Obuchi PM, Upper House Rejects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Lower House Thursday elected
Keizo Obuchi, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's president as
the next Prime Minister, but the Upper House rejected Obuchi's
nomination as a token protest.
</P>
<P>
In the opposition-dominated Upper House, opposition Democratic
Party of Japan (DPJ) leader Naoto Kan was named Prime Minister in
a runoff following splits of votes in the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, 61, polled 268 of 494 valid votes in the LDP-controlled
Lower House, which has final say in selecting a Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Kan's selection as Prime Minister in the Upper House means the
timing of Obuchi's formal designation as Prime Minister and the
subsequent announcement of a cabinet lineup would be pushed into
late afternoon to allow the election procedure run its course.
</P>
<P>
With the two Houses picking different persons, a meeting of the
Conference Committee of Both Houses will be called later Thursday
to seek a consensus.
</P>
<P>
When the committee fails to work out a consensus, the Lower
House selection will be Parliament's final decision under the
Japanese Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The election, which took place on the first day of a 70-day
extraordinary Diet (parliament) session, was held to elect a
successor to Ryutaro Hashimoto, who tendered his resignation after
the LDP suffered a major setback in the July 12 Upper House
election.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Begins Annual Dig of Bronze Age Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 30 (Xinhua) -- This year's excavation on one of
the most important Bronze Age sites in the Middle East located in
Lebanon will last longer than usual, the Daily Star newspaper said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A group of French and Lebanese archaeology students and 20
local workers, headed by French archaeologist Jean Paul Tilman,
began the dig Monday in Tell Arga in northern Lebanon's Akkar.
</P>
<P>
Tilman said that the excavation that began in 1972 has been
reduced to an annual six-week project for lack of fund, but the
program can last two more weeks this year to end on September 20.
</P>
<P>
Several artifacts have been unearthed, including clay pots,
jugs and old water tanks, Tilman said.
</P>
<P>
The 6,000-year-old site is believed to be host for several
civilizations, including the Roman civilization judged by the
Roman remains found in the site.
</P>
<P>
Tilman, urging full support from Lebanese government, said the
excavation project is currently backed by donations from France.

<HEADLINE> Stable Economic Growth In Northwest China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
saw stable economic growth during the first half of this year,
with its GDP rising 7.7 percent from the same 1997 period to reach
nearly 29.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the six-month period, local retail sales of consumer
goods grew by 7.3 percent from the same 1997 period to exceed 13.8
billion yuan, while the growth rate of the price index declined
1.27 percent. This has provided a good foundation for the
province's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Spring sowing areas in the province reached more than 1.86
million hectares, 12,200 hectares more than last year's.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to abundant rainfall since April, the province is
expected to havest nearly 4.42 million tons of summer grain this
year.
</P>
<P>
Local state industrial enterprises and non-state industrial
enterprises, each with more than five million yuan in annual
sales, generated a total of nearly 10.2 billion yuan in added
value during the first half of this year, a 5.6 percent rise from
the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Local fixed-asset investment climbed 14.8 percent to reach 7.8
billion yuan during the January-June period. Some 60 percent of
all spending on infrustructure construction is being used for
water conservancy, power, transportation, and postal and telecom
services.
</P>
<P>
The province added 20 overseas-funded enterprises this year,
involving more than 46 million U.S. dollars in investment.
</P>
<P>
It also did 188 million U.S. dollars worth of export business
during the first half of this year, a slight rise from the same
1997 period.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR, Britain Sign Investment Promotion Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China and Britain signed an
agreement for the promotion and protection of investments here
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such agreement for Hong Kong to sign since it
returned to China in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Chau Tak Hay, Secretary for Trade and Industry of the HKSAR,
and Sir Andrew Burns, consul-general of Britain in Hong Kong,
signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the HKSAR and British governments will
provide for equal treatment of investors, compensation if
investments are expropriated, and free transfer of investments and
returns.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also provides for the settlement of investment
disputes in accordance with internationally accepted rules. It is
effective for 15 years in the first instance, and will remain in
force indefinitely unless terminated by either party.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Chau said that the agreement will
further strengthen trade and economic ties between the HKSAR and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign investment has played an important part in
Hong Kong's economic success. Hong Kong's attractions as a
destination for foreign investment are manifold.
</P>
<P>
"We offer a level playing field to all investors, regardless of
origin; we provide a competitive and business-friendly environment
in which local as well as foreign enterprises can prosper; and our
well-established and impartial legal system ensures that all
investments are protected by the rule of law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that the signing of this agreement will further
encourage investor confidence and investment flows between Hong
Kong and Britain, which will promote even greater bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
he said: "Britain and the HKSAR already have a trading
relationship of which we can both be proud."
</P>
<P>
British visible exports to Hong Kong in 1997 grew by 10
percent, reaching 40 billion HK dollars (5.13 billion U.S.
dollars). This makes Hong Kong Britain's 12th biggest market.
</P>
<P>
For a market of only 6.5 million people, that is a tremendous
reflection of the strength of demand here for British products.
This is recognized by the more than 1,000 British companies which
operate here, he added.
</P>
<P>
This is the 15th investment promotion and protection agreement
that Hong Kong has signed. Hong Kong has signed similar agreements
with the Netherlands, Australia, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, New
Zealand, Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria,
japan and the Republic of Korea.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Hezbollah Current Leader Reelected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The leader of Lebanon's
anti-Israeli Muslim group Hezbollah Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah has
been elected as the party's secretary-general for a third
consecutive term, the Daily Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The party's congress, which had been convening for a month in a
secret location in Beirut's southern suburbs, held its final
session on Tuesday during which the term of the 40-year-old
Nasrallah was extended for another three years, the paper quoted a
Hezbollah source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The party's charter, which limits the tenure of a
secretary-general to a maximum of two consecutive three-year
terms, was amended to allow for Nasrallah's reelection.
</P>
<P>
The party's deputy secretary-general Sheikh Naim Qassem, party
politburo chief Mohammed Raad and key members of the seven-man
Shura council also retained their posts.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the feats of the party's military
wing in the guerrilla war against Israel in south Lebanon and the
stunning victories the group scored in Lebanon's recent local
elections have contributed to the unanimous reelection of the
current leadership.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, was established
in 1982 with the final aim of ousting Jewish enemies and creating
an Islamic state in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer self-styled security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985 under the pretext of protecting its
north from Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war in the country
trying to oust Israeli forces from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Complete New Book on Marxism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China recently published a book
recounting the vicissitudes of Marxism in China over the past
century.
</P>
<P>
"Marxism in China Over the Past 100 years," a work containing
over 640,000 characters, is the most systematical publication in
its category, according to Ding Shouhe, who served as an advisor
on the book written by scholars throughout China.
</P>
<P>
Marxism was introduced to China around 1889 as one of the
Western philosophies Chinese intellectuals determined could be
used to save the country which was being invaded by Western powers.
</P>
<P>
The theory, which Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping refined in line
with conditions in China, is the guiding ideology of the State and
the Communist Party of China which is the largest communist
organization in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The book exhibits new materials summarizing historical
experience," said Li Ben, a scholar from the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences. He explained that the book effectively analyzes
both the setbacks and successes of Marxism.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the recent nationwide fever to publish books on
Marxism indicates that academia has an even greater interest in
the theory as it relates many contending thoughts characteristic
of the so-called Information Age.
</P>
<P>
"The book illustrates the validity of the truths of Marxism,"
said Li.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 150th anniversary of the publication of the
"Communist Manifesto," and celebrations will abound throughout
China.

<HEADLINE> Expert on Flood Control Role of Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Three Gorges Water
Conservation Project, a major project to harness and develop the
Yangtze River waters, represents the key in controlling floods in
the middle and lower reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
The project, scheduled for completion in the year 2009, will
basically end the chance for devastating floods along the
Jingjiang River in Hubei Province. The Jingjiang has historically
recorded the heaviest flooding of any Yangtze tributary and has
essentially served as a barrier protecting the safety of five
million people in major downstream cities such as Wuhan, according
to Professor Liu Chongrong, a well-known water conservationist.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that China has been forced to engage in massive flood
control efforts along the Yangtze on an annual basis due mainly to
the huge volume of flood water flowing along the mainstream and
inadequate water diversion facilities in the area.
</P>
<P>
"The prevailing flood situation would be far less severe if the
Three Gorges Project were in operation," said Liu, adding that the
massive reservoir is designed to store 22.15 billion cu.m. of water
and will considerably reduce flooding along the Jingjiang River
and at Dongting Lake.
</P>
<P>
The Jingjiang levees are designed to contain 40-year floods,
while the Three Gorges Project will increase the flood water
containment capacity to 100-year floods.
</P>
<P>
However, the project will not total guarantee flood control
along the Yangtze, and various other flood diversion projects are
needed in the middle and lower reaches of the river, as well as new
reservoirs and dredging operations, according to Liu.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Urged to Ease Water Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenya urgently requires a
comprehensive water policy so as to defuse the pressure on the
country's socio-economic development, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Currently, access to water remains a major problem in rural
Kenya and among the country's poor urban dwellers, the experts
were quoted by Thursday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that over 50 per cent of the rural
population and more than 25 per cent of the urban population in
the east African country have no access to clean water, according
to the press report.
</P>
<P>
A water and sanitation policy symposium said recently that
although water management has had a ministerial portfolio since
1974, the Kenyan government fails to develop a clear policy on
its use and conversation.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water of Kenya spends about 13 per cent of
total government expenditure on water projects and activities
annually, an amount that is also supplemented by many
non-governmental organizations working in the water sector.
</P>
<P>

which should include the protection of water sources, its
conservation, harvesting, treatment, storage, supply systems
development and equal access by all citizens, the experts urged.

ANKARA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish Parliament is expected to discuss on Thursday
the proposal by its constitutional commission that the date of the
municipal and general elections be rescheduled from April 26, 1999
to April 18, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the change is the worries that the three-day
official holidays starting on April 23 might decrease the turnout.
</P>

village near the Turkish border city of Edirne last night and
Turkish soldiers immediately fired back in self-defense.

There were no report of casualties and it remained unknown why
the Greek troops fired at the civilian targets, Turkish military
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning):

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Former world women's top-class
players Monica Seles of the United States and Steffi Graf of
Germany won their second round matches in the Bank of the West
women's tournament in Stanford, California, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Seles, winner of this tournament in 1990 and 1992, rallied from
one set down to win over the unseeded challenger Li Fang of China
2-6, 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
In the other late match Wednesday, Graf, fourth seed and No.57
in the world, romped Mary Joe Fernandez of the United States 6-4,
6-0 to reach the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Graf appeared to be frustrated in the first set against
Fernandez, shaking her head after missed shots.
</P>
<P>
Her frustration was enhanced by a fault call, which she briefly
argued. In the second set, the frustration was passed to
Fernandez, currently ranked No. 49.
</P>
<P>
After an eight-month layoff because of knee surgery, Graf
returned to tennis in February at Hanover, then injured a
hamstring in her next tournament at Indian Wells. The Bank of the
West is her eighth tournament this year.
</P>
<P>
"Every match I play puts me a step further to where I want to
be," Graf said.
</P>
<P>
World No. 3 Lindsay Davenport of the United States, top seed
here, eliminated her compatriot Kimberly Po 6-1, 6-3 within an
hour.
</P>
<P>
Davenport has reached the quarterfinals in all but two of the
12 tournaments she has played this year.
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded Natasha Zvereva of Belarus ousted American Tara
Snyder 6-3, 6-4 and Joanette Kruger of South Africa came back to

<HEADLINE> Zambian President No Intention to Seek Third Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba's press aide has said that Chiluba will not seek
re-election for the third term in the interests of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Richard Sakala, also State House spokesman, said in a news
briefing here Wednesday that there is no need for Chiluba to
contest the elections as doing so would not be in line with the
provisions of the country's constitution, Times of Zambia
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who came into power in 1991 and was re-elected in
1996, could not serve a third time since the country's
constitution stipulates that a president can only have two
five-year terms.
</P>
<P>
But earlier reports said that Chiluba is in the process to
make amendments to the current constitution in a bid to contest
in the next general elections.
</P>
<P>
Sakala said that the president is not campaigning and it is
the policy of the ruling Movement for Muti-party Democracy (MMD)
to be consistent and that the president has no intentions
whatsoever to stand.
</P>
<P>
He also refuted the reports that the Zambian government is in
the process of amending the constitution to reverse the clause on
citizenship, saying this will not happen since the clause is not
meant for any individual.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's current constitution says that only the Zambians
whose parents are also Zambians can run for the presidency.
Therefore, former president and opposition leader Kenneth Kaunda
was disqualified in the 1996 elections.

<P>
PARIS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion and world record
holder Donovan Bailey of Canada regained his form from a defeat at
the Goodwill Games to win the 100 meters at an IAAF Grand Prix
athletics meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who had finished a lowly seventh at the Goodwill Games
in New York last week, stormed home ahead of Trinidad and Tobago's
Ato Boldon and Namibia's Frankie Fredericks in a time of 10.02
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Bailey dominated the all-star field from the final 50 meters,
while world champion Micheal Greene of the United States, winner
of the Goodwill Games, finished last in the eight-man field in
10.39.
</P>
<P>
"I'm back but then I was always here," said Bailey, who set the
world record of 9.84 at the Atlanta Olympics. "I'm still not in
shape right now, I'm still not in racing form."
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the old me, I just want to get back in shape and be
consistent. I just have to relax and get back to my old self."
</P>
<P>
Marion Jones led the women's 100m, scoring the second best time
of the season of 10.88 seconds to remain undefeated in the sprint
despite the rain and cold weather.
</P>
<P>
Jones completed her gold double, as well as what she performed
at the Goodwill Games, by claiming the title of the long jump with
a leap of 6.97 meters.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Media On Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese media are increasing
their presence on the Internet in order to meet the challenges of
the cyberspace age.
</P>
<P>
People's Daily, the voice of the Communist Party of China, has
two million hits on its web page every day.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet has the advantages of speed, content and
accessibility over newspapers, radio and TV. Therefore we are not
to be left outside the arena, " Liao Hong of the Internet edition
of the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the China Internet Information
Center (CIIC), China has 127 newspapers that now have Internet
websites. Chinese radio and TV stations have also put their
programs on the 'net.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet will be a major sources of revenue for our
newspaper in the next century," a reporter from the
Guangzhou-based South China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
The South China Daily Press Group in Guangdong Province has put
the content of all five of its daily newspapers and one magazine
on the Internet. In June, more than 400,000 people visited the
website of the Daily, which has a circulation of 800,000.
</P>
<P>
"As a local newspaper, we must use the Internet to expand our
readership," the reporter said.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 3,000 newspapers competing for readers.
</P>
<P>
According to CIIC statistics, the number of Internet users in
China exceeded one million at the end of June, 75 percent more
than at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
A journalist from the Shanghai-based Wenhui Bao newspaper said
that now Chinese readers can choose among hundreds of newspapers
published both in and out of China. He said that the Chinese
readers' demand for information on the Internet has increased so
fast that Chinese newspapers have to improve their content and
readability constantly.
</P>
<P>
Though most Chinese newspapers do not charge for access to
their websites, some papers have begun to make money from the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
China Infoworld, one of the first Chinese newspapers to enter
cyberspace, is expected to even accounts through on-line
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Juanjuan, head of the electronic publication section of
the newspaper, said they also provide economic information and
book-selling services on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Despite strict government regulations on the distribution of
news on the Internet, Chinese media have received wide support
for going on-line.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom regards newspapers and other media as major
sources of content, so that it offers free special lines for
major newspapers and leases Internet servers to news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Some media experts say that as the number of Internet users
increases in China, demands for news and other information on
the 'net will multiply. But they note that the Internet will not
replace other conventional media in the near future because cost
of surfing the 'net is many times higher than the cost of a
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> S. African Producer Inflation Up in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's producer
inflation rose to 2.8 percent in June from 2.4 percent in May,
defying economists' expectation of a rise above three percent.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Central Statistical Service (CSS) figures as
showing that the month-on-month increase in the producer price
index (PPI) was 0.3 percent, Business Day newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The PPI is used to measure inflation at the factory gate and
is a sign post for consumer inflation.
</P>
<P>
Economists expected a rise in producer inflation in June
because of last year's low base and an increase in imported
prices.
</P>
<P>
The markets were soothed by the index's better-than-expected
performance and the yield on the benchmark 150 Rand bond reached
a best level of about 16 percent from a worst level of 16.22
percent. It ended the day at 16.14, a touch weaker than on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, economists warned that producer inflation was set to
rise further in the following months as the weak Rand made its
presence felt.
</P>
<P>
The CSS said the imported component of the PPI was up 0.6
percent month on month while the local component rose only 0.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Local manufacturers will get more pricing power as they will
be able to match rising international prices. That should
increase inflationary pressures, the paper quoted an economist as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict the PPI would stand between five and six
percent at the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa Energy Ministers Approves Power Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Energy ministers from Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda, the three members of the East African
Cooperation (EAC), have approved a study plan to find ways they
could cooperate in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed on the study's terms of reference at the
end of a two-day meeting in Arusha, northern Tanzania, the East
African Standard newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by energy ministers Chrisantus Okemo
of Kenya and Robert Kaijuka of Uganda, as well as Deputy
Tanzanian Energy Minister Manju Msambya.
</P>
<P>
The power plan will tackle the current power demands of the
east African region, outline ways power sales could be made, and
propose a possible trilateral power-pooling arrangement,
according to an EAC statement issued at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to start on January 1999 and take a year to be
completed.
</P>
<P>
"The study is targeted on the harmonization of licensing
regimes for effective joint petroleum exploration, development of
modalities or the coordination of data collection and
facilitation of information exchange on fossil fuels and refining
and marketing linkages," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"In the area of the fossil energy sub-sector, the ministers
directed the (EAC) Secretariat to facilitate the completion of
the terms of reference on the study cooperation in this area,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also discussed possible extension of an oil
pipeline running from Eldoret in western Kenya to the Ugandan
capital city of Kampala and the development of a gas project in
Tanzania's southern coast.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: How Big a Flood Can Yangtze River Embrace? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The largest flooding since 1954 is
now rolling along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze
River, and now the greatest concern is focused on how big a flood
the river can withstand.
</P>
<P>
Historical data show that since the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.)
China has suffered more than 200 severe floods at the middle and
lower reaches of the 6,300-kilometer Yangtze, once in a decade on
average. The last devastating flood occurred in 1954, claiming
over 30,000 lives, and affecting 30 million people.
</P>
<P>
However, the current flooding, similar to that of 1954, has not
yet caused as much damage or loss of life thanks to increased
flood control efforts on the part of the central government.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the reinforcement of dikes and dams, nearly
50,000 reservoirs have been added along the Yangtze. In
particular, the damming of the river in 1997 at the Three Gorges
is expected to considerably enhance flood control capacity.
</P>
<P>
"Flood control standards vary at different sections of the
river, with some embankments able to withstand the biggest flood
of a century, supported by extra flood diversion and storage
projects, while other levees can only prevent smaller flooding,"
said Tan Qifu, senior engineer at the Flood Control Headquarters
for the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
It is very difficult to improve flood control standards only by
heightening protective embankments, Tan said, pointing out that
comprehensive measures are needed for this effort.
</P>
<P>
To wipe out flooding along the river once for all, more
reservoirs should be built on the upper and middle reaches, and
simultaneously, efforts should be intensified to dredge river
courses at the middle and lower reaches, as well as to reinforce
levees in a bid to improve flood diversion capacity, said Li
Antian, deputy director of the headquarters.

<HEADLINE> OPEC to Help Nigeria by Shoring up Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) said Wednesday it would assist Nigeria
in its economic programs by stabilizing and shoring up the prices
of oil.
</P>
<P>
The measure would help the Nigerian government and the
governments of other OPEC member countries in their development
programs, said OPEC Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman at the end
of his visit to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"As a strong member of OPEC, Nigeria has the support and
sympathy of all our member countries and if there is anyway we
can help as an organization, we are prepared to assist in
whatever way possible," he said, quoted by the Daily Times

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Livestock Numbers Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's beef cattle
numbers on July 1, 1998 were down 8 percent to 4.42 million,
compared with the figure a year earlier, an official media release
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the release, Rob Davison, executive director of the Meat and
Wool Economic Service of New Zealand, also said that beef cattle
numbers fell sharply in the drought affected regions of the East
Coast on North Island and Marlborough-Canterbury.
</P>
<P>
In the 12-month period to July 1, 1998, beef cattle numbers in
those regions fell 18 and 22 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
He added that during the corresponding period, sheep numbers
for the country declined 1.8 percent to 46.2 million, with
breeding ewe numbers down 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the drought influence, the continued expansion of
dairying, forestry and life-style blocks also contributed to the
decline in sheep numbers and beef cattle numbers though at a
slower rate than in previous years," Davison said.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the drought plus fewer breeding ewes is estimated
to result in the lamb crop this Spring falling 4 million or
decreasing 10.3 percent, compared with the Spring of 1997, he
said, adding that this reduction will reduce New Zealand's export
of lamb production for the 1998-1999 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Jiujiang Residents Battle Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 50-odd workers at a public
bath house in Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province, gathered at 7:00 am this
morning to join efforts to battle flood waters.
</P>
<P>
The crew, led by Xia Jing, 22, loaded more than 10,000 straw
and plastic bags, shoulder poles and shovels on truck and headed
for dikes along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"Women account for the majority of our staff and we joined the
battle voluntarily," said Xia.
</P>
<P>
The teams represents only a fraction of over 900,000 people
battling record flooding along a 196-km section of Yangtze River
dikes near Jiujiang.
</P>
<P>
The third Yangtze flood peak hit Jiujiang at around 8:00 am
today, with water levels hitting a record high of 22.95 meters.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks of heavy rain have hit the city, located at the
confluence of the Yangtze and Poyang Lake, and have spawned some
of the most severe flooding in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The central government has sent tens of thousands of People's
Liberation Army troops and armed police to Jiujiang to join local
residents in the major battle against flooding.
</P>
<P>
The combined efforts have either repaired of reinforced river
dikes in the area.
</P>
<P>
Local resident Yu Jiyun has not only joined efforts to
protect the city's largest floodgate during flood season in each
of the past three years, but has also contributed personal funds
totalling 20,000 yuan (2,409 US dollars) to purchase rocks needed
to repair surrounding embankments.

<HEADLINE> Largest Shipping Company Fighting Flood Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Facing the largest shipping
suspension in history, China's leading river shipping company is
going all out to keep losses at a minimum.
</P>
<P>
Due to one of the gravest flooding seasons ever, shipping on
638 kilometers, or one fourth of the swollen Yangtze River,
China's longest, has been suspended since July 26.
</P>
<P>
This has put a halt to 357 ships operated by the China
Changjiang National Shipping (Group) Co., the leading operator on
the river. "We expect heavy losses," said a company official. "In
1996, an 88-hour suspension cost us as much as 18 million yuan
(2.17 million U.S. dollars)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Within a very short time after the suspension, the company
managed to disperse all of the stranded passengers and return the
fares to more than 3,000 passengers. All of the stranded ships are
now anchored in safe places.
</P>
<P>
The company's ships navigating on other sections of the Yangtze
have not been affected, according to a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company has mobilized seven fleets totaling
30,000 tons in loading capacity to aid the government's
flood-fighting efforts.

The water level is the second highest since 1954. It is
continuing to rise slowly, according to an official from the State
Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The official said the rise of water levels resulted from
torrential rains and the volume of water released from the Lushui
Reservoir at a tributary of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The water level in the Shashi-Luoshan section has slowly
dropped, with levels in downstream areas near Wuhan, capital of
Hubei Province, rising by between 0.04-0.13 meters daily.
</P>
<P>
The Jiujiang Hydrological Station near Lake Poyang reported
that the water level there hit 22.92 meters by 06:00 this morning,
rising by 0.06 meter on yesterday's level and breaking the old
record by 0.72 meters.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Dongting Lake dropped to 25.23 meters by

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- More than one-third of the foreign
trade recorded during the first half of this year in Tianjin was
brought in by local enterprises engaged in processing using
imported raw materials.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises conducted 4.01 billion U.S. dollars worth of
foreign trade during the six-month period, accounting for 38.6
percent of Tianjin's total, and 1.6 percent higher than the growth
rate for the same period last year..

<HEADLINE> Soil Insects Imitated by Chinese Mechanical Engineers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The activities of earthworms,
ants, centipedes, scarabs and other soil insects have been
imitated by Chinese mechanical engineers in developing new terrain
machines which can easily crawl through the earth without soil
adhesion.
</P>
<P>
Mechanical engineers developed this technology by observing
these insects to design new tractors, bulldozers, excavators and
dump trucks that save fuel and are highly efficient.
</P>
<P>
"Many soil animals acquire the special ability to reducing soil
adhesion through billions of years of evolution," said Ren Luquan,
a professor at the Bionics Institute of Jilin Polytechnical
University.
</P>
<P>
Ren has studied about 2,000 soil insects of 29 species and
found that they have special geometric, chemical and physical
formations on their bodies.
</P>
<P>
"It is traditionally believed that the more smooth the surface
the less the resistance. However, the insects in soil show that
uneven surface can also reduce resistance," said Ren, who has
engaged in this study for more than ten years.
</P>
<P>
"Study indicates that the surface of many soil animals contains
silicon, phosphorus, sulphur and other chemical elements that are
resistant to water," he said. "The hydrophobic elements and the
uneven surface in the shape of ripples, scales or rings may form an
air interface which helps avoid contact with soil and surface."
</P>
<P>
In addition, earthworms and snails can secrete special liquids
to lubricate the parts of the body in contact with the soil. And
some soil animals may generate bioelectricity during movement,
which will also help reduce soil adhesion, added Ren.
</P>
<P>
Soil adhesion affects the efficiency of terrain machines and
causes serious wear and tear. Mechanical engineers in the
institute have developed bulldozers with front steel blade
surface in the shape of ripples, rings or scales.
</P>
<P>
They use hydrophobic materials and electroosmosis technology to
improve the tractors and dump trucks.
</P>
<P>
Experiments show that soil resistance to the new bulldozers
decreases by 13 to 40 percent, fuel consumption of the new
tractors is down 12 percent, and the efficiency of the dump trucks
rise 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts organized by the State Natural Science Fund Committee
recently appraised the biotics technology of the
institute. Experts say Ren and his fellows have developed a new
realm of research which is of great academic value. And their
research can be applied to a wide range of uses including
agriculture, construction, transportation, electricity, metallurgy
and mining.
</P>
<P>
Engineers and scientists from Britain, Canada, the United
States and Japan have repeatedly visited the university and
carried out academic exchanges and cooperation with the
institute.

<HEADLINE> Proposed Charge in Kenyan Port Worries Ugandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's clearing and forwarding
companies have expressed fears that the one U.S. Dollar per ton
levy proposed by Kenya's Indian Ocean port Mombasa will increase
the cost of moving goods through the port.
</P>
<P>
Mombasa is the main gateway for land-locked Uganda's imports
and exports although a substantial volume pass through
Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new levy is expected to be effective before the end of the
year. The Mombasa Municipal Council wants to use the money to
rehabilitate the infrastructure in the town.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of Uganda Clearing and Forwarding Agents
Association, Charles Kareeba, was quoted as saying that the levy
would definitely affect the cost of goods destined for Uganda or
coming from the country.
</P>
<P>
"Such levies are not good and they will not be encouraged by
the East African Treaty," said Kareeba.
</P>
<P>
He said that his association had recently agreed with the
Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) that no new changes would be
introduced without consulting the Ugandan side.

<HEADLINE> Chief Minister of Balochistan Province Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The two-week-long political
uncertainty in Pakistan's Balochistan province came to an end when
provincial Chief Minister Akhtar Mengal announced his resignation
here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Mengal's decision to step down came after his talks with the
central leadership of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N)
failed to yield results during a make or break meeting at the
Prime Minister House Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Mengal held the Federal
government was responsible for sponsoring a political crisis in
Balochistan province to dislodge him.
</P>
<P>
"I know exactly who hatched the whole conspiracy to topple a
democratically elected provincial government," Mengal said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Pakistan Muslim League (N) had never accepted
Balochistan National party (BNP) and since long had been trying to
destablize the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
When asked if BNP would withdraw its support to PML (N) at
center, Mengal said that BNP would decide about it later.
</P>
<P>
However, sources from BNP said that the party was likely to sit
on the opposition benches in the federal parliament.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that if BNP formally announced to part ways
with PML at center, the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
would lose second political ally after Awami National Party (ANP)
in North West Frontier Province opted to go separate ways earlier
this year with the ruling PML(N).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the third political ally Mottahida Qaumi Movement
(MQM) has already threatened that it will withdraw support to the
government.
</P>
<P>
Mengal, however, decided not to dissolve the Balochistan
Assembly because, he said, "the democratic process must go on."

<HEADLINE> Transportation Companies Report Sound Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Favorable government policies
have helped to ensure the sound developments of China's listed
transportation companies.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven railway, highway, maritime, aviation and port
companies gained listings on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
exchanges in the first half of 1998. The vast majority of the
companies are in coastal areas in east and south China.
</P>
<P>
Related companies reported average 1997 per share earnings of
0.34 yuan, with the average net asset earnings ratio for the
period hitting 14.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts point out that strong government support can
never be neglected when analyzing the success of the
transportation sector.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the government retains the right to set prices
makes transportation a monopolistic and low risk sector.
</P>
<P>
Strong government supports ensure the sector's sound
performance, steady growth in profits and constant expansion.
</P>
<P>
Supports, especially support from local governments, has
enabled transportation companies to actively carry out
restructuring programs which guarantee good economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Relathed enterprises have also enjoyed a diversified business
trend which has promoted development, according to analysts.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Rise of Cerebral Malaria Incidence in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The cerebral malaria cases in
India have shown an alarming rise this year with over 200,000
cases of the more lethal form of malaria have been reported so far
in the country, The Times of India said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the number of cases reported up to this time of the
year was about 40,000 less. There has been an increase of over 23
percent in malaria caused by the lethal parasite.
</P>
<P>
These are the trends shown by data collected at the National
Malaria Eradication Program (NMEP). Over 52 percent of the malaria
reported so far is this lethal variety. Earlier malaria cases
caused by this parasite used to be only 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Voluntary organizations said that the problem of malaria in the
country is much more serious than stated by the government. The
Voluntary Health Association of India said that over 70,000 people
might be dying of malaria every year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Officials admitted that the lethal parasite used to be uncommon
in the country. It was confined to the dense jungles of the
north-eastern States and some tribal areas. However, the parasite
has now moved into the cities and is responsible for a number of
deaths each year.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Fails to Agree on Iraq's Nuclear Weapons Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council failed to reach an agreement Wednesday on Iraq's nuclear
weapons program after reviewing a report presented by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
</P>
<P>
The IAEA report said there are no indications of Iraq having
retained any physical capability of producing weapon-usable
unclear materials in amounts of any practical significance, nor
any indication Iraq has acquired or produced weapon-usable nuclear
materials.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Security Council meeting, Chinese Ambassador to
the United Nations Qin Huasun said the IAEA report shows that Iraq
has fulfilled its commitments required in the council's relevant
resolution by having completely destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the Security Council should make a due and objective
assessment on Iraq's nuclear weapons program and it is time to
close that file and move it to long-term monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov proposed a draft resolution
acknowledging that Iraq has complied with Security Council's
requirements that it destroys its nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said there was absolutely
no reason for the Security Council to take any action, based on
the current report by the IAEA.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna-based IAEA is in charge of dismantling Iraq's
nuclear weapons. A U.N. special commission, led by Richard Butler,
handles biological, chemical and ballistical weapons.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Approves Surplus Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government approved a
provisional budget for 1999 on Wednesday, which has a total
savings of 13.5 trillion lire (7.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said in a cabinet
meeting that the government had ruled out new taxes, but intended
to increase income by four trillion lire (2.24 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
It will do this partly by levying welfare funds. The rest, 9.5
trillion lire (5.32 billion dollars), will come from cuts in
government spending.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi admitted he had asked his fellow ministers to keep their
funding requests to the bare minimum.
</P>
<P>
The harsh belt-tightening at ministries, aimed at squeezing
three trillion lire out of ministry budgets, comes in the wake of
government pledges to spend 36 trillion lire (20.16 billion
dollars) on development initiatives in the coming four years.
</P>
<P>
The budget package is expected to include measures allowing
workers to convert their severance pay into stocks, a concerted
effort to pull the underground economy into legality, and possibly
a new `green' tax on coal.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Accountant General, Andrca Monorchio said the 1999
accounts mapped out in the provisional budget plan were in line
with the guidelines established in the government's three-year
economic planning document.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he said, the government looked likely to reach
its goal of getting the budget deficit down to two percent of GDP
(Gross Domestic Product) by next year.
</P>
<P>
The provisional accounts showed government spending for the
year amounting to 607.6 trillion lire (347.2 billion dollars) and
receipts amounting to 664.8 trillion lire (379.9 billion dollars)
This leaves a budget deficit of 52.7 trillion lire (32.7 billion
dollars), compared to 84 trillion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Thai Agricultural Sector Wants Assistance from IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Ministry of
Thailand is looking forward to seeking 600 million U.S. dollars
for short- and medium-term assistance programs in the next release
of fund by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
A ministry source confirmed a newspaper report Thursday that
the ministry has proposed two separate programs.
</P>
<P>
As the Bangkok Post reported, the first program, with a budget
of 200 million dollars, would be used to improve liquidity in the
farm sector and to help absorb the rising number of unemployed
people over the next six to eight months.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Deputy Agriculture Minister Nevin Chidchob
as saying that he has agreed with the Finance Ministry that such
assistance should not be provided through commercial banks, which
would be reluctant to offer such loans for fear that they would go
bad.
</P>
<P>
The ministry intends to lend the funds through agricultural
cooperatives which generally have efficient management systems,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The second program, with a 400 million dollar budget, would be
for medium-term assistance to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Programs would include restructuring of production, promotion
of farms in irrigation areas, and a special economic zone to
promote export-oriented products with high potential such as
fragrant rice, sugar cane, rubber, livestock and fish products.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister was also quoted as saying that the next
quarterly report to the IMF, also known as the fifth letter of
intent, is expected to place more emphasis on the farm sector as a
way to stimulate the economy.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Aims 6 Billion Dollars Exports in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's exports, goods and
services combined, are expected to top six billion U.S. dollars
this year, Foreign Trade Minister Samuel Guzouwski said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, said Guzouwski, the country's exports of goods
alone will go up to nine billion dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The projections are considerably higher than those by the
previous administration three years ago, which stated an export
goal of five billion dollars for the early next century.
</P>
<P>
However, Guzouwski said the latest projections are the "most
conservative" ones, so actual results could be even better.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, said the minister, there has been a
surge in foreign capital inflow into the country, effectively
helping the boom of this Central American economy.
</P>
<P>
As one of the largest foreign investment projects in Costa
Rica, Intel, the U.S.-based world's largest manufacturer of
computer chips, launched a joint venture in March.
</P>
<P>
To increase its market access to North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) countries, Costa Rica has already negotiated a
deal with Mexico, one of the three NAFTA members, he said.
</P>
<P>
NAFTA is a regional bloc grouping together the United States,
Canada and Mexico. Launched in 1994, it now has the prospect of
expanding into a pan-American trade mechanism.

<HEADLINE> New Treasured Finds in Nanjing Ancient Tombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists recently
unearthed in suburban Nanjing lots of exquisite jade burial
articles in tombs which were about 1,500 years old.
</P>
<P>
They excavated nearly 200 articles of cultural relics,
including gold, silver, glass, jade, crystal, amber, porcelain and
lacquerware.
</P>
<P>
The 18 items of jade ware such as sword and jewelry are the
most treasured, according to archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the archaeologists found some gold ornaments from
a tomb, which is considered for a rich woman.
</P>
<P>
They continued their excavation work and further study on the
new finds.
</P>
<P>
Some construction workers stumbled upon the graves on June
17. After knowing that, the archaeologist team of the city's
museum arrived at the site for overall excavation.
</P>
<P>
The seven graves, in two rows, remained intact. They vary with
each other in shape and architectural technique, according to
witnesses. The oldest one might be dated back 1,700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimated that the graves might belong to a big rich
family resided there.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing was chosen as capital from 229 A.D. to 589 A.D. It had
flourishing culture in ancient times.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Passenger Jet Project on Brink of Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's passenger jet plane
project launched in 1995 is at the brink of failure after most of
the shareholders have asked for the liquidation of the company,
local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The request was made at the company's extraordinary general
meetings of shareholders here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the current economic crisis and unfavorable
national, regional and international situation, they feel that the
company's mission should be abandoned. They felt that it should be
closed down as well," said Saadilah Mursjid, Managing Director of
the company, PT Dua Satu Tiga Puluh (DSTP).
</P>
<P>
Another opinion voiced on the occasion wished that the company
be allowed to continue to operate using the money that had been
collected for investment in other sector.
</P>
<P>
"But the main result of the meetings is that the shareholders
have asked the board of directors to reconsider the future of the
N-2130 jet plane project, which will be decided upon in another
shareholders extraordinary meeting this year," Saadilah said.
</P>
<P>
PT DSTP is a company formed by former president Soeharto to
finance the development of the N-2130 passenger jet project.
</P>
<P>
The N-2130, the second airplane to be designed and engineered
entirely in Indonesia, is scheduled to enter the market by 2005.
It is planned to hold 100 to 130 passengers and is designed to
have a maximum speed of 900 kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's first locally designed airplane, the N-250
turboprop passenger plane, made its maiden flight in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Director of Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara
(IPTN), the state-run aircraft manufacturer, Ilham Habibie said
that the N-2130 project was beneficial, saying that it would have
quite good prospects.
</P>
<P>
Even if the company is eventually liquidated, he said, there is
always the possibility that the manufacture of the plane might be
continued.
</P>
<P>
"We can always find a foreign investor or new business partner
interested in funding the project", said Ilham, the eldest son of
President Habibie.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Senate Panel OKs Building Museum Honoring Physicist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Cultural Committee of the Italian
Senate approved Wednesday the plan to build a museum dedicated to
Enrico Fermi, an Italian Nobel prize-winning physicist.
</P>
<P>
The plan would convert the Physics Institute into a physics
history museum and research center at Via Panisperna, central
Rome, where Fermi and his Rome School of physicists used to work.
</P>
<P>
The auditorium, library and laboratories would be restored to
the way they looked in Fermi's day, when the group of physicists
did the experiments leading to the discovery of nuclear fission.
</P>
<P>
The project, to be financed through the Ministry of
Universities and Research, would need 1.7 million U.S. dollars as
initiation costs and 285,000 dollars as operation costs this year.
</P>
<P>
An additional 1.1 million dollars budget is required each year
starting 1999.
</P>
<P>
Fermi was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1938. The
Jewish physicist then moved to the United States because of then
Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini's racial laws.
</P>
<P>
As a professor at the University of Chicago in the early 1940s,
Fermi designed and built the first nuclear reactor that later was
put into use for research into nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
He died in the United States in 1954.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for the Fermi museum now needs to be approved by
the Cultural Committee at the Chamber of Deputies, or the lower
house of parliament.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Not to Join Intervention in Kosovo: PM Reaffirms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Orban
Viktor reaffirmed on Wednesday that Hungary will not directly
participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's possible
military intervention in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
If NATO feels it necessary to intervene in the crisis now
plaguing Hungary's neighbor to the south, Hungary is willing to
offer certain assistance, the prime minister reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
However, as there are many ethnic Hungarians serving in the
Serb army, Hungarian servicemen will never fight them under any
circumstances, he said. So, Hungary will not directly participate
in NATO's military actions, he explained.
</P>
<P>
There were 500 ethnic Hungarian soldiers in Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
Orban made the remarks while inspecting a logistics base for
the Bosnia Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Taszar, accompanied by
the U.S. ambassador to Hungary. At present, there are 1,300 U.S.
soldiers in the base.
</P>
<P>
In talks with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana in Brussels
on July 24, Orban expressed a similar position, saying that his
country needs to be prudent towards the crisis in Kosovo, a
Serbian province where ethnic Albanians are seeking independence
from the Yugoslavia Federation.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Does Not Support Kosovo Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Bulgarian
Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that Sofia does not support
independence for Kosovo and urged ethnic Albanians to select
responsible negotiators for talks with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Radko Vlaikov said Kosovo Albanians' demand for independence is
against international law.
</P>
<P>
"We agree with the international community that there can be no
question of demands for independence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite international efforts to restore peace, tensions are
mounting in Kosovo, the war-torn province of Serbia where 90
percent of its 1.8 million residents are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
After months of shuttle diplomacy, the Yugoslav government has
agreed to resume dialogue with ethnic Albanians, who, however,
have failed so far to agree on suitable negotiators.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian army and police have launched a massive five-day
offensive in the past week and have reclaimed some villages
previously occupied by ethnic Albanian guerillas.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomatics said the offensive is an effort to force
the so-called "Kosovo Liberation Army" to realize it cannot win
independence by fighting and must sit down at the negotiation
table.
</P>
<P>
Vlaikov said it is now the crucial time for Kosovo Albanians to
identify representative negotiators who could assume political
commitments and bear real responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"Our country will support all efforts of the international
community which may lead to a durable settlement of the Kosovo
problem," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria shares a border with Serbia, and the troubled Kosovo
Province is not far from its border. "This is a crucial matter
for Bulgaria because it affects regional security and because it
prompts fears that unwanted, comprehensive economic sanctions
might be imposed," Vlaikov said.

half-time, with Joey Vickery hitting six three-pointers for a
total of 23 points.
</P>
<P>
Canada managed to level 72-72 over two minutes before time but
then Greek captain Panagiotis Fasoulas, who finished the game with
eight points and 10 rebounds, took control of the boards giving
the Greeks the edge.
</P>
<P>
"Our performance tonight was good but we made mistakes in the
second half which stressed us out and we briefly lost our
concentration," Greek coach Panagiotis Yannakis said.

36-35) as Andrea Meneghin scored 18 and Alessandro Abio added 15

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Calls Off Russian Fighter Planes Purchases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has canceled its plan to
buy a squadron of Russian Sukhoi-30 fighter planes in view of the
increasingly limited state budget as the result of the monetary
crisis, local press Thursday quoted the Air Force chief as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the Air Force chief strongly denied rumors that the
cancellation was the result of external political pressure,
especially from the United States, as Indonesia has previously
called off the purchase of American F-16 jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
"No, not because of political factors, or external pressure. We
have to cancel the plan because of the deterioration of our
economic condition, although the price of a Sukhoi is only one
third of that of an F-16," Air Force Chief of Staff Vice Marshal
Hanafie Asnan told reporters in Yogyakarta, Central Java,
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the Air Force planned to buy other planes,
he said it depended on the situation, but priority has to be given
to a larger national interest.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the danger that Indonesia might have to face as the
result of the cancellation of the purchase of Sukhoi fighters, the
Air Force chief said that the challenge would be serious
considering Indonesia's vast air space and the limited number of
fighter planes available.
</P>
<P>
"But I am optimistic that we will be able to deal with threats
that may arise," he added.

<HEADLINE> Sang to be Transferred to Another Medical Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Injured Chinese female gymnast
Sang Lan will be transferred to Mt. Sinai Rehabilitation in
Manhattan tomorrow to begin a full rehabilitation schedule,
according to a medical report here.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no change in Sang Lan's neurological condition,
but she is stable and has recovered from the surgical procedure.
It is time for her to begin a full rehabilitation schedule," said
Dr. Brock Schnebel, chief medical officer for the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
Sang Lan, 17, who injured her spinal cord on July 21 while
warming up for the vaulting competition, was at present paralyzed
and still cannot feel anything from her mid-chest down.
</P>
<P>
"What we see in her test results and daily exams are signs that
are normal for a spinal cord injury of this nature," Schnebel said.
</P>
<P>
"The reflexes she's exhibited are not an indication of recovery
of function. Any reports to this effect are extremely premature.
</P>
<P>
"Our surgical team caution against too much optimism too early.
It's understandable that everyone is full of hope, and so are we.
But you can not rush what will be clearly a long process of
rehabilitation."
</P>
<P>
Mt. Sinai is one of the few best spinal cord injury centers in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Sang Lan's family and the Chinese delegation have chosen one
of the truly best centers available for the next phase of her
treatment," Schnebel noted.
</P>
<P>
Sang Lan has received the best care available from the very
beginning, thanks to the skills, facilities and resources found at
the Nassau County Medical Center.

CANBERRA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian federal government's decision to tax food has
cost the government any chance of winning the welfare lobby's
approval of a goods and services tax.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian federal government will boost direct family
payments in its tax overhaul, wooing family support for a goods
and services tax as polling by business confirms that wide
inducements will be needed to lock voters in behind the planned 10
percent tax.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Self-funded retirees are set to receive a one-off
compensation payment from the Australian federal government to
prevent the new goods and services tax eroding the value of their
savings.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian exporters have successfully diversified their
overseas markets to compensate for weak demand in Asia, according
to new trade figures published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Canberra Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian federal government is expected to ask the
United States if up to 20 Australian intelligence officers can
work at a U.S.-based facility designed to analyze satellite data
on ballistic missiles and nuclear tests.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Lift Veil on Secret Files of Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
said Wednesday that the government has decided to open the secret
files held by its Security Service on its own citizens.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement to the parliament, Straw said the
Security Service -- generally known as MI5 -- held around 13,000
active files on the British citizens and only a tiny proportion of
these files are likely ever to be under close investigation at any
one time.
</P>
<P>
The remainders were linked to investigations into espionage,
proliferation and serious crimes, and some of those were on
informers rather than suspects.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister also promised that the government would
no longer conduct any investigations into subversive groups.
</P>
<P>
Straw said that after the collapse of the Soviet Union and a
decline in the threat from subversive groups, MI5 had scaled down
its counter-subversion work "to the point where it is no longer
running any investigations in the field of subversion."
</P>
<P>
Britain has seldom lifted its veil on the work of MI5 and its
partner agency MI6, officially called the Secret Intelligence
Service, which gathers intelligence abroad.
</P>
<P>
Straw said the Security Service had opened about 440,000 files
since its foundation in 1909 and 290,000 of those were about
"individuals who, at some time during the last 90 years, may have
been the subject of Security Service enquiry or investigation."

<HEADLINE> Romanian Police Crack Biggest-ever Tobacco Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A military court in Bucharest
set the first hearing in "the Cigarette case" for August 5, after
the Romanian police cracked the biggest-ever Tobacco Smuggling in
mid-April.
</P>
<P>
Colonel of Special Security Forces Gheorghe Trutulescu,
Otopeni-Bucharest military airport commodore Ioan Suciu, who
covered up the crime, and Valentin Vasilescu, a head of the civil
airport who had the cargo routed up to the neighboring military
tarmac, are three of 19 officials indicted for smuggling activity.
</P>
<P>
Most of the remainder are businessmen, employers and drivers.
The court ruled that the first three indicted should remain in
custody pending the verdict. Under a decision by the Court of
Appeals, ten others accused were released from detention on
Monday, July 27, but will have to stand trial for accessory to the
crime.
</P>
<P>
On the night of April 16 to 17, an Ukraine licensed aircraft
IL-76 touched down at the Otopeni military airport, with 3,000
crates of smuggled Greek Assos-brand cigarettes on board. The
goods were loaded in three trucks and ferried to a storehouse at
Bucharest's off-limits, but the police located them and seized the
load.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Testify by Videotape, Lawyer Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will provide videotaped testimony in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation on August 17, Clinton's personal attorney said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
withdrew a subpoena issued to the attorney, David Kendall,
according to a senior White House official.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's personal lawyers will be present for the testimony,
which will be given at the White House, Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kendall received the subpoena ordering Clinton to
testify before the grand jury investigating allegations of a
presidential affair and cover-up. Clinton's lawyers have said they
did not want him to be the first sitting president to testify in
person before a grand jury under subpoena and had sought a forum
for furnishing testimony outside a courthouse.
</P>
<P>
"In an effort to achieve a prompt resolution of this entire
matter, the president will voluntarily provide his testimony on
August 17, 1998, to the Office of Independent Counsel, as he has
on prior occasions," Kendall told reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement was worked out in at least a week of tense
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Kendall came to the White House Wednesday to brief Clinton just
after reaching the agreement with Starr.
</P>
<P>
Starr is investigating whether Clinton and Lewinsky lied when
they denied under oath that they had a sexual relationship,
whether Clinton asked her to testify falsely, and whether the
president and others tried to obstruct the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Representative Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, has been waiting for Starr to submit a report on
Clinton's conduct, so his panel can decide whether the findings
merit impeachment proceedings.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Wednesday the approval of a 30 million U.S. dollar loan to
Guatemala for a Reconstruction and Local Development Project.
</P>
<P>
This project will finance small productive, cultural, social
and economic infrastructure sub-projects formulated and managed by
local communities.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the project is to improve the living
standards and sustainable self-development of approximately

extreme poverty. Community sub-projects will be carried out in 16
municipalities of the Departments of San Marcos and Huehuetenango.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is some 37.5 million dollars.
Apart from the World Bank loan, the Government of Guatemala will

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expects Japan to Continue in Reform Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Wednesday that it believed the next Japanese government would
continue along the economic reform path outlined by Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto before his resignation earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Hashimoto has made commitments to pursue those
policies, and I don't believe we have any indication to think that
the next government of Japan wouldn't pursue that type of reform,"
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto resigned after his Liberal Democratic Party failed in
the Upper House election on July 12.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi then was elected the leader of
the ruling party and he is assured to become the prime minister on
Thursday when the Japanese parliament chooses a new leader to
succeed Hashimoto because of his party's majority in the Lower
House.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi before assuming the premiership has chosen former Prime
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa as finance minister in his upcoming
government.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States would welcome Miyazawa, who has
close ties with Washington, to be finance minister, McCurry
declined to comment, saying it would be inappropriate to do so
before the government is formally seated.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the most important is for Japan to revive its
economy by stimulating its domestic demand, deregulating its
economy and reforming its banking system.

LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
Wednesday that it was to send four military observers to
participate in a United Nations disarmament mission to Sierra
Lenon.

education programs for the communities to recognize their
socio-economic development.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders for Durable Goods Decline in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Blamed to the lingering Asian
crisis and the GM strike, the U.S. factory orders for big-ticket
durable goods declined in June for the second consecutive month,
the Commerce Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 percent decrease, coming on top of a steep 3.3 percent
slide in May, reduced orders for durable goods, items expected to
last three or more years, to a seasonally adjusted 182.3 billion
U.S. dollars last month, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
It was the first consecutive decline in a year and a half and
the fourth drop this year. The drop in May, even worse than a
previously reported 2.7 percent decrease, was the largest in five
months.
</P>
<P>
June's order decrease was focused in automobiles, aircraft and
primary metals. Transportation orders fell 6.9 percent, the fourth
decline in five months, and primary metals declined 2.5 percent,
the third drop in four months.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for electronic and electric equipment rose 1.9
percent, partially recovering from a sharp 9 percent drop in May.
Orders for industrial machinery rose 1.7 percent in June following
a similar drop in May.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of durable goods, a measure of current production,
were unchanged in June. The backlog of unfilled orders fell 0.7
percent. It's decreased in four of the past five months.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India Agree to Resume Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The prime ministers of Pakistan
and India held their first bilateral meeting here on Wednesday
since the two countries carried out tit-for-tat nuclear tests in
May, and they agreed to resume the dialogue between the two
arch-rivals in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
At separate press conferences later, both Indian Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif
said they had a "good meeting" which covered a wide range of
issues of "mutual interest" and "of regional and global concern."
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Vajpayee said he and Sharif had asked
their countries' foreign secretaries to meet on Wednesday and
Thursday to "work out the modalities" for the resumption of the
dialogue which broke up last September.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India resumed their dialogue at the foreign
secretary-level in March last year after a three-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee read out a brief statement and took up just a few
questions before he left.
</P>
<P>
Their talks took place on the sidelines of a summit of the
seven-member South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC) in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
It was the first bilateral meeting between the leaders of the
two countries since May this year when India conducted nuclear
tests and Pakistan carried out its own in a tit-for-tat manner,
fueling anew tensions in South Asia and prompting fears of a
nuclear arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said they agreed at their talks that the dialogue
process should be resumed. "We recognized the importance of
building mutual trust and confidence and of establishing stable
and friendly ties."
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to continue the dialogue at the next available
opportunity," Sharif told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We reviewed the entire range of bilateral relations of issues
of regional and global concern. We have also discussed the events
which took place in May and completely transformed the political
landscape of our region," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said he told Vajpayee at their talks, which lasted more
than one hour, that the agreement on the agenda of the foreign
secretary-level talks reached in Islamabad last year was a
"substantive achievement," but India had since then "resiled on"
the understandings and the dialogue has remained stalemated.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest of both our countries and of course in
the interest of the region that Pakistan and India should hold
substantive and specific talks on the issues of peace and security
and Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their
independence from Britain in 1947 and two of them were over
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Jammu and Kashmir is the sole cause of tension and the core
issue which must be addressed meaningfully with a view to reaching
a final settlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The nuclearization of South Asia has added another dimension to
Pakistan's security concerns, he said. "It is imperative that we
address ourselves to the issue of nuclear and conventional
restraint and stabilization, avoidance of conflict, and
confidence-building measures."
</P>
<P>
Sharif also mentioned the decision made at last year's SAARC
summit in Male, the Maldives, on holding informal political
consultations among member states. While recognizing that the
SAARC charter prohibits any discussion of contentious political
issues, he added: "In the absence of this dimension, SAARC's real
potential has remained unrealized."
</P>
<P>
"The new realities of a nuclearized South Asia also demand that
an intensive broad-based dialogue is instituted," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Pakistan is ready to host a preparatory meeting on
a Peace Security and Development Initiative.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir in Maputo, Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian President Mahathir
Mohamed started his three-day visit to Mozambique Wednesday
afternoon, aiming to expand trade in the country.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano,
Mahathir has come after attending the second Southern African
International Dialog aimed at promoting the development in the
region through smart partnerships.
</P>
<P>
As scheduled in the agenda, Mahathir will hold talks with his
Mozambican counterpart so as to make assessment of the bilateral
relations between their two countries and to define the new
fields of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian president is accompanied by 44 entrepreneurs
from various fields such as telecommunications, agriculture,
animal husbandry and fishery, construction and engineering,
transportation, tourism, trade and financial services, who will
hold talks with the business leaders of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
According to Fernando Sumbane, Director of the Center for
Investment Promotion in Mozambique, the trade between the two
countries was less than 10 million U.S. Dollars each year. But
Sumbane believes that through Mahathir's visit and with the
efforts of both sides, bilateral trade will rise to well over 50
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
In September last year when People's Bank of Development
(PBD), the last state-owned bank in Mozambique, was privatized,
Southern Bank of Malaysia joined Mozambique's Investor Ltd. in
purchasing it with 13 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thus the Malaysian bank owns 30.6 percent of the PBD while
Investor Ltd. owns 29.4 percent with PBD's staff having the rest
of 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed that Malaysia is planning to launch an
international bank of trade and investment in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
At the Maputo International Airport, Mahathir was met by 2,000
officials and people of the two countries including Mozambican
Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi.
</P>
<P>
A Mozambican delegation led by President Chissano paid a visit
to the Asian country in March this year.

HARARE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Student Union
(SASU) has appealed to the Zimbabwean government to open the
University of Zimbabwe (UZ) and Harare Polytechnic College which
were closed last month following student demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Visiting SASU secretariat member Emmanuel Tembo told the

SASU is an organization for students from Southern African

should desist from the habit of punishing students at the expense
of solving problems being raised.

"It is SASU's hope that the suspensions will be lifted and an
amicable solution will be found soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
The SASU representative came to Zimbabwe to supervise progress

<HEADLINE> Britain to Seek New Type of Frigate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain is planning to build
three-hulled warships of the new century and naval experts
consider this innovative idea possibly the biggest change in naval
design since the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
The British Defense Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) said
Wednesday it had placed an order with British shipbuilders Vosper
Thornycroft  for a 90 meter-long (295 feet) demonstration
vessel with an innovative three-hulled design.
</P>
<P>
The DERA officials said that sea trials of the 13 million pound
(about 21 million U.S dollars) trimaran, jointly conducted with
the Unted States, is expected to begin in October 2000.
</P>
<P>
The new vessel with top speed at 20 knots will have 40 percent
more deck space than a monohull for hangars, helicopters and
weapons.
</P>
<P>
British naval experts said that the trials will show whether
the trimaran hull form can be considered for the "Future Escort"
vessels due to replace the navy's existing Type 22/23 frigates
from 2010 onwards.
</P>
<P>
They also predict the design probably marked the most
significant change in warship design since Koreans went to war
against Japan with ironclad galleys in the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
Trimarans have been extensively used in the design of commercial
yachts and its slender hull form with two outriggers could provide
stability for the whole ship.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Refugees Top 180,000: UNHCR Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 180,000 refugees are
still living in Uganda and over 80 percent of them are from
southern Sudan, an official with the U. N. High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR) told Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Miss Tomoko Niino, the public information officer with the
Kampala office of UNHCR, said here that the war in southern Sudan
and the chronic famine there have driven people to take refuge in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Refugees in Uganda are also from Rwanda, Burundi and the
Democratic Republic of Congo, she added.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,000 Congolese refugees who have been living in a
settlement center at Kyaka in western Kabarole district have been
repatriated by the UNHCR since April.
</P>
<P>
In northern Uganda, the humanitarian body provides both
material and non-material help to the refugees there. Among the
materials are foodstuffs, crop seeds, agricultural tools and
water containers while at the same time they offer health
service, psychological counseling, and education for both
refugees and local people.
</P>
<P>
Niino is optimistic that the number of refugees in Uganda will
be relatively stable in the foreseeable future, noting that they
will try their best to repatriate those willing to go back to
their countries of origin.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the above mentioned help, they have also tried to
improve the infrastructure in north Uganda by building roads
and airports which benefit all the people there, she said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. New Envoy to Be in Angola at Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations new envoy,
Lakhdar Brahimi, will arrive here this weekend to assess what is
going on in Angola in a bid to help resolve the crisis facing the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi will hold talks with the leaders from both the Angolan
government and the opposition movement of National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), trying hard to dissuade
them, the UNITA in particular, from conducting any operations
harming the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan News Agency Wednesday quoted sources from the U.N.
observer mission in Angola as saying that Brahimi will also try
to persuade the two sides to resume talks immediately and
implement the impending tasks stipulated in the 1994 Lusaka Peace
Accords without delay.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that after his visit to Angola, the U.N.
special envoy will advise U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
how to save the Angolan peace process and on the guiding line of
the U.N. actions in Angola.
</P>
<P>
On his African tour, Brahimi will also visit some other
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, the Angolan delegation to the
United Nations made a statement Tuesday, urging the international
community and the U.N. Security Council to take steps to
immediately halt all the military actions of the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on the international community to
exert pressure upon the UNITA leaders to make them realize that
the problems troubling Angola cannot be resolved in a military
way.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Stresses Dialog between Govt, Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa said Wednesday that it is important for the three
stake-holders in the national development -- the government, the
private sector and the labor -- to conduct dialogs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the second South Africa International Dialog (SAID)
meeting in Namibia, Mkapa said, "We should have in place a forum
for dialog between all stake-holders at national and regional
levels, a forum that is not elitist, but all-embracing and
representational in respect of the various stake-holders."
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Mkapa said the forum
should create, sustain, promote and facilitate interdependence
between all the stake-holders and ensure that all partners
benefit from the dialog.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting attended by representatives from Botswana, Ghana,
Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia and
Zimbabwe, as well as Malaysia, Mkapa said that the stake-holders
should strive to change negative attitude toward privatization.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa cited an example that his country had met resistance
from the civil service during the process of privatizing the
Tanzania Breweries Limited and the Tanzania Cigarette Company.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, people's attitude began to change when they
found productivity and salaries going up.
</P>
<P>
But the president cautioned that the government should have
legal and administrative provisions to ensure the proper use of
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania is in the process of setting up a dialog
forum where ideas of all circles of society are represented.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also challenged the SAID countries to devise a regional
cooperation mechanism for cross-border investment and trade.

<HEADLINE> UN Officials Ordered to Leave "Somaliland" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The local authorities in the
breakaway "Republic of Somaliland" have declared Dominik
Lagenbacher, the highest level official of the United Nations for
Somalia, persona non grata and order him to leave "Somaliland"
immediately.
</P>
<P>
In a letter issued by the president of the breakaway republic,
Mohamed Hajji Ibrahim Egal, through the Interior Ministry, the
administration also ordered Paul Knight, the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) envoy to " Somaliland", to leave
Hargeisa, the capital of the breakaway republic, within 24 hours
beginning from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A number of armed policemen have been placed around the
residence of Knight to safeguard him while he was waiting for the
nearest flight to Nairobi, the seat of the UNDP-Smalia office
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The letter which imposed the persona non-grata on Swiss
national, Dominik Lagenbacher said that the administration
doesn't mean to create animosity with the UN officials operating
in Hargeisa or elsewhered, but the move is directed on only two
employees who, as the letter put, have forgotten their
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The letter had also accused the UN officials of sabotaging the
smooth flow of the humanitarian relief by the world communities
into Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of this letter followed a serious debate by
</P>
<P>
the "Somaliland" parliament over the status and operations of
the UN officials there.
</P>
<P>
The breakaway " Republic of Somaliland" is the safest place
over all Somalia at the time being where the rule of law is in
place following the historic peace agreement between Egal's
administration and the rebel fighters last year.
</P>
<P>
This persona non grata declaration may leave some stains on
the forth-going political achievements as well as the
humanitarian developments in Somaliland.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan, Russia Sign Statement on Caspian Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijan and Russia ended their
talks on the Caspian Sea status in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, on
Wednesday with a joint statement, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported from Baku.
</P>
<P>
The talks began Tuesday immediately after the arrival of the
Russian delegation headed by First Deputy Foreign Minister Boris
Pastukhov to Baku.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterates that the two countries desire to
continue their talks on the Caspin status. But they failed to
reach agreement on the division of the surface and the waters of
the sea, an informed Azerbaijani source said.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Pastukhov as saying that
Azerbaijan is now holding the key to a resolution of the Caspin
problem.
</P>
<P>
While Azerbaijan wants both the water depths and sea surface
divided, Russia wants every littoral country to retain a "small,
12 to 20 mile wide, territorial zone covered by border, customs
and sanitary controls," Pastukhov said.
</P>
<P>
In line with international practice, a 10, 12 or 20 mile
fishing zone can be agreed and "the remaining sea surface should
be used jointly in the interests of shipping, wildlife control and
restoration of the fish population," the Russian deputy minister
said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the five Caspian countries -- Russia,
Kazakhstan, Turkeymenistan, Azerbaijan, Iran -- have almost agreed
on division of the seabed.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Pastukhov Azerbaijiani President Heydar
Aliyev pointed out the differences between Moscow and Baku on the
division of water depths and the sea surface and emphasized the
need to continue the search for mutually acceptable decisions.
</P>
<P>
Pastukhov and his delegation have left for Moscow. The joint
statement is expected to be released on Thursday, July 30, the
report said.

The United States decided on June 1 to apply a safeguard clause
in the form of a quantitative restriction on imports of wheat
gluten feed from the European Union, Australia and other countries
for a period of just over three years.
</P>
<P>
The EU quota allocation for the period from June 1, 1998 to May
31, 1999 was set at 24,513 tons, considerably lower than the 1997
level of EU exports of corn gluten to the United States of 41,239
tons.
</P>
<P>
The loss to the European Union as a result of the U.S. quota is
estimated at about 13.65 million ECU (15 million U.S. dollars) in
the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Corn and wheat gluten is a by-product that is used as animal
feed.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement on safeguards
provides that any member affected by a safeguard measure may
suspend the application of substantially equivalent concessions in
response.
</P>
<P>
The commission is notifying the WTO Council for Trade in Goods
of its proposed measure.
</P>
<P>
But the commission is still considering whether to lodge a
formal complaint under the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body regarding
the U.S. safeguard clause.

<HEADLINE> Greece Backs Pangalos' Statements on Turkish Consulate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government Wednesday
supported the statements made by Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos on the deeds of Turkish consulate in northeastern Greece.
</P>
<P>
During a tour of Thrace on Sunday, Greek Foreign Minister
Pangalos warned the Turkish consulate in Komotini to restrict
themselves to "well-meaning duties" and to refrain from creating
problems in the co-existence of Christian and Moslem residents in
the region. Turkey, which has bad relations with Greece, had
reacted angryly to Pangalos' such statements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas described Pangalos' statements as "very valid,"
saying that foreign consulates in Greece could not perform duties
which were outside their competence.
</P>
<P>
When foreign diplomatic missions undermine not only the
interests of the country in which they were located but also
bilateral relations, then Greece would react, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also rejected claims by Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem that Ankara had a special relationship with the
northern Greek region of Thrace.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Shifts Focus to Poverty Eradication in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) in Uganda has shifted its focus from HIV and AIDS
control to poverty eradication, an officer with the international
body told Xinhua Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ronald David Kayanja, the information/communication officer
with UNDP in Uganda, said this change in focus was necessitated
by changes in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, most of the money his organization had given to
Uganda was utilized in checking the spread of HIV and AIDS
because this was the most serious problem the country faced at
that time.
</P>
<P>
Now Ugandans have a high awareness of the dangers of the
killer disease and economic development has come to the
limelight.
</P>
<P>
To eradicate poverty in the country, UNDP gives more than 20
million U.S. Dollars in grant to Uganda annually, he said. The
grant is mainly put into private sector development and
decentralization.
</P>
<P>
"We sit with the Ugandan government to talk about what we
should do to eradicate poverty," the officer said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about their source of funds, Kayanja said they are
donated by some countries, listing Denmark, Japan and the United
States as the key donors.
</P>
<P>
Besides the above two areas, their grant also goes to
environment protection and development planning, he added.
</P>
<P>
Together with the World Bank, UNDP launched a "Lake Victoria
Project" aimed at getting rid of the water hyacinth in the lake
and other environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
As for the development planning, they helped the Ugandan
government formulate a national development strategy called
"Uganda Vision 2025" which will help the government in aid
coordination.
</P>
<P>
To ensure their money is properly and effectively used, they
entrust a national execution unit in the ministry of finance to
monitor the spending of their grants.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Forge Ties with Regional Organizations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Wednesday stressed the need to address the economic,
social, ethnic and other root causes of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Conflict prevention is a major topic discussed at the two-day
meeting between the United Nations and regional organizations
here.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the outcome of the meeting, Annan said the challenge
of conflict prevention goes to the very heart of the shared
mission of the world body and regional organizations.
</P>
<P>
According to him, prevention covers a series of operations
including early warning, preventive diplomacy, preventive
disarmament, preventive deployment and peace-building.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the third of its kind since 1994, considered
various cooperation modalities, including more systematic
coordination of preventive activities in the field.
</P>
<P>
It also dealt with ideas of developing common indicators for
early warning, establishing a database of prevention capabilities,
better flows of information, joint training of staff, and building
links to civil society to forge awareness of conflict prevention.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly adopted a declaration in 1994 to
enhance cooperation between the U.N. and regional organizations in
the maintenance of international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The first two meetings, with the second taking place in 1996,
focused on general principles to guide the cooperation. The
current meeting is seen as a step forward to detail cooperation
activities.
</P>
<P>
A dozen regional organizations took part in the discussions
beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They include Commonwealth of Independent States, Commonwealth,
Economic Community of West African States, European Union, League
of Arab States, Organization of African Unity, Organization of
American States and Organization of the Islamic Conference.

<HEADLINE> Investigation Demanded into Missing Nazi Gold Files </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A German Jewish leader Wednesday
demanded an investigation into the missing of government files on
gold and jewellery robbed from Holocaust victims during the Nazi
period.
</P>
<P>
"The files are missing and nobody is responsible," said Michel
Friedman, an executive committee member of Germany's Central
Council of Jews.
</P>
<P>
He made the demand after the German Federal Archive in Koblenz
admitted last weekend that key documents on the Nazi loot were
missing.
</P>
<P>
Loss of the documents, which included "Melmer files" -- records
kept by Nazi SS officer Bruno Melmer on the amount of looted gold
and jewellery, would make it impossible to make certain how much
gold the Nazis had robbed from Jewish victims, according to
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Friedman believed the missing documents could have been used as
evidence in compensation claims made by families of Jewish
victims.
</P>
<P>
Germany's public television ARD reported that the missing
documents had been destroyed at the end of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
A federal archive statement however denied the accusation,
saying there was no evidence of this.

<HEADLINE> Republican Leaders Discuss Capitol Visitors Center Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Republican leaders would like
to push legislation through Congress this year for a new Capitol
visitors center, after two police officers died last Friday
protecting the building.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott met Wednesday with Speaker of
the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich and other top
Republicans to try to agree on legislation that would authorize
work on the proposed center. Envisioned by most participants as an
underground structure, the center would provide security
checkpoints outside the Capitol while offering tourists shelter
and information.
</P>
<P>
Representative Bob Livingston, who chairs the House
Appropriations Committee, described the discussion as positive.
</P>
<P>
Without fanfare, the Capitol doorway used by the gunman Friday
was reopened to the public today for the first time since the
attack. It was guarded by three officers.
</P>
<P>
The idea of a visitors center has been around for years. But it
was given renewed impetus by the killings of officers Jacob J.
Chestnut and John Gibson by an intruder who was captured and
wounded in a brief gunfight that terrified thousands of tourists,
lawmakers and workers.
</P>
<P>
"We want to try to take steps this year that would... get this
started," Lott told reporters.

<HEADLINE> France Urged to Stop Involvement in Comoros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Comoros Islands Wednesday
urged the Organisation of African Unity to pressure France to
stop funding the separatist movement in Anjouan Island.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister of the Comoros Islands, Salim Himidi, told a
press conference in Harare that French involvement in the Comoros
islands' politics since the latter's independence in 1975 has
subjected the Indian Ocean islands to coups by terrorists, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said there was increased instability with fears of a civil
war breaking out in the Comoros, which comprises four islands.
</P>
<P>
The Comoros crisis started in July last year when a separatist
movement in Anjouan island declared itself independent of
President Mahomed Taki Abdoul Karim's government.
</P>
<P>
"The Comoros islands, for the past 23 years, has been
confronted with challenges that are beyond its structural and
resource capacities," said Himidi.
</P>
<P>
According to him, France and its sponsored terrorists had made
it difficult for President Karim to rule since his election in
1996.
</P>
<P>
"The French have to find a way out to settle this long
standing problem," said Himidi.

WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Authorities are trying to build
a case that Russell E. Weston Jr. lived in fear of the government
and came to Washington intent on violence, court documents show.
</P>
<P>
Weston is accused of shoving through a metal detector Friday
and killing two police officers guarding the Capitol. He lies
sedated and recovering from gunshot wounds received in a fire
fight inside a congressional office.
</P>
<P>
FBI affidavits filed in Washington, Illinois and Montana show
authorities are seeking evidence to prove Weston meticulously
catalogued his grievances against the government and, before
leaving his parents' home in Illinois the day before the
shootings, planned to kill federal agents, according to news
reports.
</P>
<P>
Weston, 41, has not entered a plea, and his lawyer has refused
to discuss his mental state. But prosecutors expect some kind of
an insanity claim and are trying to head it off by showing that
Weston's belief that the government was out to get him became a
motive for murder.

<HEADLINE> S. African Cabinet Okays Tobacco Control Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South African cabinet
Wednesday unanimously approved a draft legislation that will allow
the health minister to ban smoking in the workplace and prohibit
all tobacco advertising.
</P>
<P>
The Tobacco Products Control Amendment Bill will allow Health
Minister Nkosazana Zuma to ban smoking in any public place, the
definition of which includes a workplace, on pain of a 200-Rand
(32-U.S. Dollar) fine, South African Press Association reported.

KAMPALA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
returned home Wednesday from Swakopmund of Namibia where he
had attended the second African International Dialog on Smart
Partnership for the generation of wealth in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
At a lunch session Tuesday, Museveni said globalization must
be mutually beneficial to all the partners involved and called on
African countries to identify the role the continent should play
in the process, according to a press release issued by the
President's Office.
</P>
<P>
Africa should stop being mere buyers and rapidly move to
become sellers in the global market. In order to become an
overall seller, Africa needs to industrialize and sell finished
products rather than raw materials, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also challenged African countries to invest both local and
foreign investment and to enlarge the market through regional
integration.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, whose aim is to bring together
government, labor and growth and to forge a dynamic relationship
that will enhance development, had drawn leaders
from Africa and beyond.
</P>

At the opening ceremony, Namibian President Sam Nujoma said
the Dialog is also intended to develop person-to-person
relationships among the people in the region and to build a

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Says Mideast Peace Process Barely Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
on Wednesday that the peace process in the Middle East was
barely alive because of distrust between Israel and the
Palestinians and that the current direct talks between the two
sides could easily fail.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is alive, but only just and with a still
uncertain future," Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk
told the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
The United States has tried to bring Israel and the
Palestinians together by a new proposal for the second phase of
Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank. The
proposal was accepted by the Palestinians but rejected by the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel and the Palestinians resumed direct talks
recently, they failed to reach any agreement on that issue. On
Tuesday, however, the two sides met again in Tel Aviv, but
breakthrough seems still distant.
</P>
<P>
Indyk said that months of deadlock in negotiations had left
Israelis and Palestinians so distrustful that they had lost the
ability to deal with each other directly.
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the United States did not intend to
intervene in the current talks, preferring to let the two sides
find a way out of the impasse now they are stuck in.
</P>
<P>
"If they cannot resolve their differences on these issues,
how are they going to resolve the extremely complex and
sensitive issues involved in the final status negotiations,"
Indyk said.
</P>
<P>
Indyk said, however, the United States could not abandon the
peace process as it would hurt U.S. credibility. But he said a
time-out might be necessary if the current talks failed again.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Israel should be blamed for the
deadlock in the peace process as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected any ideas for the break of the
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
A majority of Israeli public support the U.S. proposal for
the Israeli troops' pullout and Israeli lawmakers, frustrated
over the lack of progress in the peace process, have been
increasing pressure on Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli parliament on Wednesday took a first step toward
forcing an early election. they voted 60-6 with one abstention
to dissolve the 120-seat Knesset.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu's rule did not appear immediately threatened.
To become law, the bill must pass a committee and three more
votes, which could take months. Future votes on the bill will
require a 61 vote majority for passage.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South African political
parties and organizations Wednesday condemned the slaying of nine
people at Simozomeni near Richmond in Kwazulu-Natal Province on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) blamed the killings
on "a third force" and called for urgent and drastic measures to
restore order in the east of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The ANC reiterates its view that the violence in the area
remains the work of a third force, using Richmond as test run
with a view to spreading destabilization to the entire province
ahead of the 1999 elections," the ANC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Urgent and drastic steps need to be undertaken if we are to
enhance the confidence of the people of Richmond and surrounding
areas in law enforcement and the judicial process."
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party and the National Party urged the
government to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry into the
killings, while the Freedom Front implored the ANC to engage in
political talks to end the carnage.
</P>
<P>
South African cabinet said the attacks were the work of
sinister forces and professional killers.
</P>
<P>
The government's task was to implement an intelligence-driven
campaign which would ensure the arrest and prosecution of these
killers, the cabinet said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi condemned the
brutality of the Richmond "terrorists" responsible for the
attack, and said he would visit the area on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that unarmed people and young children are being
killed is an indication of the sheer brutality of these killers,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The ANC Youth League calls on security forces to leave no
stone unturned to capture the perpetrators of the latest
massacre.
</P>
<P>
The nine people, five of them children, were murdered in their
sleep when a number of gunmen burst into their house and opened
fire on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
At least 40 people have been killed in Richmond this month as
violence resurged.

<HEADLINE> Romania Advances Solutions to Kosovo Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Foreign Ministry
has worked out a program for the current and upcoming periods,
that adds to the efforts the international community made in order
to put an end to the conflict in Kosovo, Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anda Filip said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The program consists of measures aimed at increasing confidence
among the parties involved and at resuming the dialogue between
Belgrade and Pristina for the negotiation of the province's future
special status, the spokeswoman added.
</P>
<P>
"Romania's participation in the actions of the observers'
diplomatic mission in Kosovo; accrediting an additional number of
diplomats in Belgrade; Romanian stronger missions in Tirana and
Skoplje," these are some of the concrete points in the program put
forward by Anda Filip.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Foreign Ministry's strategy also relies on
bilateral approaches aimed at "utmost efficiency," added Anda
Filip, who referred to diplomatic contacts with the countries in
the area, such as the visits paid by the heads of the Albanian and
Macedonian diplomacies in June in Bucharest, the visit the
Romanain foreign minister is due to pay to Tirana on July 31, a
recent visit the Romanin defense minister made in Skoplje, a
meeting the Romanian and Yugoslav foreign ministers had in June in
Istanbul, after the close of an international conference.
</P>
<P>
Romania will bolster the Albanian government to take steps
against arms trafficking through this country and will make known
its willingness to grant assistance for defusing and removing
ammunition and weaponry stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry takes note and encourages the efforts made
in "organizing a unitary group, representative of the Albanians in
Kosovo" which will allow for unitarily conducting negotiations and
discussing the cease-fire conditions, stressed the Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She added that Romania considered that accepting a realistic
status for Yugoslavia in the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) system would allow the OSCE to be
more efficient in its evaluations in the Yugoslav territory,
including the Kosovo area, and favor effectual monitoring in
conformity with international standards.

<HEADLINE> Quick End to White House Scandal Probe Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's investigation of alleged White House sex and cover-up
could be over by September, Orrin Hatch, chairman of the U.S.
Senate Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be more than just alleged sexual peccadilloes in
the White House, and frankly all of us would like to get this over
with," Hatch, a Republican senator, said at a news conference.
"I'd be surprised if Ken Starr would allow this to go well into
September."
</P>
<P>
At the same news conference, the ranking Democrat on the
committee, Senator Patrick Leahy, criticized the expense of
Starr's four-year investigation of the scandal and other matters,
and called for a quick conclusion.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, after spending 40 million dollars, after requiring a
lot of innocent bystanders to spend millions of dollars of their
own money in legal fees, either wrap it up and send it to the
Congress or go home," Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Starr may prepare a report to Congress that may
recommend further scrutiny of President Bill Clinton, Leahy said,
"Give us a report on what he's done to date. Let the American
people, let the Congress do it and let the Congress act whichever
way they want. But wrap this sucker up."
</P>
<P>
Starr's report would go first to the House of Representatives,
where members would decide whether to begin impeachment
proceedings. Any impeachment trial would take place in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Burundian Warring Factions End Second Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's warring factions
concluded their nine-day second round of peace talks Wednesday in
Arusha, northern Tanzania, vowing to continue the national
reconciliation process which was moved last month in a bid to end
years of bloody conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Julius Nyerere, the peace facilitator for Burundi and founding
president of Tanzania, told a press conference that this round of
talks went extremely well and a third round of talks will be
resumed on October 12, sources reported from Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere said delegates from the 19 factions including the
government and armed rebel groups approved a set of rules of
procedure which set code for face to face talks although there
was some reservations on whether to accept observers from inside
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"This remains for further consultation and we hope we'll have
resolved this between now and round three," he said. "We will
also tackle the issues of establishment of committees, of
governance and democracy and the security for all."
</P>
<P>
Nyerere said the Burundian government has now removed its
reservation on the cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Two new factions joined this time the other 17 partners, which
were present at the first round of talks in Arusha, in discussion
at the Arusha International Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the second round of talks dealt with the nature
of the conflicts and reform of the justice and security in the
war-torn central African republic, more time and patience are
needed to keep the process going on.
</P>
<P>
The government was represented by Ambrose Niyonsaba, the
Minister for Peace Process, on behalf of President Pierre Buyoya
who attended the first round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Early last week when the talks began, Nyerere held informal
talks with FRODEBU (Front for Democracy in Burundi) President
Jean Minani, and special envoy from the European Union Aldo
Ajello while his aides met separately with other parties.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that warring parties will put their heads together to
bring peace in Burundi," an aide to Nyerere said.
</P>
<P>
The plenary session was chaired by Nyerere and was attended by
observers from the European Union, the United States, Canda,
Italy and others.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim, the Secretary General of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU), was also present at the first round of
talks in June which issued a joint declaration to deal with the
problems of genocide, refugees, peace and public security and
others.
</P>
<P>
"All armed parties to the conflict (agree to) declare a
suspension of hostilities to take effect not later than the 20th
of July 1998," the declaration said. "(We) pledge to resolve the
Burundi conflict through peaceful means, and to put an end to all
forms of violence."
</P>
<P>
"We will create a climate of lasting peace in our country and
to bring to an end the constant cycle of violence and fratricidal
killings which have afflicted Burundi for a long time," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, so far there has not been any formal declaration of
end of hostilities among the warring factions and there are still
reports of civilian killings by armed rebels in southern Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the African leaders and the international
community, the 76-year-old Nyerere began his mediation since July
1996 when seven east and central African countries imposed
economic sanctions on Bujumbura following a military coup which
toppled a civilian governemnt led by President Ntibantunganya and
brought Major Pierre Buyoya to power.
</P>
<P>
In May, Nyerere met separately in Dar es Salaam with all the
Burundi factions leaders in preparation to make the Arusha talks
a success which may lead to an early lifting of the economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture to answer the calls by sanctions imposers and to
ease the internal tension, Major Buyoya, an ethnic Tutsi, signed
later a new transitional constitution and named two vice-
presidents including an ethnic Hutu leader of the main opposition
party.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in
bloody conflicts between the ethnic Hutu majority and the ruling
Tutsi minority since the assassination of Melchior Ndadaye, the
first president elected under a multiparty system in 1993.
