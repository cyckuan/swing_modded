<HEADLINE> mee041425hke-- Israeli Ambassador Defends Operation in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Ambassador to Turkey Zvi
Elpeleg said here today that the on-going operation against
Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon "was aimed at forcing the
Lebanese government to establish authority over its own territory."
</P>
<P>
Elpeleg told a press conference that his country had declared
many times that it had no claim for Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
He said Israeli army would withdraw from south Lebanon when the
Lebanese government could prevent the terrorist attacks launched
from its land against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey, due to its own cross-border operations in
northern Iraq to combat Kurdish rebels, has carefully kept its
voice down regarding the Israeli raids in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other Arab states and some European countries which
condemned the Israeli raids immediately, Turkey made a statement
over the weekend carrying no condemnation.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which was reportedly issued after consultations
with Israeli Ambassador, said that Ankara had expressed its
concern regarding any damage that might be imposed on civilians
who had no involvement in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Ankara said the developments would cause local support to the
peace process to waver and would deliver a blow to the peace
process.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian Foreign
Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal al-Saud today expressed his
country's support to Lebanon in defending its land and safeguard
its security, according to Saudi Press Agency (SPA).
</P>
<P>
Prince Saud's remarks came during his meeting with Lebanese
Ambassador to Riyadh Zuheir Hamdan, during which they discussed
bilateral ties and issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi minister reiterated his country's condemnation to
the Israeli aggression, which Riyadh regards as a violation to
Lebanon's sovereignty and its territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Israeli raids against Lebanon would step up
tension and violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia Saturday said the Israeli attacks on Lebanon
"constitute a challenge to the international legitimacy which
wants Israel to withdraw from the Lebanese territories under U.N.
Security Council resolution 425."
</P>
<P>
The four-day Israeli attacks on Beirut's suburbs, and southern
and eastern Lebanon killed more than 50 people and forced
thousands of people to leave their homes in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Denounces Israeli Aggression against South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese Foreign Ministry
today denounced the Israeli aggression against south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that Israel was not only maintaining its
occupation of the Lebanese territories, but went beyond that by
launching a flagrant aggression against Lebanon using all modern
destructive arms.
</P>
<P>
Such aggression represents an overt violation of international
conventions and norms as well as disrespect of human rights,
constituting a factor of insecurity and instability in the whole
region.
</P>
<P>
The ministry called on peace loving forces the world over to
confront these brutal raids against Lebanon, and to express their
rejection of such barbaric practices.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Lebanon onslaught continued for a fourth consecutive
day today. It said the raid was in retaliation for stepped up
attacks by the Shiite Moslem guerrilla group Hezbollah against
Israeli forces in south Lebanon and for the guerrilla rocketing of
its northern areas.
</P>
<P>
But, the guerrillas said they were fighting against Israel's
occupation of a border strip in south Lebanon. Israel established
a 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone" in south Lebanon in 1985
as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks on its northern
Jewish settlements.

<HEADLINE> Buthelezi Warns Against S.African Local Polls Postponement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi today warned his
party might withdraw from the government of national unity if
local government elections in Kwazulu/Natal Province were
postponed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to IFP supporters at an election rally in Phoenix
near Durban, Buthelezi said recent African National Congress
(ANC) calls for a postponement were part of a plot to create a
one party state.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi, Home Affairs Minister of the ANC-led government,
said if the ANC continued to press for the postponement of the
elections in Kwazulu/Natal, the consequences would be very grave
indeed.
</P>
<P>
"The IFP could no longer collaborate in a government of
national unity, if it were clear that the ANC was now in the
hands of a clique bent on a one-party state," said buthelezi.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi's warning followed a row over the provincial
election date which surfaced in Pietermaritzburg earlier this
week at a meeting involving various parties and interest groups.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, having been briefed on the situations in
Kwazulu/Natal, said on Thursday that further postponement might
be necessary for the local polls, which were already put off from
November last year to May 29 this year.

<HEADLINE> mee041422hke-- Lebanon Makes Efforts to Seek Israel's Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz announced here this afternoon that Lebanon is conducting
contacts with a number of countries to pursue an immediate Israeli
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz today met in his office with ambassadors of the five
permanent member states of the U.N. Security Council and
diplomatic envoys from members of the European Unions and the Arab
League.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz described what was happening today as a "political
project based on Israel's internal, political and electional
considerations," specifying that the Israeli government needs
"supports for Prime Minister Shimon Peres and a show that Shimon
is the head of the government who is able to guarantee Israel's
security."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz's remarks came when Israeli forces were continuing air
raids and bombardment at targets in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources reported that Israeli warplanes have, since
Thursday, carried out more than 75 air raids at towns and
villages in south Lebanon, western Bekaa, the eastern Bekaa
valley and Beirut's south suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party
of God, have launched successive volleys of Katyusha rockets at
15 Jewish settlements, in addition to the city of Safald, in
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
A Red Cross newest statistic showed that more than 16 people
were wounded in today's Israeli air raid at Beirut's south
suburbs, including an 11-year-old boy, who died from the serious
wounds. The air raid was the third of its kind in four days.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held following his meetings with the
foreign envoys, the Lebanese foreign minister stressed that the
"political project" was launched stemming from an "interior
competition between Israel's political and military authorities."
</P>
<P>
"All those have cast negative effect inside Lebanon," the
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the main purpose of the Israeli military
operations in Lebanon is to dispel a large number of Lebanese
(from the south) to Beirut in order to bring more "social
pressure" on the Lebanese government and to "push it to
confrontation with the resistance movement."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz announced that he had taken a number of steps in order
to rally international support on health, security and
humanitarian levels for those Lebanese dispelled by Israel from
their homelands in the south in the past four days.
</P>
<P>
He said that an urgent meeting of the Arab League called for by
Lebanon would be held Wednesday and would be attended by foreign
ministers of most Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that his country had lodged a complaint with the
U.N. Security Council, adding that "we have been informed today
after consultations that a (council) meeting will be held at 6:00
p.m. Monday night."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Lebanese demand, which will be raised at
the Security Council meeting, concentrates on three
points: implementation of U.N. Security Council resolution 425,
condemnation of Israel's aggression against Lebanon and immediate
stop of the aggression.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the implementation of the resolution 425,
which calls for an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, is the
basis to "end the military problem in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz stated that intensive contacts have been carried out
with Syria, Egypt and France, and Secretary General of the Arab
League Esmat Abdul-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the contacts with French Foreign Minister
Herve de Charette and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara was
"at first aimed at an immediate ceasefire."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister emphasized his country's
commitment to the "July understanding," saying that guerrillas of
the resistance would refrain from firing Katyusha rockets into
northern Israel on the condition that Israel stops attacking
civilian targets in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of repeatedly violating the U.S.-mediated
understanding by shelling houses and dwelling districts "on
various excuses."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon maintains that "resorting to the understanding
constitutes an acceptable mechanism for the stop of the Israeli
aggression," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But this does mean that the understanding is a solution," he
said, "the solution is an immediate Israeli withdrawal to the
internationally-recognized border."
</P>
<P>
"And we are waiting for (results of) the efforts made by a
number of countries for achieving a ceasefire," the Lebanese
foreign minister said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Voices Concern over Israeli Attacks on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today expressed
profound concern over the "extremely dangerous situation"
resulting from the four-day-old Israeli military attacks on
Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti stand was voiced by the Foreign Undersecretary
Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen during a meeting earlier today with
U.S. Ambassador to Kuwait Ryan Crocker, a Foreign Ministry source
told Kuwait News Agency (KUNA).
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. should exert prominent efforts to speed up an end to
the Israeli Military aggressions," the source quoted al-Shaheen
as saying, noting that these attacks had claimed the lives of
scores of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Crocker, al-Shaheen called for the
implementation of U.N. resolution 425 which calls for an
immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Since last Thursday, Israel staged air, sea and land
onslaughts against Lebanese territories, causing scores of
casualties and inflicting serious material damage.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Kuwaiti Cabinet expressed profound worry
over the Israeli offensives against Lebanon and deemed it as "a
violation of Lebanon's sovereignty, an encroachment of the
sanctity of its lands and a direct threat to the Middle East peace
process."
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet also decided to send urgent relief aid to the
ill-fated lebanese people, saying that Kuwait would continue to
support Lebanon's bid to maintain its territorial integrity and
the safety of its people.

<P>
LUSAKA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) member states have managed to reduce
tariffs on imports within the region by some 60 percent, the
COMESA chief revealed today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of COMESA second meeting of the inter-
governmental committee here, COMESA Secretary-general Bingu
Mutharika said some member states had also abolished restrictive
import and export licences and foreign exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
Mutharika said his organization had embarked on regional and
global trade because it would create more wealth, jobs and income
for the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
COMESA's main aim was, through economic transformation, to
achieve significant and sustained increase in productivity of
manufacturing, processing and agro-industries, so as to supply
competitive goods for regional and global trade, Mutharika said.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, grouping 23 states in the region, was born out of the
Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA) in
1994.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara will arrive in Riyadh Monday to discuss with Saudi
Arabian officials bilateral relations and other issues of mutual
concern, Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported from Riyadh today.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Ambassador to Riyadh Omar Al-Sayyed told KUNA that the
Saudi-Syrian Joint Committee will be headed by the Syrian foreign
minister and his Saudi Counterpart Prince Saud al-Faisal al-Saud.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sayyed added that the committee will also discuss the
current developments in the region, especially the israeli attacks
on Lebanon, which he described as "a great threat to the region's
peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
The suspended Syrian-Israeli peace talks will top the agenda
of the talks between al-Shara and Saudi officials, al-Sayyed said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian Ambassador added that the two sides will tackle
means of reinforcing trade and investment relations.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the total Saudi investments in Syria,
including more than 50 projects, amounted to more than 500
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We hope such investments would increase in the future,"
al-Sayyed said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Syrian markets encourage Saudi agricultural
and industrial goods which are tax-exempted.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi-Syrian Joint Committee was established in 1991 and
holds annual meetings alternately in damascus and Riyadh.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Returns Completely to World Community:  President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
said today his country was on the way to a complete return into
the international community and its institutions.
</P>
<P>
Everyday announcements on the normalization of relations were
coming from the European Union and other countries and there were
already 17 ambassadors in Belgrade, Lilic said.
</P>
<P>
"The sovereignty and state and legal continuity of Yugoslavia
are no longer disputable," the president said in an interview
given to a local radio in Kragujevac, a city in central
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
France sent its ambassador to Belgrade in Febuary, becoming the
first Western country to recognize the rump Yugoslavia. On April
8, Yugoslavia made a breakthrough in its diplomatic domain by
establishing diplomatic relations with Macedonia, an ex-Yugoslav
republic which gained independence in 1991. Over the past week,
several more European countries announced normalization of
relations with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Lilic said these recognitions were the result of Belgrade's
principled and consistent peace-making policy, which has
reaffirmed Yugoslavia as a key factor of stability in the Balkans
and southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslavia was open and prepared for cooperation with
all countries that wanted equal and mutually beneficial relations,
and Yugoslavia had no reason to be on the "side of the East or on
the side of the West."
</P>
<P>
"Full normalization of relations with former Yugoslav republics
is an essential precondition for consolidating the peace process,"
said the president.
</P>
<P>
He said the process of normalization with certain former
Yugoslav republics, such as Macedonia, went faster, while with
others it was slower.
</P>
<P>
"Where there remain open issues, such as in the case of
Croatia, owing to the question of the (disputable border
peninsula) Prevlaka, normalization will proceed gradually, until
issues of dispute are settled and problems resolved," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia also expressed readiness to normalize relations with
Yugoslavia, which comprises Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Lilic said solving the crisis in the former Yugoslavia gave
impetus to strengthening cooperation and reviving inter-Balkan
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Lilic said the role of the international community in the
crisis in the former Yugoslavia "has not always been positive."
</P>
<P>
The mistakes that were made, the biased and protective attitude
toward the seceded republics and their leaders on the one hand,
and the punishment with sanctions against Yugoslavia and the Serbs
on the other, stirred up the crisis and precipitated civil war, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, with the signing of the Bosnia peace accord and the
Erdut agreement concerning the Eastern Slavonia, the international
community had for the first time begun to apply principles of
equal treatment to all sides and confirmed the legitimacy of the
interests and rights of Serbs outside Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"The result of this is the recognition of Republika Srpska as
one of the two entities in Bosnia," he said, adding that Yugoslavia
was the only signatory to the Dayton accord that had fulfilled all
its commitments.

<HEADLINE> Gulf States Denounce Israel's Lebanon Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Arab countries today
denounced the four-day-old Israeli blitz on Lebanon and said that
it "goes against all calls" for establishing a just and
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA), a statement by the
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) said that this aggression
"bears a great risk to the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the six GCC member states -- Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain --
have fully supported the peace process since it started at the
1991 Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
It called on Israel to halt its ongoing land, sea and air
attacks on south Lebanon and the capital, Beirut, which have
killed a large number of children, elderly and unarmed civilians,
and to respect the sovereignty, independence and security of
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The right and sound path towards peace between the two
countries is Israel's compliance with U.N. Security Council
resolution 425, which calls for an Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon, the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
It also appealed to the co-sponsors of the Mideast peace
process, the U.S. and Russia, and all peace-loving and friendly
countries to pressure Israel into halting this "destructive war"
and guide the peace process on all tracks to success.
</P>
<P>
Israel's air, sea and land onslaught on Lebanon has killed 46
people and wounded over 90 since it began Thursday under the
pretext of rooting out the Shiite Moslem Guerrilla group Hezbollah
(Party of God) from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has been a menace to Israel over the past several
years as it often fires Soviet-designed Katyusha rockets against
the north of Israel, which occupies a border strip in south
Lebanon on the so-called grounds of preventing cross-border
guerrilla operations.

<P>
The Lebanese envoy briefed the prime minister on the Israeli
aggression which have inflicted heavy human and material losses.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Habib told reporters that Kabariti had
told him about the contacts Jordan was making at the highest
level under the directives of King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
He said Kabariti promised that Jordan would provide
humanitarian assistance including tents, blankets and medicine to
the hundreds of thousands of refugees who are forced to abandon
their homes in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
More than 21 people were killed and 50 others wounded in the
Israeli air and ground bombardment on Lebanon which began
Thursday in retaliation for the pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrilla
rocket attacks against northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 residents of south Lebanon have fled the area
streaming north toward Beirut since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Information Minister Marwan Muasher told reporters
after a regular cabinet meeting Saturday night that Jordan was
dismayed and concerned over the continuing Israeli military
operations in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Kabariti was the first Arab official to
personally contact Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri to
voice Jordan's concern over the Israeli actions in Lebanon,
referring to the telephone conversation between the two premiers
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan is concerned over the escalation of Israeli military
operations, which should be stopped immediately," said the
minister, adding that such actions "adversely affect the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
Muasher also said Kabariti had called his Israeli counterpart
Shimon Peres, urging him to halt the military operations in
Lebanon and emphasizing the dire need to resume "efforts at all
levels to eliminate all reasons for tension in the region as well
as the importance of an immediate resumption of peace
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has lodged a formal protest with the
U.N. Security Council over the Israeli attacks. It also called
for an emergency meeting of the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak today ruled out a
peaceful and diplomatic solution to the operations before Beirut
stops the guerrillas from rocketing Israel.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli cabinet statement issued earlier today said if
Hezbollah ceased its attacks, Israel would halt its operations.

<HEADLINE> UK Finance Minister Urged to Reject EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain's former chancellor of the
exchequer Norman Lamont urged his successor Kenneth Clarke today
to reject calls from his European partners for a single European
currency.
</P>
<P>
In a TV interview, Lamont stressed that Britain should not join
any new European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) to reinforce the
planned single European currency.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Britain resist European Union pressure to
joint the new ERM. The British "opt-out" right, negotiated by
Lamont himself, should not be compromised, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lamont called on the Tory party to unite behind Prime Minister
John Major in the run-up to the general election.
</P>
<P>
According to reports here today, Clarke, who is attending a
conference of EU finance ministers in Verona, Italy, faced an
ultimatum from Germany, France and the Netherlands Thursday night
to rejoin the new ERM by the end of the year or give up any hope
of joining a future single European currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that EU finance ministers spelt out their view
of the requirements of the Maastricht Treating at the meeting and
Germany and France proposed that all EU member states should
immediately return to the ERM, from which Britain was
humiliatingly forced to withdraw in September 1992 when a money
crisis erupted.
</P>
<P>
Clarke attempted to play down the significance of the two-year
membership requirement. No conclusion on the point had been
reached at the meeting and a more important consideration would be
whether a country's currency had exhibited a record of stability,
as Britain has, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although Britain has an opt-out on a single currency, John
Major has left open the option to join at a future date in order
to unite his cabinet which is split between those who want to sign
up as Clarke and those who do not, like Defense Secretary Michael
Portillo.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister has emphatically ruled out any
prospect of rejoining the ERM in this parliament.

ADDIS ABABA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Assistant Director General
of the International Labour Organization (ILO) for Africa Elias
Mabere pledged to strengthen assistance to Ethiopia today.
</P>
<P>
The ILO official made the pledge upon arrival to attend the
19th regular meeting of the Labour Commission of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU), which is scheduled to open at Africa Hall
tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
He said ILO would assist Ethiopia mainly in implementing
employment promotion projects.
</P>
<P>
As ILO is hit by financial constraints, it would, however,
provide Ethiopia with technical assistance in collaboration with
non-governmental organizations, the official added.

The Abuja-based ILO headquarters for Africa was in Addis Ababa
before 1990.

<HEADLINE> Libyans Hold Anti-U.S. Demonstrations (by Liu Rong) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRIPOLI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 Libyans held
anti-U.S. demonstrations here today in the Green Square and
outside of the U.N. Representative Office in Libya to commemorate
the death of their people killed 10 years ago in American air
attacks on targets in Tripoli and port city of Benghazi.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, most primary and high school students, were
wearing black ribbons on their arms and shouting slogans
protesting against what they called "American totalitarianism" and
showing support to their leader Muammar Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
"Down with the United States," "We won't bow to the Americans,"
and "Long live our great leader Muammar Gaddafi" were the slogans
they chanted.
</P>
<P>
On April 15, 1986, U.S. fighter bombers attacked the Libyan
cities of Tripoli and Benghazi, after Washington said it has
evidence linking Libya to the bombing of a discotheque in Berlin
frequented by American servicemen. Libya said 37 people died in
the raids.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also protested against the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Libya since 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two
suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include an air embargo, a ban on sale or transfer
of weapons and downgrading of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions are unfair to us," Yossef Saicar, a school
teacher, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"But We are not afraid of the sanctions because we are very
strong and live a normal life," he added.
</P>
<P>
But another school teacher told Xinhua that the sanctions did
have strong effects on the lives of the Libyan people, who he said
suffer from a serious shortage of medicine and foodstuffs as well
as the skyrocketing price hikes.
</P>
<P>
According to a Libyan information official, demonstrations and
rallies of similar kinds were held today in other parts of the
capital and all across the country.
</P>
<P>
To commemorate the victims of the American bombing, the Libyan
government also declared today "a day of mourning," and suspended
all international telephone links as well as land, sea and air
transportations.
</P>
<P>
Buildings, shops and hotels are seening hanging black ribbons
in front of them to remind people of the dead and the "American
terrorist acts."

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Welcomes Easing of Tension in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said in Skopje today it was good
that tension in the Balkans was easing.
</P>
<P>
This should encourage efforts aimed at an improved cooperation,
Qian told reporters in the Macedonian capital, where he arrived
late Saturday on a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic which gained independence
in 1991, established diplomatic relations with the rump Yugoslavia
early this month.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the current visit meant China's more political and
economic interest in the Balkans, Qian said China appreciated the
adherence to the principle of preserving peace and stability in
the region, but it did not have any special interests in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister held talks today with President
Kiro Gligorov and other Macedonian officials and the talks focused
on the ways of improving bilateral economic cooperation, according
to reports from Skopje.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister Ljube Trpeski
welcomed China's consistent and principled policy to the peaceful
settlement of problems in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia has "expressed principled support for the unification
of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao with their parent country, in
confidence that the process will end peacefully with the wise
policy of the Chinese leadership," Trpeski told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Urban Population to Exceed That in Countryside by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The human race will become a
predominantly urban species and by 2000 more people will be living
in the world's towns and cities than in the countryside, said a
report being published this week.
</P>
<P>
Details of the report prepared by the U.N. Development Program,
the U.N. Environment Program, the World Bank and the World
Resources Institute, for a U.N. conference on the future of the
world cities, appear in the Independent on Sunday newspaper here.
</P>
<P>
It said that the change of habitat is happening at an
astonishing speed. The world's urban population is growing faster
than the already rapid increase in human numbers as a whole, and
will almost double over the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"As recently as 1975, just over one third of the world's people
lived in urban areas," said the report, but "by 2025, the
proportion will have risen to almost two thirds."
</P>
<P>
The report said that in 1900, only New York and London had more
than 8 million people, and now London is not even among the
world's top 25 cities.
</P>
<P>
By 2015, the top five biggest cities are: Tokyo with a
population of 28.7 million; Bombay, 27.4 million; Lagos, 24.4
million; Shanghai, 23.4 million; and Jakarta, 21.2 million.
</P>
<P>
The report is aimed to alert government to a coming urban
crisis. One of the results of the faster population urbanization
is that in developing countries 600 million people are estimated
to live in slums, the report predicted.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, London will also shoulder a heavy burden,
described Herbert Giradet, professor of environmental planning at
Middlesex University.
</P>
<P>
By the time, although London covers less than 400,000 acres, it
needs nearly 50 million acres -- 125 times its area -- to provide
it with food, timber and other resources and to absorb its
pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This means that although it contains only 12 percent of
Britain's population, London requires an area equivalent of all
the country's productive land to service it," he said.

<HEADLINE> Peres: Israel Has No Intention of Returning to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Shimon Peres
said here today that Israel has no intention of returning to
Lebanon, or entering battles with either the Syrian or the
Lebanese armies.
</P>
<P>
Peres, in an announcement issued following today's weekly
cabinet meeting, said Israel will not allow Hezbollah firing from
within villages in southern Lebanon, and "will not permit
Hezbollah to conceal itself among the civilian population."
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as the Israeli army continues its
military operation against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon,
code-named "Operation Grapes of Wrath," which started last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"If Israeli civilian facilities are hit," said Peres, "there
will be no immunity from strike on parallel Lebanese facilities."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that Israel's policy was not to injure
civilians, saying "we will endeavor to prevent losses on our
side, as well as injury to Lebanese citizens"
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader pointed out that Hezbollah has breached all
previous understandings, which were achieved through
U.S. mediation in July 1993, and "has deliberately created an
escalation (of tension in southern Lebanon)."
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel "is not limited by time, and has the
patience, fortitude, and ability to continue carrying out the
required actions until Hezbollah attacks cease."
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli media reports, several senior Israeli
army generals predicted that the anti-Hezbollah military operation
would last two weeks until its aims are achieved.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio today quoted Amiram Levine, the Israeli army's
northern commander, as saying that the army would continue the
operation until it is sure that Katyusha rockets will no longer be
fired into Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to hit Hezbollah as long as we feel that
there are still targets or the other side does not understand that
the Katyusha rocket fire has to stop," Levine said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli warplanes carried out strikes throughout
today against Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, as
Hezbollah fired more Katyusha rockets at Kiryat Shmona and other
northern Israeli towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured during the Katyusha attacks, according to
the Israel Radio report, but several cars and buildings were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, the electricity supply was temporarily cut
off in Kiryat Shmona due the Katyusha attacks.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Israeli army called on the
Lebanese residents of more towns outside the "security zone," as
well as the coastal town of Tyre, to evacuate the area.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman today confirmed the reports that the
Israeli Navy has imposed a blockade of the harbor of Beirut,
capital of Lebanon, since 4:00 a.m. local time (01:00 GMT)
Saturday, with the Navy warships stopping ships from entering all
ports from Tyre to Beirut.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in the past three days, more than 20 people
have been killed and over 40 others wounded in the Israeli strikes
against Hezbollah, which once reached deep into the suburbs of
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
A senior Lebanese official said that more than 200,000
Lebanese residents have fled over 45 towns and villages in the
south of the country to escape the Israeli military operation.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Lebanon, the Lebanese government has
formally requested the U.N. to launch an international appeal to
get humanitarian assistance for the Lebanese displaced.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto said in Lahore this evening that her government will not
compromise with the terrorists in any case.
</P>
<P>
She was talking to newsmen at the Shaukat Khanum Memorial
Hospital, site of a powerful bomb blast in Lahore, capital of
Punjab province, where five persons were killed and 31 others
injured this noon.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn whoever has done this act of terrorism," said
Benazir.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister recalled that in the recent past a series of
bomb explosions occurred in Lahore, adding this might be part of
the same chain.
</P>
<P>
She had ordered the provincial authorities to tighten security
measures.
</P>
<P>
Benazir flew directly from Peshawar, capital of Northwest
Frontier province where she was having a visit, to Lahore this
afternoon immediately after the bomb blast in the city.
</P>
<P>
She went straight from Lahore Airport to Jinnah Hospital to
inquire about the condition of the injured and then to the site of
the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened when a five kg explosive device placed in
a trolley went off in the hospital, a cancer hospital run by
cricket star Imran Khan and located on the outskirts of the
provincial metropolis. Eight of the injured are in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister directed the Punjab government to assess the
losses caused to the hospital building and arrange its repairs on
government expense.

HARARE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch government has

<HEADLINE> OPEC Chief Visits UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Omar Makhloufi, the president
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), today
praised the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in supporting of the
organization's efforts for safeguarding the crude prices.
</P>
<P>
Makhloufi held a meeting with UAE Deputy Prime Minister
Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed al Nahyan today in Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
He arrived here Saturday from Qatar with OPEC Secretary General
Rilwanu Lukman as part of a tour of Gulf OPEC members in
preparation of the June OPEC meeting. They have also visited
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sultan reaffirmed UAE's support to OPEC in safeguarding
the oil price but also said his country will increase its
production if OPEC's output ceiling rises.
</P>
<P>
The UAE currently produce 2.16 million barrels per day (bpd)
of oil under the OPEC quota.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC officials are also expected to visit Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, an OPEC member, is discussing with the United Nations a
plan to allow it to export 2 billion dollars worth of oil every
six months in a "oil-for-food" deal.
</P>
<P>
Experts said if the deal is reached, Iraq can export up
to 700,000 bpd of oil, which might put pressure on prices if
OPEC fails to rein in quota violations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Divers Dominate Asian Swimming Championships  By Sportswriter Zongxin Zhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Even a third-notch Chinese diving
team proved to be too much for their opponents as they sealed up
their show by sweeping all the six gold medals for the sport's
three-day competitions which closed at Fifth Asian Swimming
Championships here today.
</P>
<P>
Following their sharp and clean victories in the two previous
days, the Chinese teenagers scored another double win today,
taking both the men's platform and women's three-meter springboard
events, the last of the schedule.
</P>
<P>
This year's national champion for men's platform event Li
Chengwei, 13, from Southeast China's Fujian Province, collected a
total of 689.61 points for the top honor. He was awared with a
day-high score of 87.36 points for the seventh out of 10 dives for
the semi-final and final.
</P>
<P>
His teammate Song Dinghui, 14, followed with 622.26 points for
the second place and Japanese Kaneto Keita was third with 601.14
points.
</P>
<P>
It was another Chinese who took the women's three-meter
springboard final this afternoon. Li Rongjuan, runner-up in the
earlier one-meter springboard event, scored the highest total of
575.31 points today.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Yuki Motobuchi, 27, finished second with 539.49 and
another Chinese Chi Meilan took the bronze with 505.17 points.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese won the men's and women's team titles with 2610.54
and 3439.14 points. Hosts Thailand were second for both events,
with 2030.67 and 2943.24 points.
</P>
<P>
But it was Thai Pichi Suchart who scored the highest men's
individual total score of 1545.27 points. In the women's section,
Ri Ok Rim from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea took the
highest total score of 1251.00 points.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese divers, though as young as they were here, defeated
others mainly due to their more difficult dives and insistent
performance, which are two key factors in earning higher points in
the sport.
</P>
<P>
And it proved that the painful efforts of Chinese coaches in
recruiting younger talents and exsorting to more scientific
training programs have worked.
</P>
<P>
Pool side experts noticed that divers from the DPR Korea, South
Korea and Thailand are making fruitful efforts in improving their
skills.
</P>
<P>
The newcomers are now challenging such front runners as China
and Japan. It might not be long before the time comes for a wide
spread of gold medals at major international events.

<HEADLINE> New Analysis: Israel Launches Nerves War of Low Intensity (Part II) (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beirut Christian "Voice of Lebanon" radio today quoted
security sources in the Shiite-populated city of Baalbek in
eastern Lebanon as reporting that some 300 Hezbollah's so-called
"martyrdom fighters," a name often regarded as referring to those
who carry out suicide attacks at Israeli forces, left for the
South Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Most of the casualties in the four days were civilians. To
expand the effectiveness of the war of nerves, the Israeli forces
have ordered residents of the south Lebanese port city of Sour and
38 towns and villages in the South and Western Beqaa to leave
their houses before 9:00 a.m. (6:00 GMT) today, then the ultimatum
was extended for a few hours.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Israeli forces asked residents of 41 southern
Lebanese towns and villages to leave their houses, forcing some
100,000 people to rush to Saida, Sour and other places which they
considered safer.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army today also ordered a traffic ban on all main
and branch roads in south Lebanon, including that between Saida
and Sour, against any vehicle driving from the north to the south.
</P>
<P>
To seek an international interference to put an end to the
Israeli aggressions, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri arrived
in Cairo this morning to meet with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, then to Paris to meet French President Jacques Chirac. He
will also fly to Morocco to meet King Hassan II.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad met in
Damascus with the Lebanese prime minister who was accompanied by
his foreign minister Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
Jubran Khouri, Assad's spokesman, announced that the meeting
between Hariri and Assad dealt with the Israeli aggressions on the
Lebanese lands.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon called for an urgent meeting of the Arab League and
decided to lodge a complaint with the U.N. Security Council
against the Israeli aggressions, despite a possible veto by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Several Lebanese officials sources believe that Israel had
obtained a go-ahead from Washington, in advance of its military
operations in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has accused
Hezbollah of violating an understanding mediated by the
U.S. between Israel and the Lebanese Shiite Moslem party in July,
1993, of not to attacking civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that the Israeli bombardments at Beirut and
south Lebanon had not led to a collapse of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Katyusha rockets launched by Hezbollah at
northern Israel was the "real basic problem."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel's aggression against
Lebanon, especially the South, today has entered its fourth
successive day, during which Israeli warplanes carried out its
third air raid in four days at Beirut's southern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak has announced that the
military operations in Lebanon would last one or two weeks, and
that the Israeli forces would continue the combat against the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Local military observers noted that Israel has launched a
nerves war of low intensity, and has named it as the April 11
War."
</P>
<P>
The observers see clear purposes of the Israeli actions -- to
exert maximum pressures on Lebanon, especially the Hezbollah, to
force them to yield, rather than pursuing specific military
achievements.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is playing a major role in the resistance against an
Israeli occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government wants, through the operations in
Lebanon, to score a victory against the so-called "terrorism," and
to create a favorable condition for Prime Minister Shimon Peres
and his Labor Party to achieve a triumph in the upcoming May 29
elections.
</P>
<P>
And at the same time, Peres' government also wants to limit the
intensity of the operations not to ruin the Middle East peace
process, according to the military observers.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, three characteristics have been demonstrated
in the Israeli military actions in Lebanon: large in scale, long
in time and giving a full play of the advantage of Israel's air
force.
</P>
<P>
This is a stereoscopic war. Israeli warplanes carried out
frequent attacks at Hezbollah targets in Beirut's southern
suburbs, Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon, Western Beqaa and the
South. Meanwhile, the Israeli occupation forces in South Lebanon
also continuously shelled Lebanese villages.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five Lebanese were killed and more than 60 others were
wounded in the past three days, according to Red Cross sources.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes today launched an air raid at Beirut's
Shiite Moslem-populated southern suburbs at 1:30 p.m. (10:30 GMT),
the third air raid at the same area in four days.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary report said that at least six people were wounded
in the air raid.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes launched an air raid at a power station at
the town of Jumhour on the outskirts of the Lebanese capital at
12:30 a.m. (09:30 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
In a previous air raid at Beirut's southern suburbs, Israeli
helicopters fired air-to-surface missiles to positions of the
Lebanese army and Syrian troops, killing one Syrian soldier and
wounding seven others.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Israeli warplanes launched an air raid at a
Hezbollah base near the Shiite stronghold of Baalbek city in
Lebanon's eastern Beqaa Valley, firing the first shot of the
agressions against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At the same time of the air raids and bombardments, Israel, on
the excuse of preventing more weapons from being handed over to
Hezbollah, sent its warships to enforce a blockade on the Beirut
port and others, banning any ship from pulling in to shore.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas also announced that they launched a volley of
Katyusha rockets at Jewish settlements in northern Israel, in a
latest Katyusha rocket attack at northern Israel of a dozen of
similar attacks in four days.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese swimmers came from the
shadow of a Chinese dominance to win four gold medals on the third
day at the Fifth Asian Swimming Championships here today.
</P>
<P>
With the victories, the Japanese team narrowed the gap with the

</P>
<P>
Chinese Chen Yan finished second and another Japanese Aiko

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Reigning champion Shanghai
Shenhua began its campaign of title defense with a first round
home 3-0 win over Sichuan Quanxing, but last season's runner-up
Beijing Guo'an suffered a 1-0 defeat to August First in the
Chinese professional soccer League on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> East China's Green Producers Better Educated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Fewer farmers in east China's Anhui
province are illiterate as rural workers combine working in the
fields with studying in the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
The result is that more farmers than ever have received at
least nine years of school education.
</P>
<P>
Among 14,052 people randomly surveyed, 14.2 percent are
illiterate, 5.3 percentage points lower than that in a 1990
survey, when 15,480 people were chosen to answer a questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by a research group on rural society and
economy of the province, also revealed that more farmers have
received middle school education.
</P>
<P>
One out of every four farmers in the latest survey was a junior
middle school graduate. In 1990 one out of every five farmers had
received junior middle school education.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase also reflected that rural education was
limited in the junior period because there were not enough
teachers, according to the research group.
</P>
<P>
Anhui, with a total population of 60.13 million, is one of
China's vital green producers. The average annual net income per
farmer was 1,302 yuan (about 156.8 U.S. dollars) in 1995, almost
two and a half times that in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Members of the research group contributed the changes to
farmers demand that their culture needs were met after they became
wealthier as the rural economy grew faster. Farmers who benefited
from aid-the-poor through science and technology programs realized
the importance of education and knowledge.

Canada, France, the Netherlands, Japan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Peony has been planted in China for more than 1,500 years with
the species in Luoyang being best known. The city government first
decided to hold an annual peony fair between April 15-25 in 1983.

<HEADLINE> One Million Chinese Couples Split Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- More than a million Chinese
couples divorced in the past year, according to today's China
Women's News.
</P>
<P>
The number who parted company - 1,055,000 couples - was 74,000
more than in 1994, the paper quoted the latest statistics from
the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that divorced people in 1995 accounted for
1.75 per thousand of the country's total population.
</P>
<P>
The number of divorces has been growing over the past 12 years,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Beijing, the number of divorced people
rose by only 200 couples, but divorcees accounted for 3.4 per
thousand among the municipality's total population. This was a
modest decrease of 0.1 per thousand compared with 1994.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful farewells have become more acceptable among couples
wanting to get divorced, but departments of civil affairs and
courts across the country reported that most people went to court
to solve problems such as child-raising, and the division of
properties.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, nearly two-thirds of divorcing couples resorted to
court hearings.
</P>
<P>
About 830,000 divorced people got married last year, an
increase of 40,000 over the previous year. But the remarriage rate
was fairly low in terms of the growing number of divorced people.
</P>
<P>
Less than two-fifths of divorced people produced new families
again.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Clean Taihu Lake by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUXI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China has vowed to clean one of its
most polluted lakes by the end of the century. It will mean
lakeside businesses around Taihu Lake being forced to act.
</P>
<P>
Concerted efforts must be made to ensure that the Lake becomes
clear again by 2000, State Councillor Song Jian said today in
Wuxi, in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Taihu is one of the most severely polluted lakes in east China,
where both the industry and agriculture have been booming since
the 1980s. The improvement of the water quality of the lake has
been listed among key national targets in the ninth Five-year Plan
(1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
According to Song Jian, fundamental causes of pollution of the
lake have been determined as a result of the efforts of the
environmental protection, water conservancy and science research
departments. Experts must be organized to work out a plan to
control pollution in the lake, said Song.
</P>
<P>
Industrial enterprises, township enterprises, cattle and
poultry farms, hotels and restaurants around the lake are required
to meet the state standards in terms of pollutants discharge by
the end of 1998. And measures will be taken to control industrial
pollution, accelerate the construction of urban sewage treatment
facilities, control the discharge of agricultural pollutants,
prevent soil erosion, and strictly control the tapping of
underground water.
</P>
<P>
A leadership group for the prevention and treatment of the
pollution in the Taihu Lake will be set up, with Xie Zhenhua,
director of the National Environmental Protection Agency, and Zhu
Dengquan, Vice-Minister of Water Resources, being the directors.

<HEADLINE> Libyans Hold Anti-American Demonstrations (by Liu Rong) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRIPOLI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 Libyans held
anti-demonstrations here today in the Green Square and outside of
the U.N. Representative Office in Libya to commemorate the death
of their people killed 10 years ago in American air attacks on
targets in Tripoli and port city of Benghazi.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, including primary and high school students,
were wearing black ribbons on their arms and shouting slogans
protesting against America's totalitarianism and showing support
to their leader Muammar Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
"Down with the United States," "We won't bow to the Americans,"
and "Long live our great leader Muammar Gaddafi" were the slogans
they chanted.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago today, U.S. fighter bombers attacked the Libyan
cities of Tripoli and Benghazi, after accusing Gaddafi of backing
extremists around the globe. Washington linked Libya to the
bombing of a discotheque in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also protested against the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Libya since 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two
suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions are unfair to us," Yossef Saicar, a school
teacher, told Xinhua. " We are not afraid of the sanctions because
we are strong and living a normal life."
</P>
<P>
But another school teacher told Xinhua that the sanctions did
have effects on the Libyan people, who suffer from a serious
shortage of medicine and foodstuffs as well as the skyrocketing
price hikes.
</P>
<P>
According to an information official, there are rallies of
similar kind all across the country.
</P>
<P>
To commemorate the death of their people, the Libyan government
also declared today "a day of mourning," and suspended all
international telephone links as well as land, sea and air travel
for 12 hours.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence in HK to Boost Service Industries: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong-based traders and
manufacturers are confident that the territory will remain the
favored base for their regional headquarters, according to a
survey released today by the Trade and Development Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
The confidence will help to boost trade supporting services in
Hong Kong, which depend largely on where controlling offices are
located, says the survey entitled "Hong Kong's Trade and Trade
Supporting Services."
</P>
<P>
As shown in the report, 92 percent of the 2,500 companies
surveyed have the intention to maintain their regional
headquarters or offices in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two thirds believe that overall trade in Hong Kong will
expand vigorously over the next five years. Faster growth is
anticipated in offshore trade, which involves transshipment and
direct shipment by Hong Kong companies from production bases
outside the territory to overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Offshore trade in Hong Kong is estimated at 655 billion HK
dollars (84 billion U.S. dollars) in 1994, roughly making 70
percent of the total re-exports that year.
</P>
<P>
Booming trade activities have generated brisk business for Hong
Kong's trade supporting industries, ranging from freight
forwarding to telecommunications, advertising and market research,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's role as regional headquarters will be intensified
with the rapid economic growth in China and across the
Asia-Pacific region, and Hong Kong has a leading edge over its
competitors with more experienced and skilled service providers.

<HEADLINE> UK Tory MPs Predict Election Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Two-thirds of British Tory
members of parliament believe their party will not win the
next general election which is scheduled for May, 1997.
</P>
<P>
More than one-third predict that the opposition
Labour leader Tony Blair will form the next government,
according to a survey by the Sunday Times weekly.
</P>
<P>
The survey says that evidence of a collapse in moral
among the Tory MPs is apparent after the Conservatives'
fatal defeat in the key by-election at Staffordshire
South-West constituency last Thursday, in which Labour won a
smashing victory with a 22 percent swing, leaving John
Major's government only one-seat majority in the 651-seat
House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
Guaranteed anonymity, 100 Tory backbenchers, half of the
total, expressed fears for the future of their party,
the survey adds.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major now is under pressure from Tory
chairman Brian Mawhinney who maintained reshuffling the cabinet in
the summer in response to the expected defeat of Tories in the
local council election on May 2. A total of 55 MPs supported
Mawhinney's idea.
</P>
<P>
Asked what measures the prime minister should take to
improve the government's popularity, 45 MPs called for tax
cuts, 22 for higher education spending and 10 for more
expenditure on the National Health Service.
</P>
<P>
But the Tories remain deeply divided over policy on Europe: 41
MPs wanted the government to rule out joining a European single
currency during the next parliament if re-elected, while 49
opposed the idea.
</P>
<P>
Some Tories conceded openly that the mood of the country
is not with the government at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"Our big problem is that we have been there for too long and
people are fed up with the same old faces," one of them
explained.

FREETOWN, April 14 (Xinhua)-- About 162 people who fled the
fighting in Monrovia, Liberia, by the ship Hollgan Star arrived
here early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine of them were United Nations personnel, 72 Lebanese
while the rest were Sierra Leoneans, Iranians, Liberians and
other nationalities.
</P>
<P>
According to an officer of the vessel who asked not to be
named, the vessel left Monrovia last Friday and spent 40 hours at
sea before arriving in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The head of the UN team Tsukasa Kimoto, who also arrived with
the vessel described the scene in the Liberian capital as ''a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
He spoke of ''intense fighting'' in Monrovia for three straight
days.
</P>
<P>
''I am also head of the FAO (the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization) and my office was the first to fall to
looters,'' Kimoto said.
</P>
<P>
Asked why the UN had pulled out, Kimoto attributed the
decision to ''the security of the staff as there was no guarantee
of their safety.''
</P>
<P>
He said however, ''we have left about 15 staffers of the UN
system behind.''
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean government officials at the port in downtown
Freetown set up an unprecedented screening operation with dozens

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists New Discovery on Wheat Seed Irradiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have revealed
the secret of why wheat seed irradiation can boost yields by as
much as 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
The experts have been working with ultra-low energy heavy ions
on wheat seeds.
</P>
<P>
Normally, heavy ions with moderate or low energy can penetrate
into the 34.6-micron skin of wheat grains and exert a direct
effect on their blast cells, according to Wei Zengquan, a research
fellow at the Modern Physics Research Institute under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the genetic information of the seed is changed,
and the seed may become a high-yielding strain, said Wei, head of
a research group on the irradiation effect of ultra-low energy
heavy ions.
</P>
<P>
The scientists found out that although such heavy ions can not
go through the skin of a wheat grain, they are able to set off
special X-rays with hundreds of electron volts at the skin of the
wheat. The X-rays are thus able to arouse gene mutations and
produce high-yielding traits.
</P>
<P>
With such a method, the scientists have worked out 13 new wheat
strains, and wheat production is raised between 10.6 to 57.4
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The office of the Italian
aid agency, Inter-SOS, in Jowhar town has been pillaged by
Somali gunmen on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The looting occurred after 9-15 gunmen gutted the gate of the
compound and at gunpoint silenced the guardsmen and subsequently
ransacked all the offices and stores of the agency.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Jowhar, 90 km north of Mogadishu,
the gunmen have taken away the field radio communication of the
agency, all office furniture and 2,000 US Dollars in cash. It is
yet to be known the identification of the looters, however the
Islamic court in Jowhar said it is carrying out an intensive
investigation regarding the issue to apprehend the culprits.
</P>
<P>
One of the guardsmen of the agency said all the gunmen were
armed with assault rifles and their faces were not new to him.
during the ransacking operation no single international staff was
present, and the local workers could hardly prevent the action.
this looting on the Inter-SOS compound in Jowhar is practical
threat to all the international aid agencies operating in Jowhar
and in the middle Shabelle region in general.
</P>
<P>
Inter-SOS has been operating in Jowhar since 1993 on
Agricultural development and health programs. it is too soon yet
to know whether the agency will close down its office in Jowhar
or not, but similar measures are being expected from the officials
of the agency. Jowhar has been one of the most peaceful towns in
southern Somalia before Ali Mahdi Mohamed has sacked its former
district commissioner, Mohamed Omar Habed, who is currently
aligned with General Mohamed Farah Aideed. However, its still
difficult to say that Habed is undermining the security situation
of the town.

<HEADLINE> Russian Teaching, Learning in China Become Ripe (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Prime Time" for Russian teaching and learning in China was
in 1950s when the newly-founded People's Republic of China set out
to learn many things from the former Soviet Union. The largest
department at that time in the BFSU was the Russian Department
which had more than 100 teachers, and enrolled 700 to 1,000
freshmen each year.
</P>
<P>
Russian learning became a fashion again in early 1990s after
being silent for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
"Employers rushed in and asked to employ our students before
their graduation," recalled Bai, saying that it was good that
Russian-speaking Chinese students were in great demand.
</P>
<P>
To meet the great demand, the BFSU began to enroll two-year
students learning Russian for the first time in its history.
</P>
<P>
A survey on the employment of undergraduates from dozens of
colleges and universities showed that more than half of all
students graduating from Russian departments at that time worked
in trade companies.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the situation years ago, today's Russian teaching
and learning are riper and more stable, said Bai. Temporary
factors no longer cause big rises and falls.
</P>
<P>
The content of teaching is also better. Not only politics, but
economics, culture, sociology, and education are included in newly
compiled textbooks.
</P>
<P>
The traditional literature-oriented Russian teaching was also
changed when several universities of science and engineering
started Russian courses. Northern China Polytechnic University,
Harbin Polytechnic University, and Harbin Medical Sciences
University train professionals in both Russian and science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Estimates by experts indicate that demand for people who
majored in Russian would keep balanced in the near future. With
more and more elderly teachers retiring, the number of colleges
and universities which have Russian courses may slightly reduce.
</P>
<P>
"Fewer but better' will be the future trend of Russian teaching
and learning in China," Bai noted.

NEW DELHI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A novel communication system
has been developed in India to send, store and retrieve x-ray
images over a network in various parts of hospitals, virtually
eliminating the use of microfilms, the Press Trust of India said
today.

The new system, called "picture archival and communication

<HEADLINE> Russian Teaching, Learning in China Become Ripe (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Increasing numbers of people in
China are learning Russian, giving rise to the prospect of a
Russian Language Test.
</P>
<P>
The teaching and learning of Russian in China is expanding,
said an expert in charge of China's Russian teaching and learning
in colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
"After several ups and downs, Russian teaching and learning are
becoming ripe and stable step by step," said Bai Chunren, head of
the Russian group under a national guiding committee of teaching
and learning of foreign languages in colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
Bai was engaged for the position by the State Education
Commission (SEC). He has been teaching Russian at the most
prestigious institute of foreign languages, the Beijing Foreign
Studies University (BFSU), for 40 years. Bai is now a tutor of
doctoral degree seekers.
</P>
<P>
Bai and other 11 professors and experts in the group are
working on a syllabus of Russian teaching and learning for
teachers and senior and undergraduate students across the country.
</P>
<P>
The syllabus for freshmen and junior students has been in use
for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The SEC is considering organizing a Russian proficiency test
similar to the English Proficiency Test (EPT). EPT is widely
received in China's colleges and universities, with those who pass
the test having an advantage when looking for jobs, over those who
did not pass.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 colleges and universities in China have Russian
departments, or majors with nearly 2,000 four-year students on
campus. They annually enroll about 400 freshmen who will learn
Russian for four years.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 middle school students in China learn Russian as
their foreign language. Most of them are from northeast China
which borders on Russia.
</P>
<P>
When Bai began his Russian teaching career, he began with only
one textbook. "The content was even farther behind than the Soviet
Union society," said Bai.
</P>
<P>
To Zhou Wenbin and Fan Hongyue who will graduate this Summer,
however, it has already become part of their Russian learning to
read latest magazines and newspapers published by Russia, watch
Russian videos, and practise listening in the language
laboratories. From the second year, Russians became their
lecturers for the Russian intensive reading course.

<HEADLINE> Peres: No Time Limit In Operation In Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said today Israel's on-going operation in Lebanon is not
limited in time, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "If Hezbollah stops its attack, we would
stop ours."
</P>
<P>
Peres made the statement at a weekly cabinet meeting here
this morning. He declared that "Israel has no intention of
going back into Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The cabinet heard a report on the war situation from Chief of
General Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak and head of the military
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
While all ministers expressed their support for the campaign,
Yossi Sarid, Environment Minister from the left-wing Meretz
Party, suggested that it be called off if Hezbollah stops firing
Katyusha rockets on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Peres also told the cabinet that the U.S. is not putting
pressure on Israel for its offensive, which was launched
on April 11. There is only low-level contacts between the two
countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak has canceled his trip to
Washington, which was planned before the attack code-named
Operation Grapes of Wrath. It had been assumed that Barak would
discuss the situation with Clinton Administration officials and,
possibly, officials from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Today is the fourth day of Operation Grapes of Wrath. The
Western Galilee and Panhandle area were bombarded three times
by Katyusha attacks this morning as Israel Warplanes and
artillery continued hitting Hezbollah positions in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There were not reports of casualties for the time being, but
damages were caused.

years."
</P>
<P>
"I have tried many kinds of diet food and medicine. I even
tried to loose weight by practising Qigong. But all was in vain,"
she said.

</P>
<P>
Experts say that the Chinese are become fatter and fatter. A
recent survey showed that in the past ten years the average weight
of teenagers in large and medium-sized cities has increased by two
kg, and fat has replaced malnutrition as the major problem of
teenagers.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Beef Exports In Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's beef exports to the
European Union (EU), amounting to about 44.4 million US dollars a
year, are being threatened by stringent import restrictions
imposed by the British government, currently reeling under an
outbreak of the mad-cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The Cold Storage Company of Zimbabwe, which has a monopoly on
the 9,100 tons of beef Zimbabwe ships yearly to the EU, said on
Sunday Britain was no longer buying meat from animals older than
30 months.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive of the company Laurence Masanga said that the
majority of Zimbabwean cattle, especially those from communal
farmers, were above the stipulated age limit.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, which is a net exporter of beef, had initially been
tipped to provide an extra quota to the EU as many countries
banned British beef after scientists linked the mad-cow disease
or BSE to its fatal human equivalent, the variant
creutfeldt-jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
BSE is a transmissible encephalophathy in cattle which was
first identified in the United Kingdom in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Masanga said, ''If the restriction by Britain is not lifted,
then our chances of meeting the normal quota are very very low
and let along satisfying any additional quota.''

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- About four million couples in
Nigeria are suffering from infertility caused by infections.
</P>
<P>
Professor Joseph Otubu, a renowned Nigerian obstetrician and
gynaecologist, told a recent seminar on reproductive health that
no fewer than 35 million African couples are also experiencing
infertility.
</P>
<P>
Professor Otubu, according to today's "Tribune" newspaper,
attributed the high infertility rate in the country and Africa as
a whole on the high premium placed on child bearing.
</P>
<P>
He said that 64 percent of infertile couples in Nigeria are
victims of infections from abortion, sexually transmitted
diseases and unhygienic child delivery.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for much publicity to enlighten the masses
on the causes and solutions to infertility," the professor
said, adding that the federal and state governments should
give more resource and attention to the issues of infertility
in the country because of its social complication on the
masses.

The rate stood at 9.4 percent for the corresponding period of

The 0.58 percentage point slump during the week as compared to

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Opposition leader
Nawaz Sharif said here today that Pakistan's prevailing economic
situation is unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Talking with a group of foreign correspondents here this
afternoon, Sharif said that the consumer price index in the first
nine months of the current fiscal year is 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The prices of many items had gone up, he said, adding that the
rupee had suffered more and more devaluation.
</P>
<P>
"The current exchange rate between US dollar and Pakistan rupee
is one against 35," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The rate was one against 26 when I left (the position of prime
minister in 1993)," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's foreign exchange reserve is below 1 billion US
dollars so far, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the good cotton crops, the country's export rose only
four percent in the first nine months of the fiscal year 1995-96,
as against the target of 17 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Import rose 20 percent as against the same period of last
fiscal year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The current fiscal year of Pakistan began on July 1, 1995 and
will end on June 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government's expenditure for the first nine months of the
fiscal year reached 70 billion rupees (about 2 billion US
dollars), which was going too far against the target of 32 billion
rupees (about 0.9 billion dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
"All these figures are from the government," he stressed,
adding that the whole economic situation of the country is clear.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pakistani Minister for Finance, Makhdoom Shahab
Uddin, today told the National Assembly that the foreign exchange
reserve stood at 1.7 billion US dollars now.
</P>
<P>
The reserve went down to 461 million dollars when Nawaz Sharif
was the prime minister, Uddin added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Government Urged to Implement Supreme  Court Judgment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan opposition leader
Nawaz Sharif today urged the government to implement a supreme
court judgment which obliges the government to have effective
consultations with chief justices in appointing judges of the
superior judiciary.
</P>
<P>
"I state categorically that the government must implement the
Supreme Court judgment first before the talks start between the
government and the opposition," Nawaz said in a statement to the
Islamabad Foreign Correspondents Association here today.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif, president of the Pakistan Muslim League and
former prime minister, said the government has taken negative
attitude toward the recent landmark judgment of the Supreme Court,
resulting in a constitutional crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The March 20 judgment of the Supreme Court reflects the letter
and spirit of the constitution by protecting the security of
service of judges in the superior judiciary and making the
appointment of judges in an open and above board manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Court has therefore taken a great leap forward in
upholding the rule of law and ensuring that no government will be
able to pack the judiciary with political appointees," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz accused Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of "insulting"
various judges, including the Chief Justice of the country, by
making a speech "in a taunting tone" in the National Assembly and
saying that the Supreme Court ruling had been "written in anger."
</P>
<P>
He said the government opposes the judgment because it will no
longer be possible for the government to use the judiciary as a
political instrument of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader also strongly criticized the government's
electoral reforms, saying "a planned pre-rigging operation is
underway since October 1995 through such mechanisms as preparation
of new electoral rolls to be followed by redrawing of
constituencies in a manner compatible with the political interests
of PPP (Pakistan People's Party) candidates."
</P>
<P>
"We do not accept the so-called electoral reforms of the
government and the election commission," he said. "We will take
action to reject the new rules."
</P>
<P>
He said the government is embarked on a path of endeavoring to
perpetuate itself in office at all costs, "even if it means
trampling on the constitution, defying parliament and the
judiciary, or preparing for rigging the next elections."

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets with Lebanese PM on Israeli Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
met here today with visiting Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri on escalated fighting between the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
guerrillas and Israeli army in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops have declared that the air raids and
bombardments against Hezbollah will last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Hariri apparently came to seek an Egyptian help to defuse the
tension in south Lebanon as Egypt was the first of the Arab
countries to make peace with Israel and often acts as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Hariri are expected to discuss the Israeli
situation, the impact of the recent Israeli attacks and Lebanon's
appeal for international assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process, particularly in view of the
tension in south Lebanon that is deemed to threaten the stability
in the region, is believed to be among the topics of discussion
between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Hariri met with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in
Damascus on the grave situation in the south. The Lebanese prime
minister is scheduled to leave here later today for Paris to meet
with French leaders on the Lebanese situation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli attacks on Lebanon today entered the third consecutive
day, with the Israeli gunboats blocking Lebanese ports and war
planes pounding towns and villages in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Tension grew in south Lebanon and a new rocket barrage fired
into Israel was reported just before Hariri's plane touched down
at Cairo International Airport. And a short while later, the
Israel air force launched again an air raid in the south.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Mubarak sent a message to the Lebanese
government urging an end to the violence and a return to peace
talks with Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Attacks and counter-attacks by the Hezbollah militia and the
Israeli troops have escalated over the past few days. Israel has
ordered nearly 200,000 people to leave their homes in southern
Lebanon, warning it will rake the area with artillery and aircraft
fire.
</P>
<P>
Also today, about 4,000 cars packed with families and
belongings were reported to be streaming out of the southern Lebanese
port of Tyre as people heeded Israel's warnings about artillery
and air bombardments.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila to Develop More Export Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
planning to develop more export processing zones (EPZS) in
response to increasing demand for more factory sites from both
domestic and foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
In line with his thrust to alleviate poverty in the country,
President Fidel Ramos has pushed for the creation of 10 more EPZS
under the supervision of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority
(PEZA).
</P>
<P>
PEZA Director General Lilia de Lima last week named the
Marubeni Corporation of Japan as one of the proponents that may
start economic zone projects this year.
</P>
<P>
She indicated that the Marubeni group is planning to develop a
300-hectare special economic zone in Batangas, some 110 km south
of Manila.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the PEZA intends to develop Morong, Bataan, some
60 km north of Manila, as another economic zone should the
government decide to transfer the area under the jurisdiction of
the PEZA.
</P>
<P>
De Lima said she expects the new zones to be bigger in size
compared to existing export processing zones with an average area
about 300 hectares.
</P>
<P>
She expressed confidence that the PEZA can develop new economic
zones to satisfy the increasing demand from investors.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' existing economic zones are mostly fully
occupied with very little room for additional locators.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, investments in the country's economic zones have
been increasing.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, there were only 57 registered firms operating in the
country's economic zones, employing about 23,750 laborers.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, the number of registered firms jumped to 528 and the
number of employees ballooned to 125,190.
</P>
<P>
Total investments in 1986 amounted to around 6 billion pesos
(240 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
By 1995, the amount of investments in economic zones swelled to
approximately 52 billion pesos (2.08 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In January 1996, export revenues generated among designated
economic zones in the country amounted to some 460.7 million
dollars, almost 100 percent up from 230.7 million dollars posted a
year ago.

<HEADLINE> India to Get Multi-Role Russian Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- India is to add the new
aircraft to its combat fleet - the Russian-built two-seat
multi-role, long-range su-30 mk -- for its air force, the Indian
Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
The defense deal, possibly the most expensive for a one- weapon
system, will cost nearly 6,310 crore rupees (about 1.8 billion US
dollars) in a six-year time frame up to February 2002.
</P>
<P>
The decision has reportedly been taken in response to growing
pressure of the Indian Air Force (IAF) for a multi-role aircraft
which will give the air force greater flexibility in mobilizing
resources over a large war front.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the IAF combat strengthen still consists of the
ageing mig-21 variants. Some of these planes are awaiting an
expensive upgradation and the others are increasingly becoming a
liability, given their limitations of range, firepower and
electronics, and a high accident rate.

<HEADLINE> 500 HIV-Positive People Cured In Kenya: Kenyan Researcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The controversial anti-AIDs
medicine Pearl Omega created in Kenya has cured 500 HIV positive
victims, the researcher of the medicine, Professor Arthur Obel,
has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Professor Arthur Obel said that over 500 HIV positive victims
have tested negative after taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
Delivering public lecture at Moi University in Eldoret on
Friday, Professor Obel said among those taking his drug and
having been cured is a bishop. However the Professor did not
disclosed the bishop's name.
</P>
<P>
Professor Obel revealed that the drug improves the function of
kidneys and liver and is a pure natural compound free from
toxicity, local papers reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said production cost for a full dose of one carton that
contains 12 wine bottles costs 60,000 Kenya Shillings (about
1,000 U.S. dollar), adding that some patients have recovered
after taking only two bottles.
</P>
<P>
Professor Obel first announced break-through of the medicine
two months ago. He was refuted by the Kenyan Government, saying
that there was no medicine curing Aids in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ruling KANU -owned "Sunday Times" quoted Obel as saying
the government is now supporting mass production of the drug
because of anticipated high demand.

<HEADLINE> SRFA Strives for Sino-Russian Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chen Haosu, vice-president of the
Sino-Russian Friendship Association (SRFA), said that the coming
China visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin would serve as "a
great impetus" to the growth of non-governmental ties between
China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting President Yeltsin's China tour and it's our
sincere aspiration that Sino-Russian friendship would witness
constant expansion", Chen, also vice-president of the Chinese
People's Association for Friendship with Foreign countries, said
in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The predecessor of SRFA was the Sino-Soviet Friendship
Association (SSFA), China's largest organization for
non-governmental relations with foreign countries in 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in February 1992, which was based on
SSFA, SRFA has done a lot of work to promote Sino-Russian
people-to-people exchanges. according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
For example, SRFA sponsored a meeting between Russian President
Yeltsin and people from different circles in Beijing during
Yeltsin's China visit in late 1992.
</P>
<P>
Also, the association hosted a grand reception to celebrate the
45th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and Russia in
1994. A SRFA delegation attended the commemorative activities in
Russia marking the 50th anniversary of the victory of Anti-Fascist
War last year.
</P>
<P>
As a non-governmental organization, SRFA has paid much
attention to exchanges between the business circles of the two
countries, too, Chen noted. He referred to a seminar on
Sino-Russian economic, trade and technological cooperation held
last year, during which a number of business agreements and
letters of intent were signed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, SRFA has made great progress in bringing about
sister ties between provinces, states and cities of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, there was only one pair of such ties
between China and Russia, while now the number has grown up to 49,
Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Right to School Effectively Protected by Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Law on Compulsory Education
has "greatly promoted and effectively guaranteed" the development
of China's basic education, an educational official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The official from the State Education Commission (SEC)
contributed much of the country's success in developing compulsory
education to the Law on Compulsory Education, which began to be
implemented 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Chinese children's access to compulsory education has been
considerably improved, for the Law stipulates that it is the
responsibility of governments at all levels to develop basic
education, the official said. At the same time, investment in
basic education has been increased over the years, he added.
</P>
<P>
The "Compulsory Education Project for Poor Areas", launched by
the State Council last year, aimed to allocate a total of over 10
billion yuan (about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars) during the run-up to
the year 2000 to aid poverty-stricken areas implement compulsory
education.
</P>
<P>
By now, elementary education has been popularized in areas
covering 91 percent of the country's population, while nine-year
compulsory education popularized in areas covering 36 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
All together, 98.5 percent of Chinese children can go to
primary schools, more than 78 percent to middle schools.
</P>
<P>
The Law of the People's Republic of China on Compulsory
Education was adopted in April, 1986 at the Fourth Session of the
Sixth National People's Congress and went into in force on July 1,
the same year. It was the first time for China to regulate
compulsory education in the form of law.
</P>
<P>
According to the Law, students in urban areas can go to the
nearest school and enter a middle school without taking any
entrance examination. Students in rural areas can learn
agro-technical know-hows in addition to general culture, science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 200 million primary school students and
middle school students. About 80 percent of these students are in
rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Maintains Tourist Market Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Travel agencies, hotels, scenic
spots and other tourist outlets of the island Hainan Province are
urged to improve their services as part of an on-going campaign to
straighten out tourism market order.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is booming in Hainan, as the subtropical island is
drawing an increasing number of tourists by its unique natural
beauty and ethnic culture. However, complaints from tourists are
also on the rise as a result of substandard practices of some
tourist organizations.
</P>
<P>
The provincial tourism quality supervision authority, which was
set up 1995, has so far handled 148 complaints from tourists and
settled 85 percent of the cases.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts to straighten up the market order,
crack-down has been launched on illegal practices by travel
agencies including failure to pay quality deposit, illegal
contracting business to other travel agencies, undue changing of
itineraries, and inferior service by tourist guides.
</P>
<P>
Hotels and restaurants are also urged not to compete in price
cutting, which generally result in substandard service, and not to
engage in unauthorized tourism operations.
</P>
<P>
The scenic spots are ordered to improve the sanitation and stop
unauthorized charging, while tourist stores are demanded not to
sell inferior or fake goods and not to offer commission to tourist
guides.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is mainly being carried out in major tourist areas
such as Haikou, the provincial capital, Sanya, Xinglong and
Tongshi.

<HEADLINE> Finance Company Hopes to Be More Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China's finance companies are
expecting to play a more active role in fueling the development of
the country's large group enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China has 65 finance companies by this March, owning 82.5
billion yuan of assets, and getting 2.38 billion yuan of profits
annually, according to today's Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The country's large group enterprises that have finance
companies have a total of more than 1,126 billion yuan of assets
by 1995, accounting for one-quarter of the country's total
state-owned assets.
</P>
<P>
The finance companies have raised funds for enterprises'
expansion, speeding up the circulation of funds and improving
industrial enterprises' efficiency.
</P>
<P>
They also help group enterprises transform into shareholding
companies and improve their assets structure.
</P>
<P>
China intends to build up conglomerates to enhance domestic
firms' competition in the international market, as well as to
revive large state-owned enterprises, which demands more support
from finance companies.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the increasing demand, the finance companies
hope they would be allowed to get loans from commercial banks and
relending from the central bank.
</P>
<P>
They also hope to have rights to raise overseas funds and have
some quotas for short-term foreign debt as well as to be allowed
to set up some branches.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is drafting regulations to govern the
country's finance companies and would probably consider their
suggestions during the drafting, according to an official with the
China National Association of Finance Companies.

<HEADLINE> Probe on Thai Mass Media Chief's Murder steps up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Police are focusing on a conflict
of interest and problems in the Mass Communications Organization
of Thailand (MCOT) as possible motivations behind the killing of
the organization's chief.
</P>
<P>
Saengchai Sunthornwat, director general of the MCOT, was
assassinated Thursday night near his home by an unidentified
gunman.
</P>
<P>
Police investigators have questioned 10 MCOT employees to find
leads to the people behind the attack.
</P>
<P>
Many people speculated that the murder might be connected with
the recent changes which Saengchai had ordered in the programming
of MCOT's TV and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
Among those questioned are MCOT Deputy Director Orasa Khunwut,
Saengchai's secretary Khanit Busabong, MCOT Employees Association
President Yuthapong Wichaidit, Saengchai's driver Panya Detsri and
MCOT's chief driver Rungsak Suwanphanu.
</P>
<P>
Detectives have also examined minutes of MCOT board meetings in
the hope of finding information that could lead them to the
murderer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four mass communications agencies have agreed to
seek public donations to set up a reward fund for the arrest of
those involved in the assassination of Saengchai.
</P>
<P>
The reward would be set at 500,000 baht (20,000 US dollars),
according to Police Department spokesman Achiravit Supanpesach.
</P>
<P>
Part of donations would be used to set up a foundation in honor
of the late MCOT chief.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Visits Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SKOPJE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia is keen to develop a
good relationship with China and always attaches great importance
to the Chinese market, Macedonian Prime Minister Branko
Crvenkovski said today.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, he spoke highly of the great achievements
China has made since it adopted the policy of reform toward a
socialist market economy, which, he said, has set an example in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here this afternoon on his first official
visit to Macedonia, said China is pleased to note that the
bilateral friendly relations and cooperation have been growing
smoothly in all areas since China and Macedonia established
diplomatic relations in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"We attach great importance to Sino-Macedonian relations and
support your country's independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian added that China would like to develop and strengthen a
long-term and stable friendship with Macedonia on the basis of
mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Minister said that the two governments should
create more favorable conditions for the two countries' companies
and enterprises to increase contacts and expand cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Crvenkovski also agreed that there exist broad prospects for
China and Macedonia to develop their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Qian is expected to meet Macedonian
President Kiro Gligorov and Parliament Speaker Stojan Andov.
</P>
<P>
China and Macedonia established diplomatic relations in 1993,
two years after the former Yugolav republic became independent.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Using Recycled Building Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China expects to sharply increase
the use of recycled building materials by the end of the century,
according to today's Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
China Building Materials Academy has conducted research on
"ecomaterials" and submitted its findings to the central
government authorities, the English weekly quoted Jin Zonghe, an
expert in charge of the work, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The light-yet-strong new materials will be made of recycled
waste water, gas and waste residue and will be disinfected,
mildew-proof and thermal- and acoustic-insulating.
</P>
<P>
A trial project in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, to produce
cement and bricks from coal fly-ash disposed by a power plant has
proved extremely successful.
</P>
<P>
Over the last couple of years, tax exemptions and other
incentives have been extended to enterprises turning waste into
useful products.
</P>
<P>
Despite the encouragement, the recycling effort still does not
have adequate funds. And the cost of the high-tech recycled
materials is going to be higher than that of clay bricks, cement
and porcelain of average quality made by township enterprises,
raising a barrier to their popularization, Xie Ze, another expert,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, surging demand for materials for interior
decoration and remodeling in the last decade has supported the
development of varieties of superior building materials.
</P>
<P>
Finished projects utilizing the recycled materials will amount
to a combined 1.2 billion square meters of floor space this year,
the expert said.

STOCKHOLM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Poul-Erik Hoyer Larsen of
Denmark, defending individual champion, suffered a surprise
upset on the opening day of the team event at the European
Badminton Championships on Saturday in Herning, Denmark.

But despite the failure of Hoyer Larsen, the All-England
champion and world number two, defending team champions Denmark
went on to win the Group B match 4-1.
</P>

Van Dijk was always in front in the opening game and then
produced a marvellous defensive display to pull back from 16-14
down in the second.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Experiment on New Contraception for Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in a Swedish hospital
are experimenting on a new type of contraceptive injection for
men, the local newspaper Sweden Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
If the experiment proves to be successful, the injection will
become the major contraceptive measure for men in the future, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The experiment in the Swedish hospital of Karolinska was based
on the similar ones conducted in Sweden and other eight countries
since 1984, under the instruction of the World Health Organization
(WHO).
</P>
<P>
The effect of the injection was reportedly better than that of
the contraceptive pills for women, and each injection can be
effective for as long as three months.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one hundred men of the age between 25 to 40 took part in
the WHO experiment and none of them had made their wives pregnant.
</P>
<P>
The new experiment asked the participants to be injected once
every three months instead of the weekly injection required by the
WHO experiment.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that the man-made testosterone injected into
bodies of men is able to stop the creation of sperms and their
fecundity can be regained after they stop the injection for a
certain period of time.

<HEADLINE> Drug Testing, Conduct Code Adopted by USOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee
Saturday adopted unanimously an anti-doping program and a new code
of conduct for America's Olympic athletes in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
The two proposals were aimed at avoiding the embarrassments of
the past and telling the rest of the world the United States is
serious about eliminating performance-enhancing drugs from sports
with the Summer Olympic Games coming up in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The USOC's board of directors approved the two biggest items on
its two-day agenda in a matter of minutes, with no substantive
debate.
</P>
<P>
``I think it was awfully important to get them passed, before
Atlanta,'' said USOC president LeRoy T. Walker.
</P>
<P>
The drug program mandates no-notice, out-of-competition testing
for steroids and other performance boosters for all 41 Olympic and
Pan American Games sports in the United States. Officials say no
other nation has that broad and strict an anti-doping policy.
</P>
<P>
Although the measure will go on the books retroactive to
January 1, officials said the effective date would be much later,
with little if any no-notice testing conducted before the Atlanta
Games because of the complexities of tracking down athletes and
getting the rules passed out.
</P>
<P>
All members of the U.S. team in Atlanta must pass drug tests
before they are formally on the team, under long-established
rules. New rules for those pre-game exams were automatically put
off until after this summer to avoid having to re-test some 800
athletes.
</P>
<P>
The program will cost dlrs 2.8 million a year, about dlrs 1
million more than the USOC pays now for a broad array of drug
tests.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Makes Marked Progress in Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
has completed 1.7 million ha of the "Three North" forest shelter
project, after 18 years of work.
</P>
<P>
Northwest, north and northeast China, which cover a combined
area of more than four million sq km, have 1.49 million sq km, or
98 percent, of the country's desert and desertified land.
</P>
<P>
In 1978 China embarked on the "Three North" afforestation
project, which runs across 13 provinces and regions. It covers an
area of 380,000 sq km in Gansu.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the problems of sparse vegetation, drought,
wind-blown sand, and soil erosion, local people have put great
efforts into the project. They have planted more than 500 million
trees in an area of 280,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the environment quality of Gansu has improved a
great deal. The province has built a 1,200 km forest shelter
belts, and sand erosion in an area of 460,000 ha has been
controled. The surface wind speed in the forest shelter areas has
dropped by 12 percent.

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is expected to collect
more taxes this year from bicycles, still the most common form of
transport in the city, today's Business Weekly reported.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Gu expected 5.2 million cyclists to pay up, 100,000 more than

<P>
Bicycle tax in Beijing is collected every year in March and
April, and is currently 4.5 yuan (0.54 US dollar) per bicycle.
</P>
<P>
From last year, enterprises, institutions, schools and
neighbourhood communities are charged with collecting the levy and
submitting it to the municipal taxation bureau. Before that,
cyclists themselves bought tax registration in the streets.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Two squabbling sparrows are
keeping a round-the-clock guard on their superhome nests in a
Chinese town.
</P>
<P>
One has built a nest an amazing 17 meters long in the eaves of
an office building in Mingshui county in northeast China's
Heilongjiang province, according to the Yangtze Evening News.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe it is the longest bird's nest ever reported.
</P>
<P>
A month ago a group of sparrows were seeking a place for their
sun-exposed nest.
</P>
<P>
Two of the sparrows settled down in the eaves of the office
block, and one chose the western side of the third floor eaves,
while the other selected the eastern side.
</P>
<P>
The sparrow on the western side spent all its time building the
nest, developing eastward for 17 meters.
</P>
<P>
But the nest encroached on part of the territory seemingly
claimed by the sparrow building her nest on the eastern side. This
apparently aroused its great anger, causing constant quarrels that
never stopped until a group of other sparrows came, calming the
pair down.
</P>
<P>
Although feathers are still ruffled the determined sparrow at
the western side seemed to have stopped extending her nest.

the final time by a barrage of punches from the South African as
referee Paul Thomas stopped the fight at 1:55.
</P>
<P>
Weir lost his title to Matlala in November when the fight was
stopped after five rounds because of a head cut. The referee later
admitted he stopped the fight too soon.

result of local authorities' sustained efforts over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) period, the

<HEADLINE> Hainan Poised to Benefit From Hong Kong's Return: Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The resumed exercise of Chinese
sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 will be a sure push for the
economic development of south China's island province of Hainan, a
senior local official said.
</P>
<P>
Ruan Chongwu, Communist Party secretary of Hainan, which is
also China's largest special economic zone, said that after the
return Hong Kong will play a complimentary role between the
economies of the region and mainland of China, and Hainan will be
among the first to benefit because of its geographical privileges.
</P>
<P>
Ruan, also provincial governor, made the remarks at an ongoing
Sino-Japanese economic meeting, during which the attendants
displayed great concern about the impact on the Hainan economy of
the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Future developments in both Hong Kong and Hainan will directly
be affected by the market and economic development in the
interior, Ruan said, suggesting that Hainan and Hong Kong have
tremendous potential for economic co-operation and complementarity.
</P>
<P>
He said that rapid economic development in Hainan over the past
ten years has made such co-operation possible and viable.
</P>
<P>
Some attendants said that Hainan can provide Hong Kong with new
resources and markets and, meanwhile, share part of Hong Kong's
resources. Some Japanese experts even suggested that Hong Kong and
Hainan, in a way, be considered an integrated market.
</P>
<P>
Ruan said that the number of daily flights from Hainan to Hong
Kong, between two and seven now, will be increased.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 80 percent of Hainan's
enterprises with overseas investment are Hong Kong-funded. Hainan,
meanwhile, regularly provides Hong Kong with natural gas,
vegetables, fruits and other foodstuffs.

<HEADLINE> Black &AMP; White Photo Becoming Fad Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Black-and-white portraits, long
out of fashion, have again become popular in this capital city of
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Many photo studios in the city have replaced color portraits in
their windows with black-and-white ones to attract customers.
</P>
<P>
In one studio, which takes exclusively black-and-white photos,
a young woman says that she had had a black-and-white portrait
done, and plans to come again since the photos show her
features to special advantage compared with colored photos.
</P>
<P>
In another shop a couple of newly-weds are having their wedding
photos taken in black-and-white, in addition to colored ones.
</P>
<P>
With more techniques and skills involved, black-and-white
photos usually give a better image of the subject, said a local
photographer, which may explain the recent craze sweeping the city.
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic about colored photos for more than a decade, the
Chinese have gradually adopted a new aesthetic perspective, said
James Zeng Huang, a Beijing-based veteran photographer.
</P>
<P>
With a special touch that is subtler and reminiscent of old
times, he added, black-and-white photos have staged a comeback in
other big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai in the past three
years, and the fad is spreading.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of studios exclusively taking
black-and-white portraits in Shenyang has jumped to about 100,
compared with a handful only a few years ago.

<HEADLINE> UN Team Denies Media Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Mission to
Nigeria today refuted reports that it had described the human
rights situation in the West African country as terrible and its
political problems, terrifying.
</P>
<P>
The fact-finding team leader Justice Atsu Koffi Amega, a
Togolese, told reporters in LAGOS that those reports were out of
context.
</P>
<P>
The misquotation could have arisen from the literal
translation given to the use of the word "terrible" in French,
which, he said, meant serious.
</P>
<P>
"What I meant is that the human rights and democratization
process are serious matters, very important issues to the
international community," he explained, adding that the mission
had no mandate to qualify the Nigerian situation.
</P>
<P>
The team leader said that the mission had made it clear
"several times over" that it had no right to pass judgement on
the Nigerian situation, but could only gather information and
submit its substantive reports to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Today's media reports in Lagos disclosed that the UN fact-
finding team had described at its news briefing last night the
Nigerian human rights record as terrible.

pro-Iranian Hezbollah (Party of God) Hassan Nasrallah today called
for "a general mobilization of all Hezbollah members and the
followers" for a confrontation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here tonight, Nasrallah also asked those
be called "martyrdom fighters" to report for duty to their centers
"in preparation for fulfilling their obligations."
</P>
<P>
"Martyrdom fighter," is a name often regarded as tantamount to
"body bomber" or a person who carries out suicide attacks at
Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah announced
that they fired Katyusha rockets into northern Israel this
afternoon, and "directly hit the targets."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that the Katyusha rockets were fired at the Jewish
settlement of Nahariya in the Galilee area in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a bloodiest air raid on the third successive day of Israeli
aggressions in south Lebanon, Israeli helicopters opened fire at
an ambulance on the Hanniyeh road near the south port city of
Sour, Killing four children.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said six others were also wounded in the air
raid around 2:00 p.m. local time (11:00 GMT) at the ambulance
rolling on the Hanniyeh road.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Islamic Resistance announced earlier that its
guerrillas shot down an Israeli military helicopter with Sam7
anti-air missiles when the helicopter was carrying out an air raid
at the southern Lebanese village of As-Smaiyeh in Sour area.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Inalienable Part of Serbia, Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Interior Minister
Vukasin Jokanovic said today the province of Kosovo and Metohija
was an inalienable part of Serbia, where all citizens should
exercise their human rights.
</P>
<P>
An independent and neutral Kosovo, as advocated by ethnic
Albanian leaders, is merely a contrived formulation concealing the
old nationalist and secessionist aim -- the creation of a "Greater
Albania," he told radio Pristina. Pristina is the provincial
capital of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians dominate the local
population.
</P>
<P>
A strong separatist movement has for years been active among
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, calling for its secession and possible
annexation to neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
Serbia established authority throughout its territory,
including Kosovo and Metohija, by the constitutional amendments of
1989.
</P>
<P>
Jokanovic said that Yugoslavia would defend its territorial
integrity as any other state.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls For End To Racism, Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHANNESBURG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's main
challenge was to bury the monster of racism and division once and
for all, President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
He told an election campaign rally in Belhar in Western Cape
Province that the diversity of the country's culture should be
exploited to create divisions.
</P>
<P>
While aware of concerns that Afrikaans was being scaled down
in favour of English, Mandela gave the assurance that all the 11
official languages in South Africa would be completely respected
and protected by the government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
"Afrikaans makes an important cultural, scientific and
economic contribution to the country," said the president, adding
it would be an insult to Afrikaans and Afrikaans-speakers to try
and pretend that the language was not strong enough to survive.
</P>
<P>
Addressing mostly white voters at the Cape Town civic centre
early in the day, Mandela said whites could play a leading role
in reducing thinking along racial and ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
He also urged them not to leave the country because their skills
were needed for the development of the country.

<P>
BEIRUT, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi,

the towns of Gantara and Lahli in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warships were maintaining their blockade on the Beirut

to prevent weapons from being handed over to Hezbollah.

<P>
Sixteen people were wounded in another Israeli air raid at
Beirut's southern suburbs this afternoon, including an 11-year-old
boy, who died from the serious wound. The air raid is the third
of its kind in four days.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman announced that an intelligence
center of Hezbollah in Beirut's southern suburbs was hit by a
missile in today's air raid, but Hezbollah sources said that no
center of his party was hit today by Israeli air raid.
</P>
<P>
Security sources reported that Israeli warplanes, since
Thursday, have carried out more than 75 air raids on towns and
villages in south Lebanon, western bekaa, the eastern Bekaa Valley
and Beirut's southern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also launched an attack on a power station at
the Jumhour town on the eastern outskirts of Beirut this morning,
causing serious damages estimated at 3 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes extended their range of flights in Lebanon's
sky today, and police sources in north Lebanon reported that
several Israeli warplanes flew at a medium altitude over the north
sector of the country around 5:00 p.m. (14:00 GMT), drawing
anti-air fire from Lebanese and Syrian forces in the area.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri arrived tonight in
Paris to continue his diplomatic mission to rally international
