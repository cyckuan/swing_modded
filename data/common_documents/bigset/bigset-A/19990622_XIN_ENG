<HEADLINE> Albright Visits Romania with Dollar Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrived in here Tuesday for a three-hour visit.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Albright and Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu discussed bilateral ties, the Kosovo situation and
cooperation between Romania and NATO.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Albright thanked Constantinescu for Romania'
s strong support for the Kosovo operation, stressing that
Bucharest's attitude mattered to the US.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary also said that she was aware of the economic
problems caused by the Kosovo conflict. She assured the Romanian
president that the United States would help with the economic
recovery, and the Congress would approve more money in this regard.
</P>
<P>
This is Albright's second stop, after visiting Bulgaria, in a
series of visits to countries surrounding Yugoslavia that have
suffered economic losses during the 78-day allied airstrike
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Her visit to Romania was postponed two weeks ago due to the
prolonged Bonn talks that were aimed at solving the Kosovo crisis.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Medicines Covered by Canadian Health Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- British Columbia will become Canada
's first province to regulate Chinese medicine, according to a
report reaching here Tuesday from Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
The decision to regulate Chinese health therapies came on
Monday after a three-month consultation. The province's Premier
Glen Clark suggested they be covered by the local health-care plan.
</P>
<P>
The procedures to be regulated also include energy control
therapy and manipulative therapy offered by more than 700
practitioners in British Columbia, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Currently, patients must pay the full cost for such procedures,
the report said, adding that the coverage would likely add
millions of dollars to the costs of the provincial health-care
plan.
</P>
<P>
Clark suggested, however, the public would eventually support
the idea because traditional Chinese medicines can help fight
serious illnesses when used along with western forms of medicine.
</P>
<P>
"I think at the end of the day, the more emphasis we can put on
wellness and this kind of medicine, the more money we save in our
acute care sickness model," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Plant to Become World's No.1 Tennis Ball Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has been chosen to be the
production base for sport balls of the U.S.-based sporting goods
giant Wilson company, Thai Deputy Industry Minister Suriya
Chuengrungruengkit said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Suriya said that the Universal Sportware Co. of Taiwan, the
licensed producer of Wilson sport balls, has decided to implement
its new 400-million-baht (10.8 million U.S. dollar) production
capacity expansion plan at Sampran plant in the central province
of Nakhorn Prathom.
</P>
<P>
The Thai plant will produce 60 million tennis balls annually
for sale worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The move followed the plan to close Wilson's U.S. factory,
turning the company's Thai plant into the largest one in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The expansion project, which will start production later this
year, would use 4,000 tons of natural rubber products annually,
which is expected to shore up rubber prices and help improve the
economic conditions of local plantations, the deputy minister
said.
</P>
<P>
It will also create 600 jobs in the Nakhorn Prathom province,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Universal originally planned to use China as the expanded
production base for Wilson balls, but finally decided to choose
Thailand when taking availability and quality of raw material into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Wilson now controls 20 percent of the world's market for tennis
balls. The company will also relocate its U.S. football factory to
Thailand, which has local petrochemical production to provide the
necessary raw materials.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports Up, Trade Surplus Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports began to rise
in April while trade surplus dropped sharply in the first four
months of this year, said a Government House press release, which
was available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased 4.7 percent in terms of U.S. dollar to 4.54
billion dollars, which was considered "a positive sign of export
recovery", the press release quoted government economic ministers
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The increase includes agro-industry products and industrial
products which rose 16.3 percent and 8.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, agricultural goods, such as rice and frozen shrimp,
fell both in terms of volume and value.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of 1999, Thai exports totaled 17.6
billion dollars, or a 1.9 percent drop compared to the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to economic ministers, the fall of exports should be
attributed to the slowdown in demand from markets in the
Association of Southeast Asian countries, the United States and
European Union members.
</P>
<P>
Other factors leading to the export fall are high competition
from rivals like Chinese, Malaysian, Indonesian and Philippine
producers and exporters, especially those small and medium-sized
ones.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand's imports recorded a 5.1 percent to 15.1
billion dollars from January to April this year.

ATHENS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Dimitris Avramopoulos, mayor of the
Greek capital of Athens, announced Tuesday plans to establish a
network of shelters for abused and neglected children, the first
such project in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Avrampoulos said that the
Athens Municipal Child Care Center was expanding its role to other
areas of child care and protection with the establishment of the
shelter for battered and neglected children.
</P>
<P>
He urged the state and the European Commission to financially
support this program.
</P>
<P>
The shelter will provide temporary accommodation and support
for children and will operate in tandem with a counselling service
for families with social problems and families with children with
special needs.
</P>
<P>
Three months after the children are accommodated at shelters,
they will be reincorporated into the family or elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Thai WTO Chief Candidate to Attend APEC Meeting in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister
and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, who is running for
the top post of the World Trade Organization (WTO), will go to New
Zealand to attend an APEC meeting there, a Thai Foreign Ministry
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Supachai has no plans to meet his bitter rival for the
WTO director-general post, New Zealand's former prime minister
Mike Moore, said Kobsak Chutikul, director general of the Thai
foreign Ministry's Economic Department.
</P>
<P>
Supachai is to head a Thai delegation to attend a three-day
session involving ministers of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum to prepare for the September summit.
</P>
<P>
The battle for the WTO's new director general has lasted for
eight months.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the WTO's 134 members postponed once again efforts
to build a consensus around either Supachai or Moore, the last two
candidates remaining in the race, until July.
</P>
<P>
Kobsak warned earlier that ill feeling stirred up by the row
over the race could cast a shadow over the APEC summit in
September.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, New Zealand Ambassador to Thailand Adrian Macey said
his government had no intention of linking WTO affairs with APEC.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the New Zealand government will not invite
Moore, a member of the opposition, to the meeting.

<P>
BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has won bids to export
more than 15,000 tons of rice to Japan this year, Pracha
Charutrakulchai, director general of the Commerce Ministry's
Foreign Trade Department, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government had arranged two biddings for foreign
rice purchase this year as obliged by free trade accords of the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Thai suppliers won a share of 868 tons of rice from the total
25,000 tons arranged for the first bidding and won the whole lot
of 15,000 tons in the second bidding, Pracha said.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo has set an import quota of 646,300 tons of rice in this
fiscal year, which started in April, and had allowed for the first
time extra imports of rice beyond the set quota, with import
tariff of 351.17 yen (2.9 U.S. dollars) a kilogram, which would be
reduced to 341 yen (2.8 dollars) a kilo in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, with steady increase of rice exports to the Japanese
market over the past years, expected to ship at least 160,000 tons
of rice to Tokyo this year, Pracha said.

MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Asia's first climate change
information center (CCIC) was set up in the Philippines on
Tuesday, a news release of the Philippine Presidential Palace
said.
</P>
<P>
During the launching ceremony in the Presidential Palace,
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said the establishment of the
CCIC "can encourage awareness among our people regarding the
measures we can adopt to mitigate prospective adverse effects of
climate change."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Antonio
Cerilles said that the CCIC will disseminate information on global
warming, its impact on the Philippines, climate-friendly
technologies, and measures to mitigate and adapt to climate
change.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Cerilles said that the CCIC will have a
collection of books on climate change, atmospheric science and
pollution, as well as compact discs and various multi-media and
video tapes concerning climate change.
</P>
<P>
He added that the center will also conceptualize and conduct
seminars and workshops on climate change to ensure that needed
information are given out and discussed by concerned groups.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Observatory under the Ateneo de Manila University
will host and operate the CCIC, while the Foundation for the
Philippine Environment will help in information dissemination and
training, Cerilles said.
</P>
<P>
Global warming has been tagged as the primary cause of extreme
weather disorders like typhoons, the El Nino and La Nina phenomena
that have brought about damages to the whole world.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Forestry "Icon" Taken Over by U.S. Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Canadian forestry "icon" MacMillan
Bloedel is being taken over by U.S. giant Weyerhaeuser Co. in an
all-stock transaction of 3.6 billion Canadian dollars (about 2.45
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The proposed merger between the second largest company in the
Canadian province of British Columbia and its U.S. rival based in
Federal Way, Washington, would create the world's largest softwood
lumber producer, "The latest example of globalization sweeping
Canada," local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Annual sales of the new company were estimated at 19.5 billion
U.S. dollars with a stock-market value of 24.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Weyerhaeuser's friendly take over offer," which was announced
Monday, valued MacBlo's stock at a 35 percent premium over its pre-
takeover market price of 21.05 Canadian dollars (about 14.31 U.S.
dollars) a share, reports said, adding that MacBlo's directors
gave unanimous support to the deal.
</P>
<P>
Speculations about the new company, which will have one-third
of its operations in Canada, drove MacBlo stock at the Toronto
stock market Monday up by 5.15 Canadian dollars (about 3.5 U.S.
dollars) to close at 26.20 Canadian dollars (about 17.82 U.S.
dollars), a new 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
Weyerhaeuser stocks were reported down 2.63 U.S. dollars to 67.
13 dollars on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Canadian regulators and government officials need up to five
months for a sweeping review of Weyerhaeuser Co.'s planned multi-
billion dollar takeover of MacMillan Bloedel Ltd, before they
allow the blockbuster marriage to proceed.
</P>
<P>
Accounting for half of British Columbia's exports, MacMillan
Bloedel was formed by a merger of three companies in 1959. It was
first established 80 years ago by H.R. MacMillan, a native of
Newmarket, Ontario, and a cousin of novelist Mazo de la Roche.
</P>
<P>
The company employs 9,500 workers in British Columbia, down
from a peak of more than 25,000 during the 1970s.

PARIS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- French justice Tuesday said 31
people linked to cycling -- former professionals, amateur riders

The investigation is looking into allegations of widespread
doping in amateur cycling near Poitiers, in central France,
including claims that riders frequently took "Belgian pot" -- a
mixture of caffeine and amphetamines.

<P>
It is also probing allegations that dealers had offered another
mixture, dubbed "Polish pot", in which heroin and cocaine were to
be found.

The 31 were placed under investigation on various doping
charges and face sentences of up to 10 years in jail.

In a letter dated June 16 to the U.N. Security Council released
Tuesday, Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Woldensae said that
Eritrea is "not occupying any Ethiopian land."
</P>
<P>
A report from the Organization of United Africa (OAU) has
recently called on Eritrea to withdraw from all Ethiopian
territories seized in a year-old border war.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Foreign Minister said that "Ethiopia violated the
U.S. brokered moratorium on air strikes and targeted civilian
areas in Eritrea".
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Ethiopia had expelled Eritrea's
ambassador to the OAU, which is headquartered in the capital of
Ethiopia, and ransacked his residence.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopia-Eritrea war broke out in early May 1998 along the
1,000- kilometer borders of the two Horn of African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Although both countries have agreed to the peace framework put
forward by the OAU, they differed over the details of the peace
plan and its implementation.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Medicine Wins Wide Recognition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A thousand years ago, Tibetan
doctors developed a simple way to find out if a person had been
poisoned or not: Spit in a bowlful of water, and the pattern of
the saliva the next morning would reveal the truth.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Chinese experts, including Tibetans and people of
other ethnic groups, are engaged in extracting the more reliable
parts of traditional Tibetan medicine to find new and alternative
treatments for various diseases.
</P>
<P>
"The old Tibetan medicine and drugs are gaining greater
vitality because they are being scientifically tested," said
Jiacuo, a deputy director of the Tibetan Medical Institution the
Tibet Autonomous Region .
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, when the institute was established, over 500
students have graduated from it, including some postgraduates and
foreign students, according to the Jiacuo.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Tibet has five other Tibetan medical schools, and
nearly 100 students, from Tibet and other Tibetan areas in the
country, graduate from these schools every year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the autonomous region has more than 1,000 medical
workers who are practicing traditional Tibetan medicine, while
half of the 3,000 village doctors in Tibet are able to treat their
patients with Tibetan medicine and drugs.
</P>
<P>
So far, one regional Tibetan hospital and six prefecture-level
Tibetan hospitals have been set up in the autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Before, 1959, when the democratic reform began after a failed
rebellion against the Chinese government by the Dalai Lama and his
clique, there were no beds in the Tibetan Hospital in Lhasa, which
then had only a dozen doctors and a floor space of a mere 1,000 sq
m, recalls Gyaindoi, head of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
But now, the hospital boasts a floor space of more than 40,000
sq m, 220 beds and more than 400 doctors. Last year, the hospital
handled over 260,000 patients, he says.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local authorities are working on standardizing the
research and application of traditional Tibetan medicine,
according to Aden, deputy director of the Public Health Department
of the regional government.
</P>
<P>
To date, local experts have analyzed more than 1,000
traditional Tibetan medicinal herbs. There are now three major
Tibetan pharmaceuticals manufacturers in the autonomous region,
whose products are sold to over 30 Tibetan medical institutions
across the country.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Tibetan experts have published dozens of
academic works and textbooks on traditional Tibetan medicine.
Meanwhile, a group of young people have been assigned to study
under some 50 aged Tibetan doctors, Aden said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Although late April brought good rains to Somalia, Ethiopia and
Kenya, an extended dry spell with only scattered rains during May
and June is likely to cut crops and livestock production, further
weakening the region' s already precarious food situation.
</P>
<P>
In Somalia, 80 percent of the country's harvest is dependent on
rains which fall between April and June. This year, it rains for
only half the normal period.
</P>
<P>
In Ethiopia, the failure of the rains from February to May have
caused huge crop losses in areas which are already suffering from
food shortages.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, scarce rainfall and the plague of army worms will
have an adverse impact on the country's next harvest.
</P>
<P>
"We are acting now to prevent a potentially major humanitarian
crisis", said Judith Lewis, WFP country representative for
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
WFP has already approved a 40.5 million U.S. dollars emergency
 operation to feed nearly 1.2 million people desperately in need
of food in eight drought-stricken regions of Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Welcomes G7 Plan to Halt Financial Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Approached by reporters on the Group of Seven (G7) and Russia's
approval Monday of a plan to halt financial speculation, Mahathir
said that Malaysia is now glad that rich nations have finally
subscribed to her conviction that financial speculation is to
blame for the current global economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
He said they were now accepting Malaysia's proposal to
regulate financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The G7 approved the plan at their meeting in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, however, said that "between accepting and doing
something [about it], there is a wide gap."
</P>
<P>
He also commented on another G7 decision to provide debt
relief amounting to 70 billion U.S. dollars to help 36 countries
to move out from the grip of poverty.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that rich countries should have written off these
debts long ago but they waited until these poor countries were
almost "half dead" before they decided to do so.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Govt Supports Communications Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government will
continue to support the development of communications and Internet
infrastructure to facilitate more efficient and cost-effective
business transactions.
</P>
<P>
When closing the Microsoft Executive Summit '99 here Tuesday,
Energy, Communications and Multimedia Minister Datuk Leo Moggie
said the prospect to market goods and services to the fast-growing
number of Internet users in the country remains very bright.
</P>
<P>
The Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), the Kuala Lumpur
International Airport, smart schools, cyber laws, the
Communications and Multimedia Act and the setting up of the
Communications and Multimedia Commission are to facilitate and
advance the growth of this sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These steps taken by the government are in recognition of the
importance and impact of technology and multimedia on the economy
today. Various measures have also been put in place by the
government to encourage Malaysians to embrace the power of
technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said local higher institutions of learning will supply some
25,000 local graduates in computer science, engineering, arts and
design, information technology (IT) and multimedia fields to meet
the need of the present 216 MSC-status companies for 35,000
skilled workers by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Moggie said the government welcomes companies such as Microsoft
with their technology, knowledge and experience to share with
business people their vision of how a networked environment can
transform Malaysian companies into living organisms with a digital
nervous system.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia to Boost Economic, Trade Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- In the eyes of Zhong Fushou,
deputy secretary-general of east China's port city of Taizhou
Governemtn, Russia is a big market full of business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his point of view at a Sino-Russian seminar on
regional cooperation oriented toward the 21st century, which ended
here today.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day gathering, businessmen from central,
southern and coastal parts of China showed great interest in
expanding economic and trade cooperation with Russia, in addition
to those from the areas of China's border with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Taizhou, known as a center for the manufacture of daily
necessities, hopes to establish a solely- or jointly-invested
trade center in Elektrostal near Moscow, to help meet Russia's
demand for shoes, leather goods and garments.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it also hopes to introduce Russia's advanced
technology in the pharmaceuticals and chemicals sectors, and
import Russian timber and other raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian participants also expressed willingness
to further cooperate with their Chinese counterparts. Deputy Mayor
of Elektrostal Y.A. Tokmachev will travel to Taizhou tomorrow to
discuss ways to promote economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei and Guizhou provinces also
want to cooperate with Russia in industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Yantai, a port city in the coastal province of Shandong, has
begun to set up a Sino-Russian high-tech cooperation center, to
concentrate on electronic information, new materials,
pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor of Novosibirsk V.P. Nekhoroshkov, who attended
the seminar, said that Sino-Russian cooperation in high technology
will improve the two countries' trade structure, and boost
bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Manzhouli, the largest land trade port in China, together with
Russia's Chita Oblast, are planning to set up a border trade
complex, where individuals and enterprises will be encouraged to
engage in industry, trade, tourism and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Yang Hanzhong of Manzhouli told the seminar that the
establishment of such a trade complex will help make full use of
the resources, raw materials and preferential policies of the two
countries, to achieve the maximum economic results.
</P>
<P>
Participants said that localities in the two countries should
increase mutual understanding. The establishment of sister cities
will help promote exchanges of information, and guarantee the
smooth implementation of cooperative projects.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Stock Market Recovers From Two-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Composite Stock Index of the
Shanghai Stock Exchange finished today at a historic high of 1564.
44 points, a clear indication that China's stock market has
recovered from the bearish situation of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The new high, which has been widely expected by the market for
the last few days, is a natural development of the bullish rally
starting on May 19.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the indices of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
exchanges have soared by more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
On June 17, the turnover of the two exchanges hit a record high
of 52.18 billion yuan, up 1,300 percent from the figure for May 18.
</P>
<P>
The rally came amid a spate of good news from the part of the
government, including the approval for a major securities firm to
expand its capital base, reducing the stamp tax on B- share
trading from four to three percent and a major cut in the interest
rate.
</P>
<P>
While most investors were still hesitating, the ``People's
Daily" gave its blessing to the market surge in a front-page
special commentator's article on June 15.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that the recent rally is a reflection
of the macroeconomic situation and a result of the market
operation mechanism, adding that it is only the beginning of a
long-term development.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the editorial greatly boosted investors'
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Xu Tong, an analyst at Citic Securities Ltd, said the current
rally is reasonable and different from market bubbles or
overheating.
</P>
<P>
He gave two reasons: One is that most of the funds have been
flowing to high-tech stocks and blue chips, indicating that the
investors are cautious. The other is that the current rate of
change is only 10 percent, which is within the normal range.
</P>
<P>
He noted that an active stock market will be greatly helpful
for China's reform of its state-owned sector and the stimulation
of the domestic market, and hence boost the growth of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, said on Monday that the current rally marks a turning
point from which a regularized and vigorous stock market will
march into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts here predicted that the market will continue to
surge in the near future, and the market indices are sure to hit
new highs.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Monitoring of China's Most Dangerous Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China is applying the most
advanced high-tech systems in monitoring Mount Changbai, which has
the greatest potential for eruption of all the volcanoes in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that the high-tech systems include global
positioning system, remote sensing of satellites and global
information system.
</P>
<P>
They said the systems not only provide 24-hour monitoring of
the volcano, but are also expected to provide a basis for short-
term prediction of any possible eruption, in an effort to protect
the scenic spot and natural resources there.
</P>
<P>
Su Yang, a researcher at the Changchun Geological Institute
Attached to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said a complete
volcano monitoring network is expected to be built at Mount
Changbai within three years.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring system will be jointly built by the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Jilin Seismological Bureau and Jilin Mapping
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The latest research indicates that volcanoes worldwide will
soon enter a volcanic activity period. Some foreign experts
believe that the Changbai volcano is among only a few in the world
that have the potential for disastrous eruption.
</P>
<P>
Mount Changbai is located in the southeastern part of east
China's Jilin Province, and is also located in the central part of
east Asia.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that in the past 30 million years, over 3,000
billion tons of material have been brought out by the eruptions of
the Changbai volcano.
</P>
<P>
They said that, as the magma of the volcano is acid, the
harmful gas caused by the eruptions may give rise to acid rain and
forest fires.
</P>
<P>
As the crater is the source of the Songhua, Tumen and Nenjiang
rivers, an eruption will have particularly serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
China has 30 groups of volcanoes, mainly located in northeast
and northern China, the western part of southwest China's Yunnan
Province, near the Leizhou Straits, in the central part of Fujian
Province and in the northern part of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
However, no volcanic eruption has been recorded in China since
1951.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, China has established a basic volcano
monitoring network.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shuying, deputy governor of Jilin Province, who has carried
out scientific research for dozens of years, said that, as the
Changbai volcano is formed in the inner deep rift zone of the
Eurasian plate, monitoring and research concerning the volcano are
of great importance for global volcanic research.
</P>
<P>
She welcomed the U.N. and other foreign organizations and
volcano experts from other countries to participate in research
into the Changbai volcano.

<HEADLINE> Key for Cyprus Peace Process Lies on U.N.: Greek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek Ambassador to Cyprus
Kyriakos Rodousakis said Tuesday that the key for a resumption of
the peace process on Cyprus lies on the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides,
Rodousakis reiterated the Greek government's view that the G-8
(seven most industrialized nations plus Russia) statement on
Cyprus is a "positive step."
</P>
<P>
The G-8 statement, issued in Cologne, Germany on Sunday, urges
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to invite the leaders of the two
communities in Cyprus for talks this Autumn.
</P>
<P>
Rodousakis said that what is expected now is a move on the part
of the U.N. secretary-general and the next two resolutions of the
U.N. Security Council on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that previous U.N. resolutions on Cyprus,
especially the resolutions 1217 and 1218 adopted in December 1998,
will be reconfirmed.
</P>
<P>
The resolution 1217 called on all states and the parties
concerned to refrain from any action which might prejudice the
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The resolution 1218 requests the U.N. secretary-general to
"work intensively" with the two sides in Cyprus on a "staged
process aimed at limiting and then substantially reducing the
level of troops and armaments on Cyprus," as well as other
measures for the reduction of tensions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Thai Plant to Become World's No.1 Tennis Ball Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has been chosen to become
the production base for sport balls of the U.S.-based sporting
goods giant Wilson company, Thai Deputy Industry Minister Suriya
Chuengrungruengkit said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Suriya said that Universal Sportware Co. of Taiwan, the
licensed producer of Wilson sport balls, decided to choose
Thailand for its new 400 million baht (10.8 million U.S. dollars)
expanded production capacity at Sampran plant in the central
province of Nakhorn Prathom.
</P>
<P>
The Thai plant will produce 60 million tennis balls annually
for sale worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The move followed the plan to close Wilson's U.S. factory,
turning the company's Thai plant into the largest one in the world.
</P>
<P>
The expanded project, which will start production later this
year, would use 4,000 tons of natural rubber products annually,
which is expected to shore up rubber prices and help improve
economic conditions of local plantations, the deputy minister said.
</P>
<P>
It will also creat 600 jobs in the Nakhorn Prathom province, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Universal originally planned to use China as the expanded
production base for Wilson balls, but finally decided to choose
Thailand when taking availability and quality of raw material into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Wilson now controls 20 percent of the world's market for tennis
balls. The company will also relocate its U.S. football capacity
to Thailand, which has local petrochemicals production to provide
the necessary raw materials.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Indian Chief Election
Commissioner M. S. Gill said here Tuesday that the general
elections would be held on schedule in September this year and he
ruled out any possibility of postponement of the elections.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether there is any chance of delaying the polls
due to the fighting in Kargil of Kashmir with Pakistan, Gill said
at a press conference that the Election Commission was aware of
the complexities the country was facing but it had a
constitutional obligation to fulfill.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission has scheduled the general elections in
September this year. President K. R. Narayanan dissolved the 12th
lower house of Parliament on April 26 as no political party or
group could form a clear majority government after that led by
Atal Behari Vajpayee lost a confidence vote in the House.
According to the Indian constitution, the maximum gap between two
lower houses of Parliament could not be more than 180 days.
</P>
<P>
"The 12th Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament) has been
dissolved and we need to have the 13th Lok Sabha in place in good
time, that is by October 20," Gill said.
</P>
<P>
There is no provision in the constitution to postpone the
general elections throughout the country, another election
commissioner G. V. G. Krishnamurty said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Stock trading on the Shanghai
Stock Exchange (SSE) soared to a historic high today, amid an
ongoing bullish mood buoyed up by the authorities' encouraging
words in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The SSE Stock Index opened at 1551.8 points, once touched the
day's bottom of 1524.4 points, and closed at a new high of 1564.44
points, compared with the historic figure of 1558 points achieved
six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Today's trading volume was 23.87 billion yuan, slightly down
day-on-day.
</P>
<P>
Local observers attributed the bullish mood in the stock
business to official encouragement, including the May 19 editorial
in the ``People's Daily" and a recent speech by Zhou Zhengqing,
chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Zhou said the buoyant market indicates the
reality of the macro-economy in China and the internal
requirements by the market. He expressed his confidence that the
Chinese stock market has laid a foundation for long-term, stable
development.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's remark is an objective evaluation of the stock market
and an optimistic forecast of the future of the market, the
observers noted.
</P>
<P>
Some local stock dealers called it a result of the present
situation, as the Securities Law is to go into force by July and
the government has taken a series of measures that are favorable
to the stock business.
</P>
<P>
They agree that securities traders should make the most of the
current situation by abiding by the law, standardizing their
practice and perfecting their internal management.

HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The inward cargo Hong Kong port
handled in the first quarter of 1999 dropped by eight percent to
23.9 million tons, and its outward cargo handled fell by 17
percent to 12.9 million tons.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the total cargo Hong Kong port handled in the

living in the Tiger Garden of this capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province has given birth to triplets, following a
Caesarian operation.
</P>
<P>
Erhuan is one of ten rare Siberian tigers in the Shenyang
Tiger Garden. She had been 102 days pregnant when a team of
doctors from a local military hospital performed the operation
last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Dr Jing Shuhua explained that the team made the decision to
perform the operation because it feared that the cubs might
otherwise be stillborn, since the middle-aged Erhuan had already
suffered the same tragedy twice before.
</P>
<P>
The operation, believed to have been the first of its kind ever
performed on a tiger, was successful, even though two of three
cubs were not breathing when they were born. A doctor performed
artificial respiration to save their lives.
</P>
<P>
Erhuan is recovering well from the operation, according to
workers at the Tiger Garden, who also found a dog to be the wet
nurse for the cubs.
</P>
<P>
The Siberian tiger is one of the rarest species on earth, with
a population estimated at about 200 in China, and fewer than 20 of
them living in the wild.
</P>
<P>
Tiger specialist Zang Zhubin said the successful performance of
the Caesarean operation was a further step in the efforts to
protect and help the rare creature to reproduce.

<HEADLINE> Law To Curb Juvenile Delinquency Ready for Approval </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A law aimed at curbing juvenile
delinquency will hopefully be passed by China's legislative body,
the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (
NPC), after further discussions at a Standing Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The draft law is basically acceptable since many discussions
have been conducted and opinions solicited while an expert team
was organized to study the revision of the draft," Zhou Keyu, vice-
chairman of the NPC Law Committee, told the 10th Meeting of the
Ninth NPC Standing Committee which began here today.
</P>
<P>
"The law committee has advised that the responsibility for
preventing juvenile delinquency should rest on governments at all
levels, instead of simply "local governments" as stipulated in the
earlier version," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
"According to the revised draft, criminal activities by minors
may be investigated but the principle of 'education first,
punishment second' has to be considered," Zhou added.
</P>
<P>
"The law will also prohibit news reports, films, television
programs and publications from publishing the name, address,
photos or any damaging information about a juvenile who is
suspected of crimes before the case is finally judged," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here on Tuesday that the name of a street in Tehran
should not become an obstacle in relations between Iran and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said at a press conference on the sideline of a
seminar on Caspian Sea that Iran and Egypt are currently holding
negotiations and making plans to upgrade their relations.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to a call made by some Egyptian
officials to change the name of a main street in northern Tehran
named after Khaled Islambuli, an Islamic extremist who
assassinated former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat after Egypt
signed a peace accord with Israel in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Majlis (parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri said
recently that the Iranian government can consider the proposal to
change the name in order to pave the way for a rapprochement
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, hardline Iranian newspapers soon blasted Nouri for his
 remark and some hardliners posted a big picture of Islambuli on a
building in the street last week to show their opposition to any
change.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi criticized the press for making a fuss about the issue
and said Iran-Egypt relations have greatly changed, especially in
the past two years and the two countries have satisfactory
cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Iran severed its relations with Egypt after Egypt granted
asylum to Pahlavi, the former king of Iran, who was dethroned in
the 1979 Iranian Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been improved after
moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami adopted a detente
policy with other countries.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Recast with Correction in 8th paragraph Macao Garrison Law To Be Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The draft Garrison Law for the
Macao Special Administrative Region, which was submitted to the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee today, is
expected to be passed by the committee's current meeting.
</P>
<P>
Experts say it is an important law concerning social stability
in Macao after it returns to China in the coming December.
</P>
<P>
The duties of the Macao garrison, according to the draft law,
include defense of the region, safeguarding of the region's
security, administration of military facilities, and undertaking
relevant military affairs concerning foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The garrison should not interfere in Macao's local affairs, but
the government of the special administrative region may request
the central government for the garrison's assistance in
maintaining public order and disaster relief in the region when
necessary.
</P>
<P>
The law also stipulates that the Macao garrison should be
commanded by the Central Military Commission and its composition
and the size of the force decided by the needs of the region's
defense, that the rank and file follow the laws of the special
administrative region as well as national ones, and personnel be
changed in fixed rotation, and that the expenses of the garrison
be paid by the central government.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts here said that the Macao garrison sent by the
central government will be a significant symbol of China's
resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Macao and will meet
the needs of safeguarding national unification and security and
defending the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
China is to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the current 10th meeting of the NPC Standing
Committee, the NPC Law Committee said that the ninth meeting of
the NPC Standing Committee in last April made preliminary
deliberations on the draft garrison law, and committee members
concurred on its feasibility.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Law Committee has made amendments to the
draft law based on the suggestions of some Standing Committee
members, specialists and Macao officials and public figures.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Cut Down Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Angola is mapping out series of
measures to cut down its tariff to meet the changing economic
situations in the country, the Angola Daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Armando Mateus da Rose, director of the National Customs
Bureau, was quoted by the daily paper as saying that the tariff
cut is being carried out in accordance with actual hike of tariff
after the marginal devaluation of kwanza, the local currency,
which has been subjected to floating exchange rate system.
</P>
<P>
The actual rise of tariff after the kwanza devaluation, the
customs official said, has ended in two negative impacts: the
higher tariff has stock-piled imported goods after many importers
find it hard for them to pay the rocketed tariff; the raised
prices has brought difficulties to general citizens and more
rampant smuggling activities.
</P>
<P>
The measures to be taken on tariff cut, Rosa said, is to ensure
a healthy economic development and secure that people's living
standard is not affected, but he did not specify how much will the
tariff be lowered.
</P>
<P>
The kwanza was devaluated by almost two thirds after the
government announced a floating exchange rate system on May 21.
</P>
<P>
Angola is a resource-rich country, with crude oil and diamond
as its main export products, and heavily-dependent on import for
daily necessities.

<HEADLINE> China to Revise Accountancy Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China is going to revise and firm
up its existing Accountancy Law and will severely punish those who
infringe it.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng today outlined the draft of
the revised Accountancy Law and the draft of a list of related
punishments to the tenth meeting of the Ninth National People's
Congress Standing Committee which opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that the existing law, which was approved by the
Ninth Meeting of the Sixth National People's Congress Standing
Committee in January of 1985, has played a positive role in
regulating and improving accountancy work in China, and has
contributed to the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
However, with the deepening of reforms and the development of
the socialist market economy, the law needs to be updated in order
to meet the demands of macroeconomic control by the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
The revised law will improve the basic systems and regulations
affecting business and expense accounting, strengthen the control
and inspection of accountancy practices and punish those who
violate the law.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said relevant organizations and some experts in criminal
law have worked out the list of punishments after careful studies
and research.

volcano, Mayon, erupted Tuesday afternoon and rained ash on
surrounding areas, but no immediate casualties have been reported.
</P>
<P>
An expert of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and
Seismology (Phivolcs) told Xinhua that the volcano erupted at
16:58 (08:58 GMT) and lasted about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Because the eruption is mild, and only lasted 10 minutes, no
casualties are expected," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a high column of ash and smoke were seen on
Mayon's crater, but the volcano already calmed down an hour after
its eruption.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Phivolcs has noted since May 13 the
activity of the volcano, which was characterized by intermittent
crater glow at the summit area and a slight increase in sulfur
dioxide emission.
</P>
<P>
He said that residents living near the volcano were reminded to
keep off the six-kilometer permanent danger zone, which means no
one should be within six kilometers of the volcano in any
direction.
</P>
<P>
Following the eruption, Mayon, which is about 330 kilometers
southeast of Manila, sent lava flowing down its southern flank and
rained ash on the surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Mayon, the most active volcano in the world, has erupted at
least 40 times since 1616. The volcano's last eruption on February
2, 1993, killed 78 people and affected 17,119 persons.

call made by the G-8 countries' summit on Sunday for the
resumption of talks over the Cyprus issue with no preconditions in
autumn.

According to a statement faxed to Xinhua in Ankara on Tuesday,
the Turkish Cypriots said "outside interventions on the Cyprus

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Tuesday called for a fundamental change in the country's
administrative and managerial system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Construction Jihad
Ministry, Khatami stressed that efficient decision making demands
a fundamental change in the administrative and managerial system
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Any change in the management system calls for people's
knowledge and strong will of different powers, the Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian president gave no specific reasons for
the fundamental change in the country's administrative system.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that bureaucracy, inefficiency and
complicated administrative procedures have seriously retarded the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also praised the services of the Construction Jihad
Ministry, particularly its services in creating job opportunities
in the agricultural sector, livestock breeding, pasture
preservation, rural and small industries.

Caspian Sea should be utilized collectively for the development of
the littoral states.
</P>
<P>
"Any unilateral utilization of the Caspian resource...is not

on other littoral states.

pipeline on the Caspian seabed, given the fact that the region is
prone to earthquakes.
</P>

forces to intervene in the region.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Tehran's claim that Iran is the best route for

TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM: Street Name not Hurdle to Tehran-Cairo Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here on Tuesday that the name of a street in Tehran
should not become an obstacle in relations between Iran and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said at a press conference on the sideline of a
seminar on Caspian Sea that Iran and Egypt are currently holding
negotiations and making plans to upgrade their relations.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to a call made by some Egyptian
officials to change the name of a main street in northern Tehran
named after Khaled Islambuli, an Islamic extremist who
assassinated former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat after Egypt
signed a peace accord with Israel in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Majlis (parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri said
recently that the Iranian government can consider the proposal to
change the name in order to pave the way for a rapprochement
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, hardline Iranian newspapers soon blasted Nouri for his
 remark and some hardliners posted a big picture of Islambuli on a
building in the street last week to show their opposition to any
change.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi criticized the press for making a fuss about the issue
and said Iran-Egypt relations have greatly changed, especially in
the past two years and the two countries have satisfactory
cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Iran severed its relations with Egypt after Egypt granted
asylum to Pahlavi, the former king of Iran, who was dethroned in
the 1979 Iranian Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been improved after
moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami adopted a detente
policy with other countries.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Military Port to International Shipping (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to open one of
its leading military ports, Huludao, in northeastern China's
Liaoning Province, to international commercial shipping later this
year, government sources announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Located on the Bohai Rim, Huludao ranks as an important port
for the Chinese naval forces, and one of the few bases for
developing and manufacturing advanced vessels in the nation.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the Huludao port at this time indicates that
China will always take economic development as the first priority,
and ports with military facilities can be partly put into civil
use to spur regional economies," said Chen Zhengcai, a navigation
official with the Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's cabinet, has given the green light
for the opening of the port, and preparations are being made and
are expected to be finished later this year for final opening
approval from the General Administration of Customs, according to
navigation officials in Huludao.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time for China to open a military port
for civil use and international shipping. Since the 1980s, China
has put into commercial use Dalian, Qingdao, Lianyungang,
Zhanjiang and Ningbo ports. All these ports are now leading parts
of the civil shipping system in China.
</P>
<P>
"Huludao port cannot match the other ports in cargo-handling
capacity, but its opening is an indication that China will never
stop the opening-up drive," Zhang said.

<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian army announced on Tuesday
that its forces seized 2,030 kilograms of opium Monday night in
arm clashes with drug smugglers in the southeastern border
province of Sistan-Baluchestan.
</P>
<P>
The army's 88th armored division also seized 13 camels, one
Klashinkov rifle and two rocket propeller grenade shells, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The division last week also confiscated five tons of different
types of narcotic drugs in the province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said over 10 tons of various narcotics have
been confiscated from smugglers in the province since the
beginning of the current Iranian calendar year, which started on
March 21.
</P>
<P>
Iran launched an anti-drug campaign in 1989 after the Majlis
(parliament) passed a law allowing capital punishment against drug
criminals. Over 195 tons of various narcotics were seized during
the past Iranian calendar year.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian army was deployed in the border provinces of
Sistan-Baluchestan and Khorasan last September following tensions
between Iran and the Afghan ruling Taliban.

<P>
According to the official, only domestic oceangoing freighters
will be allowed to enter Huludao port. And, as in former cases,
docks for commercial use in the port will be separated from the
naval docks and facilities.
</P>
<P>
Huludao port was first approved for opening to domestic
commercial shipping lines in 1984, and has since mainly handled
crude oil, oil products, grain and commodities for daily use
destined for the western part of Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the opening of the Huludao port for
international shipping use could greatly boost the economy of the
western part of Liaoning, and it may also facilitate the
transportation of commodities, grain in particular, from the three
northeastern provinces and east part of Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
"If the Huludao port could be merged with the nearby Jinzhou
Port, whose current handling capacity stands at between six and
seven million tons, their advantages in shipping would be greatly
enhanced and the economy around the Bohai Rim would receive a
strong boost," said Ren Hong, a port planning official with the
State Development and Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Huludao has been a military port since 1908, when it was
constructed by the Qing Dynasty authorities, and later expanded in
1929 by General Zhang Xueliang. After the Japanese incursions into
northeast China in 1931, it was used by the Japanese army as a
transportation base.
</P>
<P>
The ice-free port now has an annual commercial handling
capacity of one million tons. The city government is moving to
expand it, with investment totaling 280 million yuan earmarked for
the first phase. One dock, with a handling capacity of 10,000 tons,
has already been completed, while two others -- of 20,000 dwt and
30,000 dwt capacity, respectively, are now under construction.

<HEADLINE> IRA Bomber Freed From Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The IRA man who bombed to kill
former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1984 was freed
Tuesday from the Maze Prison in Belfast after barely serving one
third of his recommended sentence.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Magee was given eight life sentences for the 1984
bombing of a hotel in Brighton, England, in an attempt to kill
Margaret Thatcher and her entire Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Five people were killed and 34 injured in the blast but
Thatcher escaped injury.
</P>
<P>
The trial judge recommended Magee serve a minimum of 35 years
in jail. But under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, Magee
became eligible for early release after serving only about a third
of his sentence.
</P>
<P>
Magee is the 277th prisoner to be given early release under the
Good Friday Agreement, a landmark deal signed by Northern Ireland'
s feuding political groups in April 1998 aimed at ending 30 years
of violence.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Conservatives were outraged at Magee's early release,
saying it was a "particularly bad example". They urged the British
government to stop all early paramilitary prisoner releases until
terrorist arms decommissioning begins.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate Urged to Clear Cabinet Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has said the
delays by the Senate in clearing cabinet list could cripple the
new civilian government.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Doyin Okupe said Monday the delays were
sending wrong signals within and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the Senators to show some urgency "so that
government does not become unduly crippled."
</P>
<P>
However, Okupe expressed optimism that the Senate would keep to
the constitutional time-lag for screening.
</P>
<P>
The observation came four days to the expiration of the 21-day
 constitutional provision for the Senate to clear the nominees.
Failing to do this, they would seem to have been cleared.
</P>
<P>
Okupe advised that rather than delay the exercise, the Upper
House of Nigerian legislature could drop any of the nominees it
considers unfit.
</P>
<P>
On a separate topic, Okupe said the present administration has
no intention to marginalize the North or any section of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to reports in the media that the (Olusegun)
Obasanjo-led government is pursuing an "anti-North agenda", he
said the insinuations were false, illogical and difficult to
understand.
</P>
<P>
"President Obasanjo is a nationalist and will always be a
nationalist," he said.
</P>
<P>
Such sentiments, he said, were only being expressed by some few
elite which he described as vocal minority, who felt unnecessarily
threatened and could only fall back on ethnic or religious excuses
to explain their failures.

HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China beat Russia 4-0 to enter
the quarter-finals of the World Women's Youth Softball
Championships in Taipei, China on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women recorded four wins and one defeat in Group B
to anchor a berth in the final eight, thus a 0-1 defeat to Japan
later became meaningless.
</P>
<P>
Japan topped Group B with an unbeaten record in six outings.
Australia and Russia, who were 4-2 and 3-3 respectively, also
advanced to the quarter-finals.

In Group A, the United States has guarenteed a place in the

<HEADLINE> China Improves Management of Fodder Manufacturing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen the
management on fodder and fodder additives to ensure the healthy
development of animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held here today, Qi Jingfa, vice-minister
of agriculture said that China's first related regulations came
into effect on May 29.
</P>
<P>
China is both a major fodder manufacturer and consumer with
last year's output value of the forage industry reaching 130
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
But Qi noted that some problems are hindering the healthy
development of the industry, such as the importing of below-
standard fodder.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation has outlined clearly the principle and scope
of the management methods required, said Qi.
</P>
<P>
Newly developed fodder and additives can only be made after
checks on its safety and effectiveness and no hormone medicines
are permitted to be added during manufacturing, according to the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also called for registration of overseas fodder
and fodder additives when they are imported for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Building Budget Gets Bigger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Spending on the Sydney 2000
Olympics rose by 40 million U.S. dollars on capital expenditure in
the latest New South Wales state budget, according to reports from
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
After a 265 million U.S. dollars rise in Olympic spending last
year, the New South Wales government intended to cut expenditure
to 123 million U.S. dollars in 1999/2000.
</P>
<P>
But the figure in Tuesday's budget was nearly a third higher at
163 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In year-on-year terms it still represents a fall of about half
in spending on capital expenditure from the 315 million U.S.
dollars in 1998/99.
</P>
<P>
Net cost to the NSW government of the Games has also risen by
28 million U.S. dollars to 1.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Michael Egan said 85 percent of the total venue and
infrastructure budget for the Olympics has been paid for, with 11
per cent to be spent this coming financial year.
</P>
<P>
The most recent economic assessment of the impact of the Games
estimates the Olympics will generate a total of 4.22 billion U.S.
dollars in additional economic activity and more than 90,000 new
jobs from 1994 to 2006.

SINGAPORE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Share Prices closed mixed on

The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) inched up 2.85 points
to close at 2,123.23, off from the intraday high of 2,139.69
points.
</P>
<P>
Total volume contracted to 1,630.57 million shares worth
1,545.65 million Singapore dollars (906.33 million U.S. dollars).
Decliners outpaced advancers by 224 to 130 with 89 counters
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The largest block was the 143.64 million shares parcel by
Hotung transacted at 0.595 U.S. dollars per share. It was followed
by Eagle which had 90.14 million units traded at a price of 0.49
U.S. dollars per unit. AFP was the next with 84.48 million
counters changing hands.
</P>

breather after the STI's sharp rise Monday.
</P>
<P>
They noted that some profit-taking in the afternoon evidently
dragged down the share prices.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, did not foresee a major pullback as the
economic recovery in Singapore and the region continued to weigh
on the market.
</P>

<P>
SEOUL, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government has
ordered Hyundai Group to halt the operation of its cruise ships
which transport South Korean tourists to the Mountain Kumgang area
in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Monday night, the South Korean government convened an emergency
standing committee meeting of the National Security Council to
discuss the alleged DPRK's detention of South Korean female
tourist Monday and its consequences to the inter-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Unification Ministry identified the detained
as housewife Min yong-mi, 36, from Seoul.
</P>
<P>
"North Korean immigration officials detained her for a probe
into alleged abuse against the North. She is reported to have said
that North Korean defectors live well in the South," a ministry
spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK Central News Agency (KCNA) said Min made "ill-intended
remarks" to induce DPRK people to defect to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"Those who included a professional agent among tourists in an
attempt to preach defection must be condemned by the nation and
pay dearly for that," said the KCNA.
</P>
<P>
South Korean presidential secretary said Seoul decided to send
a message of strong protest to Pyongyang, while calling for Min's
immediate release.

<HEADLINE> China to Regulate Individual-Funded Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature, the
National People's Congress (NPC), is deliberating a draft law
aimed at regulating solely individual-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The draft, designed also to protect investors and creditors,
was tabled for the second review at the 10th meeting of the NPC
Standing Committee, which convened here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xuwu, vice-chairman of the NPC Law Committee, said his
committee believed, after wide consultations in the past two
months, that it is necessary to have a law like this.
</P>
<P>
As the legislation intends to regulate enterprises solely
funded by individuals, the present title does not go well with the
contents. He suggested renaming it as "Individual's Solely-funded
Enterprise Law".
</P>
<P>
Referring to the widespread violations of workers' legitimate
rights and interests in solely-funded enterprises, Zhang said, "
Provisions aimed at protecting workers' rights and interests
should be included and the workers are entitled to set up trade
unions," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to the responsibility of the enterprises, Zhang suggested
the law stipulate that those enterprises solely funded by
household assets shoulder unlimited responsibility based on
household assets so as to protect the interests of creditors.
</P>
<P>
"The committee also believed that the law should not be applied
to foreign-funded enterprises as there is already legislation
dealing with this type of enterprises," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Consumer Prices Fall 4.0 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices of Hong Kong
registered a year-on-year rate of decrease of 4.0 percent in May,
after a 3.8 percent decline in April, according to the Census and
Statistics Department Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices are indicated by the Composite Consumer Price
Index (CPI). Similar movements were observed in the three sub-
indices, namely, the CPI(A), CPI(B) and Hang Seng CPI, that cover
respectively about 50 percent, 30 percent and 10 percent of
households.
</P>
<P>
In May 1999, the CPI(A), CPI(B) and Hang Seng CPI fell by 3.5
percent, 4.6 percent and 3.6 percent respectively over a year
earlier, somewhat larger than the corresponding decrease of 3.3
percent, 4.5 percent and 3.3 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by component, those consumer items registering year-on-
year rates of decrease in May 1999 included clothing and footwear,
durable goods, fuel and light, and housing.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, year-on-year rates of increase were recorded
for alcoholic drinks and tobacco, as well as transport.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that consumer prices
remained on an easing trend in May, along with the continuing
downward adjustment in costs and prices in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The further easing in price pressure was manifested in a wide
range of consumer goods and services, with the prevalence of price
discounts in the local retail market, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, import prices continued to be soft generally. On a
year-on-year comparison, the prices of clothing and footwear
showed the most significant decrease in May, followed by the
prices of consumer durables, charges for fuel and light, and
private housing rentals.
</P>
<P>
Compared with April, both the Composite CPI and CPI(A) showed
virtually no change in May. The CPI(B) fell by 0.2 percent, while
Hang Seng CPI rose by 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first five months of this year together, the
Composite CPI declined by 2.7 percent compared with the same
period in 1998. The corresponding decrease in the CPI(A), CPI(B)
and Hang Seng CPI were 2.3 percent, 3.3 percent and 2.1 percent.

BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislative body, the

CANBERRA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Soccer Australia have ruled out
England's Roy Hodgson to take over as coach of the national team,
a television report in Sydney said on Tuesday.

CHANGCHUN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China plans to launch a
nationwide restructuring of the maintenance of its 1.28 million
kilometer long highways including 8,700 kilometers of expressways.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhiqiang, director of the Road Department of the Ministry
of Communications, disclosed the government plan at today's Sino-
Britain Highway Maintenance and Management Symposium, which was
held in Changchun, the capital of northeastern Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The director said that the existing management of road
maintenance, mainly funded by the state, has been out of date and
should be replaced with a scientific and new system.
</P>
<P>
"The United Kingdom is advanced in maintenance management of
highways and some British experts have been invited to advise
their Chinese counterparts on the matter," Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
Jilin has been a pioneer in China regarding such reform,
according to local officials. Since 1996, the province has
introduced an experimental system to let specialist companies, now
numbering 25, help maintain the state-owned roads.

TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi underlined here on Tuesday that the resources of the
Caspian Sea should be utilized collectively for the development of
the littoral states.
</P>
<P>
"Any unilateral utilization of the Caspian resource...is not
acceptable for Iran," Kharrazi said at the opening session of the
7th International Congress on the Caucasus and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
The minister underlined that the Caspian Sea belongs to all
the littoral states and warned that any country doing otherwise
will be fully responsible for its actions which can incur damages
on other littoral states.
</P>
<P>
He also warned against any damage to the sea's environment and
reiterated that Iran is against the plan to lay oil and gas
pipeline on the Caspian seabed, given the fact that the region is
prone to earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi called on the littoral states not to allow foreign
forces to intervene in the region.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Tehran's claim that Iran is the best route for
transferring the Caspian oil and gas to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, experts from 25 countries will
exchange views on issues related to the Caspian Sea.

NANJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- One of China's oldest, once
biggest and most well loved commercial retail outlets is to be
reduced to rubble after sixty years in business to make way for a
modern plaza.
</P>
<P>
News of the demolition last month spread like wildfire amongst
Nanjing's population and people have flocked to the old store to
have nostalgic commemorative photographs taken or buy souvenirs.
At peak times the store was handling 400,000 customers and
visitors a day and was racking up daily sales volumes of over 10
million yuan (about 1.2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing Central Shopping Mall was built in 1936, financed
by a group of prominent figures in the then Kuomintang government
and business circles, and only sold commodities made in China in
its early days.
</P>
<P>
And it remained as the top selling store in Jiangsu Province
throughout the development of the People's Republic of China since
1949, with its annual sales volume in recent years exceeding one
billion yuan (about 120 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The planned new shopping mall will boast 40,000 square meters
of floor space, four times more than the original, and will be
completed next year.
</P>
<P>
A grand closing ceremony was held Sunday afternoon in front of
the old shopping mall which was attended by leading officials from
the Jiangsu and Nanjing governments and representatives of all
social circles in the province and city.

CANBERRA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Tasmania state is

<HEADLINE> China Finds No Dioxin Contaminated Forage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China has found no dioxin
contaminated forage so far, according to an official from the
Ministry of Agriculture today.
</P>
<P>
Jia Youling, director of the ministry's animal husbandry
department, pointed out that China did not import forage from
Belgium, Germany, Holland, and France, which have all reported
dioxin contamination since January.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that China has carefully checked its fodder imports
and manufacturing after a report highlighting the European scare
was published.
</P>
<P>
The dioxin panic started when some Belgian chickens and eggs
were found to be contaminated with dioxin and this later spread to
pork and milk.
</P>
<P>
Short-term exposure of humans to high levels of dioxins may
result in skin lesions, and altered liver functions, while long-
term exposure is linked to impairment of the immune system.
</P>
<P>
Jia also noted that the dioxin contaminations in Europe are
reported to be caused by the forage added with animal fat or oil
for industrial use. In China, only 25 percent of fodder comes from
fodder processing plants. The country does not have a tradition of
adding animal fat to fodder.
</P>
<P>
He noted China has paid great attention to the contamination of
forage and put into effect a regulation on the management of
fodder and fodder additives on May 29.

<HEADLINE> China Opens First Nationwide On-line University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China opened its first nationwide
on-line university today, marking the beginning of a new era for
its education system.
</P>
<P>
The Distant Learning School of Beijing University of Post and
Telecommunications (BUPT) is jointly sponsored by the university
and China Telecom.
</P>
<P>
The first year's intake of 1,000 students are from Beijing and
Tianjin cities and Guangdong, Liaoning and Fujian provinces. They
will attend real-time classroom lectures of the university through
the Internet and the ATM telecommunication network at 31 different
locations around the country. After earning adequate academic
credits through four years of study on line, they will gain an
official certificate or even a degree.
</P>
<P>
Apart from BUPT, Qinghua University, Hunan University and
Zhejiang University have also been given government approval to
run on-line education courses on a trial basis. However, Hunan and
Zhejiang universities are only open to on-line students in their
own provinces.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Information Industry Qu Weizhi said at the
today's ceremony that on-line distant learning will lead to a
revolution in the means of education in China. She said that it is
a major step forward in the drive to rejuvenate the nation through
scientific and technological advances and a vital way to improve
national competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Zuo Feng, director of the Data Communications Bureau of China
Telecom, noted that limited resources have restricted further
expansion of the higher education market in China. He said that on-
line education will make full use of the existing educational
facilities by breaking down the barriers of time and distance. It
will help stimulate demand in a huge potential market.
</P>
<P>
China now has some 696 million employed persons. If only a
quarter of them receive further education every year, the
potential market will be 174 million persons. As a result, Qu said
that on-line education has tremendous prospects.
</P>
<P>
A student from Liaoning Province in northeast China said at the
launch ceremony that the on-line university will allow greater
flexibility for him to balance study, work and family. He said
that on-line education is the best choice for him to complete
higher education.
</P>
<P>
Noting that on-line distant learning is still in a trial stage
at present, Zuo said that the new method of education has yet to
resolve such problems as inadequate utilization of network
resources and returns of investment.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom has invested near 50 million yuan in the first
phase of setting up the Distant Learning School at BUPT. A BUPT
official said that the university is still waiting for government
approval on the level of tuition fees of on-line education.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the first year of on-line students are
employees from post and telecommunications bureaus in various
localities. The university is yet to get government approval to
widen the base of students to people from all trades, he added.

<HEADLINE> Macao Garrison Law To Be Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The draft Garrison Law for the
Macao Special Administrative Region, which was submitted to the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee today, is
expected to be passed by the committee's current meeting.
</P>
<P>
Experts say it is an important law concerning social stability
in Macao after it returns to China in the coming December.
</P>
<P>
The duties of the Macao garrison, according to the draft law,
include defense of the region, safeguarding of the region's
security, administration of military facilities, and undertaking
relevant military affairs concerning foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The garrison should not interfere in Macao's local affairs, but
the government of the special administrative region may request
the central government for the garrison's assistance in
maintaining public order and disaster relief in the region when
necessary.
</P>
<P>
The law also stipulates that the Macao garrison should be
commanded by the Central Military Commission and its composition
and the size of the force decided by the needs of the region's
defense, that the rank and file follow the laws of the special
administrative region as well as national ones, and personnel be
changed in fixed rotation, and that the expenses of the garrison
be paid by the central government.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts here said that the Macao garrison sent by the
central government will be a significant symbol of China's
resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Macao and will meet
the needs of safeguarding national unification and security and
defending the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
China is to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the current 12th meeting of the NPC Standing
Committee, the NPC Law Committee said that the ninth meeting of
the NPC Standing Committee in last April made preliminary
deliberations on the draft garrison law, and committee members
concurred on its feasibility.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Law Committee has made amendments to the
draft law based on the suggestions of some Standing Committee
members, specialists and Macao officials and public figures.

<HEADLINE> China to Reduce Crude Oil Production Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China has plans to continue its
efforts to bring down the production cost of crude oil by five
percent this year, a senior official from the China National
Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) announced today.
</P>
<P>
"The reduction will be realized by shutting down debt-ridden
oil exploration wells and cutting off the output of crude oil
where costs exceeds international prices," said Ma Fucai, general
manager of CNPC.
</P>
<P>
The company's crude oil production costs dropped to 587 yuan
per ton last year, the lowest for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
CNPC has targeted an output reduction of 1.2 million tons of
crude oil this year from last year's amount of 107 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"The restructuring of the country's oil and petrochemical
sectors, completed in 1998, enabled CNPC to integrate exploration,
development and processing, domestic and international trade, and
production and marketing in order to effectively optimize
distribution," according to Ma.

<HEADLINE> Macao Students Take Entrance Exams for Study in Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 759 middle school
students in Macao Tuesday morning began their three-day entrance
exams for studying in institutions of higher learning in the
mainland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
Coming from more than 20 middle schools, the students are
striving for 56 specialties in 71 universities and colleges on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The number of examinees is the largest in recent years,
according to Ng Va Kai, vice director of the Macao Chinese
Education Association.
</P>
<P>
He noted that more and more Macao students are aiming at
entering institutions in north China and northeast China in
addition to those located in south China and east China.
</P>
<P>
With Macao's return to the motherland around the corner,
frequent tours to the mainland have enabled Macao students to know
more about the mainland, Ng Va Kai said, adding that those who
completed their studies in colleges or universities on the
mainland found work more easily in Macao.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ng attributed the increasing number of examinees
to the fact that colleges and universities on the mainland have
better teaching quality and lower expenses than similar studies in
Macao.

<HEADLINE> China to Draft 10th Five-Year Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China's 10th Five-Year Plan for
2001-2005, which is currently being drafted, will have major
differences with the former nine five-year plans and will be
implemented in line with shaping a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
"The contents, form and roles of the medium- and long-term
outline will have profound changes taking into account modern
demands, especially in the way the market has a basic role in
resources distribution," said Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of
the State Development Planning Commission, at a televised
conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
"The new plan must rely on market forces while also guiding and
regulating the market," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
Economic development and population growth are having an
negative impact on the shortage of resources facing China.
Therefore, the new plan should not simply focus on increasing
investments and launching new projects for rapid development as it
has been done before, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He urged relevant departments and localities to do their best
in giving helpful suggestions for drafting the plan.
</P>
<P>
He told planners that they should take into account both the
domestic and international situation when formulating the plan,
stressing that governments at all levels should not be involved in
commercial activities but leave those activities to enterprises
and marketers.
</P>
<P>
Zeng called for more attention to be paid to the central and
western areas, especially the latter, in a move to narrow the East-
West gap. Priority should be given to projects related to water
conservancy, electricity, communications, environmental protection
and the development of resources in the western part of the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"More democracy is needed in drafting the plan in an attempt to
reflect and protect the interests of major market players," he
said.

<HEADLINE> UNC, DPRK Meet for Tension Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from the United
Nations Command (UNC) and the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) met Tuesday at the truce village of Panmunjom to
discuss measures on tension reduction caused by the inter-Korean
conflict in the Yellow Sea last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The talks were frank, open and useful to both sides, "said a
UNC release issued after the two-hour talks.
</P>
<P>
"The primary objective of the meeting was to reduce tensions in
the Yellow Sea," said UNC spokesman Carl Kropf.
</P>
<P>
The UNC and the DPRK held talks on June 15, but the meeting
ended with no results and saw the two sides trade a verbal war on
who fired first during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the UNC proposed measures to reduce tensions
and to avoid escalation of conflict, said the release.
</P>
<P>
The measures include that the DPRK ships operate north of the
Northern Limit Line and the South Korean vessels south of the line
and the two sides improve communication channels in the vicinity
of the Northern Limit Line.
</P>
<P>
"The UNC also proposed to meet again in the general office
forum to continue dialogue on these recommended steps," said the
release.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting was the seventh of its kind between the two
sides aimed at reducing tension on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In the inter-Korean military conflict on June 15, a DPRK
torpedo boat was sunken and three others badly damaged while two
South Korean ships were slightly damaged.
</P>
<P>
In the conflict, 30 DPRK servicemen were reportedly killed
whereas nine South Koreans were injured.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Insurers Pass Y2K Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A recent test shows that major
insurance firms in China have basically solved the year 2,000
problem which could affect their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
The China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) said in a
press release today that all the 13 Chinese insurance firms
participating in the test conducted last Saturday and Sunday have
proved their readiness for the year 2,000 computer bug, also known
as Y2K or the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
During the test, the insurance firms halted all business
activities and adjusted their computer systems to several dates
when Y2K is likely to attack.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC said all the firms passed the test without system
breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
Two other major tests are scheduled to be carried out on July
17-18 and September 18-19.
</P>
<P>
None of the overseas insurance firms operating in China took
part in the test, as CIRC sources said they would tackle the Y2K
problem by themselves.

its 10th meeting this morning.
</P>
<P>
The three treaties include one with Viet Nam on judicial
assistance in civil and criminal cases, one with the Republic of
Korea on judicial assistance in criminal cases, and an extradition
treaty with the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
They were signed in Beijing in October, November and December

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investors Play Bigger Role in High-Tech Industry in Southern Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investors have become a
major part of this south China city's high-tech industrial
development, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
It now has 130 high-tech companies, 60 percent of which are
backed by overseas investors and overseas investment accounts for
55.7 percent of the city's total high-tech research, development,
and production funds. Overseas-backed enterprises contributed 70
percent of Shenzhen's high-tech product exports last year.
</P>
<P>
Many overseas investors have chosen Shenzhen to produce
computers and related software, telecommunications equipment,
audio-video goods, electro-mechanical products, new chemical
materials, and bioengineering products that involve a lot of
technology and capital and this has improved the city's industrial
structure, a local official says.
</P>
<P>
The city will continue to improve its investment environment
and find ways to introduce overseas investment into a wider range
of production.
</P>
<P>
In Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province, which is just
north of Shenzhen, non-government enterprises have been playing a
greater role in its high-tech industry. Guangzhou now has 225 high-
tech enterprises, 147 of which are non-government ones.
</P>
<P>
To increase its high-tech industrial development, the city will
set aside a billion yuan to apply high-tech developments and to
help high-tech companies repay bank loans or reinvest and to
provide financial guarantees through next year.

<HEADLINE> Manila Starts Process of Recovering More Marcos Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has begun
the process of recovering the 100 million U.S. dollar Swiss
accounts under the name of five Marcos cronies, a senior official
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora
confirmed reports that the Marcos cronies' accounts have been
identified, but he cautioned against raising high hopes for the
immediate recovery of the money stashed in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
"That means they've identified some accounts, but I wouldn't
wait for it tomorrow or the day after. This is going to take a
while," he said, recounting the tedious process that the
government had to go through to effect the transfer of the 590
million dollar escrow account from Swiss banks to the Philippine
National Bank (PNB).
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an unnamed source at the Presidential Commission on
Good Government (PCGG) was quoted as saying the Swiss authorities
identified last month several secret Swiss accounts under the name
of five close friends of the late president Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said that the recovery of the funds requires that the
government "go through a fairly extended count procedure to make
sure that these are really ill-gotten."
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the requirements, both of the Swiss authorities
and Philippine courts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, the government is happy to note that the
 recovery process has now begun, adding that "it is definitely
possible" for the government to gain control of the 100 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> NPC Reviews Public-Bidding Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature, which
convened here today, started its second review of the draft public-
bidding law aimed at curbing corruption in the building sector.
</P>
<P>
Gu Angran, vice-chairman of the Law Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), reported today on the draft to the 10th
meeting of the NPC Standing Committee on the draft legislature.
</P>
<P>
Since the draft's first review at the last session in April,
the committee has solicited opinions from a wide section of the
society. "We hold that it is very necessary to have a law like
this now," Gu said.
</P>
<P>
"As they will be the basic rules for bidding procedures, the
legislation should apply not only to the construction sector, but
also to bidding in other activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
All projects, whether they are wholly or partially financed by
the public, should be subjected to public biddings according to
the law, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"As to whether the projects could be partitioned or sub-
contracted, the committee believed that the non-essential parts
could be contracted out according to agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And both the bidders and sub-contractors shoulder the
responsibility for project quality," he noted.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth completion of projects and their quality,
the committee suggested that the law should adopt the universal
practice of a financial guarantee which is levied on the bidders
and contractors. "This means that if they can't fulfill their
agreements, the guarantees can be confiscated and any losses can
be accounted for," Gu said.
</P>
<P>
The committee also suggested that those bidders who fail to
fulfill agreements should not be allowed to bid in the future and
even have their commercial licenses revoked.

SHENYANG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The city of Anshan in
northeastern China has the country's biggest steel producer and
has decided to clean up its smoke-blackened sky.
</P>
<P>
The face-lift includes importing production lines from Italy
and technology from the United States to cut pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Anshan Steel Corporation was the first steel producer of
the People's Republic and is still the nation's pride because it
provided the steel for the country's automobiles, airplanes and
satellites.
</P>
<P>
But, since the 1980s, the plant, which employs 300,000 people,
has become one of the country's biggest sources of sulfur dioxide
and dust in the air.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yesong, deputy mayor of Anshan, has announced that the city

technology to deal with the problem and produce equipment for cars

<HEADLINE> Singapore Announces Liberalization of Internet Exchange Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Telecommunication Authority
of Singapore will open up the market of international Internet
exchange service in Singapore as another step towards achieving
its goal of becoming an Internet hub and information society.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Communications and Information Technology Yeo
Cheow Tong made the announcement in his address at the opening
ceremony Tuesday for the telecommunication exhibition CommunicAsia
99.
</P>
<P>
Yeo said the move to allow more providers of Internet exchange
service in Singapore will enhance Singapore's attractiveness as a
portal for high speed access to the Internet backbone.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the Asian Internet Access Service Providers
(IASPs) will also have more means to interconnect via Singapore
and this will encourage the development of an intra-Asian Internet
network," Yeo said.
</P>
<P>
Internet exchanges are physical interconnection sites for IASPs
to access the global Internet backbone and exchange traffic with
one another. Such exchanges will enable IASPs traffic to be
aggregated before being sent via leased circuits to the U.S.
Internet backbone and the regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeo also billed information and communications technology (ICT)
as the key driver and transformer in the net economy and
information society of the future and said that his ministry is in
the midst of formulating the ICT21 Master Plan to facilitate the
development of ICT in Singapore over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"Our vision is to transform Singapore into a dynamic and
vibrant global ICT capital with a thriving and prosperous net
economy by the year 2010," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
He said the ICT21 Master Plan will map out strategies to attain
three key objectives which include developing the ICT sector as
the key sector of growth in Singapore's Economy, using ICT as a
common platform to boost the performance of Singapore's
knowledge-based economy and leveraging on ICT to enhance the
quality of life and standard of living of Singaporeans in the
information society of the future.
</P>
<P>
Some 900 companies from 40 countries and regions participate in
the CommunicAsia 99 which will last to June 25.

<HEADLINE> S. African Officials Leave for Congo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- South African government
officials left for Zambia Tuesday morning for talks aimed at
resolving the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Foreign affairs director-general Jackie Selebi heads the South
African mission, which will be followed by a ministerial team
expected to depart for Lusaka Wednesday or early Thursday, the
South African Press Association reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial delegation will comprise of Deputy Foreign
Minister Aziz Pahad, Provincial Affairs and Local Government
Minister Sydney Mufamadi and Defense Minister Patrick Lekota.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Nkosazana Zuma said Sunday that she saw the
resolution of the conflict in Congo (K) as one of the top
priorities in her new portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said unless the conflict in Africa was resolved there was
no possibility of a renaissance on the continent.
</P>
<P>
She said although the latest initiative to bring about peace in
Congo (K)

was being led by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, South Africa
was giving the process its full support.
</P>
<P>
"We would like a cease-fire in the DRC and a standstill of
foreign troops, and (to see) the Congolese beginning a meaningful
dialog to resolve the problems there," she said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was involved in talks with all the countries
sucked in the Great Lakes conflict including the warring parties
in the DRC, Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of countries involved in the Congo (K) crisis met in
Pretoria last week after they attended Thabo Mbeki's inauguration
as South Africa's new president Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki told a media conference that the Lusaka meeting was
expected to put forward proposals for a ceasefire in the DRC
conflict between rebels wanting to topple President Laurent
Kabila's government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, preliminary talks to prepare for a regional peace
summit on the DRC failed to get under way Monday because some of
the delegates had not yet arrived, a Zambian official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Some officials have not yet arrived for the meeting and we are
all waiting for them...it's possible that the meeting might take
place on Tuesday," Agence France Presse quoted the official, who
declined to be named, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Sunday that the DRC peace talks would begin at the
 officials' level on Monday, followed by a ministerial meeting
possibly on Wednesday through to Friday.
</P>
<P>
Depending on the outcome of the two meetings, a summit of heads
of state involved in the Congolese conflict would be called on
Saturday to sign a cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Tutsi rebels -- disaffected soldiers and opposition politicians
-- backed by Rwanda and Uganda, launched an insurgency in the
eastern Congo 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Kabila sought military support from other African nations such
as Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The rebels now control roughly the eastern part of the vast
central African country.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Benefit From Service Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A foreign investment service
center in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin has helped
increase of city's foreign funds in its 12 years of existence.
</P>
<P>
There were only 226 foreign-funded enterprises, worth less than
30 million U.S. dollars, before 1978, but today the number has
risen to more than 12,000, worth 24 billion U.S. dollars, 208 of
them multinationals, making Tianjin the city with the most foreign
investment in northern China.
</P>
<P>
The increase has resulted from the efforts of the service
center, officials say. It mainly provides registration services
and consultation, providing convenience for foreign business
people.
</P>
<P>
Albert Yeung, general manager of Smith Kline &AMP; French, says
that the service center has solved investment procedure problems,
and Ji Zhongqiang, deputy general manager of Korea's LG, calls it
the "home of foreign-funded enterprises". It has helped Japan's
Mitsumi Electric smoothly increase its capital from 10 million U.S.
dollars to 70 million, according to the general manager, Tadshi
Tamura.
</P>
<P>
However, Pi Qiansheng, the center's director, says that they
still have a lot to do in improving service to keep management
costs down and the city has rescinded over 500 different fees for
foreign-funded enterprises this year.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue made the
remarks here today at a regular press conference while denying
the allegation that China is aimed at assimilating Tibetans in
this resettlement project.
</P>
<P>
 Certain western media and a few Tibetan splitist groups
recently asked the World Bank to reject or delay the approval of
granting loans to the project.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the project is part of the poverty-relief program
implemented by Qinghai Province to uproot poverty in the land-
locked province.
</P>
<P>
"The mission of the project is to remove a portion of the poor
population from their current living areas, where natural
conditions are so harsh that development cannot be realized, to
Dulan County of Haixi Prefecture in western Qinghai, where natural
conditions are relatively better," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Local residents from all ethnic groups, including Tibetans,
thus can shake off poverty and local socio-economic development
can also be improved," she said, adding that the Chinese
government has placed high importance on improving the living
standards of all ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
A three-year feasibility study has been carried out on the
project, which is supported by local people, she said.
</P>
<P>
Many countries participating in the financing of the project
agreed that the project conforms to the standard of WB loans, she
added.

<HEADLINE> China to Punish Futures-Related Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature, the
National People's Congress (NPC), is mulling over a draft
resolution designed to regulate the futures market and severely
punish futures related crimes.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jingyu, director of the Legislative Affairs Office of the
State Council, delivered the draft to the 10th meeting of the NPC
Standing Committee, which convened here today.
</P>
<P>
"Though the country's Criminal Law contains provisions
concerning securities, it does not deal directly with crimes
related to futures," Yang said in his explanation to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
China's futures market, which was piloted in 1990, experienced
rapid expansion in the following years. "Despite the tightening up
of regulations and clearing up of anomalies, there still exist
problems," Yang added.
</P>
<P>
They include the unauthorized establishment of futures
exchanges, insider trading, the concocting of false information to
disrupt the markets, price manipulation and unauthorized trading
on overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
"These and other negative activities have damaged the interests
of investors and severely disrupted the financial and economic
order," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
"The futures' market can't operate healthily unless these
crimes are punished," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The State Council intends to ask the NPC Standing Committee to
expand the scope of a number of items of the Criminal Law and make
futures-related crimes punishable under the law, Yang said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique in Need of 325,000 Tons of Food in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique is estimated to be in
need of about 325,000 tons of food in the 1999/2000 financial year
(starting from July to next June).
</P>
<P>
This was revealed here Monday by Jose Egidio Paulo, director of
the National Commerce Bureau, the Noticias newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
So far, rice production in Mozambique is only 116,000 tons, as
against its yearly consumption of 250,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the country needs to import 60,000 tons of
maize, 175,000 tons of wheat and 150,000 tons of rice in the
coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, he added, the production of cassava, sorghum and
millet are sufficient for domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
The government will resort to border trade to solve the
problem, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Revise Marine Environment Protection Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature has
decided to revise the country's Marine Environment Protection Law,
the first time in 16 years, in a bid to improve the protection of
marine resources and maintain a ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by Zhang Haoruo, vice-chairman of the
Committee of Environment and Resources Protection of the National
People's Congress, in his explanation to the tenth meeting of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee on the draft of the
revised law.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that marine environmental disasters such as red tide
and the pollution of seawater aquatics have increased because of
the large amounts of urban sewage discharges and the discharge of
industrial and agricultural waste water into the sea. The current
regulations are unable to prevent the worsening situation in this
regard, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the revised law has thus added such amendments as
marine environment supervision and management, marine ecological
protection, the prevention of land pollutants to marine
environment and the prevention of coastal and marine construction
projects to marine environment, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The present law, which was promulgated at the beginning of the
reform and opening-up in the early 1980s, focuses on controlling
oceanic pollution and cannot be adapted to meet the needs of the
country's sustainable development strategy.
</P>
<P>
"It also has loopholes concerning the overall monitoring and
management of the marine environment, thus needing amendment,"
Zhang stressed.

<HEADLINE> Yangjin, First Female Lawyer in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Among 53 professional lawyers in
10 lawyer's offices in Tibet, Yangjin is well known not just
because she is a woman, but also for her cooperative lawyer's
office launched in 1993, the first of its kind in the Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
So far, Yangjin has handled some 800 legal cases, and served as
lawyer for over 100 enterprises. She helped recoup some 70 million
yuan for them.
</P>
<P>
She worked as the defending lawyer for 310 criminal cases and
had the suspects in 41 of the cases released free.
</P>
<P>
For years, the fully-occupied Yangjin has never known weekends
as she has to be present on the court four or even five times a
week.
</P>
<P>
"I am busy because the Tibetans have gained legal knowledge,"
said Yangjin, adding, "They realize the importance of living on
law. This is why there are so many enterprises and companies that
employ their own attorneys."
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the Tibetans felt insulted to go to court. They
prefer to have a senior villager to help solve any disputes. Our
business means the progress of the society," she said.
</P>
<P>
Whenever entrusted with an economic case, Yangjin plunged into
work right away. Once, a construction company boss used up his
money for an economic case. He borrowed 2,000 yuan from Yangjin
and promised to pay her back soon. But he never did so.
</P>
<P>
"When I worked for others, I do my best to win for them," said
Yangjin. "So far as I am concerned, I don't know how to get back
my money."
</P>
<P>
Outside the court. Yangjin is somewhat shy. She speaks slowly
and in a tender voice. Given her success, Yangjin, 35 this year,
is one of Top 10 Lawyers in China and one of Top 10 Youths in
China.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Yangjin, then 21, graduated form the Southwest
Political and Legal Institute and was assigned to work in the
Legal Commission of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Government.
</P>
<P>
It was an office of six lawyers and Yangjin turned out to be
the only female among them.
</P>
<P>
Four years later, Yangjin opened her own economic attorney
office, which was the first of its kind in Tibet. In 1993, she
launched Tibet's first cooperative lawyer's office.

<P>
LHASA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The four-room flat has beautiful
Tibetan-style furniture, electric appliances, a small area for
studying the sutras, and a Buddhist niche in the wall with
offering bowls and a butter lamp.
</P>
<P>
It's a lot smaller than where they lived when she was a young
girl, says Galsang Zhoima, a cousin of the Dalai Lama, "but it is
very warm, comfortable, and cozy." The 51-year old woman, whose
mother and the Dalai Lama's mother are sisters, now lives in the
Chengguan District of Lhasa, Tibet' capital.
</P>
<P>
Zhoima and her brother, were brought to Lhasa by the Dalai Lama,
after he visited them in 1955 in Huangzhong County in Qinghai
Province where he was born. He then fled to India in 1959 after a
failed rebellion against the central government.
</P>
<P>
Zhoima's father, died in 1990 after living in India for ten
years. Her elder brother is an engineer with an institute in Lhasa
and her younger brother is a section director with the Public
Health Department. Both have been to India to visit relatives.
</P>
<P>
Zhoima used to work at a sewing cooperative. In 1984, she was
elected a member of the district People's Political Consultative
Conference and later became a deputy of the National People's
Congress. She often visits urban and rural units and ordinary
families and submits proposals to the regional People's Political
Consultative Conference or People's Congress. She has traveled to
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and many other major cities
and says, "Over the past four decades, Tibet has experienced
tremendous changes with the help of the central government and
other provinces, even though it still lags behind many areas."
</P>
<P>
In 1969, Zhoima married Zhezhu Wangdui who is 10 years older
and used to be a lama. The couple have a daughter who is a tour
guide and a son who is a lama. Zhoima says she is satisfied with
her life.

<P>
NANJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Jiangdongmen Memorial Hall in
Jiangsu Province, which was built to commemorate the victims of
the Nanjing Massacre, has 2 copper coins that reveal Japan's
intent to occupy China 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The coins were given by an overseas Chinese in the United
States. They weigh 100 grams each and are 4.5 centimeters in
diameter. On the obverse side of one coin is a picture of a
Japanese officer with a sabre at his waist and a pair of
binoculars in his hands and 3 Japanese soldiers in a shooting
stance.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Health Ministry has
dispatched its food inspectors to collect a number of imported
foodstuffs from the European Union from supermarket shelves for
tests as a food and soft drinks poisoning scare hit some Nairobi
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Bureau of Standards (KBS) Monday declared a ban on
all chicken, eggs, pork and meat products from the EU ahead of a
final government decision, the state-run Kenya Times newspapers
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
KBS import inspection officials were put on alert to ensure
that foodstuffs and drinks containing the cancer-causing dioxin
are not allowed into Kenya from the EU member states exporting
such products manufactured in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
However, a source from the Health Ministry said the ministry
could not recommend any action by the government before tests on
the foodstuffs and soft drinks under scrutiny are finalized and
results determined.
</P>
<P>
Spot checks at a number of supermarkets in Nairobi revealed
that most of the snacks, chocolates and biscuits are imported from
Belgium, Switzerland, France, Italy and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Following the dioxin scare, the KBS has subsequently instructed
its officials to reject all coca-cola products from Belgium,
France, Luxemburg and the Netherlands.
</P>

The KBS quality assurance officials are also carrying out local
market surveillance for all imported chicken, eggs, pork, meat
and coca-cola products.

<HEADLINE> Urban Population Explosion Causes Problems: Moi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Urban planning in developing
countries has been hampered by the explosive urban population
growth coupled with shortage of resources for adequate services,
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has admitted.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Times newspaper Tuesday quoted Moi as saying that in
many developing nations, a large proportion of urban dwellers
remained deprived of basic services such as proper housing, clean
water supply, sanitation and access to health care.
</P>
<P>
Urban areas no longer guarantee a better standard of living as
many of those seeking refuge from the worsening conditions of
poverty in the rural areas find themselves caught up in equally
dehumanizing conditions of poverty in the cities, said Moi Monday
at the opening of U.S.-Africa Sister Cities Conference in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The president also urged the conference to work and come up
with workable solutions to some of the urbanization problems
facing developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In the Kenyan capital Nairobi, about 50 percent of people live
in only five percent of residential areas without adequate
housing, water supply and health care.

<HEADLINE> China Increasing High Quality Stone Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- After 2 decades of growth, China
plans to slow stone products output down while increasing their
quality.
</P>
<P>
Better quality stone products will account for 90 percent of
output in the next 15 years and annual growth of stone production
will be held to 10 percent, according to Zhang Wenbo, of the China
Stone Products Association. Zhang is on an investigation tour of
the region.
</P>
<P>
China has become the world's second largest stone producer
since the 1980s, but high grade products account for only 35
percent of the output. It produces 130 million square meters of
stone annually, most of it from Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong, and
Sichuan provinces and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has over 100 stone quarries with estimated reserves of
several billion cubic meters. Its products have low radioactivity
and chromatism, and are lustrous, rigid, and resist wear.
</P>
<P>
The region has opened up 70 quarries that produce 60,000 cubic
meters of stone products in 47 varieties annually.
</P>
<P>
China exports 30 percent of its output to Japan, the Republic
of Korea, the Unites States, and Germany, and earns 780 million U.
S. dollars from it annually. It also spends 240 million U.S.
dollars on imports from Italy and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 foreign companies and 2,700 collective and private
companies make up the bulk of stone producers. They have an annual
output value of 57 billion yuan on average.
</P>
<P>
Governments have adopted measures to encourage foreign firms to
invest in stone production. On average, producers can begin
showing a profit in a year and a half and processors can recover
their investment in 3 years.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Frowns on Human Skin Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye has said the government will mercilessly fight
the illegal trade of human skin.
</P>
<P>
Describing such a trade as "barbaric" and "shameful," Sumaye
called on the public to expose the culprits involved and do away
with superstitious beliefs, The Guardian reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Mbeya Region in southwest Tanzania said two
suspects have been seized in connection with the murder and
skinning of a 13-year-old boy for trade. In recent months, many
people have been found dead there with skin missing.
</P>
<P>
Some people superstitiously believe that human skin can protect
a house from evil spirits and agents of witch-craft, other people
believe that when associated with special rituals, human skins
increase harvests and even lure more customers to their clubs and
shops, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a parliament session in the central city of Dodoma
Monday, the prime minister called for immediate action against the
murderers, who are "a threat to the country's peace and
tranquility."
</P>
<P>
The paper said the government will seek assistance from Zambia
and Malawi, which borders Mbeya, to investigate the matter.

<HEADLINE> China in Bid to Clean up 5th largest Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China is gearing up an ambitious
program to clean up its fifth largest freshwater lake, Chaohu, in
east Anhui province, vice governor Zhang Ping has said.
</P>
<P>
All the 109 industrial firms in the lake areas must comply with
state pollution discharge standards by the end of this year. Those
that fail to do so will be shut down.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of China's efforts to tighten pollution
control over its major lakes and rivers, including Dianchi Lake in
Yunnan province and Haihe River in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
So far progress has been made to clean up the 13,000-km Chaohu,
since the Anhui provincial government launched the program last
October, with 27 enterprises having complied with the state-set
standards.
</P>
<P>
Chaohu and its surrounding areas are threatened by a yearly
discharge of 280 million tons of wastewater. It is also filling up
with more than two million tons of silt and mud annually that come
from the dwindling wetlands and banks around the lake.

<HEADLINE> Senior Citizens of Tianjin Still Work Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Over 90 percent of some 3,900
people above the age of 60 in the Chinese city of Tianjin still do
some kind of labor for the family, a recent survey has shown.
</P>
<P>
Of these aged between 60 to 80, 9.1 percent in the urban area
work at paid labor, 92.4 percent do some household chores, while
in rural areas 22.2 percent are still doing farmwork and 43.5
percent, household chores.
</P>
<P>
The reason that so few of these people have other jobs is bad
health, old age, or fear of being laughed at. Some think that
their pensions are sufficient, but some say they cannot find a
suitable job.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of those surveyed in rural areas say they
spend about three hours taking care of grand-children, buying
groceries, and cooking.
</P>
<P>
Professor Hao Maishou, who studies gerontology, says that
Chinese seniors have a tradition of proving themselves useful to
the family and society. He says that China is now becoming an
aging society with 120 million elderly, and this group of people
needs care from the society and more research is needed on the
subject.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai People's New Ideas About Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Recent statistics show that more
people in Shanghai are spending their money on housing, medical
care, recreation, and education.
</P>
<P>
A survey on Shanghai consumer spending patterns showed an
average per capita spending on housing of 660 yuan (79 U.S.
dollars) and on medical care of 260 yuan last year, up 22 percent
and 32 percent respectively over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Average per capita spending on recreation and education went up
from 784 yuan in 1997 to 843 yuan last year, and on newspapers and
magazines it was 50 yuan and on cultural and recreational
activities, 72 yuan, up 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
With improvements in the standard of living and changing
consumer concepts, a car and computer and the Internet have become
the symbol of a modern and fashionable life for more Shanghai
citizens.
</P>
<P>
A survey by Beijing's Horizon Survey Company of 800 Shanghai
people above the age of 18 showed that a third of them put housing
first on their list of priorities for the next 2 years, while 15
percent putting buying a computer as their first priority and 13
percent, education.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that new high-tech durable goods, high quality
kitchenware, interior decoration, and tourism will become new
consumer items in Shanghai, and spending on education will
continue to go up proportionally.

Tietmeyer told the press in Hannover, capital of Niedersachsen

growth would begin to slow down then. (Germany-Bank-Euro)

<P>
SHENZHEN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Fengyuan Biochemical Co. Ltd.
of east China's Anhui Province raised 375.6 million yuan from the
initial public offering (IPO) of shares on the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the company said it sold 60 million A shares at a
price of 6.5 yuan per share yesterday. The move was designed to
raise funds to expand the company's citric acid production and
export capacity.
</P>
<P>
The east China company has a 25 percent share of the domestic
citric acid market and ten percent of the international market. It
is the largest maker of citric acid and other related products in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The corporate sources said that a half of the raised funds
would be used to introduce new technology for producing citric
acid directly from fermented corn flour. The company is now able
to produce 50,000 tons of citric acid annually and is hoping to
boost that to 100,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Citric acid is an organic acid that can be used for many things
including the making of food-stuffs, beverages, pharmaceuticals
and detergents.
</P>
<P>
By late next year, the company will increase its citric acid
exports to 90,000 tons. By then, it will also have a 17 percent
share of the international market, said the sources.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Pilots On 24-Hour Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- About 70 percent of the pilots of
the national carrier Cyprus Airways (CY) pilots started a 24-hour
strike as of midnight Monday, with 11 flights to be grounded and
over 3,000 travelers to be affected.
</P>
<P>
The pilots' union PASIPY said the strike was triggered by the
management's failure to enforce a deal on freezing vacancies in
the airline's charter arm Eurocyprian until an agreement is
reached among all sides concerned on how to fill the posts.
</P>
<P>
Eurocypian pilots, CY management and PASIPY signed an agreement
in 1994 on promotions, which clearly states that promotions in the
charter firm should go to its pilots. But the parties concerned
agreed to hold a dialog on the issue in an accord reached last year.
</P>
<P>
But CY claimed the dialog collapsed on June 1 this year and
advertised two captain posts in CY and three in Eurocypria for
what it said urgent need to fill the vacancies.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, PASIPY announced it would go on strike against
the decision.
</P>
<P>
Eurocypria pilots were also threatening industrial action due
to the management's failure to fulfill the agreement and PASIPY
insisted the dialog be completed before the vacancies were
filled.
</P>
<P>
CY press spokesman Tasos Angeli said the strike will cost
thousands of pounds, and above all, it will have a bad effect on

<HEADLINE> New Analysis: Asia Needs New Engine for Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- When Asia's exports have run out of
steam, what could be the main source of the region's next phase of
growth?
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe that Asia should find other growth
engines when the region's exports are unlikely to grow at a fast
pace again in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
For over a decade, Asia's economic growth had to a large extent
relied on exports, which were described as one of the main
"engines" of the region's growth.
</P>
<P>
But now, when Asia's exports have become very weak, the region
may have to look for a new engine for a steady growth.
</P>
<P>
It is quite true that Asia's export-led growth strategy once
proved successful. "A number of successful economies have pursued
a development strategy of export-led growth, using policy to shift
their industrial structures toward exports and to exploit
economies of scale," said a recent Asian Development Bank report.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of such a strategy, Asia's export grew
at an annual rate of 20 to 30 percent in the 1980-1995 period. Due
to the high growth of exports, Asia became the fastest growing
region in the world in the past decade, and its economic miracle
won the admiration of other regions.
</P>
<P>
However, Asia's heavy reliance on exports had already shown
defects even before the regional financial crisis broke out in
mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, when the world electronics market experienced a
cyclical slowdown, Asia's export machine nearly broke down. As
electronics accounted for a large share of its exports, Asia's
export growth declined to 4.3 percent in that year from 20 percent
in 1994 and 22 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Asia's economic growth slowed down from 8.2
percent in 1995 to 7.5 percent in 1996 and 6.1 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Asia's export growth has not recovered. Despite
large depreciation of Asian currencies in the financial crisis --
83 percent in Indonesia, 57 percent in South Korea, 55 percent in
Malaysia and 46 percent in Thailand -- Asian export growth
continued to be slow.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the regional economy grew only 4 percent as a result
of weak exports and the impact of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Although exports in Asian countries like China, Singapore and
Thailand showed signs of recovery in May, gone are the days when
exports in the region could play its role as the main growth
source.
</P>
<P>
"That party is well and truly over," said Jim Walker, chief
economist at CLSA Global Emerging Markets, citing lower price and
profits worldwide and shrinking product cycles as a result of
fast-moving technology.
</P>
<P>
Some experts estimate that if Asian firms maintain their share
of the world market, the region's exports are expected to increase
by 5 to 10 percent in good years, and much less in bad years.
</P>
<P>
What could replace exports as the new engine of Asia's growth?
Many economists believe that Asia's vast domestic markets could
play the role if Asian economies could make a policy shift by
looking homeward.
</P>
<P>
"Asia needs a new source of growth. Luckily, such a source
exists and it's right here at home. There is a rich seam of
productivity gains waiting to be mined in Asia's domestic
economies," said the Far Eastern Economic Review in its recent
issue.
</P>
<P>
Since the third quarter of 1998, Asian countries have taken a
series of measures to stimulate the domestic demand. Governments
in the region have started infrastructure construction, increased
imports, lowered interest rates and urged higher consumption.
</P>
<P>
Such measures have already worked quite well. In the first
quarter of this year, South Korea's economy grew by 4.6 percent
from a severe recession last year, while Singapore and the
Philippines increased 1.2 percent. Production in Thailand and
Indonesia is also showing signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
The rebound in Asia is based on domestic economic improvements
rather than demand from overseas, said Stanley Fischer, first
deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund in a
recent speech.
</P>
<P>
The signs of growth are coming from within, because "the export
markets for this region have been very weak," he said.
</P>
<P>
The improvements should encourage Asian economies to make a
policy shift by not overlooking the importance of domestic
markets, the new engine for the next phase of Asia's economic
growth, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Over 59,000 Detained in Combing Drive in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh's law-enforcing
agencies have arrested a total of 59,220 persons and recovered
more than 1,150 fire arms during their two months' country-wide
combing operation against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Malik Khasru, assistant inspector general of the Bangladeshi
police, disclosed this on Monday afternoon, the New Nation
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the arrested persons, 527 were listed terrorists, who
were directly involved in killing, raping, dacoity, mugging,
hijacking and extortion in different parts of the country,
especially in the southwestern region, according to Khasru.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the operation, peace has been restored to a
certain extent in the southwestern region, and people there have
gained their courage and confidence.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that to tackle the law and order situation in
the southwestern region, a continuous operation would be needed
with deployment of more force by setting up permanent camps in the
trouble-prone areas.
</P>
<P>
"A special drive is needed to deal with the long-standing
problems of terrorism, especially in the country's southwestern
regions," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
During the combing operation, the government has set up over
150 police camps at sensitive places, and members of the
paramilitary Bangladesh Rifles and Answers (village and border
militia) are actively participating in the operation which has
gained the support of the people, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The government launched the combing drive on April 21 following
bomb explosions early this year in two separate places in the
southwestern region that killed several political leaders and
activists and injured many others. The region has then reportedly
become a haven for terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Snap Spurs' 12-Game Winning Streak with Game 3 Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks snapped the
NBA's longest single-season playoff winning streak as Allan
Houston tied a playoff career-high 34 points in an 89-81 triumph
over the San Antonio Spurs in Game Three of the Finals here
tonight.
</P>
<P>
The Spurs had won 12 straight games, including all six on the
road, before suffering their first loss since May 11 at home
against the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second game of their
Western Conference first-round series.
</P>
<P>
Houston made all 12 of his free throws and was 10-of-24 from
the field for the Knicks, who assured themselves the maximum three
home games for the lowest-seeded team in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
Game Four is on Wednesday and Game Five is Friday -- both at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
David Robinson led the Spurs with 25 points and Tim Duncan
added 20. Latrell Sprewell scored 24 points and Larry Johnson had
16 for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
After suffocating defense paced the Spurs to wins in each of
the first two games of the series, New York made adjustments
tonight and opened with 32 points in the first quarter to build an
11-point lead.
</P>
<P>
Despite totaling a combined 33 points in the next two quarters,
New York never relinquished the lead as the crowd, which included
NBA scoring champion Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers and
numerous celebrities, remained a factor throughout.
</P>
<P>
The good news for the Knicks was that they were able to win
without playing their best. They shot only 39.7 percent (31-of-78)
from the field but were even on the boards. The difference was
turnovers -- the Spurs commited 20, twice as many as New York.
</P>
<P>
San Antonio shot 44.6 percent (29-of-65) from the floor, as
Robinson and Duncan, San Antonio's "Twin Towers", combined to make
14-of-28. But the rest of the team was just 15-of-37 (40.5 percent)
and totaled only 36 points.
</P>
<P>
Duncan and Robinson paired up for 22 rebounds while Kurt Thomas
led the Knicks with 10. Marcus Camby, who started at center,
scored just five points before fouling out for New York.
</P>
<P>
Things look better now than they did for New York before Game
Three. Only two teams have won a championship after losing the
first two games, and no team has swept the middle three home games
since the 2-3-2 format was installed in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks has a chance to gain all the momentum on Wednesday
and thrust the pressure heavily on the favored Spurs, who entered
the NBA from the defunct ABA in 1976. San Anotonio never won an
ABA title and was stopped one round short of the NBA Finals four
times.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks, who last appeared in the NBA Finals in 1994, are
seeking their first title in 26 years. They became the first No. 8
seed to advance to the NBA Finals by beating the top-seeded Miami
Heat, Atlanta Hawks and the Pacers in the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Improper Zoo Facilities For Animals In Eastern Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Animals at the city zoo in the
capital of China's Fujian Province are suffering from the same
problem as local people -- poor housing conditions and limited
living space.
</P>
<P>
When compared with the areas of zoos in other major Chinese
cities, the zoo at Fuzhou can only be called tiny, with its 4
hectares of land. It's only about one tenth of ordinary zoo areas
in other cities of the country.
</P>
<P>
And, even though the zoo has not been enlarged in recent years,
the number of animals kept growing, increasing to 130 types that
even include big animals like the elephant, orangutan, and tiger.
</P>
<P>
To provide them with more comfortable living conditions during
the hot summer, zoo keepers have to put some different animal
species together in the same house, like zebras and ponies, or
macaques and gibbons. And, to keep them from fighting over
territory while living in the same room, the keepers have to use
barriers to separate them into groups.
</P>
<P>
The severe housing problem for animals in the zoo has aroused
the attention of relevant departments. But whether the issue can
be properly settled in short time remains in doubt.

<HEADLINE> Old Chinese Castle Opens To Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- An old castle in southwest China's
Guizhou Province that is believed to have been built during the
Middle Ages has had thousands of visitors this year.
</P>
<P>
Hailongtun Castle is on a 1.5-sq.km. mountainous part of
northern Guizhou and is surrounded by steep cliffs on three sides,
about 10 miles from the city of Zunyi.
</P>
<P>
The castle is believed to have been built during the late Tang
Dynasty (618-907) and served as an important fortress for a local
clan named Yang for 725 years.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou plans to spend 50 million yuan developing the castle
for a scenic spot. The first phase of construction has already
cost 6.8 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Sun Gang, deputy director of the State Tourism Administration,
was surprised during a visit to Guizhou and the castle last summer
to see that it is the most intact castle from that period in China.
</P>
<P>
Historical records report that the castle went into a period of
decline after the clan rebelled against the central government and
was attacked by military forces in retaliation about 400 years ago.
However, the walls, blockhouses, strategic passages, and dungeon
are almost completely intact. There are also palaces and buildings
for concubines that were built during the Song (960-1279) and Yuan
(1271-1368) dynasties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commerce Secretary Warns of Risks With Steel Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley warned Monday that U.S. industries which rely heavily on
exports to other countries might suffer if the domestic steel
industry obtains quotas on foreign steel.
</P>
<P>
Daley issued the warning on the eve of a key vote in the Senate
on a quota measure. The House overwhelmingly passed the bill in
March, 289-141, despite the threat of a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
"It is not just the steel industry that stands to suffer. Other
industries that depend greatly on exports and could pay a steep
price include pharmaceuticals, high-tech, and above all,
agriculture," the Commerce Secretary said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. steelworkers are pushing for quotas as a way to combat low-
priced foreign shipments that the industry blames for bankruptcies
at three U.S. companies and for thousands of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Last year, foreign shipments reached record highs because of
the Asian economic turmoil, which reduced demand for steel abroad
and forced foreign producers turning to U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's news conference, Daley said steel quotas would
violate international trade agreements and make it difficult for
the U.S. government to persuade other countries to open their
markets to U.S. products.
</P>
<P>
The quota bill would impose monthly quotas on steel shipments
equal to the average levels in the three years before July 1997.
The measure also would set up an import notification system to
better track shipments into the country.

BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Residents in the Thai capital city
have become increasingly health-conscious and a majority of them
are interested in alternative medicine and new ideas to ensure
they live well, according to a survey by a leading advertising
firm, which is available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Listening Post, who conducted the survey early
this year, said that 82 percent of 203 people aged 19-40 said they
were concerned about their health.
</P>
<P>
Health issues were getting increased attention from local
marketers and advertisers, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Some 55 percent of respondents claimed to be interested in
learning or practicing new things beneficial to health.
</P>
<P>
Most of those who did put thought into action were aged 25-29,
with a bachelor's degree or higher education and from middle- and
upper-income households.
</P>
<P>
The changes in behavior were influenced by books, television
and radio, friends and doctors, with respondents citing a mix of
these factors, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of the total surveyed claimed to have
heard of Thai traditional medicine and meditation techniques, with
as many as 20 percent understanding what was involved.

<HEADLINE> ADB Urges Nepal to Reduce Growing Dependence on Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank has
urged the Nepalese government to address the issue of growing
dependence on foreign aid but committed itself to continued strong
support for the country.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Director of the bank's Programs Department (Region
West) Geert van der Linden told the press that he briefed the
government on the increasing scarcity of the bank's concessional
loan funds and the need to utilize the aid more effectively and
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
He said the new majority government of Nepal understands well
that it should demonstrate its ability to use the assistance more
effectively.
</P>
<P>
Both the prime minister and finance minister made strong
assurances in this regard and agreed that frequent change of
project officials is very detrimental to the projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with senior government officials, Linden urged
the government to improve the revenue mobilization efforts through
effective implementation of the value-added tax and other
necessary tax reform measures to address the important issue of
growing dependence on foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
But he also assured the government of the bank's continued high
commitment to the development of Nepal, a press release issued by
the bank's Nepal Resident Mission said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the new majority government would
use its majority to address the many development challenges facing
Nepal so as to take the country back on the path of sustainable
growth and address poverty issues.
</P>
<P>
On the Melamchi water supply project which aims to improve
water supply in the Kathmandu Valley, the ADB official expressed
satisfaction that agreement had been reached between the Nepalese
government and the donor community on the implementation and
financing arrangements for the project.
</P>
<P>
He said it will take five to six years to complete the project
at a cost of 300 million U.S. dollars.

KATHMANDU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)

<HEADLINE> Fei Xiaotong, Harbinger Of China's Rural Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- He foresaw the development of
township businesses as a venue for China's rural reforms 50 years
ahead of time and soon drew up the next stage of the reforms,
which now seems feasible.
</P>
<P>
Fei Xiaotong, the Chinese anthropologist, is respected
worldwide for his lifetime of study and for his contribution to
China's rural economy. At the age of 89, he still devotes a third
of each year conducting investigation and research across the
country and seeing with his own eyes the changes reflecting his
second "prediction" about rural changes.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago he proposed that small market towns become a
powerful force in bridging the gap between town and country to
substantially improve the living standard of Chinese farmers and
stimulate the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
And, as it turned out, things are going just as he expected. By
the end of last year, there were 50,000 small towns across China
that had assimilated 100 million farmers and these township
communities have developed many primary planning functions modeled
after cities.
</P>
<P>
Fei's research was based on several decades of outdoor studies
and, in spite of a limp left from an accident in a mountainous
area, he was still able to cover all of China's provinces and
regions, with the exception of Tibet and Taiwan. He has been
honored as "the scholar who walked the longest journey in China,"
as he travels more than 30,000 km every year, almost as long as a
round-the-earth trip.
</P>
<P>
"A doctor's warning kept me from going to the highlands of
Tibet," he explains, and, "As for Taiwan, I will go there for
research as soon as it reunites with the motherland," Fei said in
his exclusively interview with Xinhua when he did investigation in
Changsha city.
</P>
<P>
He fell into a tiger pit while doing research with his wife
Wang Tonghui in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 1935 and
hit a large boulder. His wife fell into a stream and drowned while
going to call for help.
</P>
<P>
Fei always says self-deprecatingly that he can no longer do any
skillful work, and can only do investigations and write articles.
</P>
<P>
Fei got his doctor degree at the London School of Economics
after studying with the prominent anthropologist Malinowski in
1938. His thesis on villages in China's Jiangsu Province, which is
his home, has been called the first anthropological research paper
in China.
</P>
<P>
He is esteemed by foreign colleagues as a voice for Chinese
farmers because of his incessant attempt to seek ways to help the
rural economy.

<HEADLINE> Thais Working Overseas Help Boost Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The money sent back home by Thais
working overseas will help the country recover from the economic
crisis, a report by Bank of Thailand's northeastern branch in Khon
Kaen province said.
</P>
<P>
The report, which is available Tuesday, said that 191,735
Thais, most of them from the Northeast, were working overseas last
year, an increase of 4.6 percent over the previous year. They
remitted 21.1 billion baht (570 million U.S. dollars) worth of
foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, monthly salaries offered by foreign
employers averaged between 15,000 and 18,000 baht (405-486
dollars) compared with around 39,000 baht (1,054 dollars) offered
by local employers for jobs of the same nature.
</P>
<P>
But fees charged by job-recruitment agencies ranged from
150,000 to 180,000 baht (4,050 to 4,860 dollars), which
discouraged Thai workers from seeking employment abroad, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the policies to solve the rising unemployment caused
by the economic crisis, the Labor Ministry has passed new rules
capping fees at 80,000 to 100,000 baht (2,162 to 2,702 dollars),
hoping more Thai workers will seek jobs overseas this year.
</P>
<P>
However, it is expected that the amount of money in baht term
remitted by Thai workers overseas this year would drop from last
year since the baht strengthened, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, more than two million people in Thailand become
jobless, making the country's unemployment rate surge to six
percent.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Opens Up Insurance Market for Foreign Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has opened up its insurance
market to the outside by issuing last week wholly-owned foreign
insurers with licenses to operate in the country.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) had issued
a life insurance permit to Canada's Manulife to run an insurance
company in Vietnam, according to a report of the latest issue of
Vietnam Investment Review.
</P>
<P>
Under the license, the 8.5 million U.S. dollar insurance
company can offer corporate insurance, life insurance, reinsurance
and investment for a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, MPI also granted a non-life insurance license
to a consortium that includes Allianz Aktienge-sellschaft of
Germany and AGF Asia Privated Ltd of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The 7.5 million dollar Allianz/AGF Insurance Company will offer
non-life insurance, reinsurance and capital investment as well as
other services for foreigners in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's non-life insurance has expanded rapidly -- growing 40
percent a year since 1994 -- mainly because of rising demand from
motorbike owners and, now, car drivers.

BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign companies in China spoke
highly of their joint ventures and partnership with Chinese
companies although many prefer wholly owned subsidiaries, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Experts and senior officials from major foreign companies in
China made their view clear on the collaboration and partnership
with Chinese firms at the 1999 Strategic Relationships Conference

<P>
Henry Chow, chairman of IBM China Co Ltd, was quoted by China

partners smoothly collaborate and share their strong points.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely viable for a foreign company to enter the
Chinese market through launching a joint venture with a Chinese
partner," he said, adding that joint ventures will continue to be
established in China in the future.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Khordoc, director of the International Development

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Foreign Ministry to Cut Overhead Costs Amid Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Economic crisis has made Ecuador's
Foreign Ministry look for new ways to reduce its overhead costs,
local press said Monday.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures was to close down Ecuador's diplomatic
missions in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, three consulates and an
embassy have been closed. The consulate in Philadelphia and the
Embassy in Romania were closed in March, and the consulates in
Hong Kong, China, and Valparaiso, Chile suspended their business a
few days ago.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Philadelphia, it is believed that the work of
the consulate there can be transferred to New Jersey or New York.
</P>
<P>
The problems of the Foreign Ministry were basically caused by
its cut in budget and the delay in the payment of its allowance by
the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, its operating costs were around 24 million dollars,
and the figure is expected to be around 27 million dollars this
year.
</P>
<P>
Due to a government cut in the budget, the Foreign Ministry
will only receive 21 million dollars this year.

<HEADLINE> Better Medical Care In Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- When Liao Wenshan, from southern
China, was preparing for a visit to Tibet, his friends warned him
of the serious consequences of getting a cold in Tibet if no
treatment was available -- but Liao got the flu and recovered
quite soon and completed his scheduled visit.
</P>
<P>
Before 1959, Tibet, which covers a 1.2-million-square-kilometer
area, had only three official clinics that mainly helped the
Tibetan nobility, while serfs were too poor to see doctors and
could die of even the most minor of diseases because of a lack of
medicines.
</P>
<P>
After 40 years of development, however, there are 1,300 medical
institutions in Tibet employing 10,000 people. In 1994, the
central and regional governments spent 140 million yuan (16.9
million US dollars) building or renovating pharmaceutical plants
and medical training centers.
</P>
<P>
Li Chengsong, the director of the region's People's Hospital,
says that his hospital can do difficult operations and treat
plateau-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
This year, the regional government plans to allocate 220
million yuan, or 7 percent of the region's expenditures, for the
public health sector.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's population has increased to 2.44 million people from
one million in 1959, with Tibetans accounting for 95 percent of
that figure. The average life expectancy of Tibetans rose to 65
years, compared with 36 years in 1959, and there are 60 people who
are 100 years old or older in Tibet.

ULAN BATOR, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagbandy said on Monday that his country badly needs foreign aid
and loans to help tide over the country's economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a two-day international conference
on economic aid to Mongolia, Bagbandy said the government will
take measures like financial reform, privatization of big
enterprises and development of infrastructure to check the
economic problem, but this goal can not be achieved by only
relying on the country's own financial resources.
</P>
<P>
Bagbandy also stressed that Mongolia can create a better
environment to attract more foreign investment, making full use of
its rich animal husbandry raw materials and mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from about 20 countries and eight international
organizations are attending the meeting, co-sponsored by the
World Bank and the Mongolian government.
</P>
<P>
During the past eight years, the international community has
provided Mongolia with loans and assistance worth 2 billion U.S.
dollars through international conferences on aid to Mongolia.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Food Administration Department
of Vietnam will carry out a nation-wide food hygiene, quality and
safety campaign throughout the month of July, said Vietnam News on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Food Administration Department of the Ministry of Health
will work with Vietnam's related ministries and branches to
mobilize the mass media to raise public awareness of food
poisoning prevention and preparation of healthy and safe meals.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will take the safety of imported goods into
account.
</P>
<P>
In the Ho Chi Minh City food markets, powdered milk made by
European companies, which lately have been embroiled in a scandal
over contamination with the carcinogenic substance dioxin, was
still being displayed and sold as usual.
</P>
<P>
Imported European milk products account for 30 percent of the
milk products displayed and sold in Ho Chi Minh City. These milk
products have not been tested for quality, hygiene or safety
because such tests are very expensive, said local authorities,
adding that in addition, the test results may not be totally
accurate because of the backward state of the local testing
center.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will also concentrate on small-scale food
production enterprises, private food and beverage manufacturing
businesses and popular restaurants where hygiene and safety
standards are not observed.

</P>
<P>
Pelti spokesman Benny Mailili said the association would choose

<HEADLINE> Australian Senate Approves Further Sale of Telstra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Senate approved
Monday night the sale of a further 16.6 percent of Telstra, the
national telecommunications carrier and the biggest company in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The first third of the state-run enterprise had been sold in
1987 and around 1.8 million Australians invested in it.
</P>
<P>
The second slice of the company will be sold within months and
the Howard government is expecting to raise about 10 billion U.S.
dollars to retire its debt which was up to 149 billion U.S.
dollars by last March.
</P>
<P>
The sell-off attracts vast attention in the society.
</P>
<P>
In the first sale, investors bought for 3.30 Australian dollars
a share and now Telstra shares are trading at 8.10 Australian
dollars a share, a gain of almost 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government appointed in advance a team to
prepare to float later this year but refused to reveal details
about how the second batch would be sold.
</P>
<P>
According to Australian Associated Press, the Senate voted 37
to 35 to pass the legislation as two key independents stood by the
government's side, and the support only came after the government
admitted defeat with its plan to sell all of Telstra by amending
its own legislation, limiting the total sale to no more than 49.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian oppositions including the Labor, the Democrats
and the Greens insistently opposed the bill arguing that it would
raise the unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
The Howard government is now hoping to rush through its goods
and services tax package this week because by July 1 the current
Senate will expire and the balance of power in the new one will
rest with the Australian Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Panama to Construct Largest Trade Center in C.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Panama is constructing one of
the largest and most modern trade centers of the Central America
and Caribbean on the old site of the North American air-base,
Albrook, the Inter-Oceanic Regional Authority (ARI) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
ARI, an official autonomous entity in charge of the
administration of U.S.-returned properties, said that this mega-
project, named Albrook People's Trade Center, has involved various
domestic and foreign companies, which have invested more than 100
million U.S. dollars in total.
</P>
<P>
Investors of the center, to be built on a 60-hectare site, can
lease for forty years, during which the Panamanian state will
receive tax payments.
</P>
<P>
According to ARI, the trade project, located just a few
kilometers from the city limits of the Panamanian capital, will
help the local population to get supply merchandise and healthy
diversion.
</P>
<P>
The project is just one of a dozen development plans of the
Panamanian government in the zone of the inter-oceanic canal which
was returned to Panama in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Another mega-project, competing with Albrook, is the Tourist
Center of Amador, a modern tourist installation invested by Korean,
Spanish, Canadian and American businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Amador, on the Pacific coast and about 30-minute drive from the
Panamanian capital, is to become a large tourist resort with three
islands connected by pedestrian walkways.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Sets IMF Exit Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- After over 30 years of
subservience, the Philippines finally hopes to cut the so-called
protective grip of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over the
economy next year, Journal reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
To make way for this plan, the Philippine government will rush
reforms in various facets of the economy to strengthen its
defenses against external shocks, the paper quoted Finance
Secretary Edgardo B. Espiritu as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines was actually preparing for an exit program as
early as 1997 when the Asian financial crisis erupted, putting in
disarray most economies in the region.
</P>
<P>
As the impact of the crisis reverberated throughout the world,
the government opted to sign a precautionary arrangement with the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
The two year program, under which the Fund closely monitored
the country's economic performance with a set of criteria, will
end in March next year. It carries a total standby package of 1.4
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The targets pertain to the borrowing requirements of the public
sector, the level of foreign borrowings and net international
reserves.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government signed a new letter of intent with
the IMF last week committing continued reforms to ensure growth
not just this year but for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
The reforms include the revision of the Securities and Exchange
Act, the creation of bankruptcy courts, the rationalization of
fiscal incentives and the public sector reform program which would
include the local government units.
</P>
<P>
Once all of these reforms are in place, Manila can look forward
to the termination of IMF support programs which have dominated
Philippine finance over the last 37 years, the paper said.

finishing with seven points and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Forward Lubos Barton scored the most 24 points by making all
six of his 3-pointers, while Saulius Stombergas led Lithuania with
17 points.

Kukoc of the Chicago Bulls, with 16 points, paced a Croatian
comeback from a 19-point halftime deficit against Italy, runner-up
two years ago, while Dirk Nowitzky, the Dallas Mavericks rookie,
scored 21 points as Germany shocked Greece.
</P>
<P>
Russia crushed Slovenia 68-47 and Turkey beat Bosnia-
Herzegovina 57-42, behind 14 points from Hidayet Turkouglu.

67 behind Tariq Abdul-Wahad, the Sacramento Kings forward, who led
France with 24 points.
</P>
<P>
Dejan Tomasevic paced Yugoslavia with 24 points and 12 rebounds
in its opening Group A game in Toulouse, as Tomasevic and Dejan
Bodiroga keyed a 14-0 run that put Yugoslavia firmly in control.

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, June 21 (Xinhua) -- United Airlines, the largest
airline in the world, reported Monday that last month more of its
customers used electronic tickets than paper tickets for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
May ticketing revealed that 51 percent of the more than 7
million tickets used on the airline worldwide were electronic ones.
</P>
<P>
The United Airlines launched electronic ticketing in 1994 and
now it is available to 95 percent of the destinations the airline
served worldwide.
</P>
<P>
In a survey conducted by the company, more than 70 percent of
its customers using electronic ticketing said they prefer it to
other ticketing options for the convenience and hassle-free travel
it provides.
</P>
<P>
Domestic customers using electronic tickets are not required to
carry anything other than identification and, in some instances,
the credit card used to pay for the ticket.
</P>
<P>
International customers are requested to carry their ticket
receipt. Unlike paper tickets, with electronic tickets, there is
no need to worry about ticket pick-up or delivery. An electronic
ticket can be issued instantly over the telephone or through the
company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, customers don't have to worry about losing tickets.
Losing a paper ticket can involve purchasing a new one and paying
a lost ticket fee of 75 U.S. dollars. Besides, with an electronic
ticket, changes to an itinerary can easily be done over the
telephone, saving an extra trip to have a ticket re-issued or
updated.

<P>
It took Chinese specialists three years to develop the system,
which is based on data from more than 3,600 management personnel
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The newly emerging business of quality assessment is a result
of the introduction of the market economy, which allows
enterprises to recruit on their own people instead of just
accepting whoever the government assigns to them, one Ministry of
Personnel official explains.
</P>
<P>
However, he also points out that the business is still new and
that there are many improvements needed to better assess human
resources.

<HEADLINE> More Highways Protected by Trees in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Trees have been planted along more
than 10,000 kilometers of highways in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, a dry place with deserts in northwest China, accounting
for one third of its total highway mileage.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have been made to curb the damage of highways
caused by drought, scarce vegetation, sand and floods and ensure
the safety of transport, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
The region has 32,000 kilometers of highways, but 17,000
kilometers of them run through Gobi and cold uplands, making it
hard to plant trees.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, however, set aside a lot of funds annually in recent
years to along highways where trees are viable.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the region built gardens, fruit yards, vegetable
yards and grape trellises along its highways.

TIANJIN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The northern Chinese city of
Tianjin has found 461 trees more than 300 years old, 8 of which
are more than 1,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
They were discovered during a recent activity to select "King
Tree". The honor went to 3 of the trees that are more than 1,000
years old.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese pine accounts for the greatest number of old trees,
followed by the Japanese Pagoda tree, and oriental arborvitae.
Most of the trees were found in the northern suburbs on hills that
have rich soil.
</P>
<P>
The trees are regarded as living antiques and provide important
information about the city's history and local folklore, according
to one folklorist and they also show that the city has made an
effort to protect things of historical interest.
</P>
<P>
To better protect these old trees, the city has a project for
encouraging citizens to sponsor a specific tree or grassy area.

BERLIN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Dietbert Friedberg, a former East
German sports official, was sentenced to six months by a Berlin
court on Monday after being found guilty of doping and causing
bodily harm to athletes in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that any sports official was sentenced to
prison in connection with the systematic doping in former East
Germany.
</P>
<P>
However, the 56-year-old physician acquired probation
automatically because the sentence was under two years and the man
has no previous convictions.
</P>
<P>
The court found Friedberg guilty of providing anabolic steroids
to athletes and swimmers in East Germany between 1977 and 1984 as
20 former East Germans filed charges against him.
</P>
<P>
The physician was the deputy director of the Sport Medical
Service of East Germany.

<HEADLINE> World Tourism Industry Earnings to Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The world tourism industry is
expected to double its revenue in the next 20 years, predicted
former president of the World-wide Hotel and Restaurant
Association (WWHRA) Eric Pfeffer on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local newspaper "El Pais," Pfeffer
said that at least one in ten people in the world are now involved
directly or indirectly in the tourism.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the world-wide tourism industry accounted for almost
10 percent of the total world Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
earning 600 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, revenue from business travels represented 50 percent
of the total tourism earnings, while in some developed countries,
such as the United States, the figure reached 70 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pfeffer was the WWHRA president in 1998, and now is the
Executive President of the hotel division, Cendant, a consortium
of eight hotel chains grouping a total of 6,200 hotels in the
world.

<HEADLINE> International Police Advisers Arrive in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The first contingent of
international police advisers, unarmed and wearing blue U.N. caps,
arrived in the East Timor capital of Dili on Monday to assist in
the August direct ballot in the territory, according to reports
reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 41 police officers who arrived on Monday, the first of some
270 civilian police advisers, were drawn from Australia, Ireland,
New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The police officers would be limited to an advisory role, and
they will act in an advisory capacity to the Indonesian police,
who are responsible for ensuring East Timor remains peaceful in
the run-up to the vote.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman in East Timor David Wimhurst said Indonesian
police would be ultimately responsible for maintaining law and
order.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., which is organizing the ballot, hopes the officers
will be able to stem a tide of violence convulsing East Timor
ahead of the direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
Wimhurst also disclosed that the U.N. mission has opened voter
registration centers in Dili, Baucau, Suai and Same. Later this
week it plans to open similar centers in Viqueque, Los Palos,
Ermera and Maliana regencies.
</P>
<P>
U.N. special representative on East Timor Jamsheed Marker is on
his way to East Timor. Marker held talks with President B.J.
Habibie, Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas and other senior
Indonesian government officials in Jakarta on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Marker said he was encouraged by ongoing preparations for the
direct ballot to be held in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to say whether the U.N. would go ahead with its
original plan to hold the self-determination vote on August 8 or
postpone it because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
Since January, dozens of East Timorese have been killed in
clashes between the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
"I think the process is going well and we hope this will
continue. The U.N. will continue with all it can to bring about
this peaceful solution," Marker said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas acknowledged there were still minor incidents in East
Timor, but said the government would be able to ensure an
atmosphere conducive to the ballot process.
</P>
<P>
He said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan would make his final
decision on the ballot date after receiving Marker's report on the
East Timor situation.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by Indonesia and Portugal on May 5,
the U.N. will deploy civilian police advisers from several
countries to assist Indonesian police in maintaining law and
order. A key function will be the disarmament of rival factions
that are either for or against independence.
</P>
<P>
The August 8 ballot will allow the territory's people to choose
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent. The Indonesia government has
announced that it would grant East Timor independence if the
people in the territory reject Indonesia's offer of a
wide-ranging autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' 91-day T-bill Drops to 46-month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' benchmark 91-day
treasury bill (T-bill) rate dropped Monday to a 46-month low of
9.067 percent, the lowest recorded since August 8, 1995 when the
yield settled at 8.932 percent, a local newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
National Treasurer Leonor Briones was quoted by the Philippine
Star as saying that the drop was widely anticipated due to the
continued easing of the inflation rate coupled with the Central
Bank's decision to reduce its key overnight rates anew last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Investors swarmed the auction floor Monday with total tenders
reaching a four-month high of 16.377 billion pesos (409 million
U.S. dollars), an indication of a very liquid financial market,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Rates for the 182-day T-bills declined to 9.355 percent from
the previous week's 9.679 percent while yields for the 360-day
T-bills eased to 10.262 percent from 10.625 percent a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo B. Espiritu said earlier that the
rates for the bellwether 91-day T-bills may drop to as low as 8.7
percent following the continued easing in inflation rate and the
Central Bank's key overnight rates.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate slowed down to 6.7 percent in May from eight
percent in April while the Central Bank effected Monday another
25-point reduction in its key overnight rates, the 18th time this
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Department of Finance inked Monday the agreement
for the government's small denominated treasury bonds aimed at
mobilizing savings and enhance further development of the
country's capital markets.

<HEADLINE> Milestone Marked in Finding Hodgkin's Disease Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists have discovered
what sparks the growth of deadly cancer cells in Hodgkin's
disease.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Press reported Monday that the findings marked a
milestone in the battle against the cancer.
</P>
<P>
The research, by Dr. Tak Mak and his team at Toronto's Princess
Margaret Hospital, paves the way to stop the growth of Hodgkin's
tumour and sets the stage for clinical trials on people, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Mak was quoted as asserting:"If this treatment works, there
should be almost completely no side effects."
</P>
<P>
According to the findings, to be published Monday in the
Journal of Experimental Medicine, a factor called Interleukin-13
or IL-13 fuels the growth of more cancer cells in a process of
self-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
By depriving the cancerous cells termed as Reed-Sternberg cells
of IL-13 in test tubes, the researchers found that cancerous cells
did not grow.
</P>
<P>
Hodgkin's disease commonly strikes adults in their 20s or 30s
or patients in their 50s or 60s. Many patients die of
complications from chemotherapy and radiation treatment, while
some others come down with infections of secondary cancers.

<HEADLINE> Italy Names New Minister to Accelerate Institutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Antonio Maccanico was appointed
Monday to the Reform Minister by Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema to push along long-awaited changes in the country's
institutions.
</P>
<P>
"I believe he is extraordinarily suited to this job," said
D'Alema Monday, commenting on the new Minister for Institutional
Reforms, whose task is to draft changes to Italy's electoral
system and its form of government.
</P>
<P>
"Institutional reforms remain one of the priorities of this
legislature," D'Alema said, adding that "the government must push
reforms along with intelligence and maintaining dialogue with all
political forces."
</P>
<P>
Maccanico, aged 75, is a renowned mediator and deal-maker from
the center ground of politics. This reputation was one of the
reasons he was called on in 1996 to forge a coalition government
which would have ushered in reforms, including that of the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
He failed by a whisker to knit a coalition together and instead
had to settle for the job of posts and telecommunications minister
in the government of Romano Prodi which emerged from subsequent
elections.
</P>
<P>
Since losing his job when D'Alema formed a new government last
autumn, Maccanico has been chairman of the Senate's commission on
constitutional affairs - a key talking shop on reform.
</P>
<P>
Between 1988 and 1991 he was regional affairs minister in two
successive Christian Democrat governments.
</P>
<P>
Recently he joined the Democrats party, a formation founded by
Romano Prodi to carry on the ideals of the center-left Olive Tree
government he led for two and a half years.

<HEADLINE> British MPs Wants to Probe Secret Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A committee of British members of
parliament pressed the government on Monday to allow them greater
freedom to probe the activities of the security and intelligence
agencies, better known as MI5 and MI6.
</P>
<P>
A report by the House of Commons home affairs committee said
current arrangements for supervision of the agencies should be
replaced by a fully independent parliamentary committee with wider
powers, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994 the agencies, previously secret and beyond the
scrutiny of parliament, have been subject to a watchdog committee
of MPs appointed by the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We conclude that the present statutory arrangements for
oversight of the intelligence and security agencies by the
Intelligence and Security Committee should be replaced by a
parliamentary select committee or committees," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The key feature must be that the scrutiny committee should be
more clearly seen to be independent of the executive," the
report noted.
</P>
<P>
Members of parliament say that despite the 1994 reform, their
ability to monitor the two agencies, which handle foreign
intelligence and domestic counter-espionage, is very limited
compared with counterparts in other countries, according to
Reuters.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- French World Cup-winning captain
Didier Deschamps agreed to a three-year deal with English Premier
League soccer club Chelsea on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, Deschamps moved from Juventus to
join Chelsea at a transfer fee of three million pounds (about 4.77
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The midfielder finalised negotiations with the premier league
club's chief executive Colin Hutchinson who is on holiday in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Deschamps is a former teammate of Chelsea coach Gianluca Vialli.
The pair helped Juventus lift the European Cup in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He won the French championship twice and the European Cup at
Marseille before joining Juventus in 1994. He helped Juventus
complete the Italian league and cup double the following year.
</P>
<P>
Deschamps also played a major role in helping Juventus win the
Italian title in 1997 and 1998 and took them to the Champions
League final last year where they were beaten by Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Deschamps's best friend, fellow French World Cup winner Marcel
Desailly, joined Chelsea last season and recently pledged his
future to the London club.

<HEADLINE> Sampras, Graf Advance in Wimbledon Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Men's top seed Pete Sampras of the
United States had a smooth start on the way to defend his
Wimbledon title by beating Australian Scott Draper 6-3, 6-4, 6-4
in the first round on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The American world number one is bidding to become the only man
of the century to win the singles title six times and he was in
inspired form as he cruelly exposed the gulf of ability between
himself and his 63rd-ranked opponent.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, winner in 93, 94, 95, 97 and 98, met little challenge
from the Australian in centre court, which drew a capacity of
crowd to enjoy the match.
</P>
<P>
"You can get the jitters in your first match out there but as
soon as I got on the court I felt right at home.
</P>
<P>
"For an opening match I couldn't have asked for anything better
-- I am motivated to do well here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sampras was joined in the second round by Britain's Tim Henman,
the sixth seed, who beat Arnaud di Pasquale 6-4, 6-0, 3-6, 7-6 (7-
1) and 13th-seeded Slovak Karol Kucera who destroyed Mexican
Alejandro Hernandez 6-2, 6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Australian Mark Philippoussis was the first men's singles seed
to go through when his booming serve demolished Belgian teenager
Xavier Malisse 6-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
In the women's draw, second seed Steffi Graf breezed past Czech
Ludmila Cerranova 6-1, 6-4 while fourth seed Monica Seles made
light work of Spain's Cristina Torrens-Valero 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Seven-times champion Graf looked completely at home back on
grass after her French Open victory and said: "I feel good... I
feel in good shape and I've trained well and prepared well.
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready for the next round and nothing else right now."
</P>
<P>
American Seles made the most of her double-fisted, disguised
groundstrokes to wrongfoot her Spanish opponent as she romped to
victory.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Amanda Coetzer, seeded 12, eased past Australian
Nicole Pratt 6-2, 7-5 but Anna Kournikova had a tough start
against Austrian wild card Barbara Schwartz before winning 7-6 (7-
2), 4-6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova was named 17th seed when the number 10, American
Serena Williams, pulled out with influenza.
</P>
<P>
Serena's sister, sixth-seeded Venus, maintained the Williams
family challenge by beating Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands 6-1,
7-5.
</P>
<P>
Two matches were suspended on the first day due to bad light.
The men's singles first round match between Sweden's Magnus
Larsson and Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov, ranked third, was stopped
with the score (Larsson first) 7-6 (7-4), 5-7, 6-7 (6-8).
</P>
<P>
The women's singles match between Jennifer Capriati and Anke
Huber also had a halt with the score level at one set each and 5-5.
</P>
<P>
German Huber had taken the first set 7-5, with American
Capriati hitting back to win the second 6-3. The resumption will
be the second match on center court on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> UK's Blair to Refocus on Domestic Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
will use a major policy speech on Tuesday to refocus his party's
sights on the domestic agenda, after the Labor Party's disastrous
performance in the recent elections for Members of European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Blair will travel to the midlands city of Birmingham to
highlight the success of his government's New Deal job creation
scheme, billing it as the epitome of New Labour in action, his
official spokesman was quoted as saying by Reuters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a classic example...of New Labour enterprise made
real," Blair will say, celebrating the 100,000th young unemployed
person to get a job through the New Deal subsidy scheme since
Labour took power in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister will reject accusations Labour has neglected
its traditional working-class supporters in its relentless pursuit
of middle class votes, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
"We will serve people of all ages and background, even those
who didn't vote for us," he will say.
</P>
<P>
John Monks, head of trade union umbrella body the TUC and
widely seen as a New Labour loyalist, said on Saturday that Blair
treated long-time Labour voters like "embarrassing elderly
relatives", shunning them in his drive for modernisation.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, John Edmonds, chief of the GMB union, warned Labour
that unless it switched its focus to party loyalists it risked
them staying at home in the next general election, due by 2002, as
they did in droves in the European poll two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman said the suggestion that Labour achievements
such as lower taxes, cuts in unemployment and hefty increases in
child benefit were only of interest to well-off pockets of the
population was "ludicrous".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that while the opposition Conservative
Party's hostility to adopting the euro currency had yielded
short-term gains, in the long term they would be marginalised as a
one-issue party.
</P>
<P>
"It will become clearer and clearer they have nothing to say on
jobs, schools and crime," he was quoted saying.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman also angrily denied media reports that the
Prime Minister had gone cool on the euro in the face of hostile
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
Party sources said Blair would address Labour MPs on Wednesday
to review what lessons could be learned from the European poll,
which gave opposition Conservatives more seats than Labour in
Brussels, Reuters said.

<HEADLINE> US, Cuba Hold Talks on Counter-narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Four U.S. officials met Monday
in Havana with Cuban officials to discuss ways of improving
counter-narcotics cooperation but that does not indicate a change
of U.S. policy towards Cuba, a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
Michael Ranneberger, who heads the State Department's office of
Cuban affairs, said the meeting was taking place within guidelines
for law enforcement efforts on counter-narcotics, the Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team consisted of two State Department and two Coast
Guard officials, none of whom holds a high rank. They were to
spend only one day in Cuba, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Only a small portion of the drugs entering the United States
come through Cuba, McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the island's location and a growing
tourist market could make it an opportune target for drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Cuba lacks the resources to counter large drug-trafficking
organizations, so drugs are routinely flown over Cuba or dumped in
Cuban waters without effective resistance by local authorities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the talks did not mean a change of
policy towards Cuba. The U.S. administration maintained an
embargo against the country attempting to topple the current Cuban
government.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Phones Blair on the Deaths of British Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) - The United States President Bill
Clinton on Monday phoned British Prime Minister Tony Blair to
express condolences over the deaths of two British soldiers in an
explosion in Kosovo, Blair's office said.
</P>
<P>
The two soldiers were killed on Monday after a blast involving
what might have been the remains of NATO bombs in Kosovo. Their
deaths were the first NATO fatalities since the military alliance
deployed its peacekeeping force in Kosovo 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is currently visiting the Balkans, "phoned to
express his condolences to the prime minister", Blair's spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were killed while removing munitions from a school
in the village of Negrovce, some 30 km (20 miles) west of the
Kosovo capital Pristina, a British army statement said earlier.
</P>
<P>
A BBC report quoted witnesses as saying that 50 explosives were
being collected by British bomb experts when the blast happened.
</P>
<P>
At least two civilians were also killed in the blast.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Names Civilian Administrator and Refugee Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A French Government
official will take charge of administering Kosovo and a New
Zealand refugee expert will oversee the return and resettlement of
those who fled the Serbian province, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dominique Vian, currently the prefect or governor of French
Guayana, will be Annan's deputy special representative for the
interim civilian administration of Kosovo -- overseeing everything
from the police to schools, buses and electric plants.
</P>
<P>
Dennis McNamara, currently the special envoy of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees for former Yugoslavia, will be the
secretary-general's deputy special representative in charge of
refugee return and humanitarian assistance, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard announced.
</P>
<P>
Under a proposed plan for Kosovo, which Annan unveiled a week
ago, the U.N. peace mission, the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission (UNMIK), will have four deputies serving
under a special representative. The plan has to win endorsement
from the 15-nation Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, who is currently on an official visit to
Russia, has not yet made a decision on a special representative to
oversee the challenging civilian operation aimed at taking Kosovo
and its people and its people from the devastation of war to an
economically secure future without fear of renewed ethnic
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
In answering to a press question, Eckhard said that the future
U.N. special representative for Kosovo will be a European
national. Sergio Vieira de Mello, U.N. under-secretary-general for
humanitarian affairs, assumed his responsibility as the special
representative on interim basis since he arrived in Pristina,
provincial capital of Kosovo, on June 13.
</P>
<P>
Annan said last Saturday in Paris on his way to Moscow that the
special representative would be a European. That ruled out the
leading American candidate, Jacques Klein, a deputy to the
international community's top Bosnian envoy, Carlos Westendrop.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general has put the European Union in charge of
reconstruction and has given the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in European primary responsibility for
rebuilding government institutions and organizing election.
</P>
<P>
Vian, 54, a lawyer, has been prefect for French Guyana since
February 1997, in charge of 51 local administrations, 6,500 civil
servants and regional cooperation with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
McNamara has held a variety of posts at the UNHCR, most
recently as director of international protection for the agency's
staff. He also ran the human rights component of the U.N.
peacekeeping operation in Cambodia ahead of 1993 elections.

<HEADLINE> UNEP, Habitat Welcome G-8 Cologne Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Executive Director of the United
Nations Environment Program (UNEP), Klaus Toepfer, Monday welcomed
the debt relief plan agreed to by world leaders at the G-8 Summit
in Cologne, Germany, last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"Debt relief is a necessary precondition for sustainable
development - an important step toward increasing resources for
education, health and the environment," Toepfer told the press in
Kenyan capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer, who is also acting director of the United Nations
Center for Human Settlements, added that debt relief is also
essential in order to alleviate the conditions of the urban poor.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 Cologne Debt Initiative and the re-launch of the High
Indebted Poor Countries initiative, is a clear signal that debt
relief and overseas development assistance must increasingly be
tied to good governance, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Debt relief will alleviate the living conditions of the billion
people who are homeless or live without adequate shelter in the
cities, only when governments and local authorities commit
themselves to better urban governance, he said.
</P>
<P>
World leaders at the G-8 Summit agreed in Cologne last weekend
to the 1999 Cologne Debt Initiative, which is expected to write
off debts of 36 countries totaling 70 billion U.S. dollars.

``We want the conflict of Kosovo to become a turning point,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook also said that it is time to help the Kosovars to hold
``free and fair'' elections, while the long-term status of Kosovo

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate Urged to Approve Ministerial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Nigerian government
official Monday urged the Senate to timely approve the list of the
ministerial nominees submitted by President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Only five of the 49 nominees were cleared last week by the
109-member Senate, two weeks after the list was submitted to the
upper chamber.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing held in Nigerian capital Abuja Monday,
Doyin Okupe, special assistant to the president on media and
publicity, said that "the delay in the clearance of the nominees
has created international anxiety."
</P>
<P>
He urged the senators, who have constitutional responsibility
for approving ministerial nominees, to "have a quick and
dispassionate look at the list", warning that further delay could
"cripple the government."
</P>
<P>
The list has generated much controversy but most Nigerians
argue that it should be approved to enable the president to get on
with the business of addressing the country's daunting problems.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo met with the senators five days ago in an
effort to drum up support for his nominees.
</P>
<P>
The Senate last week asked the president to provide additional
information on the other nominees, some of whom have been
criticized as "being a return of discredited former public
servants."
</P>
<P>
Okupe said that "a lot of communication had gone on between the
Senate and the president in the last few days" in an effort to
resolve areas of disagreement and ensure timely clearance.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, the Senate has been flooded with
avalanche of petitions by different interest groups over the
nomination of certain persons for ministerial appointment.
</P>
<P>
Senator Arthur Nzeribe confirmed having received more than 100
petitions against most of the nominees.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four out of the 49 ministerial nominees will appear
before the Senate Tuesday with more information about themselves.
</P>
<P>
The nominees are expected to show proof of having paid their
taxes consecutively in the past three years and to provide
evidence of their medical report to show that they are fit persons
to be appointed as ministers.
</P>
<P>
Other hurdles which must be scaled by each of the ministerial
nominees include possession of voter's registration card, written
evidence of declaration of assets and membership card of his or
her political party.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's GDP Figures Revised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has never been
in an economic recession as was previously believed, Statistics
South Africa said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Revised gross domestic product (GDP) figures for 1998 have
showed that the country's economy had grown by 0.2 percent in the
last quarter of 1998, and not by minus 0.3 percent as originally
reported.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the original figures, South Africa was technically
in a recession because it recorded negative growth rates for two
successive quarters.
</P>
<P>
The revisions followed Statistics South Africa's use of the
United Nations-prescribed System of National Accounts 1993 (1993
SNA), in calculating the country's quarterly real growth rates and
the revised annual real growth rates.
</P>
<P>
The new method pushes GDP level upward by a few percent through
 counting certain activities into GDP for the first time, the
organization said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's annual growth in real GDP over the
five-year period from 1993 to 1998 has been boosted from the
original 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
By applying the new method, Statistics South Africa had
identified new economic activities, noticeably in the
communications sector, including the rapid spread of cellular
phones, Internet-use and satellite TV.
</P>
<P>
The organization said that since the economy opened up to the
pressures of globalization following the 1994 election, there had
been notable increases in existing economic activity, such as the
taxi industry, private health services, and financial and
government services.
</P>
<P>
The increase in real GDP for the first quarter of this year was
 calculated at 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The best news about the figures was they showed that the
country was technically never in a recession, said Maria Ramos,
Director-General of the South African Finance Department.
</P>
<P>
"I think what these numbers mean, is that the economy is more
buoyant, more resilient, and the potential for future growth is
greater than we anticipated," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates indicated that the 1998/99 deficit, set
at 3.3 percent in April this year, would probably be coming in at
somewhere in the area of 2.9 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
Other growth numbers are also expected to be revised upward for
the next few years, including the debt to GDP ratio and the tax to
GDP ratio.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the figures should boost South Africa's image among
credit rating agencies.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official Monday urged
Kenyan authorities to get serious about curbing the drug abuse
menace, saying that the war against drug trafficking and abuse in
Kenya was hampered by corruption.
</P>
<P>
Muki Daniel, U.N. Drug Control Program assistant regional
representative, said that "drug trafficking and abuse pose a major

lip-service to the fight against them."
</P>
<P>
Daniel made the remarks at the program's office in Kenyan
capital Nairobi when briefing the media on the international day
against drug abuse and illicit trafficking, which falls on June
26.
</P>
<P>
Daniel noted that what was required was to sensitize the
police, judiciary and Customs and Excise Department to ensure
drugs were detected and traffickers arrested.
</P>
<P>
She added that Kenya also required sophisticated equipment and
highly trained officers to curb the menace.

<HEADLINE> "Policy Has Not Changed One Iota" Towards Euro, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) - There would be no change in the
Britain's policy towards the EU's single currency, an official
spokesman from the Prime Minister's office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also denied there had been any shift in the tone
of policy in recent weeks, saying "policy has not chanted one
iota. The tone has not changed."
</P>
<P>
However, Tony Blair said on Sunday it would be "daft" for
Britain to join the single currency straight away and insisted
that there would have to be further economic reform in Europe
before Britain could sign up.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Radio 4, the Prime Minister acknowledged that the
public had "real concerns" about Europe and admitted that the
Tories had received a short-term boost from the Euro-sceptic vote.
</P>
<P>
In the European elections on June 13, Tony Blair saw his
party's share of the vote collapse from its high water mark of 44
percent at the General Election in 1997 to 28 percent, while the
Conservatives were up from 32 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman refused to confirm whether or not the prime
minister would attend a conference next month to support Britain's
membership of the euro.
</P>
<P>
The matter was dependent on other potential priorities in
Blair's agenda, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the comments are bound to fuel
speculation at Westminster that the Govenment's timetable for a
referendum on British entry to the single currency is slipping.

LONDON June 21 (Xinhua) - European stocks held most of their
strong gains Monday after a series of rallies underpinned by
strong overnight performances in Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
The UK blue chip index finished 53.4 points or 0.82 percent up
at 6581.26, within a whisker of its all-time closing high of
6598.8, set on April 28.

18 points to the index. HSBC was another notable gainer, up 2.7
percent after a 4.4 percent surge for the Hang Seng index
overnight.
</P>
<P>
Sharp gains on leading Asian markets together with a 2.5
percent rally in Frankfurt also helped steer the FTSE higher form
the outset.
</P>
<P>
"The rise in Hongkong and Germany is fuelled by hopes of a
synchronised global economic recovery, while the likely hike in US
rates at the end of the month has been priced in," said Jeremy
Batstone, head of research at NatWest Stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the electronic Xetra Dax retreated slightly from
an early surge that drove its blue chips up nearly 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The index ended 2.46 percent higher, at 5468.47 amid sharp
gains in chemical stocks and a surge in Japan's Nikkei index
Monday to its highest level in 20 months.

<P>
Paris' CAC 40 index ended up 0.12 percent at 4545.09, having

<HEADLINE> Wearable Computing A Potential Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have been finding
ways to make PCs really "personal", worn by people much as
eyeglasses or clothing.
</P>
<P>
Now the wearable computer market is evolving from a research
and development focused, start-up environment to a product- and
customer-oriented market. According to a report released Monday by
market analysis firm International Data Corporation (IDC), the
market in the United States will reach 600 million U.S. dollars by
2003.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the U.S. wearable PC marketplace will be driven by
the demand in the industrial, manufacturing, military, government
and medical sectors. "Wearable computing will start to play a key
role in cost cutting and increasing productivity for many
industrial users in the next five to ten years," IDC said. "The
true mobility of wearable computing will expand PC opportunities
to markets and job functions PCs have not been able to penetrate
up until now."
</P>
<P>
The potential market opportunities have attracted the efforts
of many companies and universities in the United States. IBM's
Almaden Research Center, for instance, has been working on a
number of variations of the wearable PC, such as a "belt" computer
that let users surf, dictate and edit documents while they are
moving around. It is also working on personal area network (PAN)
technology, which uses the natural electrical conductivity of the
human body to transmit electronic data. In the future, a user of
PAN technology will be able to transfer information via touch
rather than issuing typed commands or pressing buttons.
</P>
<P>
Vehicle maintenance users, particularly large vehicles such as
aircrafts, will find that a wearable computer can cut down on the
need to refer to paper-based manuals and increase accuracy on the
job. Medical workers will have immediate access to records,
reference materials, and with communications capabilities, other
medical resources.
</P>
<P>
But wearable computing may be a commercial application only for
the next few years. According to IDC, the biggest challenge to the
wearable computing industry is user education. Although many
useful applications will be developed, the majority of end users
will remain confused about the form factor.
</P>
<P>
IBM researchers stress the value of the functionality as well
as the social context, saying that the technology has to be
purposeful and relevant to the situation, or people won't bother
wearing it.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders 300 Planes Home after Yugoslav Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
authorized the return of more than 300 of the U.S. aircraft which
participated in the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia to their home
bases.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen said NATO Supreme Commander
Gen. Wesley Clark would decide on details of the redeployment.
However, Cohen added that the first planes, as well as some
reserves called up for the campaign, could start returning as
early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The first wave of returning aircraft will include B-1 and B-52
bombers and F-117 stealth fighters
</P>
<P>
The secretary, who returned Sunday from a tour of the region,
told a Pentagon news conference that the crews of the planes
"helped to make airpower history."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that 47,000 Serb troops have left Kosovo in the past
11 days, taking with them 800 tanks, armored personnel carriers
and artillery pieces.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is well on its way toward meeting its goals of getting
the Serb forces out, getting NATO peacekeepers in and getting the
refugees back home," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
However, Cohen admitted that the peace-keeping operation ahead
is still very difficult. "Hatred does not heal quickly...Our
troops and the people of Kosovo still face a very daunting task in
the months ahead."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Homeownership Rate Hits 66.3 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Spurred by the lowest mortgage
interest and low unemployment rates since the 1960s, national
homeownership soared in 1998 and probably will continue increasing
for the next decade, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
The study, released Monday by the Harvard University's Joint
Center for Housing Studies, found that about 1.8 million homes
have been built each year since 1996, and that the national
homeownership rate reached 66.3 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
"The state of housing in America is very, very good," Nicolas
Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies, was
quoted by the Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of the growth has occurred outside of cities and in the
South and the West, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that increases in immigration and in the number
of young or newly formed households will fuel a continued increase
in the housing market for the next decade. At the same time, baby
boomers becoming senior citizens are expected to help sustain the
home remodeling market as they revamp their homes, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
More members of minority groups are buying homes because of low
interest rates and specially tailored mortgage loan programs, the
study found. Minority households now account for 30 percent of
first-time homebuyers, up from 19 percent in 1985, the report
said.

He urged local people to take the issue of environment
protection very seriously and to completely desist from
cultivating in wetlands.

<HEADLINE> PLO Backs UAE's Position on Gulf Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) said here on Monday that
the Palestinians back the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on its
dispute with Iran over three Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) took a firm position
on the issue, said Mahmoud Abbas, Secretary-General of PLO's
Executive Committee, who is on a visit to the UAE.
</P>
<P>
"We support the UAE's peaceful approaches of solving the issue
through negotiations or referring the dispute to the
International Court of Justice," Abbas was quoted by the official
WAM news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after meeting with UAE Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Abbas said
their talks covered bilateral ties and current issues in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he briefed Sheikh Hamdan on the results of
the May Israeli elections and the efforts being made to form a new
Israeli cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The three islands, Abu Musa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs, located
near strategic shipping lanes in the Gulf, are claimed by both the
UAE and Iran but have been occupied by Iran since 1971, when
Britain withdrew from the region.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has just solved a quarrel with its Gulf ally Saudi
Arabia, who recently improved ties with Iran. The UAE had required
Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies, such as Qatar, Bahrain, Oman
and Kuwait, to link relations with Iran to the solution of the
islands issue.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of Israel's
Shas party reiterated on Monday night that the party's joining in
the new government is conditioned on whether it will hold the
portfolio of the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak,
outgoing Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli Ishai told
reporters that Shas did not give up its demand for the position.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere of his meeting with Barak was good and the two
sides will continue the negotiations over forming the government.
</P>
<P>
Other Shas officials said that the talks with Barak are
critical in the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Barak is trying to bring Shas into a broad-based government, as
the powerful religious party won 17 seats in the May elections and
became the third-largest party in the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
But Yisrael Baaliya Party, which represents the interests of
the Russian immigrants, has accused Shas of blocking the
immigration from Russia and wants to control the ministry itself.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Baaliya got six seats in the elections, and was Barak's
first choice to be a member of his coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Baliya leader Natan Sharansky threatened to walk out
of the coalition should Shas be offered the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Senior sources in the One Israel coalition led by Barak have
said that a compromise could be reached between Shas and Yisrael
Baaliya over the issue.
</P>
<P>
They said that as long as Shas does not hold on to the
Interior Ministry, Sharansky will agree to give it up and take
the Housing Ministry instead.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Pledges to Continue Servicing $8Bln </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania pledged Monday to
continue servicing the eight-billion-U.S. dollar external debts to
sustain its credibility to the donor community, a statement from
the State House said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that President Benjamin Mkapa will remain
committed to paying the external debts to ensure a reliable flow
of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
"President Mkapa is very much concerned about the debt relief
to ensure that developing countries including Tanzania have a
respite in debt servicing to enable them better provision of
social services," it said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania established the Multilateral Debt Relief Fund (MDF)
last year aimed at lessening the serving of the external debt and
ensuring better provision of social services.
</P>
<P>
Several less developed countries including Uganda, Mozambique,
Guinea Bissau and Bolivia have also started the same fund to
ensure better provision of social services.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Tanzanian Finance Ministry show that a
total of 50.4 billion Tanzanian shillings (one U.S. dollar equals
some 710 Tanzanian shillings) have already been pledged to support
the fund.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that during his meeting with the visiting
Managing Director and Corporation Secretary of the World Bank
Zhang Shengman Saturday, Mkapa said that Tanzania, a
highly-indebted poor country (HIPC), is facing difficulties in
servicing external debts.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa appealed to the World Bank to assist Tanzania to attain
debt relief within a shorter time frame under the HIPC initiative.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's commitment to servicing the external debts
encouraged the donors to cancel a total of 700 billion Tanzanian
shillings in debt in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa asked the World Bank to consider Tanzania's request
following its successful implementation of a three-year economic
reform program put forward by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Zhang commended Tanzania for its impressive performance in
regard to economic reform program, promising to cooperate with
Tanzania in marketing its agricultural potential.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has actively supported Tanzania's economic
development efforts by financing more than 130 projects since the
1960s.

NAIROBI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone People's Democratic
League (PDL), a political party in exile, has declared its total
support for the formation of an "interim government of inclusion"
in Sierra Leone, the Ghana News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is the only path to bring lasting peace and security in
Sierra Leone" , said a statement issued in Ghanaian capital Accra
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The statement signed by Alimamy Bakarr Sankoh, chairman and
leader of the party added that "our belief is that no military
solution but only negotiations through the on-going Lome talks can
bring the untold sufferings of our neglected people to an
immediate end".
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean government and the rebels are holding talks
aimed at ending the blood bath in the west African country in
Togolese capital Lome.
</P>
<P>
The party in exile called for the reinstatement of the Sierra
Leonean army as the only constitutional body responsible for
defending the country' s national sovereignty and the holding of
"free, fair, honest, transparent and participatory elections."
</P>
<P>
It condemned the on-going campaign in Sierra Leonean capital
Freetown against the formation of the interim government,
describing the action as " criminal, selfish and a declaration of
war against peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
The statement said any parliamentarian who would sit in "any
impeachment discussions" against President Tejan Kabbah for
accepting an interim government "will be considered an enemy of
Sierra Leonean society and will be treated as such."

cooperation in peace-keeping between the U.N., the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and the SADC.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. welcomes the establishment of the center. Young men
and women will come to this center to be groomed as competent and
resourceful peace- keepers in the multiple dimensions that
comprise today's peace-keeping," he said.
</P>
<P>
Miyet said peace-keeping has become complex and
multi-dimensional in nature and the U.N. depends on member states
to provide both military and civilian personnel.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. could no longer carry the burden of peace-keeping
alone and needed regional organizations to help carry out the
responsibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation between the U.N. and regional organizations has
become the hallmark of today's peace-keeping, " he noted.

<HEADLINE> Angola,Two Congos to Join Hands for Common Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Interior Minister Fernando
da Piedade Dias dos Santos said Monday that his country will join
hands with two Congos to ensure stability and security along their
common borders.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Angola, Congo (Brazzaville) and Congo (Kinshasa)
have set out to establish a joint police force to ensure stability
and security along their common borders by reinforcing check
points, concerting patrols and coordinating military operations.
</P>
<P>
The interior ministers of the three countries held a meeting in
Kinshasa recently, reaching an agreement on cooperation among
their police forces.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, priorities are given to preventing
the rebels from launching attacks from the land of the other
country. And the three countries will also take measures to curb
the smuggling of arms, diamonds and illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Angola has a 2,000-km common border with Congo (K), the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). For long, the rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has been using
its bases in the DRC. Recently, the UNITA forces established
alliance with the rebels there.
</P>
<P>
Angola shares common border with Congo (B), the Republic of
Congo, in its northern enclave Cabinda Province. The separatists
frequently launch attacks on the petroleum-rich province from the
border.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government of President Denis Sassou-Nguesso
also hopes to win support from the Angolan army in quenching the
rebellion in his country.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Parties Satisfied With G-8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Most Greek Cypriot parties Monday
expressed satisfaction with the reference to Cyprus in the G-8
summit statement issued Sunday in Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 (seven most industrialized nations plus Russia)
statement urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in accordance
with relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions to invite the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders to negotiations in the fall of
1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the parties also expressed reservations with the
reference included in the G-8 statement that "all issues (will
be) on the table."
</P>
<P>
Ruling right-wing DISI party leader Nicos Anastasiades
expressed satisfaction with the fact that the G-8 countries are
interested in the Cyprus issue and are becoming active.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Cyprus issue remains within the
U.N. framework and a settlement will be based on the Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition party AKEL parliamentary representative Andreas
Christou said the reference to the U.N. resolutions on Cyprus is
positive.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that other references could allow the Turkish
side to place its unacceptable condition for a confederation in
Cyprus on the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
President of center-right DIKO Spyros Kyprianou said the
statement proves that the G-8 will become involved in efforts for
a settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said that even though the reference has some positive
aspects it includes some points which must be clarified.
</P>
<P>
Similar views were expressed by the socialist EDEK leader,
Vasos Lyssarides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Environment Minister
Bernardo Ferraz Monday urged to avoid clashes over the management,
utilization and development of the natural resources shared by the
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Ferraz made the call at a regional workshop on African natural
resources in Mozambican capital Maputo, the Mozambican News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that there might be regional conflicts
over natural resources unless the African countries coordinate
their steps in the management, use and development of these
resources.
</P>
<P>
He cited water as one of the most important resources which may
possibly cause conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that various countries sharing common waters
should coordinate their policies on the management, use and
development of the resources.
</P>
<P>
The sectors most likely to fall victim to such clashes include
agriculture and energy, Ferraz was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
At the workshop, Ebenizario Chonguica, representative of the
World Conservation Union in Mozambique, also urged the African
countries to protect the natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from South Africa, Kenya, Zambia, Malawi, Namibia,
Botswana, Zimbabwe, Angola and Finland and some non-governmental
organizations attended the seminar to be closed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Land and population, forest and wild life and mineral resources
and energy will also be addressed at the workshop.

<P>
PARIS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- France's new Gaullist party, the
Rally for France (RPF), Monday elected its founder Charles Pasqua
as its president.
</P>
<P>
Charles Pasqua, who was interior minister in the former
conservative government of Edouard Balladur, established the RPF
after the European Parliament election on June 13.
</P>
<P>
The RPF won 13 percent of the votes in the election, the second
biggest win after the Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
Pasqua, who is often called "sovereigntyist" for his opposition
to France's adherence to the European single currency and a wider
European political integrity, caused a mini-earthquake to the
French rightwing by breaking away from the Rally for the Republic
(RPR) of President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The new RPF leader also opposed France's participation in the
NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
His close associate, former RPR parliament deputy Philippe de
Villiers, was elected the vice president of RPF.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM: Uzbek Mistrust of Turkey Baseless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit Monday dismissed as baseless suspicions raised by
Uzbekistan that Turkey provides support and shelter for Uzbek
anti-government forces.
</P>
<P>
"The suspicions and concerns of Uzbek President Islam Karimov
are unfounded," Ecevit told reporters, adding that Turkey attaches
great importance to its relations with Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
"I can not accept that bilateral relations are harmed because
of such a sensitivity," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He played down suggestions that the schools opened in
Uzbekistan by Turkish religious leader Fethullah Gulen, who faces
charges of anti-secularism, had fueled the tension between Ankara
and Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is the reason...I think there is an
unnecessary mistrust, " Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan's apparent conviction that Uzbek dissidents have
received support and shelter from Turkey has led to a severe
diplomatic crisis between the two countries, with Ankara recalling
its ambassador to Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
The tension erupted after two Uzbek dissidents, suspected of
participating in a February assassination attempt on Karimov,
surfaced in Istanbul and Ankara did not proceed with their
extradition as quickly as Tashkent demanded.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, the Uzbek authorities have decided to close
down more than 20 Turkish schools in their country and have
ordered the immediate return of 220 Uzbek students studying in
Turkish universities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Six Iraqi civilians were injured
Monday in U.S. and British warplanes attacks on civilian
facilities, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 16:20 (1220 GMT), 16 formations of
enemy warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated
southern Iraqi airspace over Basra, Misan, Thi-Qar and Muthana
provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy planes attacked some civil service installations,
leaving six civilians injured, said the spokesman, adding that
Iraqi air defenses counter-attacked the enemy planes and forced
them to flee to their bases.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 11:05 (0705 GMT), eight formations
of enemy planes coming from a Turkish air base violated northern
Iraqi airspace over Neineva, Dohuk and Erbil provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy planes bombed some civilian facilities in this
region, said the spokesman. No casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq
last December, their warplanes have made 1,695 and 7,275 sorties
over the northern and southern no-fly zones respectively, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting
the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.

<HEADLINE> Preparatory Meetings on Congo (K) Start in Lusaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Preparatory meetings on the signing
of a cease-fire in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) started
here Monday with rebel delegation expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Zambian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
confirmed that delegates from the countries concerned had started
arriving here for a series of meetings that would culminate into
the heads of state summit on June 26.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the ministers of defense meeting would be
held on June 23 and rebels fighting to oust DRC President Laurent
Kabila are expected to participate in all the meetings.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Zambian government was still waiting for
confirmations from Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, the
DRC and other countries and world bodies before the ministers of
defence meeting could start.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who is spearheading the
peace initiative, has already invited former South Africa
President Nelson Mandela, former Tanzanian President Julius
Nyerere and former Botswanan President Ketumile Masire to witness
the signing of the peace documents.
</P>
<P>
Invitation had also been extended to Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Salim Ahmed Salim, the United
Nations and Gabonese President Omar Bongo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Lusaka International Airport shortly before
departure for Blantyre, Malawi, to attend the swearing-in ceremony
of re-elected President Bakili Muluzi Monday morning, Chiluba said
that the latest demands by DRC rebels would be discussed during
negotiations after Saturday' s signing of a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that they (DRC rebels) will try and push things
out of context. It is not the chair that will look in their
demands, but it is what will take place in the negotiating
process," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president is scheduled to host the summit, during
which a cease-fire is expected to be signed by all the
belligerents in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
He has been mandated by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC)

to lead the cease-fire initiative aimed at ending the 11-month
conflict in the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
But the rebels have given a set of demands which they say must
be met before they agree to sign the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Among the demands are that DRC President Kabila's forces should
stop bombing civilian targets, release political prisoners and
agree to hold direct talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The rebel delegation led by Emile Ilunga, President of the
Congolese Rally for Democracy is in Lusaka to meet Chiluba and to
take part in preparatory talks ahead of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Zambian government officials said that the 10-man rebel team
included former Congolese Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha and other
senior members of the political and military wings of the rebel
movement.

UNITED NATIONS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday requested
that the United Nations intervene in U.S. spying activities in the
country so as to bring a halt to this practice in the interests of
safeguarding the reputation of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said the United states was persisting in
its unlawful and immoral interference in Iraq's internal affairs
by sending agents of its intelligence services who used the U.N.
agencies working in Iraq as a cover for their activities as spies.
</P>
<P>
"At other times, it sends agents through northern Iraq to
infiltrate the country in order to carry out acts of espionage
and sabotage," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
"The persistence of the United States Administration in
blatantly interfering in Iraq internal affairs and its use of
the United Nations agencies as a cover for its interference is
a flagrant violation of the spirit and letter of the Charter of
the United Nations and of the norms and percepts of
international law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It constitutes an attempt to destroy the reputation of the
United Nations as an international organization together with
the good name of its personnel, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Prime Minister requested the U.N. chief that he
intervene to ensure the representatives and personnel of the
United Nations agencies and bodies do not cooperate with these
spies and informers.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Reiterates Support for Holding Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh
Mohamed Bin Mubarak reiterated on Monday his country's support for
the idea of holding an all-out Arab summit proposed recently by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Bin Mubarak made the statement after a meeting with Arab
League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid. The Bahraini official
arrived in Cairo earlier in the day to accompany Emir Sheikh Hamad
Bin Isa al-Khalifa in a visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Bin Mubarak, meanwhile, called for full preparations for
the possible summit in a bid to achieve tangible results to
enhance Arab solidarity and forge a united Arab stance on the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following the victory of Ehud Barak, moderate leader of
Israel's Labor Party, in his country's elections last month,
Mubarak proposed with Moroccan King Hassan II during a recent
visit to the North African country that a summit be held to
coordinate and adopt a unified stance toward the peace talks with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The possible summit should also discuss other key issues
related to the Arab world, including restoring Arab solidarity,
Mubarak maintained.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Bin Mubarak said he also discussed with Abdel-Meguid the
issues on the agenda of the Arab Foreign Ministers Council due to
meet in September. The Arab countries convene meetings of the
council in March and September each year.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the coming meetings would reach the
required settlement of several pressing Arab issues which he did
not elaborate.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday expressed concern over the situation in Congo (K) and
expressed the hope to see a successful outcome of the peace talks,
scheduled for June 26 in the Zambian capital of Lusanka.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement read to the press, the president of the
Security Council, Ismaila Jane of Gambia, said, "The members of
the Security Council expressed concern over the situation there
and expressed the hope for a successful outcome" of the planned
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council is preparing a statement on this issue
for adoption within a week," he said.
</P>
<P>
The press statement came after the 15-nation Security Council
met in a closed-door session to hear the briefing on the political
situation in the African country by Moustapha Niasse, the U.N.
special envoy for the Democratic Republic of Congo, also known as
Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The briefing coincided with the preparation for the peace
talks, slated for Wednesday in Lusaka, capital of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The rebels took up arms in August last year in a bid to topple
the Congo (K) Government, headed by President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda back the rebels while Kabila has won military
support from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the mediation by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba,
the parties to the conflict have agreed to send ministers to
Lusaka on Wednesday for talks that would include rebels, and the
warring parties' presidents would meet without rebels on Saturday
to sign a ceasefire accord, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba's concept of peace, if achieved, would require the
costly deployment of United Nations peacekeepers. The plan
involves a ceasefire between Congo, its allies and Rwanda and
Uganda, and a separate one between Kingshasa and the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Outlines Conditions for Resuming Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a
statement Monday that the acknowledgment of the existence of
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" is the only way to the
resumption of bilateral talks in the long-divided Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The ministry issued the statement in response to Sunday's call
of the G-8 summit for the resumption of talks in Cyprus with no
preconditions in the upcoming autumn.
</P>
<P>
The seven most industrialized countries plus Russia (G-8)
stressed in their summit held in Cologne, Germany, that the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot communities should be committed "in good faith
to continue to negotiate until a settlement is reached."
</P>
<P>
And leaders of the G-8 hinted that the November summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
Istanbul, Turkey, should be a deadline for a conclusion of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "instead of forcing the parties to
negotiate under a definite timetable, the reasons for the failure
of previous talks should be carefully examined and an appropriate
atmosphere and basis should be created for productive talks."
</P>
<P>
It added that any negotiation process will be doomed to fail if
the parameters are not determined on the basis of realities on the
island and if the present lack of confidence is not eradicated.
</P>
<P>
"At present, there are two equal sovereign and democratic
states in Cyprus which represent the two peoples there," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that "a solution to the problem can be durable
only if it is outlined not by the third parties but by these two
states and if it maintains the balance between Turkey and Greece."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Monday welcomed the end
of war in Yugoslavia but reiterated its condemnation of NATO for
its armed adventure that flouted the generally recognized norms
and principles of international law, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"It has been our consistent position that the Kosovo issue has
no military solution and (we have) called on all sides to look for
a way out of the crisis only by political means through
negotiations," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"From the start of NATO's aggression against Yugoslavia, our
country strongly condemned it and pressed for an immediate end to
armed violence. The Russian side exerted maximum effort to stop
the air strikes on the territory of Yugoslavia and return the
process of Kosovo settlement to the political footing," Tass
quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the NATO aggression caused catastrophic
consequences. "Yugoslavia has been completely ruined. The damage
caused to its national economy and infrastructure exceeds all
destruction during World War II."
</P>
<P>
"Now top priority tasks are the deployment in Kosovo of an
international civilian presence and a security presence under the
U.N. auspices, the resumption of talks on political settlement
with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of work is to be done to restore the Yugoslav economy,
including in Kosovo, and other countries in the region," the
statement said. "Russia will actively cooperate in this with all
interested sides."

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Extends Contract Probe to 1970s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
Monday ordered to extend a probe of the unfinished projects
tracing back to the year 1976 to cover his own tenure as the Head
of State then.
</P>
<P>
At the inauguration of a 12-member probe panel in Nigerian
capital Abuja, Obasanjo announced the decision in response to
criticism for the probe.
</P>
<P>
He said the extension, to cover his tenure between 1976 and
1979 and that of second republic president Alhaji Shagari from
1979 to 1984, should "help allay fears that this is not a probe."
</P>
<P>
The president said that the original 14-year-mandate from 1984
has been "misconstrued as a probe" of governments after the
military takeover in 1984.
</P>
<P>
"This is far from the objective, which is to provide an
inventory of uncompleted projects, supplies and services," said
Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The panel would investigate hundreds of contracts, including
the abandoned presidential villa in Abuja, which were awarded and
in some cases paid for without completion.
</P>
<P>
It would also determine whether due process was followed in
their award and advise the government.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is time to turn our attention to critical
economic issues affecting our policy including that of such
projects," said Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The panel has nine months to complete its work, three months
shorter than in its original mandate.

<HEADLINE> Interior Ministers of Western Mediterranean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The interior ministers of the
Western Mediterranean countries gathered here Monday for a two-day
conference.
</P>
<P>
Interior ministers from Algeria, Spain, France, Libya, Italy,
Morocco, Portugal and Tunisia attended the meeting, the fifth of
its kind.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will discuss combating organized crimes,
narcotics, illegal immigration, and cooperation in the areas of
civil defense and local communities, the Algerian News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Opening the conference, Algerian Minister of Interior, Local
Collectivities and Environment Abdul-Malik Sallal said the meeting
shows the member countries' collective will to continue the
regional cooperation that started several years ago.
</P>
<P>
On Algeria's anti-terrorism campaign over the recent years,
Sallal said efforts are being made to fight terrorism and to curb
its spread.
</P>
<P>
Algeria kept warning the international community against the
dangerous contagion of terrorism, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's continuous efforts to attract the world attention to
the danger of terrorism were not designed to derive mere
denunciation, but to establish bases for regional cooperation that
can help uproot terrorism completely within the framework of law
and international pacts, Sallal noted.
</P>
<P>
The first conference of interior ministers of the Western
Mediterranean countries was held in January, 1995, in Tunis.
</P>
<P>
The second conference was held in Morocco in April, 1996, the
third in France in April, 1996 and the fourth in Italy in May,
1998.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Court Rejects Vanunu's Appeal for Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel's High Court rejected an
appeal for early release of Mordechai Vanunu, who is serving an
18-year sentence for disclosing Israel's nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
Vanunu said in his first appeal that he should be allowed to
return to Italy after 13 years in jail, according to Israel
Channel One. The court rejected the appeal.
</P>
<P>
Vanunu, a former technician at Israel's Dimona nuclear plant,
was abducted from Italy to Israel reportedly by Israeli agents in
1986 after telling Britain's Sunday Times newspaper that Israel
had more than 200 atomic bombs.
</P>
<P>
However, the court accepted his second appeal, agreeing to make
public parts of the judgements or protocols in his case, which
have never been released.
</P>
<P>
The documents might be publicized Tuesday after the state
prosecutor and security officials decide Monday night which parts
should be deleted, the television report said.
</P>
<P>
Vanunu, 44, was taken out of solitary confinement last
year. His lawyer said Monday that his mental health has been
improved since then, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In order to keep a vague deterrent force, Israel carries out a
"don't ask, don't tell" policy on its nuclear programs, never
confirming nor denying any reports on these programs.

LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's health farms on Monday
declared themselves opposed to genetically modified (GM)
foodstuffs, saying they would work towards eliminating such foods
from their menus.
</P>
<P>
The Health Farms of Ireland Association said in a statement its

health risks associated with GM foods and by the apparent failure
of governments to implement adequate safeguards, according to a
Reuters report.
</P>

"For this reason the association has decided to declare itself
opposed to GM foods. It is our stated aim to serve food that is
completely GM-free," it said.
</P>
<P>
Consumer and other groups, including the British Medical
Association, have called for a moratorium on GM crop planting
until scientists agree they are safe.

<HEADLINE> Proposed IMF Gold Sale Lamented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Proposals for the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to sell 10 percent of its gold
to assist debt relief among the world's poorest countries "are
flawed", the World Gold Council (WGC) said in a press release here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The recent fall in the price of gold as a direct consequence
of the plans of the IMF, Switzerland and the United Kingdom to
sell gold, has already lost these developing nations more than 150
million U.S. dollars in annual export earnings," the release said.
</P>
<P>
"This is more than they stand to gain from the IMF's proposed
sale of 10 percent of its gold reserves," it noted.
</P>
<P>
The impact of these potential sales has raised concerns
world-wide and led the WGC to commission a study by independent
economists into the effect of such sales on the economies of
gold-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
The 80-page study, entitled "A Glittering Future?", sets out
the role gold plays in the macro-economic life of many of the
world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
The study says that these countries are just beginning to
broaden their export base, away from dependency upon one or two
agricultural commodities and toward industrial growth, assisted by
their embryonic gold mining industries.
</P>
<P>
Gold mining has helped boost not only their export revenues but
also played an important part in strengthening their legal,
financial and economic development.
</P>
<P>
"This process is now threatened by the falling gold price," the
report says.
</P>
<P>
Of the 41 heavily-indebted poor countries, or HIPCs, more than
30 are gold producers or potential producers. In nine of them,
gold accounts for at least five percent of export revenues and in
other two of them for more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Annual gold production in the HIPCs is set to be 200 tons in
the year 2000. In global terms, this may not sound much, slightly
less than 10 percent of annual global production, but for the
countries concerned this is an important contribution to export
and tax revenues," Gary Mead, head of Research at the WGC, told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
At 280 U.S. dollars an ounce, projected export earnings for
these countries from gold would total 1.66 billion dollars by the
end of 2000, according to Mead.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with 10 years ago, there is now a large gap between
supply (mine production) and demand (mostly jewellery)," he said.
"In order to help fill this gap, gold mining would provide solid
and viable export growth for these countries if it were not for
the damaging impact of major threats from official sales."
</P>
<P>
The researcher said the WGC argues that leaders of the G-7
countries should refrain from approving the gold sales for two
essential reasons:
</P>
<P>
-- The IMF's proposed sale of 10 million ounces (311 tons) has
already (in conjunction with other official sector sales)
adversely affected the international price of gold, and thus has
inadvertently damaged the economic development of many of those
countries the HIPC initiative aims to assist;
</P>
<P>
-- The IMF proposes to invest the proceeds (about 2.3 billion
dollars) from the gold sale, and use a proportion of the yield on
that to help fund debt relief. If invested in U.S. government
bonds the interest may amount to some five percent a year, about
110 million dollars. Thus the benefit of the sale (110 million
dollars a year ) has already been more than offset by the economic
cost, a loss of more than 150 million dollars annually as a result
of the fall in the gold price.
</P>
<P>
"Without careful reconsideration of the damage which has
already been done to the fledgling gold mining industry of many of
the world's poorest countries by the threat of gold sales, their
glittering future may be still- born," the WGC press release said.
</P>
<P>
"The World Gold Council calls upon all official gold holders,
including the UK, to consider the consequences for the poorest
gold producing countries when planning any sales," it said.

<HEADLINE> Bahraini Emir Arrives in Egypt for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa
al-Khalifa said on Monday that his visit to Egypt is part of the
continued coordination between the two countries on bilateral ties
and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad made the remarks upon his arrival at the Cairo
International Airport for his first visit to Egypt after he
assumed power in March after the death of his father.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that he will follow his father's suit in
strengthening ties with Egypt, Sheikh Hamad said his meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak will augur well and hopefully turn for the
interests of Bahrain, Egypt, and the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
The constant changes on the international and Arab arenas
"necessitate intensifying meetings and consultations among Arab
brothers" in a bid to reach coordination and cooperation, which
will help realize the supreme national and joint interests, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Following the victory of Ehud Barak, moderate leader of
Israel's Labor Party, in his country's elections on May 17, Arabs
are talking about holding a summit to coordinate stances on the
Mideast peace process. Bahrain has expressed support for the
proposal put forward recently by Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"Restoring and deepening Arab solidarity should be a priority
in this stage of the Arab national march, a stage that calls on
all of us to stand up to surrounding challenges," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini emir voiced appreciation for Egypt's role in
supporting his country's development at all levels, saying that he
was satisfied with the achievements made by the two countries in
the economic and trade cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday Met in a closed-door session to hear the briefing by a U.N.
special envoy for the Democratic Republic of Congo, also known as
Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Moustapha, Niasse, the U.N. special envoy for Congo (K), began
the briefing to the 15 Security Council members at about 11:00 EST.
</P>
<P>
The briefing coincided with the preparation for the peace
talks, slated for Wednesday in Lusaka, capital of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The rebels took up arms in August last year in a bid to topple
the Congo (K) Government, headed by President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda back the rebels while Kabila has won military
support from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the mediation by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba,
the parties to the conflict have agreed to send ministers to
Lusaka on Wednesday for talks that would include rebels, and the
warring parties' presidents would meet without rebels on Saturday
to sign a ceasefire accord, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba's concept of peace, if achieved, would require the
costly deployment of United Nations peacekeepers. The plan
involves a ceasefire between Congo, its allies and Rwanda and
Uganda, and a separate one between Kingshasa and the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Withdraw Some Forces From Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Monday it intended
to withdraw some air forces and naval ships from the Serbian
province of Kosovo as the NATO air campaign was over.
</P>
<P>
"RAF (the Royal Air Force of the United Kingdom) air and ground
crews will soon be coming home to their loved ones and so will be
some of the Royal Navy ships which have been on station for so
long in the Adriatic," Defense Secretary George Robertson told a
news briefing.
</P>
<P>
But he did not give any details, stressing that there would
still be NATO aircraft and ships available in that region.
</P>
<P>
"We have not dropped our guard. NATO will still act if it is
provoked," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
During various stages of the Kosovo crisis, Britain had
deployed a total of 13,000 military personnel in the region.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Britain decided to send 60 armed police officers to
Kosovo to "help form a new police force" as part of efforts to
rebuild the shattered province.
</P>
<P>
NATO's devastating bombardment of Serbian targets killed nearly
1,000 civilians and caused the exodus of a large number of
refugees.
