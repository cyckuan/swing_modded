<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 28 (Xinhua)-- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin on Saturday called on economic sectors of China and Japan to
look to the future and strive to open new fields for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon sponsored by Japanese economic bodies,
Jiang said the establishment of friendly and cooperative
relationship between China and Japan has provided a new wide space
for the two countries to expand economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He held that the two countries can further boost cooperation
in the aspects of hi-tech and industrial technology, environmental
protection, and economic development of the central west of China.

Through joint efforts by the two countries for generations,
economic and trade cooperation between China and Japan has enjoyed
great development, said Jiang.

A steadily developing cooperation framework of various forms
has been established on a mutually beneficial and complementary
basis, Jiang said, noting each country has become an important

<HEADLINE> Elephant Conservationists Demand Return of Elephants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Elephant conservation groups
from Bangkok and several provinces have been gathering in front of
the Government House in the past two days to demand the quick
return of five Thai elephants from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The groups, bringing with them nine elephants, lodged a letter
with Prime Minister's Office Minister Suphatra Masdit, calling on
the Thai Government to urge for the return from Indonesia after a
delay of nine months, Thai News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They demanded a reply from the government in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Sompas Meepan, one of the conservationists, said 80 elephants
would storm the Government House if the Government ignored the
demand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand sent the five elephants to Indonesia in 1997 to help
the latter's forest officials gather wild elephants in Sumatra's
woods. In return, Indonesia promised to pay 600 U.S. dollars per
elephant each month for the service. However, the promise is not
honored due to Indonesia's financial turmoil
</P>
<P>
Thai mahouts have already returned from Indonesia to Thailand
after they were not paid. However, they left the animals there as
they could not afford the return of the pachyderms.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chen Gang, Santoso for Men's Singles Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Chen Gang produced
the biggest upset of the on-going Hong Ta Hong Kong Open
Badminton Championships by ousting Denmark's world number one
Peter Gade Christensen in the men's singles semi-final here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the championship final Sunday afternoon, Chen is to face
Indonesia's Budi Santoso who downed Malaysia's Rashid Sidek in
the other semi-final on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Chen, winner at the Asian championships in
September in Bangkok, ousted top-seeded Christensen 15-10, 15-9
in 58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who has been competing with a twisted ankle since his
opening match on Thursday, obviously annoyed the hot-favored Dane
with his persistent game.
</P>
<P>
Christensen became too anxious especially after losing the
first game and made one error after another in his stormy smashes.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese pulled away after they tied 3-3 and never gave up
the lead. The victory was a compensation to his loss to
Christensen at last year's China Open in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"Peter is a very strong player but I won the match today
because I managed to hang on there," an excited Chen said after
the win. He also thanked the partisan crowd for their
encouragement during the competition.
</P>
<P>
Santoso downed Sidek 15-5, 15-4, to qualify for the final.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's top-seeded Camilla Martin and Lidya Djaelawuaya from
Indonesia qualified for the women's singles final after their
respective semi-final victories on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
World number two Martin won over Ling Wan Ting of Hong Kong,
China 11-4, 11-8 and Djaelawuaya downed Chan Ya-ling of Chinese
Taipei 11-6, 13-10.
</P>

MAPUTO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 Mozambicans
have died of various kinds of diarrhoea as a result of cholera,
dysentery, or food poisoning since the end of last September.
</P>
<P>
Avertino Barreto, assistant director of the National Health
Bureau, disclosed this here Friday, saying 160 deaths were
reported in Cabo Delgado and Nampula provinces in north
Mozambique, 36 in Zambezia Province in the central part of the
country, 4 in Tete Province in the northwest and two others in
the capital Maputo City.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports Saturday, about 4,000 people
have suffered diarrhoea in these localities, of which 99 patients
were sent to hospitals in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Barreto blamed the increasing diarrhoea patients on warm
weather and more rainfall which give rise to overflowing dirty
water and flies.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Astronomers Detect New Planet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Swiss astronomers at the
European Southern Observatory in Chile said that they had
detected evidence of another new planet orbiting a star outside
our solar system.
</P>
<P>
According to Washington Post, the new planet is believed to
be circling one of a pair of stars in the southern constellation
Eridanus. Known as Gliese 86, the star is a bit smaller and
dimmer than the sun, but because it is so close in cosmic
terms-35 light-years, it can be seen with unaided eyes from Earth.
</P>
<P>
Although the new planet itself cannot be seen, the
astronomers believe it exists because planet 86 is wobbling in
space. More than dozen suspected planets outside our solar
system have been detected in the last three years, and most of
them have caused this same characteristic wobble in the stars
they orbit.
</P>
<P>
They said that the new planet could be as massive as Jupiter, the
largest planet orbiting our sun. The distance between the planet
and its star appears to be only about one-tenth the distance
between the Earth and sun.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Refutes Statement of GCC Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Sunday refuted a
statement made by secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) to the effect that Iraq's adherence to its
commitments was central to security in the gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the statement, Iraq's Foreign Undersecretary
Nabeel Najim said the GCC secretary-general "spoke in vague
terms, particularly when he said that the security in the Gulf
depended on Iraq's adherence to its obligations."
</P>
<P>
GCC Secretary-General Jamil al-Hijilan on November 27 also
said that Iraq's implementation of the U.N. Security Council
Resolutions was a fundamental prelude on the path to achieve
regional security.
</P>
<P>
Najim, former Iraqi representative to the Arab League, said
that al-Hijilan's "ill-chosen words suggested that Iraq did not
respect its commitments regarding U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"In fact Iraq, as it had officially stated many times in
letters sent to the Security Council, the U.N. secretary-general
and the Arab countries, had indeed honored its obligations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This made it incumbent on the Security Council to meet its
reciprocal commitments towards Iraq," he added.
</P>
<P>
Najim said that "in his statement, al-Hijilan completely
avoided reference to the American hegemony and the U.S. buildup
in the Gulf," asking that "isn't it strange for al-Hijilan to
ignore the threats posed by America to security in the Gulf?"
</P>
<P>
He said "the security of the Arab gulf is the responsibility of
its people and not that of foreign forces who exploit all for
their own interests."
</P>
<P>
Iraq was defeated by the U.S.-led allied forces in the 1991
Gulf War, which liberated Kuwait, a member state of the six-member
GCC, from Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
Suffering from the eight-year-old, crippling U.N. sanctions,
Baghdad has long demanded that the U.S. and British forces in the
Gulf be pulled out from this region.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier on Medical Insurance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Li Lanqing
has called for accelerating reform of the medical insurance system
for employees of urban enterprises, and the establishment of
a basic medical insurance system in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Li, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said that
reform of the medical insurance system for urban workers is
vital to reform as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In his closing address to a national working conference on
reform of the medical insurance system for urban workers, he
said that the medical insurance system constitutes an important
part of the social security system and is part of the
infrastructural construction of the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that together with the pension system and the
unemployment insurance system, a new medical insurance system for
urban workers will form China's social security system
guaranteeing people's basic needs.
</P>
<P>
He called on speeding up reform of the medical and health care
system with major innovations including the separation of the
management of medical treatment from that of medical treatment
itself, and establishing a rational competition system for
medicine; deepening reform of administrative departments in
hospitals and clinics and reducing staff; lower costs and greater
efficiency; setting rational prices for medical services and
improving the quality of medical staffs, and developing community
medical services.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Wu Banguo said the reforms should guarantee the
basic medical needs of the urban employees and keep in line with
the actual conditions of China's preliminary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
He said that medical insurance fees should be jointly paid by
units and individuals with the establishment of social medical
funds and individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the social medical funds should be responsible
for the payment of large costs such as hospitalization, while the
individual accounts can be used for for small payments such as
diagnostic fees.

<HEADLINE> Arab Justice Ministers Council in Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The 14th session of the Arab
Justice Ministers Council opened here Sunday to discuss
outstanding legal issues, such as the anti-terrorism campaign and
unifying legislations, in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the two-day meeting, Algerian Justice
Minister Mohamed Adami said the most important achievement during
the previous session was the adoption of a resolution on convening
a joint meeting of the councils of Arab justice ministers and
interior ministers.
</P>
<P>
The joint meeting was held last April, in which the Arabs
signed their first ever anti-terrorism agreement, said Adami, who
chaired the last session, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian minister, whose country ratified the agreement on
November 7, expressed hope that other Arab countries would adopt
similar steps.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be further boosted with the efforts made by
more than 50 Islamic countries to hammer out a treaty on fighting
terrorism under the auspices of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, he added.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that the signatory parties should
cooperate closely in fighting terrorism, including exchanging
information on terrorist activities and extraditing terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The agreement opposes any possible attempts of the signatory
states to organize, finance, commit or take part in terrorist acts
against any other party in any way.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing session, attended by justice ministers from 14 Arab
countries, will discuss the establishment of a mechanism to carry
out the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The session will also touch on reports presented by the Arab
technical committees assigned to studying the possibility of
unifying the Arab legislations.

<HEADLINE> Village Autonomy Opens China's Future Democratization(2) By Li Nuer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's democratization has always been a fundamental social
problem attracting the attention of many Chinese with high ideals
over the past century, Wang said. "It is only since 1978 that
there has been a sound advance in China's democratization."
</P>
<P>
China first put in force the Electoral Law and the Organic Law
of the National People's Congress and the Local People's
Congresses at Different Levels in 1979, and promulgated the
Organic Law of the Villagers' Committee on a trial basis in 1987,
which was revised and adopted by the NPC Standing Committee in
November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the villagers' autonomy is a logical
result of political, economic and social reforms in China's rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Bai Gang, deputy director of the Politics Institute of the
CASS, said that the "household responsibility system" which began
in late 1970s marked a recognition of the role of the individual
peasant and the right of farmers to own property. It was actually
a harbinger of the end of the People's Commune system, Bai said.
</P>
<P>
"The process of the formation and development of villagers'
self-governance is one of the transition from 'rule by man' to
'rule by law' in China's rural society," Bai said.
</P>
<P>
The rules and regulations of villagers' self-governance have
also effectively pushed the township government to change in the
direction of "rule by law," Bai said.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of reforms and the expansion of social
autonomy, there must be a big improvement in government policy
processes, government conduct, and citizen participation and
governance, Bai said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Keping, director of the Contemporary Institute under the
Bureau of Compilation and Interpretation of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China also made a comment, saying that
villagers' autonomy indicated the future direction of China's
rural political development.
</P>
<P>
"To promote democracy at the grass-roots level is one of the
major political goals of the Communist Party of China and the
government," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Yu believes that a more advanced grass-roots democracy in rural
areas should be built at both township and village levels. As a
result, Yu said, the issue of how to improve democratic governance
at the township level will draw the close attention of officials
and political scientists.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on State Enterprise Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
said recently that the goal of helping China's losing large and
medium-sized state enterprises overcome their difficulties in
three years can be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection tour of northeast China's Liaoning
Province from November 23 to 27, he said that with the improvement
of the macroeconomic situation and the implementation of reform
measures in state-owned enterprises, some of the enterprises in
Liaoning Province have overcome their difficulties and are now
realizing a profit.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
said that Liaoning is one of the major industrial bases in
China. "If Liaoning can realize the objective of reform of
state-owned enterprises, the country can surely achieve this goal."
</P>
<P>
The difficulties faced by these enterprises are mainly the
result of overlapping construction according to low standards over
a long period of time, he said.
</P>
<P>
This problem led to surplus capacity in these enterprises, and
manufacturing at an insufficient working rate, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that this year the State Council is determined to stop
approving redundant projects and close down some enterprises which
have no hope of being salvaged.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, the state has adopted positive
financial policies to promote infrastructural construction, expand
domestic demand and stimulate consumption.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged the enterprises to enhance reforms, improve internal
management, and reduce the number of employees.
</P>
<P>
He said that the laid-off workers should be enlisted in the
enterprises' reemployment centers and their living expenses
should be provided for over a certain period of time.

Zhu said that this year the central government will allocate
eight billion yuan to support the localities in opening more
channels for laid-off workers, adding that by next year, the local
governments should have their own budgets for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
He said that the leaders of enterprises which suffer
losses for two years in succession must be removed from their
posts.
</P>
<P>
On the sale of small state-owned enterprises, he said that
sales should not be the sole way of reforming those enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said in some places sale of enterprises has been replaced
by a half-sale, half-giving method, which resulted in great losses
of assets of the state. "That should be stopped," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the reforms of the grain marketing system, Zhu said that the
policies of the central government sum up both positive and
negative experiences and agree with China's actual conditions.
</P>
<P>
He called for the autonomy of grain purchasing and
storing enterprises and turning these enterprises into entities
responsible for their profits and losses.
</P>
<P>
He urged local governments to protect farmers' interests and
enhance the management of the grain purchasing market, noting that
non-state grain purchasing and storing enterprises and private
grain sellers must be banned from directly buying grain from
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Ministers Urge Air Strikes Against Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Several Israeli cabinet
ministers on Sunday called for air strikes against Lebanese
civilian targets to avenge the killing of Israeli soldiers by
Islamic militant groups in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The ministers made the call before attending a meeting called
by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to assess the situation in
south Lebanon. The meeting, known as the security cabinet meeting,
will hear military and security chiefs report on the Lebanon
situation and formulate Israel's policy towards Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was convened after seven Israeli soliders were
killed in the self-styled security zone in south Lebanon over the
past two week.
</P>
<P>
The rising casualties caused growing concern among the Israelis
and nearly half of the Israeli population now prefer a unilateral
pullout from south Lebanon, although the idea was opposed by
military and intelligence brass.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was forced to cut short his trip to Europe Friday to
return home to reconsider Israel's policy towards Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, a hawkish member of the security
cabinet, supported the ideas of a one-sided pullout. He called in
April for a phased withdrawal, but said Lebanese government should
guarantee the security of Israel's north after Israeli evacuation.
</P>
<P>
If Lebanese government fails to prevent these attacks, he said,
Israel could target Lebanese civilian facilities, such as power
stations, water pumping facilities, bridges and roads.
</P>
<P>
Some other ministers Sunday expressed support for attacks on
Lebanon's civilian facilities in retaliation for the stepped-up
guerrilla campaign against Israeli occupation troops.
</P>
<P>
The attacks will prompt Beirut to send forces to rein in
activities of the pro-Iranian resistance group Hezbollah, or Party
of God, said Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani.
</P>
<P>
Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon with about 40,000
troops as peacekeepers there, will also do so, because it has
"expanding economic interests" in the post-civil war construction
in Beirut, he said.
</P>
<P>
What policy the government will adopt towards Lebanon remains
unclear right now. But the there was concern in the military that
Israeli air strikes against power stations and other facilities in
Lebanon would lead to an escalation of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense establishment, strongly opposing a
unilateral withdrawal from the security zone, is not in favor of
opening a new front against Syria in Lebanon either.
</P>
<P>
Israel's opposition leaders also argue that Syria will never
help stop the guerrilla warfare in south Lebanon until Israel
agrees to return the Golan Heights which it captured from Syria in
the 1967 Mideast War.

<HEADLINE> Thai Official Likely to Become WTO's New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi stands a better chance to become the new
director-general of the World Trade Organization (WTO), government
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors to the WTO will sound out the opinions of member
countries on the most suitable person for the post, and Supachai
will do well in the poll, said the officials, who refused to be
named.
</P>
<P>
Supachai's competitors include Roy Maclaren, former
international trade minister of Canada, Mike Moore, former prime
minister of New Zealand and Hassan Abouyoub, former trade minister
of Morocco. The term of the present WTO director-general, Renato
Ruggiero of Italy, expires in April.
</P>
<P>
Unless consensus is reached during the first round, a second
round is expected to take place, with one source not ruling out
the possibility of the 132 WTO members breaking with tradition and
calling a vote on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra, who chairs
the official campaigning committee, said most Asian countries had
pledged support for Supachai, concurrently commerce minister.

<HEADLINE> China's Steel Demand in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China's demand for steel
products is expected to reach 115 million tons in 2000 and
increase to 140 million tons in 2010, according to a China
Metallurgical Information and Research Center report.
</P>
<P>
The forecast was made in accordance with China's macroeconomic
policies and the law governing the development of the iron and
steel industry with the help of internationally recognized survey
methods, said experts at the center.
</P>
<P>
The report points out that although the current supply of
steel products is sufficient and the market seems a bit sluggish
in China, the ongoing readjustment of macroeconomic policies
will result in a drastic expansion of domestic demand,
which will trigger a rise in the price of steel products.
</P>
<P>
The report predicts that steel-product consumption will
keep growing in China between now and 2010.
</P>
<P>
One internationally recognized theory is that the output and
consumption grow when the per capita steel reserve is lower than
five tons, and the per capita steel reserve was one ton in China
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Another theory says that steel-product consumption can rise
sharply when the per capita value of the gross national products
is less than 1,500 U.S. dollars. China's per capita GNP value is
expected to be close to 800 dollars in 2000, and less than 1,500
U.S. dollars in 2010.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, there will be shortfalls in the
supply of crude steel and pig iron in the coming years, triggering
the demand to readjust product structure and rearrange new
construction.

<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Miss Wang Xuejun can feel
overseas investments in every aspect of her life. An increasingly
large portion of what she eats, wears and uses in her daily life
is produced by overseas-funded enterprises or imported from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Over 30-years-old, Wang works for a management organization in
an overseas-funded development zone in Suzhou in east China's
Jiangsu Province. After attending an exhibition on the use of
foreign investment in China over the past 20 years, she praised
the quality of these overseas-invested products, saying they have
become indispensable in her life.
</P>
<P>
Like Wang, today more and more Chinese are engaged in one way
or another with overseas-funded products.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded enterprises' products such as toothpaste and
brushes, food, drinks, shoes, suits, audio equipment, VCDs, all
can be found in Chinese families; and the taxis, cars and buses in
which they travel, are all produced by overseas-invested
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In the office, some kinds of paper, pens, computers and
telephones are made by overseas-funded companies.
</P>
<P>
Now Chinese who are enjoying these products and services
realize how far overseas investments have penetrated. Since
China's first joint-venture, Beijing Air Food Corporation Ltd.,
was set-up in April 1980, the number of overseas-funded businesses
in China has multiplied to over 320,000, involved in finance,
insurance, retail, trade, motor vehicles, information technology,
civil aviation, tourism, railway construction, agricultural
production and processing, and almost every other field. Now, only
a a small number of trades such as postal services are not open to
overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Navy Ships Recover Smuggled Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi navy ships have
recovered smuggled goods worth of about 4.6 million taka (about
94,850 U.S. dollars) and arrested 20 crew with seven mechanized
boats, the official news agency BSS reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi navy ship Shapla, during a recent routine patrol
near Sandwip, 180 kilometers southeast of Dhaka, apprehended one
mechanized boat with seven crew carrying 109 tons of white salt
worth of about 2.21 million taka (about 45,570 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Another four navy ships recovered smuggled goods including
electrical parts, air conditioners, cigarettes, television sets
and other illegal items worth of 2.39 million taka (about 49,280
dollars) and seized boats carrying illegal goods while patrolling
recently in the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
All the crew, goods and boats have been handed over to relevant
authorities for legal action, the report added.

<P>
Better products and services were not the only things noticed
by visitors to the exhibition. Some of them said that what is more
important is that overseas investments have changed the views of
Chinese without their realizing it.
</P>
<P>
Xu Bing, a middle-level manager of one Beijing's state-owned
enterprises, said overseas investments have enriched the China
market, and widened people's choices.
</P>
<P>
Price used to be the major factor in consumption, but quality
is now more important. People can accept higher costs as long as
the quality is high, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the coming of overseas investments have set
an example for China's state-owned enterprises. Many Chinese
enterprises have begun to learn promotion and advertising from
overseas-funded businesses, as well as service after sales. People
like it, and businesses benefit.
</P>
<P>
However, not everyone accepts these influences so
readily. 74-year-old Li Suosheng is a retired Beijing Post
University teacher. He admits that overseas investment is
necessary for China's development, but stresses that he himself is
not so interested in their products.
</P>
<P>
"It would not work if China developed behind closed doors as in
the past. We should become open to see what's it like outside. The
country is too poor to rely totally on itself. Overseas
investments is necessary," he said after visiting a exhibition on
Tibet, which highlighted motor vehicles jointly produced with
overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
Li said it's really terrific that an underdeveloped region like
Tibet now can produce motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, as a pensioner he cannot afford many of the
new high-priced products. He emphasized that some Chinese-brand
products are just as good. Despite of this, he admits that
overseas investment is an essential factor for raising the quality
of Chinese brands.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- In Macao with 450,000 residents,
207 people hold gun licenses and the number of applicants is
increasing, a Portuguese language newspaper said in a recent
report.
</P>
<P>
The gun holders mainly include lawyers, judicial officials,
business people and senior government employees. The mounting
number of gun holders is believed to be a result of worsening
public security in Macao since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Among the gun holders, some Portuguese had been granted gun
licenses in Portugal. They are able to retain their gun licenses
in Macao as soon as they go through certain formalities at the
Macao Public Security Department.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a government decree, judicial officials do
not need a license which grants their holding self-defense guns.
</P>
<P>
The application of a gun license requires that a person has
fine behavior with no criminal record. In addition, the occupation
of the applicants is rather important, and the checking process is
very complicated, the Portuguese newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, about 30 applications have been turned down.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Seven out of every 10
pregnancies end in abortion in Russia, Interfax reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 abortions are annually registered among girls
under 14, said a report released by the Russian Health Ministry on
the eve of the first Mother's Day in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of Russian women suffer from health problems
resulting from abortions.
</P>
<P>
Abortions, many performed in unauthorized clinics, are the
cause of death for one third of all mothers, said Interfax.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry is under-funded to cope with the alarming
rate of abortions. In 1998, it received only 5.6 percent of the
funds earmarked for the Safe Motherhood federal program aimed at
reducing the number of abortions.

<HEADLINE> Village Autonomy Opens China's Future Democratization (1) By Li Nuer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A few years ago, foreigners
found themselves in an entirely new world the moment they watched
village elections in China's rural areas. Village autonomy,
embodying China's progress in democracy, has now been reinforced
by the issuance of village-committee law this month.
</P>
<P>
"China is now groping forward on the road of democracy," said
Emerson Niou, a professor of politics at Duke University in the
united States.
</P>
<P>
The election of People's Congresses at various level and of the
village committees provide people with "necessary training to
exercise their democratic rights," Niou said at an international
symposium on China's public policy choices at the 21st century,
held in Beijing Friday and jointly sponsored by the Ford
Foundation and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
Niou has made a comparative study of election modes in China
and other countries around the world. He said that elections are a
procedure synthesizing individual preferences into collective
will, and is the major mechanism adopted by democracies to reflect
popular will.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhenyao, deputy director of the Bureau of Disaster and
Poverty Relief under the Ministry of Civil Affairs and also a
participant at the symposium, said that since the introduction of
reforms and opening up in 1978 when China removed the system of
life tenure in leadership, and the electoral system begun to play
a role, and elections have now become important in political life.
</P>
<P>
"It was beyond imagination 20 years ago," Wang said. "The
practice of village autonomy in the past decade or more opens
up the broad way to China's future democratization."
</P>
<P>
According to the village committee law, elections should be
carried out by secret ballot, with choices freely and
transparently made.
</P>
<P>
"This is a revolutionary innovation in the history of elections
in China," Wang said.

<P>
-- Congo, Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Uganda, which have made a

on Saturday in Paris to negotiate a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>

Germany, said Saturday they had shot down a Turkish army
helicopter and killed more than a dozen government troops.
</P>

The New York Times:

lawyers and concentration camp survivors over the 1.25 billion
U.S. dollars paid by Swiss banks to settle Holocaust-related
lawsuits, and potentially billions more from claims against
companies in Germany, Austria and other countries.
</P>
<P>

Marijuana to heroin and cocaine, a measure that, if passed, would
give Switzerland the most sweeping decriminalization of drug use,

<HEADLINE> Steel-Products Market to Pick up in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The demand for steel products
is expected to grow by a wide margin as the economy picks up next
year.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing reconstruction drive triggered by this summer's
devastating flooding, the accelerated fixed-asset investment
supported by the increased issuance of treasury bonds, and greater
supporting funds, are all expected to contribute to growth of the
national economy in 1999, said Wang Jixiang of the China
Metallurgical and Economic Development and Research Center.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the oversupply of steel products will be
alleviated and the prices will stablize or even rise slightly,
Wang predicted.
</P>
<P>
The forecast that the price of coal, electricity, oil and
transportation will not rise sharply will provide fairly
favorable market conditions for steel products. The expansion of
railway construction also adds to the demand for steel. Moreover,
automobile, construction and light industries are expected to
come out of the doldrums, further pushing up demand.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, sales of 12 of the 15 major
steel-consuming manufactured goods, including washing machines,
tractors, and machine tools, all reported negative growth.
</P>
<P>
The slowed growth in the collective, private and
overseas-funded sectors has worsened a sluggish
market and driven down prices even further.
</P>
<P>
This year's price declines are also attributable to low
import prices, Wang pointed out.

BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Ding Guangen, member of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, met here today with a Nihon Hoso Kyokai (NHK) Broadcasting
delegation led by its president Ebisawa Shoji.
</P>
<P>
Ding, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC
Central Committee, said that the historic state visit to Japan by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin in the year marking the 20th
anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Peace and
Friendship Treaty will promote bilateral friendship as the turn of
the century approaches.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan, on the whole, have witnessed a sound
development of bilateral ties over the past two decades, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The peoples of both countries should face up to history and
look into the future to inherit the cause of friendship initiated
by the older generation of statesmen, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ding believes that Shoji's current visit will help expand
cooperation between Chinese and Japanese radio and TV sectors, and
help increase mutual understanding and friendship between the two
peoples.
</P>
<P>
Ding also congratulated Shoji on his election as president of
the Asian-Pacific Broadcasting Union at its 35th conference held
in Shanghai recently, and said that he believes Shoji will
contribute to regional broadcasting during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
Shoji agreed that President Jiang's state visit to Japan is of
special significance.
</P>
<P>
NHK and its Chinese counterparts have conducted sound
cooperation in radio, TV and in cultural areas, he noted, adding
that NHK very much values this cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian, Israeli officials hold Talks Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Senior Israeli and
Palestinian officials held talks on Sunday in a bid to find a
solution to the crisis over the release of palestinian detainees
in Israeli jails, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh
and senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat took part in the
meeting held in the West Bank town of Jericho.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, Erekat warned that if Israel did not
abide the peace agreement signed last month and set free the
so-called security prisoners, the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) would not honor the accord either.
</P>
<P>
Erekat also said earlier that the PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat
would raise the issue with U.S. President Bill Clinton during his
trip to Washington this week.
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement signed on October 23, Israel agreed to
release 750 out of more than 3,000 Palestinian detainees in three
stages.
</P>
<P>
One week ago, Israel released the first group, including 150
common criminals, which set off criticism and disappointment from
both the Palestinian public and officials who had expected the
release of Palestinians held for political or militant
activities.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the Palestinian Cabinet Friday said
that the issue of prisoner release was "top priority" one," and
"will not be subjected to compromise."
</P>
<P>
Palestinians also held widespread demonstrations throughout the
West Bank and East Jerusalem on Saturday, calling for the release
of relatives and neighbors held in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a
statement on Saturday that the Palestinians were trying to create
a crisis in the peace talks by making new demands to which Israel
never agreed.
</P>
<P>
He said that no "artificial crisis" would change his refusal to
release prisoners who committed murder or militant acts against
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Determined Italy Beats Yugoslavia in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Italy proved
its strength and determination to crash Yugoslavia in the final
for a record third straight victory at the Men's World
Volleyball Championship on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian spikers took no mercy in a three-set victory with
their solid defense to win 15-12, 15-5, 15-10 in the re-match of
a second-round clash between them, when the Yugoslavians downed
the eventual world champion in three sets on Wednesday's second
round by scoring a 15-12, 15-5, 15-10.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday's final was Italy's first win over the European
champion Yugoslavia in more than a year. Italy beat Yugoslavia
twice on its way to chalking up six up six straight wins.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavians had no answers to Italians steady blocks and
counter-attacks when they found their missiles strikes failed to
crash the confidence of their rivals.
</P>
<P>
But the Italians, also the 1995 world Cup holders, have lost
four times in a row since June last year, including a 0-3 defeat
at the European championship. It was also a fourth appearance in
the finals at the world championship for Italy, who finished r
unner-up in 1978.
</P>
<P>
For the Yugoslavs, it was its highest finishing spot in the
three major events - the Olympics, the world cup and world
championship.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Cuba gained its third world medal after
defeating Barcelona Olympic champion Brazil 12-15, 15-6, 15-11,
15-12 in the bronze medal play off. Cuba also took the silver in
the 1990 championship and the bronze in 1978.

<HEADLINE> India's Ruling Party Suffers Major Setback in State Assembly Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- India's ruling Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) suffered a major setback on Sunday as the
opposition Congress won a landslide victory in three of the four
states which conducted assembly elections Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to final results of the polls just released by the
Election Commission, the Congress won 380 of the 626 assembly
seats in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan and
Mizoram, far ahead of the ruling BJP by 212 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Congress won a major victory in Rajasthan, where the BJP
had ruled for eight years, with 150 seats gained out of the total
of 197 while the BJP got only 33.
</P>
<P>
Six went to anti-BJP forces including Janata Dal and the
Communist Party of India (Marxism), and the remaining eight were
shared by independents and others.
</P>
<P>
BJP chief minister in the state Bhairon Singh, who owned moral
responsibility for the BJP's defeat, resigned Saturday after
initial results showing a spectacular comeback of the Congress
last night.
</P>
<P>
In Delhi, which was also ruled by the BJP, the Congress wrested
power from the BJP with 51 of the 69 seats, pushing the latter a
distant second at only 15.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that a flood of onion tears besides a rise
in prices of other essential commodities was one of the factors
which helped the Congress win the assembly election in the
national capital.
</P>
<P>
The two-month-old BJP chief minister Sushma Swaraj, who
resigned Saturday, blamed infighting within the BJP for the
debacle, saying that it was neither the people nor the Congress
but the BJP which had made the BJP to lose.
</P>
<P>
In Madhya Pradesh, the BJP's hopes of cashing in on the
anti-incumbency factor against the ruling Congress were dashed as
the ruling party received 173 of the 320 seats, leading the BJP
ahead by 53.
</P>
<P>
However, in Mizoram, the Congress got only 6 of the 40 seats
and the Mizo National Front and its ally, the Mizoram People's
Conference, which won 20 of the 40 assembly seats, would formally
stake claim to form the state government on Monday.
</P>
<P>
With results showing BJP reverses pouring in on Saturday, Prime
Minister of the BJP-led government Atal Behari Vajpayee held a
meeting with some of the allies supporting his government.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the meeting, Vajpayee called on President
Kocheril Raman Narayanan and talked with him for 40 minutes, the
contents of which were unknown.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the outcome of the results of the assembly
elections Saturday, he conceded that while in Delhi, the BJP was
not very optimistic, but the outcome of the polls in Rajasthan and
Madhya Pradesh had come as a "complete surprise to him and other
BJP leaders.
</P>
<P>
Although the Congress strategy for dealing with the political
turmoil was yet to be finalized, several important leaders of the
party confidently predicted the fall of the BJP government with
the withdrawal of support by some of the 13 allies now backing it.

(NC) on Sunday expelled Assistant Minister for Health Ram Chandra
Adhikari for one year for misusing his diplomatic passport, the
party said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
He lent his passport to another person for a trip to
Switzerland, press reports said, adding that he submitted
resignation on November 22 but is yet to be accepted.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Nepal Tarun Dal is a youth group under the NC.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop held here Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister for Water Resources Shailaja Acharya said that the
action was taken against the three to prevent the party's good
public image from being tarnished, to enhance the credibility of
the party's performance and to develop the party as an ideal
party, the official RSS news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The NC is the single largest party in the country with 89 seats
in the 205-member Lower House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>

of diplomatic passports at the residence of Amir Gurung, who used

<HEADLINE> "I Witnessed the Most Exciting 20 Years in China's History" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Uli Sigg was one of the
founders of China's first Sino-foreign industrial joint
venture -- Schindler China. Today, he serves as the Swiss Ambassador
to China.
</P>
<P>
"From a businessman to an ambassador, I've witnessed the most
exciting 20 years in China's history," Sigg said with pride.
</P>
<P>
On March 10, 1980, Sigg, then about 30, signed a contract
founding Schindler Elevator (China) Corporation Ltd. on behalf of
the Swiss government, putting his name down in Chinese history in
its initial years of reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Today, Schindler (China) stands out among over 320,000
foreign-funded enterprises in China, with its elevators everywhere
in shopping centers and office buildings. What the company earns
a year today could have founded two companies in 1980.
</P>
<P>
With the founding of Schindler (China), Sigg became the
vice-chairman of the board of directors -- the highest position a
foreigner was allowed to assume in a Sino-foreign joint venture at
the time.
</P>
<P>
"All my Swiss colleagues admonished about investing in China,
insisting that I would not earn a penny. They thought that I was
crazy," Sigg recalled. "But today I receive calls from Switzerland
everyday asking for my advice on investing in China."
</P>
<P>
As an ambassador of a neutral country, Sigg during his four
years in the post has functioned more as a "non-paid business
consultant" than a career diplomat.
</P>
<P>
When Sigg first came to China in 1978 and sat down with his
Chinese counterparts to negotiate the establishment of Schindler,
he discovered with enormous regret that "all these people dressed
anonymously in grey clothes have absolutely no idea of what an
independent enterprise is, let alone the concept of joint ventures
and shareholding, and so on."
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, as Sigg is about to retire and pick up his
business career again, he describes his potential business
partners in China as "much more sophisticated about business,
flexible and fully aware of the world outside China. But they are
averagely 10 years younger than those i met 20 years ago, which
gives them a definite advantage over me."
</P>
<P>
One of the deepest impression left on Sigg during his
negotiations then was the lack of relevant laws and
regulations. "Private-run business was not allowed in China then,
but how about foreigners?" Sigg was very much frustrated that
"nobody gave an answer, simply because of the law vacuum in the
field."
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the establishment of Schindler expedited the
birth of China's first regulation on Sino-foreign joint ventures,
the first law passed by China's National People's Congress after
the ten-year-long Cultural Revolution ended in 1976.
</P>
<P>
As a lawyer, Sigg remembered clearly that another basic law --
the Criminal Procedural Law of China came into effect soon after
that.
</P>
<P>
Even more than the enhanced business sophistication of the
country and the improvement of laws and regulations, it is the
change in the psychology of the people that impresses Sigg.
</P>
<P>
"The company was not allowed to set up a bonus mechanism in its
initial years, but now people feel justified in earning more money
in various ways." Sigg said.
</P>
<P>
The term "consumers' rights" which has replaced political
jargons popular 20 years ago is now the most fashionable phrase,
Sigg said, adding that people know not only what their rights are,
but also how to protect them.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador discovered that grass-roots people now dare to
comment on government officials, something not even dreamed of 20
years ago when Sigg avoided contacting any Chinese for fear of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's future, Sigg said, with the prudence and
perception typical of him, "Fully aware of its problems, the
Chinese government has adopted daring measures. Though there will
be great challenges ahead, China is heading in the right
direction."

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Israeli Allegation on Nukes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran has rejected as
"unfounded" an allegation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu that Iran is seeking access to atomic warheads.
</P>
<P>
Hamid Reza Asefi, the spokesman of Iranian Foreign Ministry,
said Sunday the allegation was fabricated by Israel with the mere
objective to divert the public opinion from dangerous schemes of
Israel, "which has turned the region into a depot of nuclear
weapons."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu voiced Israel's concern over Iran's nuclear programs
after Tehran and Moscow signed a memorandum of understanding last
Tuesday to promote their nuclear cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum signed at the end of a visit by Russian
Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeny Adamov to Iran, the two
countries will form expert groups to discuss building more
nuclear power plants in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"As the Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly announced,
Iran-Russia nuclear cooperation is for peaceful purposes" and Iran
carries out its peaceful atomic programs under the supervision of
the International Atomic Energy Agency, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, Asefi pointed out that Iran considers self-defense
based on internationally recognized principles as its legitimate
right.
</P>
<P>
Russia is helping Iran build a nuclear plant in Bushehr in
southern Bushehr province according to a contract concluded in
1994 between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Thai Army Moves to Check Sharp Rise in HIV-Infected Draftees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Thai army has imposed full
medical checks on draftees starting from next year following
reports about a sharp rise in HIV-infected and drug-addicted
conscripts.
</P>
<P>
Army sources said Sunday that the army is setting a requirement
that draftees seek detailed medical checks from any of 12 army
hospitals nationwide with their own money and show their medical
certificates to concerned authorities.
</P>
<P>
The army, the sources said, could no longer afford medical fees
for sick conscripts and those addicted to drugs.
</P>
<P>
Those due for next year's conscription must seek medical checks
from military hospitals by February 1999, the sources said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Army statistics show that up to 30 percent of all army
conscripts are found to be drug addicts or suffer from serious
diseases, especially AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The current superficial medical checks during the draft process
are unable to establish certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
The Thai army has stepped up efforts to curb drug abuses. The
northern border drug suppression center planned to destroy poppy
fields in all 72 targeted areas of 12 northern provinces between
1999-2001.

</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by This Day newspaper said that the
leading party is closely followed by the All Peoples Party (APP)
which may clinch 11 states outright, do well in many others in
the country with a total of 36 states and Federal Capital
Territory.
</P>
<P>
The third party will be the Alliance for Democracy (AD) which
is going to take the six states of the southwest, and a handful
of other chairmanship and councilorship seats scattered across
the country.
</P>
<P>
Nine political parties were provisionally registered in the
country, and would be finally registered if any political party
scores five percent of the total votes cast in at least 24 out of
36 states in the December 5 local government elections.
</P>
<P>
An earlier poll survey on Nigeria's on-going transition
program indicated an overwhelming support for the emergence of
the next civilian president from the southern part of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Infrastructure Build-up in Philippines Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A massive infrastructure
build-up in the transportation and communications sector is
underway in the Philippines as a key strategy of the government to
stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Sunday, the presidential palace said
that President Joseph Estrada has ordered the Department of
Transportation and Communications (DOTC) and other government
agencies to frontload projects in the telecommunications, domestic
shipping and air transport sector to spotlight the Philippines'
new image as region's investment haven.
</P>
<P>
"This will support the policies and economic efficiency and
global competitiveness that we in the transportation and
communications department have drawn up to uplift the
socio-economic well-being of our people," DOTC Secretary Vicente
Rivera was quoted as saying in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Rivera said the Estrada administration is expanding the
coverage of rural telephone system to serve the underserved
municipalities and villages.
</P>
<P>
In the transportation field, Rivera said the Estrada
administration is accelerating the expansion of ports, airports
and railway systems, particularly in areas that have been
identified as the country's principal gateways such as Manila,
Cebu, Davao, the Clark Special Zone in Pampanga and the Subic
Freeport in Zambales.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is striving to improve the domestic
shipping industry by adopting safety facilities and procedures
such as the Global Positioning System (GSP) by all ships plying
Philippine seas.
</P>
<P>
Being a country with 7,000 islands, he said, the Philippines
could not fully develop without rural air transport system to
complement the already productive competition among the domestic
airlines over major trunk routes.
</P>
<P>
"We have initiated measures to modernize and develop our civil
aviation system under a liberalized atmosphere underscoring the
eminent need to prioritize our government's countryside
development program," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rivera said this particular undertaking will spur economic
activities and development in the countryside and, in the long
run, improve the delivery of basic services to the rural folk.

<HEADLINE> Maternal Deaths Increase in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has not made any
progress in the past 10 years to curb the high number of mothers
who die during pregnancy, instead the maternal mortality rate has
been increasing in the country, The Guardian reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Obstetricians made the disclosure at a international forum
organized by the Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria
in Benin City, southeastern Nigeria, with an aim to review the
country's maternal mortality profile in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that in some places, the maternal mortality
rate had increased from 200 to 600 percent following the
launching of the international safe motherhood initiative ten
years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the forum, Wilfred Chukwudebelu of the University of
Nigeria Teaching Hospital disclosed that the maternal mortality
death at the hospital from 1991 to 1997 was a staggering 1,259
per 100,000 live births, a five fold increase from the 270 per
100,000 deliveries recorded between 1976 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
F. Akindele from the University College Hospital told the
forum which maternal mortality rate rose from 1,102 in 1988 to
2,360 in 1997 with a peak of 3,157 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The main causes of death are post abortion sepsis, haemorrhage
and complications of eclampsia.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the forum called upon the Nigerian government
to provide enabling policies and commit more resources to the
health and social sector to avert the rising profile of maternal
death in Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Resume Joint Military Exercises Under FPDA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will resume its
military exercises with Singapore and three other countries under
the Five Power Defense Arrangement (FPDA) next year, Defense
Minister Syed Hamid Albar said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Malaysia and Singapore would discuss the details
this year, he told reporters after attending a function here.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether the airspace rule imposed by Malaysia
would create problems for Malaysia and Singapore to start the
joint exercises, Syed Hamid said, "the airspace rule is normal...
we don't want it to be an obstacle or hindrance to such exercises
for the good of both countries."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has pulled out from this year's FPDA exercises at the
last minute, due to what was termed "the cost factor and the
country's current economic difficulties."
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old defense arrangement also involves Australia,
Britain and New Zealand, which is aimed at promoting regional
security.

CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks Sunday with visiting Eritrean President Issias Afwerki
on regional issues and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reviewed the latest developments in the
Eritrean-Ethiopian border dispute, discussed ways to solve it and
underlined the role in this regard played by the Organization of
African Unity, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the 20th Franco-African summit which ended
Saturday in Paris, Mubarak held similar talks with Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi over Egypt's efforts to help settle the
Ethiopian-Eritrean dispute.
</P>
<P>
Armed clashes took place last May between Eritrea and Ethiopia
on a number of border areas. The two countries agreed to a
cease-fire in June.
</P>
<P>
Some African presidents have put forward a proposal which calls
on Eritrea to pull out from Ethiopian land it occupied in the
clashes. But Eritrea has frowned on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Afwerki further touched on some other African
issues of mutual interest and means to promote bilateral relations
in various fields, especially in the economic area.
</P>
<P>
Afwerki arrived here Saturday for a two-day visit after
attending the Franco-African summit.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Some 35 Palestinians, including five journalists, and nine
Israeli policemen were wounded Saturday in Jerusalem in clashes
between Israeli police and protesting Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The clashes broke out when Israeli police disrupted a
demonstration by Palestinians demanding the release of political
prisoners held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian demonstrators also scuffled with Israeli police in
the West Bank towns of Hebron, Bethlehem and Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday is to meet Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat and
representatives of the countries ready to provide aid to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and representatives from 45 countries and world
organizations have gathered in Washington for an international
conference of donor states, which is designed to raise aid
for the PNA in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
The Monday meeting is a major step in a process aimed at
determining what funds the palestinians need to develop economic
independence from Israel. The international aid package, likely to
reach about 3 billion U.S. dollars, is one of the key provisions
in the land-for-peace agreement signed by Israel and the PNA last
month.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon will likely garner
three supporters in the 11-member inner cabinet for his call for a
gradual, unilateral withdrawal from South Lebanon in a span of
several months.
</P>
<P>
The inner cabinet will meet Sunday to discuss Israel's Lebanon
policy. But Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai believes
that Israel can not afford to leave Lebanon unilaterally without
prior comprehensive security arrangements in place.

<HEADLINE> Ousted Iranian Minister to Launch Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian Interior Minister
Abdollah Nouri, who was ousted by the conservative Majlis
(parliament) in June, announced Sunday the launching of a
newspaper to defend the public freedom.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Nouri said that his daily
was named "Khordad," the Persian-language name of the Iranian
calendar month in which the moderate President Mohammad Khatami
was elected with a landslide victory over the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
As the managing director, he termed his newspaper as a
"mirror," which will reflect all good and bad, strong and weak
points of the society.
</P>
<P>
The daily, with an initial circulation of 100,000, will hit
the newsstand next week to offer "exact, accurate" news to the
people, said Nouri, who was seen as a strong supporter of
Khatami's open-minded policies.
</P>
<P>
Nouri failed to win a vote of confidence in the Majlis on June
21 after the conservatives accused him of creating tensions in the
country, delivering provocative statements and promoting
inexperienced persons to managerial positions.
</P>
<P>
Khatami appointed Nouri Vice President For Development and
Social Affairs hours after the sack. But Nouri quited the post
last month to contest the forthcoming local elections scheduled in
February.
</P>
<P>
Nouri noted that his newspaper will be independent with no
party or faction affiliation though he is one of the close
friends of the president.
</P>
<P>
The daily will make efforts to reveal the truth to the
public and to defend the country, the people and the public
freedom, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that "it is impossible for a newspaper to
have no political inclination."
</P>
<P>
Nouri said that the aim of his newspaper is to provide a free
tribune to the public to express their views, criticism in favor
of or against the government.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper has the responsibility to clear any ambiguity in
the society, he said, criticizing the country's mass media for
failing to offer clear and accurate reports about events in the
society.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the notion that his newspaper will replace the
pro-democracy daily Tous, which was closed down by the
conservative judiciary in September for publishing material of
defamatory character against late Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
"Some people asked me to publish Khordad soon after Tous was
banned, but I refused, because Khordad has nothing to do with
Tous," he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the possibility that Khordad will
face the same fate as Tous since he has many political opponents,
Nouri said that his newspaper will act according to the country's
constitution and the press law.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that my newspaper will not have the fate of Tous," he
said, stressing that no one can impose any limit on press freedom
envisaged by the constitution and the press law.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sanctions Committee Blamed for Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi official in
the Ministry of Health has criticized U.N. Sanctions Committee
for delaying Iraqi contracts to purchase badly-needed medicine.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Hussein Shareef, general director of the General
Establishment of Medicine Marketing was quoted Sunday by Al
Mussawer as saying that the committee had only approved contracts
equivalent to 2.5 percent of the total sums allocated to the
ministry for the fourth phase of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Shareef said the Sanctions Committee has hold many medical
contracts and the medicine that had arrived in Iraq during the
previous phases accounted for less than 20 percent of the actual
need of the health sector.
</P>
<P>
The shortages, said the director, caused an increase in
mortality rate among children, adding that statistics released by
the Ministry of Health showed that a child dies every nine
minutes.
</P>
<P>
"The Sanctions Committee is fully responsible for the
deterioration of the Iraqi people's health conditions, in
particular children and the elderly," said the director.
</P>
<P>
Under the fourth phase of oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed
to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 22 million
people.
</P>
<P>
Among the 5.2 billion dollars, some 200 million was allocated
for the medical and health sector.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that Iraq is preparing to submit its
distribution plan for the fifth phase of the humanitarian program,
which came into force after midnight of November 25.

Pakistan has an "effective command and control system," which

obligation to halt production of fissile material."
</P>
<P>
FMCT, he said, was under negotiations at present and, "is aimed
at defining obligations for a halt in fissile material
production."
</P>

Pakistan is participating in these negotiations along with 60
other countries within the framework of the Conference on

<HEADLINE> Three Million S. African People HIV Positive: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November29 (Xinhua) -- More than three million
South African people are HIV positive, with 1,600 new infections
occurring each day, the daily City Press newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released by the medical department
in Johannesburg, hospitals in the city center alone admit about
600 AIDS patients a week, ranging from infants to adults of 50
years old.
</P>
<P>
Twenty percent of pregnant women who book into hospital are
HIV positive. In Johannesburg, one third of children admitted to
the children's wards are HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
AIDS is growing at an alarming rate, the paper quoted a senior
official of the health department as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jo-Anne Collinge, director for health promotion and
communication, said that the secrecy, ignorance and myths about
the killer disease contributed to its spread.
</P>
<P>
She said between one-tenth and one-fifth of young school
children are already infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
Most young people become infected through unprotected sex, and
most of them do not know that they are HIV positive. Many who do
know keep it to themselves for fear of discrimination and social
rejection, she said.
</P>
<P>
Collinge appealed to members of the community to support, love
and respect people with AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Companies Expect to Expand Investment Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
encouraging domestic companies to expand investment overseas as
many of them are facing oversupply of products and redundancy in
construction.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) is drafting a
list of products in oversupply to be transferred overseas,
including products in light industry, electronics, and machinery
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in collaboration with other government agencies, the
SETC is mulling measures to give firms in these sectors incentives
to invest overseas, said a SETC official who declined to divulge
more details.
</P>
<P>
The new policies come against a backdrop of widespread
undercutting on domestic market that has sparked calls by
manufacturers for price floors and the punishment of enterprises
that sell their products below them.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the third national industrial
census, nearly 500 kinds of products are being manufactured at
less than 60 percent of capacity.
</P>
<P>
And a large proportion of these products have better technology
and quality than those of many developing countries and
considerable price advantages than those of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Xing Houyuan, an expert specializing in Chinese overseas
investment, said: "The time has come for Chinese firms to invest
more overseas."
</P>
<P>
"China can transfer its technologically mature industries to
the developing countries in the Middle East, Latin America, Africa
and Central Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Till now, most of the operations are located in developed
countries and regions, small in scale, and engaged in very limited
activities.

CHONGQING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu
Province, one of the country's economic powerhouses, has increased
economic cooperation with the Three Gorges Dam area as part of a
nationwide effort to help needy, newly relocated people.
</P>
<P>
To date, Jiangsu province has invested in 175 projects in the
area worth 186 million yuan. Last year, the projects in operation
employed more than 2,000 local people and yielded 500 million yuan
in output, with a gross profit of 47.6 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the State Council demanded that all provinces,
especially those in the east, help poor areas affected by this
largest water conservation project in China.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Jiangsu has encouraged its enterprises to set up
joint ventures with local businesses in the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Changchai (or Changzhou Diesel Engine) Group from
Jiangsu invested 21 million yuan to establish a joint venture with
the Wanzhou Diesel Engine Plant.
</P>
<P>
The new company has provided jobs for 300 relocated people and
has so far turned out more than 80,000 diesel engines, generating
140 million yuan in sales and 2.16 million yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Jiangsu has also funded about 40 local schools and
some other public facilities in the Three Gorges area.

BANGKOK, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic Council of Asia

Asian Games, according to local reports.
</P>

Saudi Arabia's last-minute pullout from the 13th Asian Games
had given the hosts difficulties. Thailand had said it would ask
the OCA to impose tough penalties on Saudi Arabia for its
withdrawal. But Thai foreign minister Surin Phitswwan said
Thailand should be wary of pushing the issue too far and should
respect the Saudi decision.
</P>
<P>
But the OCA would not give up and Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad
al-Ahmad, president of the OCA, is trying to persuade Saudi Arabia
to relent and hopes to convince them to send at least a token
delegation to the Asiad.

<HEADLINE> Greens Accuses Howard Government's Standing on Kakadu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Greens accused the Howard
government's standing on Kakadu National Park by saying it had
become the world's leading environmental pirate for its role in
stopping the immediate listing of Kakadu as an endangered area.
</P>
<P>
Greens Senator Bob Brown said Sunday that the World Heritage
Bureau Saturday night in Kyoto, Japan, granted the Australian
government until April 15 to produce evidence why the United
Nations should not declare Kakadu National Park, which surrounds
the Jabiluka uranium mine, endangered.
</P>
<P>
"The Howard Government has now in the space of 12 months become
the leading agent in undermining world agreements and
environmental conventions," Brown was quoted by Australian
Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It has become the ace environmental pirate on the planet and
Australia's international reputation is being very grievously
damaged."
</P>
<P>
At its meeting in Kyoto, the heritage bureau expressed "grave
concerns" about the impact Jabiluka would have on Kakadu's
cultural and natural values.
</P>
<P>
But after intensive lobbying from the government the bureau
decided not to immediately put the park on its list of world
heritage areas considered to be in danger.
</P>
<P>
Instead it ordered Australian authorities to provide a detailed
report saying what had been done to "prevent further damage and to
mitigate all the threats" to the park posed by Jabiluka.
</P>
<P>
If that report was not satisfactory, the bureau said Kakadu
should immediately be put on the in danger list, joining the likes
of the war torn old city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Brown said the delay would see Australia's reputation "dragged
through the environmental and cultural fires from experts right
around the globe".
</P>
<P>
The bureau's recommendation would be put to the World Heritage
Committee this week for a final decision. It was unlikely the
committee would disagree with the bureau.
</P>
<P>
"This has come out of an intense political lobby devoid of any
environmental or cultural rhyme or reason by the Howard
Government."
</P>
<P>
Brown said he would write to the bureau to say millions of
Australians, international experts and the local Aboriginal people
did not agree with its decision.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot proceed with building a mine without damaging the
cultural and environmental values of the Jabiluka valley and
therefore the world heritage area," he said.

<HEADLINE> Albanian President Signs New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Rexhep
Meidani signed Saturday the nation's new constitution passed after
a referendum on November 22.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Meidani called the law not merely a
beginning of constructing a normal, democratic Albania and
realizing Albanian people's expectations, but "the symbol of
Albania's European future".
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all Albanians should work hard, with no fear
of sacrifice, to benefit future generations and lofty national
cause.
</P>
<P>
At a state banquet held on Saturday evening in celebration of
both the introduction of the new constitution and the country's
liberation and independence day, the president said,"From today
Albania will have its own constitution, which will provide a solid
foundation for our future".
</P>
<P>
The new constitution ends the non-constitution period of the
country since the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
However, the largest opposition Democratic Party declared that
it would refuse to recognize the new constitution as legitimate
and work to make the state basic law by its own will, complaining
that the voter turnout in the November 22 referendum was lower
than 40 percent by the party's statistics.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Make More Efforts to Combat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- African governments should
accelerate efforts to combat diseases and promote health in the
region, African Regional Director of the World Health
Organization (WHO) Ebrahim Samba has said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the health situation in Africa in 1998, Samba said
in Harare Saturday that notable progress has been made in various
areas including health sector reforms, polio eradication,
communicable diseases control, water supply and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
But a lot more still needs to be done in order to effectively
combat problems currently besetting health delivery systems in
most African countries, the WHO official told Sunday Mail.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the newspaper Saturday, Samba
stressed that wars and civil strife have affected the health
situation in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Wars, civil strife and other man-made emergencies are
currently wreaking havoc in at least 20 African countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has more than nine million refugees and more than 40
million internally displaced persons," Samba noted, adding that
"these are the highest numbers in the world and they are
increasing. This is a major challenge which the WHO is tackling
in collaboration with the (African) states and other U.N.
agencies."
</P>
<P>
On the situation of HIV/AIDS in Africa, Samba said, "the
picture is very gloomy. Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected
region."
</P>
<P>
"Of the 30.6 million adults and children living with AIDS in
the world, 20.8 million are in Africa, and everyday 7,500 new HIV
infections occur in our region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If it continues to spread at the present rates, AIDS will
deplete an important portion of the African workforce, including
better skilled and educated workers who are not easily
replaceable," said Samba.
</P>
<P>
"It will also slow economies and put a huge strain on
financial and medical resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the WHO is providing education and information
about change in pattern of sexual behavior and mobilizing African
political leadership to carry out the anti-AIDS campaign.

<P>
CHONGQING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality is helping resettlers in the Three Gorges reservoir
area develop a comprehensive economy to protect the natural
environment.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that highly efficient and ecologically
sound agriculture and agricultural industrialization are needed to
resettle the people who have moved from their former homes as part
of the Three Gorges Reservoir construction.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing will establish large enterprises and open a number of
model areas for industrialized agriculture to encourage farmers to
abandon their traditional way of farming, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has the task of resettling some one million local
people, over 40 percent of whom are farmers from outskirtan
villages. Two years ago, these people were settled in wasteland
areas reclaimed for farming.
</P>
<P>
After last summer's deluge along the Yangtze River, the central
government announced a series of policies to ban logging and
protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the new situation, Chongqing has drawn up a
program for efficient ecological agriculture to introduce
sustainable agriculture development into the reservoir area.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Finance Minister on "Sick Industry" Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister
A.M.S. Kibria Saturday said that the "sick industry culture" in
the country must come to an end by June 30 next year, The
Independent daily newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Those who think they won't be able to recover their business
must find a graceful way to get rid of their sick industries while
those units that come out successfully within the deadline will be
rehabilitated," he said while addressing a conference of
entrepreneurs of small and medium-sized industries in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
There is a tendency to taking advantage in the name of sick
industries, he noted, stressing that "these abuses of facilities
must stop".
</P>
<P>
Weak management, over-capitalization and lack of proper market
feasibility were the main causes for the failure of the
industries, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that he would issue directives to the
nationalized banks to speedily settle the problem of sick
industries by adopting realistic plans.
</P>
<P>
On the government's plans to promote industries, he said that
the government would give support to agro-processing industries as
a thrust sector in the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
At present, 1,325 industries have been identified by the
government as sick industries, according to the latest official
statistics. The government is taking a series of measures to solve
the issue.

HEFEI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A new highway-railway bridge
spanning the Yangtze at the city of Wuhu, China's longest river,
is now under intensive construction and is scheduled to be
operational by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, with a 6,078-meter-long highway and
10,616-meter-long train tracks, will be the longest over the
Yangtze. It will cost 2.6 billion yuan (314 million US dollars) to
construct the bridge, and one billion yuan (120 million US
dollars) of this total has already been spent.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, it will shorten the route between Beijing, the
Chinese capital, and the city of Xiamen, one of the country's five
special economic zones, by 800 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1957, China has built 16 bridges over the Yangtze

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and commercial center, has invested heavily in
technological progress in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau
show that the city injected five billion yuan into the research
sector last year, five times the 1990 figure, bringing the total
amount used in this sector over the past seven years to 21.44
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yearly expenditures for scientific and technological research
projects in the city is equivalent to 1.5 percent of its gross
domestic product, much higher than the national average of 0.6
percent, according to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the surge to the introduction of a more
market-oriented fund-raising system, one that has opened the
research sector to a variety of investors.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, capital from non-governmental sources,
including large and medium-sized enterprises, has jumped to nearly
60 percent of the total, replacing the government as the main
source of investment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city recorded 1,193 major achievements in
science and technological research, over a third of which reached
the advanced international standards, and at the same time the
number of patent applications reached 3,119, three times that of
1987.
</P>

Moreover, sales of newly developed products for the past three
years doubled those of the previous three-year period, to surpass
179.3 billion yuan (21.65 billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Advance Team of NATO Rapid Reaction Force Arrives Skopje </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Thirty French soldiers have
arrived in the Macedonian capital to prepare for the deployment of
a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) rapid reaction force.
</P>
<P>
Arriving in Skopje on Friday evening, the soldiers were in an
advance team to address logistic needs of the 1,700-member rapid
reaction force, said media reports reaching here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, visiting NATO Secretary-general Javier Solana
reportedly struck a deal with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
and Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski on the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
As called for by a NATO decision on November 13, the rapid
reaction force would protect 2,000 observers of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) assigned to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The military strike force would intervene and bring the unarmed
OSCE observers out from the neigboring province of the Yugoslav
Federation once they are under attack or at risk there.
</P>
<P>
However, pending the formation of a new government following
the recent election, Macedonia has not officially responded to the
NATO request for the deployment of the force in the country.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Gligorov and Georgievski, NATO chief Solana
did get the approval from the two leaders to send the advance team
to Skopje.

<HEADLINE> Mitch Gives Rise to Infectious Diseases in Honduras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Incidence of infectious
diseases has rapidly increased in Honduras after Hurricane Mitch
swept the country in late October.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry has registered at least 20 cases of
leptospirosis, 200,000 cases of diarrhea, 1,000 cases of malaria
and another 1,000 cases of classic dengue.
</P>
<P>
Jose Ochoa, head of the ministry's Population Risks Direction,
said on Saturday the number of people affected by malaria is
increasing, causing more concern among victims of Mitch.
</P>
<P>
Leptospirosis, which has already caused four deaths in
Honduras, is caused by bacteria transmitted through rats, and its
symptoms include fever, muscle pain, hemorrhages and jaundice.
</P>
<P>
The bacteria are abound in Honduras as a remanent of Mitch.
</P>
<P>
France, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Cuba and the United States,
among other countries, have sent medical teams to the country to
help prevent epidemics caused by contamination and overcrowding.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Direct Investment Up in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment (FDI)
in the Czech Republic was up 24.7 percent in the first nine months
of the year to an equivalent of 1.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rise, over the same period in 1997, has brought the FDI to
the country to a total 9.2 billion dollars since 1990, a spokesman
of the Czech National Bank told the press earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Of all capital inflow into the Czech Republic from January
through September, 32.2 percent went to its finance and insurance
sector, and 24.9 percent went to the retail and catering sector.
</P>
<P>
Britain was the biggest investor to bring in 25.4 percent of
the total FDI, followed by the United States with 16.1 percent of
the total and Germany with 15.5 percent, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the preferential policies put into
place by the government in April this year have helped encourage
foreign investors to bring more fund into the country.
</P>
<P>
Under these policies, any investment of over 25 million dollars
in the country would be exempted from taxation over the next five
years, and imports of high-tech equipment would enjoy zero tariff.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the new policies, and partly because of political
uncertainty in the country, FDI went down to 1.4 billion dollars
in 1996 and 1.3 billion dollars in 1997, or half that of 1995.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Colombian police
captured on Saturday a faction leader of the National Liberation
Army (ELN), the country's second biggest guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
Police authorities identified the chief as Asdrubal Pedraza and
confirmed he was detained in Cucuata, a northern city on the
border with Venezuela, but did not give details of the arrest.
</P>
<P>
The rebel chief is charged with leading an ELN attack last July
on Sardinata, northeast of Cucuata, in which eight policemen were
killed and 10 others taken hostage, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The faction, led by Pedraza, laid siege to the city and damaged
public buildings there.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have ordered the transfer of the rebel leader
to the capital city of Santafe de Bogota, where he will be brought
to the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the police said two men from the same guerrilla
group were detained in a residential sector with important
documents about ELN operations in the Colombian capital.
</P>
<P>
Identities of the men were not revealed.

<P>
ROME, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Germany agreed on
Friday to bring Kurdish rebel leader Adbullah Ocalan to trial and
Turkey closer to the Europe Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and his German
counterpart Joschka Fisher issued a joint statement after their
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the two countries decided to "make every

</P>
<P>
They also want to make joint contribution to an EU initiative
for a "peaceful solution in southeast Turkey and bringing Turkey

</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister also discussed the Ocalan issue
with Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema and German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder Thursday voiced
a preference for bringing Ocalan before an "international court,"
a proposal that Turkey says is "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
A Turkish extradition request is on its way, but Fisher
confirmed to D'Alema that Germany does not plan to follow up its
international arrest warrant with a similar request.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was detained in Rome on November 12 under international
arrest warrants issued by Germany and Turkey, but then Germany
said it would not be seeking Ocalan's extradition.
</P>
<P>
Italian law forbids extradition to a country that practices
death penalty, which is in force in Turkey. The remaining options
are political asylum, expulsion or trial before an international
court -- the uppermost in official thinking here.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Stock Market to Close Higher in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- November is expected to end
as the best month in 1998 for the Santiago Stock Exchange, with a
14.6-percent gain in its selective stock index.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge, analysts here said, will take place at a time when
there has been uncertainty generated earlier this week by the
British justice's decision against former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
The IPSA, an index covering the 40 most heavily trade stocks,
closed Friday with 82.28 points, up 0.53 percent from Thursday,
1.84 percent from last Friday and 14.15 percent from October.
</P>
<P>
The results marked an important recovery after the first
negative impact following the British House of Lords' refusal last
Wednesday to acknowledge Pinochet's immunity as a former ruler.
</P>
<P>
With rise on Friday, the stock exchange here rose to the
highest since August 11, when the IPSA stood at 82.42 points.
</P>
<P>
The rally was attributed to the interest rate cut from 10
percent to 8.5 percent by the Central Bank on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In explaining the cut, the bank cited statistics showing that
the internal spending during the third quarter had grown slowlier
than the gross domestic product for the first time in the year.
</P>
<P>
As traders said, another factor that led to the good
performance at the stock market was that the indexes on the Wall
Street, of the United States, hit a new record high on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Government Cautious on LTTE's Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- There was no government
reactions so far to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
offer of peace talks with third party mediation.
</P>
<P>
The government cautious over LTTE call for talks. officials
preferred not to say anything at the present stage, informed
sources here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
political analysts here noted that there were several
conditions that the leader of the LTTE has imposed for talks and
it was unclear whether negotiations on those terms would be
possible.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that there was a gap between the LTTE
position of the need for an active mediator and government's
readiness to consider the possibility of a third party solely to
facilitate talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the LTTE Velupillai Prabhakaran is prepared for a
negotiated political settlement if peace talks are mediated by a
third party, said a release from the LTTE's International
secretariat in London, according to reports reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Prabhakaran has proposed peace talks mediated
by a third party in a speech to mark the "heroes's day" from
November 21 to 27 at the time of his birthday on November 26.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga reiterated
that her government was prepared for talks with the LTTE. The
government believes in a negotiated political settlement for the
ethnic crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, she noted that the talks were within a stipulated
time-frame and irrespective of a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after coming to power in 1994, the government opened
talks with the LTTE rebels who have been fighting a war for
separate state in the country, but in April 1995 the LTTE abruptly
pulled out to resume their protracted campaign.

<HEADLINE> China to Shak Up Township Courts For Rural Stability (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Supreme People's Court
is formulating rules to rework the country's 17,411 township
courts to see to it that there is justice in rural areas for rural
stability, the court's president, Xiao Yang, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Xiao told a national conference on township courts that these
will help stop corruption in the judiciary and help further effect
law and order in vast rural areas by standardizing the operations
of township courts, their management, and their working procedures.
</P>
<P>
Township courts are a branch of the county-level courts and are
independent of township governments.
</P>
<P>
Today's conference is the first to be held in China. It was
meant to help implement the policies of a recent Chinese Communist
Party meeting on rural reforms and developments.
</P>
<P>
Xiao says that township courts handled 50.27 percent of all
first-instance cases in China's courts in the past five years and
have made remarkable progress.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still problems facing courts at various
levels in building township courts, standardizing their work,
fighting corruption in the judiciary, and seeing to it that
justice is served, Xiao says.
</P>
<P>
He said court arrangements that could affect the outcome of
trials must be altered within a certain time limit, and though
township courts are not a part of the twonship Party committee of
township government, some township governments have used court
staff as government employees and such practices have to be
corrected.

<P>
Township courts that get involved in government affairs that
are not part of their legal duties must be stopped, he said, and
their activities must be conducted in strict accordance with the
law and trials must be independent and fair.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Courts should avoid all tampering and keep to
guarding the authority of the law, working for a better image of
the people's court, and increasing the people's confidence in the
law, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to emphasize that justice is the core or crucial
point of all court work and said that all courts need to be open
to the public for supervision. He also encouraged township courts
to go to villages at a regular basis to try cases there so that
more and more villagers can attend hearings.
</P>
<P>
The top court judge says that, in addition to handling criminal
and civil cases, township courts handle a large number of disputes
that are fairly easy to resolve, in fact, five times the number of
formally registered cases.

<HEADLINE> Stability in China Guarantees Attraction of Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China attracted a faster fund
inflow from Europe and America as investment from Asia trickled
off, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The untilized investment from Asia fell between 11 and 12
percent during the first ten months of this year due to the Asian
Pacific financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
However, higher investment flows from Europe and North America
have made up the gap.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the country absorbed 39.5 billion in foreign
direct investment from January to October, inching up 0.9 percent
from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
For the past five consecutive years, China has been the world's
second largest recipient of foreign direct investment, both
committed and actually utilized.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shantang, vice-chairman of the China Association of
Enterprises with Foreign Investment, put the continued attraction
of China for foreign investors, especially against the backdrop of
the Asian financial turmoil, down to the country's "mammoth
market, broadened by sustained rapid economic growth, social and
economic stability amid the financial tempest."
</P>
<P>
Zhang's view was shared by Maarten van Alkemade, general
manager of Rabobank Netherlands (China) Ltd., who said that many
large multinational companies coming to China are driven by
long-term interests because the country has huge potential
market.

Moya, the French Open champion, eliminated Tim Henman 6-4,
3-6, 7-5 in another semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Despite his loss, Sampras is assured of holding to No. 1 for a
record sixth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
Sampras had 50 unforced errors against Corretja, who only had
19.
</P>
<P>
Sampras was seeking his fifth title in the elite tournament
after winning the championship in 1991, 1994 and the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
Corretja, who is ranked No. 6 in the world, said:"We have been
told by people all over the world that we can only play on clay.
Now they have to show us some respect."
</P>
<P>
The three match points turned into a long rallies, and all
went Corretja's way, one on his winner, two on errors by Sampras.
Sampras netted a simple forehand and dived for a volley on the
last one, but it went wide.
</P>
<P>
Two Spaniards have never played in a final before in this
tournament. The last Spanish finalist was Manuel Orantes, who
also won what was then called the Masters in 1976 in Houston.
</P>
<P>
Although not known for his prowess on indoor courts, Moya
moved into the semi-finals of the championship last year in his
first appearance in the tournament and now has advanced to his
first final.
</P>
<P>
Corretja could become the first player to win the event in his
first attempt since John McEnroe in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Obstacles to Sino-Japanese Trade Ties should be Cleared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan should further
strengthen cooperation and eliminate unnecessary hindrance to
offset the negative impact of the Asian financial turmoil on
bilateral economic ties, China's Daily's Business Weekly reported
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Weekly, as the Asian financial crisis deepens,
Sino-Japanese trade shows declining momentum.
</P>
<P>
During the first 10 months of this year, China's exports to
Japan dropped 5.4 percent year-on-year to 23.6 billion US dollars,
and imports from Japan slid 2.1 percent to 21.98 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, trade friction is further hampering the
growth of Sino-Japanese trade and economic cooperation, the
English newspaper quoted officials of the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec) as saying.
</P>
<P>
One such hindrance is the recent adoption of discriminatory
practices by Japan against some Chinese textile products and
against Chinese rice in Japan's public bidding for rice import
quotas.
</P>
<P>
While it is understandable that some problems and frictions
occur in bilateral economic ties, China is against unnecessary,
man-made hindrances, Moftec officials said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the significant achievements over the past two
decades on furthering the bilateral economic links, Moftec
officials pointed out that there is still great potential to
develop bilateral trade and economic cooperation due to the
complementary nature of the two economies and their geographical
proximity.

MEXICO CITY, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's Popocatepetl
volcano erupted again on Saturday, spewing columns of ashes on its
slopes and cinders over nearby villages in Mexico state.

height of 1,500 meters above its crater.
</P>

Civil protection authorities have warned local residents to be
at least seven kilometers away from the Popocatepetl volcano and

<HEADLINE> China Telecom Faces End of Monopoly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China is to break up China
Telecom's monopoly in its telephone call industry although
no timetable is currently available, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Information Industry (MII) official is quoted
as saying that the process of amending the plan for the
long-awaited restructuring is being accelerated.
</P>
<P>
The final plan is pending approval from the State Council. MII
has submitted several such plans to the State Council, but none
has been fully accepted, the newspaper noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the Government is left with only
the choice of reforming China Telecom.
</P>
<P>
The company will be divided into several independent companies
according to business or geographical areas. It said that an
alternative plan is expected to cut out some certain businesses of
China Telecom.
</P>
<P>
Ending of the state monopoly in the telecommunications sector
is linked with China's efforts to accede to the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The state-owned China Telecom operates in local and
long-distance calls, mobile communications, paging services and
data communications. It chalked up a total turnover of 163.4
billion yuan (19.7 billion US dollars) in 1997.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels has
proposed peace talks mediated by a third party in a message to
mark the "heroes'day" at the time of leader's birthday on November
26, reports reaching here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A release from the Tamil rebels' International Secretariat in
London said Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) is prepared for a negotiated
political settlement if peace talks are mediated by a third party.
</P>
<P>
Prabhakaran who said "we have not closed the door to peace"
called for the "creation of a climate of peace and goodwill to
hold peace talks."
</P>
<P>
He said "peace negotiations cannot take place under prevailing
conditions of war, violence and oppression" and said the Tigers
would prefer to hold talks in a climate of "peace and normalcy."
</P>
<P>
"We hold the view that political negotiations cannot be fire,
fair and just if the government utilizes the military aggression
on our soil and the restrictions imposed on the economic life of
our people as political pressure. We are prepared to engage in
initial talks to discuss the removal of such pressure and to work
out a basic framework for political negotiations", the release
quoted prabhakaran as saying.
</P>
<P>
In his message, the rebel leader alleged that foreign countries
he did not name were providing Colombo with economic, diplomatic
and military assistance and said this was helping to prolong the
war.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a war against the government
since 1983 for separate state in the north and east of the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A number of foreign financial
companies are contacting Chinese authorities for diverting the
country's pool of pension funds to the securities market.
</P>
<P>
Such insurance companies as Lincoln National Corp. of the
United States have discussed with the Ministry of Labor an Social
Security on this issue, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
However, a ministry official said it was too early to put
pension funds onto securities market in search of profits.
</P>
<P>
China now has about 50 billion yuan (six billion US dollars) in
the pool of pension funds. The funds currently can only be
deposited in special accounts in banks or invested in treasury
bonds.
</P>
<P>
"The point is how to utilize such pension funds," said Huang
Jianping, president of the Beijing-based JP investment Consulting
Corporation (JPI).
</P>
<P>
Huang's company and other three foreign enterprises are making
a joint effort to help the Chinese Government design a new system
of untilizing pension funds.
</P>
<P>
JPI is to help the Government establish an information network
to check the flow of pension funds in the next three years. It
will also offer pension management expertise and personnel
training programs for the Ministry of Labor and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of Civil Affairs official said that China welcomes
foreign investment in building senior citizens' homes.

ways to combat terrorism and drug and arms trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three top defense and security officials, including
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, have confirmed to attend the

Colombian Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said drug
trafficking in his country could be the focus of attention at the
ministerial conference being held every two years.

Sources said Cohen is expected to reassure Colombian President
Andres Pastrana of the U.S. support to the peace process with the
country's two major rebel groups: the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>

The process has been on the track since Pastrana took office as
president on August 7.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Clash With Israeli Security Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces on
Saturday arrested nine Palestinians who were among hundreds of
others demonstrating for the release of Palestinian prisoners
from Israeli jails both at Bethlehem and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Near the National Hotel in East Jerusalem, demonstrators threw
stones at the Israeli border police and the police fired tear gas
and rubber bullets to disperse them. During the clash, nine
palestinians were arrested.
</P>
<P>
In Bethlehem, hundreds of protesting Palestinians clashed with
Israeli soldiers near the Rachel's Tomb and they were pushed back
by the Palestinian police. No protesters were arrested there.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's demonstrations were organized by the Palestinian
Prisoners Association, which also asked the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) to renegotiate with the Israeli side for the
total release of Palestinian prisoners from Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side said that a total of 3,500 Palestinian
prisoners were being held in various Israeli jails. 250 of
them were first released last week under the Wye peace accord
signed last month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The PNA was not satisfied for the first release of the
prisoners because most of the released ones were criminals, not
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on several
occasions that he will never release the Palestinian political
prisoners, such as members of the Palestinian terrorist groups.

Kasoulides made the remark upon his return from Athens where he
took part in a meeting Friday on the Cyprus issue, chaired by
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Greek Premier Costas
Simitis.
</P>
<P>
"Some conclusions reached at the meeting will be put before the
National Council, top advisory body to the President on the
Cyprus problem," he said, adding that President Clerides will
brief political party leaders on the content of the Athens meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides refrained from giving details of the meeting. But there
was wide speculation here that the leaders of the two countries
discussed the deployment of the Russian-made S-300 missiles which
might be deployed in Crete, Greece, instead of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said the emphasis given in Athens is the two
government's wish to see the reduction of tension in Cyprus with
an aim to create the conditions through which negotiations for a
settlement of the Cyprus problem could be carried out.
</P>
<P>
"This is our aim," he said, adding that "we are stating to the
international community our readiness to cooperate to find mutual
ways of reducing tension in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but the
Turkish Cypriots opted out of the peace negotiations last year to
protest against a decision made by the European Union to begin
accession talks with Cyprus government.
</P>
<P>
The tension has been escalating on this Eastern Mediterranean
island since the Cypriot government ordered S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles from Russia in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly threatened military actions if the
missiles are deployed in Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Pull Out of DRC If Security Guaranteed: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said in Paris Saturday that his government will pull its
troops out of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) if his
country's border security is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remarks at a press conference after the
closing of the two-day Franco-African summit, Radio Uganda
reported Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is committed to withdrawing its troops from DRC as soon
as an agreement is in place to cater for its security concerns,
the president explained.
</P>
<P>
He also said that negotiation process to find a resolution to
the four-month-old DRC conflict has been taking place and the
leaders at the conference have given the process a political
push.
</P>
<P>
The regional leaders involved in the DRC crisis have agreed to
work out an agreement that will stipulate the steps to be taken
to end the conflict in the third largest African country, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
They held a meeting under the chairmanship of the U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and unanimously agreed that the
conflict must be brought to a speedy and conclusive end and that
none of them is interested in seeing continued fighting in that
country, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Favors OAU's Africa Conflict Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria believes that conflict
resolution and prevention in Africa should rest with existing
mechanisms at the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and
regional bodies, a senior Nigerian officer said.
</P>
<P>
The Chief of General Staff, Rear Admiral Okhai Akhigre, made
the remarks at the plenary session of the 20th Summit of
Franco-African Heads of State and Governments in Paris Friday,
the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that those bodies were better placed to check the
eruption and spread of conflicts on the continent, adding that
experience had shown that better results were achieved through
cooperative efforts between the OAU and regional bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian officer expressed welcome to the interests shown
by the international community in peaceful resolution of
conflicts in Africa, but noted that what Africa required from the
international friends was logistic and financial support for its
own initiatives.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU central mechanism and other sub-regional efforts are
better placed to satisfy the objectives of early resolution of
conflicts than those externally conceived," Akhigre stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged Western countries to assist the continent to get out
of its incessant conflict situation, stressing that the search
for peace must be the collective task of both Europe and Africa.
</P>
<P>
So, he said, Nigeria believed that Africa's relationship with
France should open the window to a wider relationship with the
whole of Europe in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the new millennium, he noted that "we
should look forward to the emergence of a Europe-Africa summit,
reflecting the new spirit of the age and founded on much more
mutual, genuine cooperation, trust and confidence."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Agrees to Extend Oil-for-Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has agreed to a proposal
raised by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to extend
oil-for-food program for a fifth phase of six months, said a
U.N. source on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The source from the U.N. humanitarian program in Baghdad,
requesting anonymity, told Xinhua that Iraq will submit to the
U.N. chief a specific plan for implementing the new phase of the
program in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council voted unanimously last Tuesday to renew
the program for another six months.
</P>
<P>
The source said that earlier Iraq had only agreed to an
three-month extension of the program to give time for the
implementation of the contracts reached in previous phases.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed trade embargo on Iraq following its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990, but approved an oil-for-food deal to allow Iraq
to sell a limited amount of oil every six month since December 1996
to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods for its
hardship-stricken people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil export ceiling has been raised to 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars in the fourth phase, which expired Wednesday, from
2 billion dollars in the previous phases.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq's dilapidated oil industry and the sagging world oil
prices have earned Baghdad only 3.3 billion dollars in the fourth
phase.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council agreed in June to allow Iraq to import 300
million dollars worth of spare parts to revamp its oil
installations for raising export capacity.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of badly-needed spare parts arrived in Iraq
last Wednesday after several delays. But some of the refinery
managers have complained that their rejoice has died away shortly
after spare parts arrived because the parts were for oil
production, not refining.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kamil Al-Fatli, general manager of Iraq's second
largest Daura refinery, said his factory signed 58 contracts in
the fourth phase to import new equipment and spare parts, but the
U.N. Sanction Committee has only approved six of them due to the
obstruction of the U.S. and Britain .
</P>
<P>
And no spare parts his factory ordered have arrived yet, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Fatli said his refinery can now yield 100,000 barrels of oil
per day, a 25 percent of decrease from 1990, before the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He was also pessimistic about Iraq's oil exports in the coming
six months, saying that that if the current situations continue,
Iraq's oil production can not be increased.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lab Devises Simple Cholera Detector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists have devised a
simple detector which can sniff out cholera bugs before people
start falling ill, the New Scientist magazine reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Current approaches based on DNA sequencing to spot dangerous
anthrax or cholera bacteria before epidemics break out are still
slow and relatively insensitive, and the chemicals used in
antibody tests have a limited shelf life.
</P>
<P>
Basil Swanson and colleagues at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, the United States, focused on a different way by
isolating the natural protein within cell membranes that binds to
cholera toxin and embedded it in an artificial membrane coating a
glass bead.
</P>
<P>
When a cholera toxin molecule binds to the membrane, it causes
a reaction that emits a red light from the bead.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have found that by monitoring the red light
emitted by the beads, they could determine the amount of cholera
toxin present.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army is studying a version of the detector to see if
it can be used on the battlefield to detect the use of biological
weapons, the New Scientist said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Closer Cooperation with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh on Saturday called for further promotion
of comprehensive cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
"We attach importance to the relations between Iran and China
and see the relations being of strategic significance," Aminzadeh
said in a meeting with a nine-member Chinese press delegation
which arrived here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran and China have enjoyed a friendly
relationship historically, which should be pushed forward under
the new world circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Chinese leaders and officials share the same
views with us on the promotion of our bilateral relations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh said that Iran hopes to learn from China in building
power stations, dams and subways, and in oil, gas, petrochemical
and transportation sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iranian side has expressed satisfaction over the
projects carried out by China in Iran, expressing hope that the
Tehran-Beijing joint commission will convene soon to explore ways
for expanded economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Terming Iran as a good place for foreign investments, Aminzadeh
said that foreign countries can get access to a huge market in
Iran and its neighbors through Iran's free trade zones.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign companies can set up storage and distribution
centers in the free trade zones and export their products to Iran
and the Central Asian and Caucasian states by using Iran's
transportation networks.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh also told his Chinese guests that the government of
President Mohammad Khatami pursues a foreign policy of
tension-reducing and detente.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Iran has succeeded in improving its relations
with European and Persian Gulf states, he said.

<P>
Bonn, November 28 (Xinhua) -- In four German cities Saturday
more than 20,000 Turkish migrants demonstrated peacefully for the
extradition of the leader of Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) Abdullah
Ocalan to stand trial in a Turkish court.
</P>
<P>
Turkish community leaders accused Bonn of cowardice in failing
to obtain Ocalan's extradition from Italy, where he is under house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
In Berlin, some 6,000 showed up to the rally. Speakers demanded
that Ocalan be tried in either Germany or Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In suburban Bonn, 4,000 demonstrators waved Turkish flags,
chanted slogans against Ocalan's PKK and handed a message of
protest at the Italian embassy.
</P>
<P>
In Nuremberg, 5,000 people waved the flag of their homeland,
while further south in Bavaria, a Munich rally against Ocalan
attracted 6,500. Police said all the rallies were incident-free.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, about 10,000 pro-PKK Kurds had
demonstrated in Bonn for Ocalan's release.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been a banned organization in Germany since 1993
because of arson attacks on Turkish clubs, shops and offices. It
is fighting for Kurdish autonomy in the east and southeast of
Turkey.

LUSAKA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba announced here Saturday that he will launch a new
presidential housing initiative next January to enable more
Zambians to benefit from the housing program.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation this evening on TV and radio Chiluba

In order to mobilize funds for the new housing initiative,
parastatal houses hived off from companies will be offered for
sale to the republic, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said proceeds from the sale of the government houses will
also be channeled into the new initiative to create a revolving

JERUSALEM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat left for Washington
Saturday afternoon in the hope of raising 4 billion U.S. dollars
in aid, a senior PNA official said in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is to attend the Conference of Donor Nations in
Washington, which is due to open next Monday with the
participation of representatives from 45 nations and organizations
of the U.N., the official said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will deliver a speech at the conference to ask the
donor nations to provide about 4 billion
U.S. dollars to support the Palestinian economy in the next five
years, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The donor nations had pledged to grant the Palestinians 3.5
billion dollars in aid over the past five years, but only 2.5
billion were delivered, the official added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Washington, Arafat, the official said, will
meet U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on the implementation of the Wye peace accord signed last
month and issues regarding the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will also chair a meeting of the U.S.-Palestinian

communities, and members of the U.S. Congress, the official said.

<P>
LUSAKA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Saturday announced that the long-delayed local government
elections will be held on December 30, this year.
</P>
<P>
In a national television speech Saturday evening, Chiluba
called on the Zambians to be enthusiastic and participate fully
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that local government elections are not
political party elections, saying this is about people making
decisions and about the welfare of the people.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba regretted that the election which should have been
held in 1995 has been delayed for three years and he attributed
this to limited resources.
</P>
<P>
The councillors who were elected in 1992 unfortunately
continued staying in office beyond the time stipulated by law, he
said.
</P>
<P>
And the long stay in office has affected the performance of
the majority of councillors, resulting in their poor service
delivery to their communities, in-fighting, wrestling for power
and abuse of office, said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
He stressed this state of affairs could not be allowed to
continue.
</P>
<P>
In his 20-minute speech, Chiluba called on the Zambians to
vote for those "competent" and "dedicated" people who have a

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S. of Prolonging Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iraqi Justice Minister
Shabib al-Maliki Saturday accused the U.S. of deterring the
lifting of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has handed over to the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM,
all the documents related to its weapons programs, al-Maliki said
upon his arrival in Cairo for a meeting of Arab Justice Ministers
Council.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the documents is "nothing but a pretext" to
keep economic sanctions on Iraq in place, he said.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM, which oversees Iraq's dismantling of weapons of mass
destruction, has demanded that Baghdad hand over all the documents
for its weapons programs. But Baghdad holds that it has no more
secret files.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused that it is the U.S. that manipulates the
weapons inspections to prolong the embargo imposed on Iraq by the
U.N. Security Council following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The council maintains that the sanctions will not be lifted
until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has cleared of all banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Al-Maliki said that he will also discuss with his Egyptian
counterpart Farouk Seif el-Nasr judicial cooperation between the
two countries on the sidelines of the two-day meeting of Arab
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is to open Sunday, will discuss ways of
facilitating the implementation of the first anti-terrorism pact
in the Arab world signed in Cairo last April.

<HEADLINE> Many Legally Bought Guns Used in Crimes in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Almost half of all guns
used in crimes in the United States were purchased from federally
licensed dealers within the previous three years, new federal law
enforcement data said.
</P>
<P>
The new data cited by the New York Times Saturday challenges
the long-held view that most guns used in crimes are stolen and
contradicts the gun industry's argument that its dealers are not
the source of an illegal black market for weapons.
</P>
<P>
But gun industry said that the relatively short length of time
between the sale of a handgun and its use during a crime was an
inaccurate measure of whether a weapon has been stolen.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms data was
disclosed just days before the expiration of the Brady Law, which
requires a five-day waiting period before buying a handgun.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Dalay filed a 433
million U.S. dollar lawsuit against the firearms industry,
declaring that it has created a public nuisance by flooding the
streets with weapons deliberately marketed to criminals.
</P>
<P>
New Orleans already has taken the gun industry to court and
Miami has similar plans. And in January, a lawsuit brought by the
relatives of victims of gun violence is scheduled for trial in the
Federal District Court in Brooklin.
</P>
<P>
The suit also accuses gun makers of creating a public hazard by
flooding the market with their products.
</P>
<P>
On November 30, the U.S. Justice Department is to implement the
National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which will give
law enforcement officials access to a wider array of records than
is now available and will require background checks before
customers can purchase rifles, shotguns and firearm transfers at
pawn shops.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Hope Emerges for Ending DRCongo Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Hope for putting an end to the
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRCongo) emerged on
Saturday as the major forces involved agreed to cease fighting for
the first time since the war broke out in early August.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the DRCongo, Uganda, Rwanda and four other African
nations engaged in the war promised to cease acts of hostilities
immediately and sign a ceasefire agreement before mid-December.
</P>
<P>
This progress was made due to efforts by French President
Jacques Chirac, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and
president of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Burkina Faso
President Blaise Compaore, in arranging the primary talks between
the belligerent leaders.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac called on President Laurent Kabila of DRCongo
and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda -- two biggest players in
the conflict -- as well as President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe to
"confirm rapidly their commitments", when he received them
separately at the Elysee presidential palace Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, Museveni, Mugabe, Rwandan President Paster Bizimungu
and other African leaders involved in the war were present or
represented at the 20th French-African summit held in Paris Friday
and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"To each of them, he (Chirac) repeated his feeling that the
elements for a solution exist," said French presidential
spokeswoman Cathrine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
France hopes that Uganda and Rwanda could pull out their troops
from DRCongo first, while the United Nations Security Council
adopts a resolution guaranteeing the security of their borders
with DRCongo.
</P>
<P>
Then, the four nations supporting DRCongo President Kabila --
Angola, Chad, Zimbabwe and Namibia -- will also withdraw their
troops from DRCongo, according to the French plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Paris hopes that the DRCongo will start the process
of democratization and national reconciliation by guaranteeing
equal rights for its citizens, no matter what ethnicities they
belong to.
</P>
<P>
Chirac wanted the belligerent states to sign a ceasefire
agreement on December 8 and 9 under the auspices of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), prior to a meeting of the
OAU in Ouagadoudou, Burkina Faso, on December 17 and 18.
</P>
<P>
South African vice-president Thabo Mbeki said that Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba will call together the leaders of all
the belligerent countries in DRCongo at a meeting in early
December in Lusaka to discuss the methods for arranging a
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan also said that he hopes that
the leaders concerned would run after time with all strength and
emergency when they return home.
</P>
<P>
"They should sign an agreement. But they have promised to
accept a ceasefire, they have also decided to accept an immediate
stop of hostilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Museveni said that he would pull out troops
from DRCongo if security is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
But President Kabila of DRCongo remained vague Saturday
afternoon as for whether he would sign an agreement in time.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ugandan and Rwandan troops should pull out of his
country without pre-condition.

<HEADLINE> Kabila to Sign Preliminary Cease-fire in Early December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRCongo) said Saturday evening that
he would sign a preliminary ceasefire agreement around December 8
in Lusaka, Zambia, with his rivals from Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Kabila made the announcement at a press conference held in a
Parisian hotel, after he was received by French President Jacques
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that a definite ceasefire agreement should be worked
out during a meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to
be held on December 17 and 18 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the belligerent countries in the DRCongo
conflict -- Uganda, Rwanda, Angola, Chad, Namibia and Zimbabwe --
promised Saturday to stop hostilities immediately and sign a
ceasefire agreement as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba will organize a meeting of
the leaders of the countries involved in the DRCongo conflict in
early December in Lusaka to discuss methods for arranging a
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio Info, Kabila said that a stop of
hostilities does not mean putting down arms but means a pause to
launching offensives against the enemies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebel force of DRCongo welcomed the "engagement"
on ceasefire, but said they would continue the fight to "liberate"
territory as much as possible.
