<HEADLINE> Coaching Future Staked at China vs Japan Friendly by sportswriter Liu Guang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua)-- It is no more than a friendly but
has been elevated to a duel with high stakes.
</P>
<P>
Japanese national soccer head coach Philippe Troussier from
France has been looking for a solid performance and above all a
win in the hope of gaining a contract extension through to the
2002 World Cup, to be jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"This is a really crucial game because it will decide the fate
of the Japanese team at the Sydney Olympics and also the 2002
World Cup," the coach told reporters.
</P>
<P>
On the other side his counterpart Yugoslav Bora Milutinovic
seemed more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
"Win or loss is not of importance, because it is just a meet
between two countries. If our target is to qualify for the 2002
World Cup finals, we should not pay so much attention to the
result of such competition which is not very important," said
Milutinovic, who replaced Englishman Bobby Houghton to guide the
national squad early this year.
</P>
<P>
But analyst argued that Milutinovic had no good reason to treat
the match as just a friendly.
</P>
<P>
The March 15 match will be his first formal chance to test his
reputation as the only coach to lead four different countries into
the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The "Wonder Coach" ,a nickname given by the Chinese media, has
shouldered a daunting task of guiding China into the 2002 World
Cup finals, which has been a far cry for the soccer-crazy country.
</P>
<P>
His high-profile takeover has incurred both hope and suspicion
after China turned out to be a Waterloo for foreign coaches.
</P>
<P>
Nan Yong, vice chairman of the Chinese Football Association,
said he would rather put it as a showdown than friendly.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important match. It is neither a friendly nor
an ordinary match. For Milutinovic he will guide the national
side for the first time in official competition, which bears great
importance to himself and his charge," Nan was quoted as saying by
the popular Chinese newspaper Sports Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic also suggested his desire for a win in his debut.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to bring about happiness for the Chinese people," he
said in an interview with Beijing TV before bounding for Kobe.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Euro Stars Arrives for Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan's national soccer coach
Philippe Troussier from France could have a sigh of relief after
his European-based trio all returned home on the eve of Wednesday'
s major friendly international against China.
</P>
<P>
AS Roma's Hidetoshi Nakata and Shoji Jo of Spain's Real
Valladolid arrived on Tuesday morning and showed up in the field
with teammates for the pre-game training.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshi Nanami, who played for Italian club Venezia, had come
back on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Troussier had put the friendly as a "really crucial game",
thinking it will "decide the fate of the Japanese team at the
Sydney Olympics and also the 2002 World Cup".
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman also hoped for a win to gain a contract extension
through to the 2002 World Cup finals, to be jointly hosted by
Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
So far the duel between the two counties are split half with a
7-2-7 record. The last time they met on a soccer field China won
2-0 in Tokyo as Japan prepared for the 1998 World Cup finals.

<HEADLINE> FIFA: S. Africa Ready to Host 2006 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa moved one step
closer to realise their soccer World Cup 2006 dream when a FIFA
delegation unequivocally proclaimed the country ready to host the
event.
</P>
<P>
Alan Rothenberg, head of the technical inspection group, told
reporters on Robben Island in Cape Town that the delegation was
more than impressed with the country's technical ability,
labelling the bid as "outstanding and very impressive".
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg said South Africa presented a strong, comprehensive
bid and one that had the entire support of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with what we saw. South Africa's
presentation was military-like in precision yet captured the heart
and soul of a nation," he said.

<HEADLINE> India not to Link Clinton's Trip to Special Issue: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- India Tuesday asserted that it
will be a mistake to link the upcoming visit of U.S. President
Bill Clinton to any specific issue and maintained that there was
no change in its position on the resumption of the stalled
dialogue with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Referring to U.S. Ambassador Richard Celeste's remarks that
Clinton's interest is in trying to reflect progress on non-
proliferation, an External Affairs Ministry spokesman said, "It
will be a mistake to link the forthcoming visit to any issue or
subject."
</P>
<P>
On Clinton favoring that the Lahore process be "re-energized"
and the Kashmir issue addressed between the leadership of India
and Pakistan "at highest level," he said, "Our position on the
matter remains absolutely unchanged."
</P>
<P>
India has made it clear that "the resumption of the dialogue
could be considered only after Pakistan takes steps to create a
conducive atmosphere by stopping cross-border terrorism in Jammu
and Kashmir and other parts and ceases hostile anti-India
propaganda."

<HEADLINE> Assassination, Mortar Attack Plot of Enemies: Rafsanjani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani said Wednesday the recent assassination and mortar
attack in Iran are signs of a plot conspired by "the enemies."
</P>
<P>
Such "abnormal behaviors" could be an indication of "a plot that
we have recently witnessed its signs," said Rafsanjani, who
currently heads the powerful advisory State Expediency Council.
</P>
<P>
"We should not easily ignore the comments once made by U.S.
officials that next year would be the year of riots and instability
in Iran," Rafsanjani told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But he stopped short of giving more hints what the plot is or
accusing anyone who might behind it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is Iran's arch enemy. The two countries cut off
diplomatic relations in 1980 after Islamic revolutionaries seized
the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held its staff hostage.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified gunmen shot in short range at Saeed Hajjarian, a
close advisor to President Mohammed Khatami and architect of the
reforms, on Sunday in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian is still in a coma in hospital with a bullet lodged at
the top of his spine. But doctors treating him is more optimistic
that he would survive. Reformers accused hardliners for the attack,
while conservatives blamed extremists and foreign hands.
</P>
<P>
The following Monday, the Iraq-based armed opposition Mujahedin
Khalq fired several mortars on a residential area in northern
Tehran, injuring at least four. The outlawed organization had
launched similar attacks on central Tehran in February.
</P>
<P>
"The enemy is trying hard to create instability, unrest and
differences in the country in a bid to hamper people's normal
life," Rafsanjani said, without specifying.
</P>
<P>
The so-called plot emerged as tensions ran high in Iran
following the landslide victory of reformers over their powerful
conservative opponents in the sixth parliamentary elections last
month.
</P>
<P>
Vote-counting results show that reformers supporting the
reformist president would get more than 75 percent of the 290 seats
in the new expanded parliament.
</P>
<P>
Of the 30 seats in the Tehran constituency, the front 29 were
all won by reformers, while centrist Rafsanjani ranked the 30th,
according to initial results.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to complaints by some candidates about possible ballot
rigging, votes from some 1,000 or one-third of the ballot boxes in
Tehran are being re-counted. There are speculations that Rafsanjani
may be removed from the 30-person list.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Warns of Likely Decline in Iraq's Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's oil production was
likely to decline in coming months unless the United Nations
raises the funds that the country could use to repair its
dilapidated oil industry, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
in a report,
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, obtained by the
reporters on Wednesday, Annan said the lamentable state of the
Iraqi oil industry had not been improved.
</P>
<P>
It was apparent that the decline in the condition of all
sectors of the industry continued and was accelerating in some
sectors, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The trend would continue and the ability of the Iraqi oil
industry to sustain the current reduced production level would be
seriously compromised, unless effective action was taken
immediately to reverse the situation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi oil industry was unable to sustain production at
these levels due to its inability to replace the lost capacity of
depleted strata and "watered-out" wells, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of drilling, well work-over and completion
activities, and delays on the commissioning of wet-crude treatment
plants, resulted directly from a lack of spare parts and equipment,
the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Without prompt action, a continued decline in production was
strongly indicated, and the Iraqi oil industry continued to adopt
high-risk solutions in order to balance the production quantity/
oil-price equation against the necessity to export crude oil, to
produce gas for domestic use, and to refine products for
transportation and power generation, the report stressed.
</P>
<P>
Annan recommended to the Security Council that Iraq be allowed
to double funds it spends on oil equipment and spare parts from
600 million U.S. dollars to 1.2 billion dollars over a year's
period ending this June.
</P>
<P>
Annan's report is based on the findings of a group of six
experts. The mission, which was sent to Iraq by the U.N. chief,
visited the country from January 16-31, 2000.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Effective Sanctions Against UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday called for
effective sanctions against the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) in accordance with relevant
Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Wang Yingfan, Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at the open
Security Council debate, which kicked off here on Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions against UNITA are far from being effective," he
said. "(Jonas) Savimbi are still using all kinds of means and
channels available to violate the sanctions imposed by the
Security Council," he said. "One specific example is that the
diamonds produced in the areas under its control are being used in
the illicit arms trade."
</P>
<P>
"It must be pointed out that no country, company or individual
should be allowed to collude with Mr. Savimbi or UNITA in their
attempt to circumvent the sanctions imposed by the Security
Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the violations of the sanctions regime continue,
the peace will not come to Angola and the sufferings of the
Angolan people will continue," he said. "We strongly appeal to the
all countries to truly abide by relevant Security Council
resolutions in accordance with the provisions of the U.N. Charter
by putting an end to the supply of arms and any other forms of
support to UNITA and by taking effective measures to prevent
violations by their own nationals."
</P>
<P>
Voicing his appreciation of the report, Wang said that the
report has sent a very clear signal to the world: to take
effective measure to strengthen sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by the Security Council Sanctions Committee
on Angola, spells out how UNITA has been able to circumvent U.N.
sanctions by buying weapons, mainly from Bulgaria, having them
shipped to African nations and paying for them with diamonds from
mines it controls.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed an arms and fuel embargo on UNITA
in 1993, a year before the United Nations brokered a peace
agreement between the rebels and the government. In 1998, six
months before the peace agreement collapsed, the Council expanded
the measures to include a ban on rebel diamond exports, which are
estimated to have supplied the group with up to 4 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Like other countries, we believe to strengthen the sanctions
against UNITA itself is not our purpose, but rather a tool for
creating necessary conditions for a political settlement," he said.
"It is our hope that the international community can make
concerted efforts to coordinate actions, and to force UNITA lay
down their arms with strengthened sanctions so as to end
hostilities and achieve national reconciliation at an early date."

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russia Determined to Protect Kosovo Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two sides announced their determination after they resumed
the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council at the ambassadorial level
after the western military alliance launched air strikes against
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Wednesday's was the first PJC
council meeting since last March.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Russia said in a joint statement released after the
council meeting that the international community would not
tolerate provocation and other attempts to undermine the peace
process in the region.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed their will to meet in full the aims of the
international community as set out in the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1244.
</P>
<P>
NATO ambassadors discussed with their Russian counterpart the
situation in the Yugoslav province and exchanged views on NATO-
Russia cooperation in the international security presence in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Russia, former foes of the Cold War, started to
compare notes with each other's new strategic concepts. NATO
brought forward a new strategic concept last April while
celebrating its 50th anniversary while Russia worked out a new
national security concept last January.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views and information on a wide
range of issues concerning arms control.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Denies Violating Sanctions Against Angolan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Louis Michel Wednesday said that the United Nations
report which accused his country of violating sanctions against
the UNITA is "full of unfounded words".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Michel said the Belgian
government has completely abided by the U.N. resolutions on the
sanctions against the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Belgium has taken a series of measures to prevent smuggled
diamonds from entering the country, said Michel, who is on his
tour of the central Africa in an effort to find a solution to the
conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. expert group submitted a report to the U.N. Security
Council on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report focusing on the implementation of U.N. sanctions
against UNITA, has accused Belgium of lacking strict control over
its diamond market in Antwerp, leading to a large amount of
diamonds flowing in the country from Angola.
</P>
<P>
The illegal trade of diamonds has enabled UNITA to obtain money
to buy arms and to continue its civil war, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Michel admitted that the Antwerp diamond market is a huge one,
where many people have been engaged in business trading, so the
Belgian government will earnestly study the U.N. report and make a
full response to it after investigations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. banned sales of arms, military equipment and fuel to
UNITA in 1993 after rebel leader Jonas Savimbi refused to accept
his defeat by Angola's President Jose dos Santos in elections in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the U.N. Security Council further placed bans on
UNITA's diamond trade, travel for its leaders and a freeze on its
funds and financial resources.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibars Mourn Death of Former President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of mourners in
Zanzibar, Tanzania Wednesday paid their last respect to the isles'
Former President Idriss Abdul Wakil, who died at the age of 75 at
the Mnazi Mmoja General Hospital in Zanzibar on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar incumbent President Salmin Amour, Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa and Vice President Omar Ali Juma were among the
first dignitaries who started streaming at Wakil's residence to
pay their last respect.
</P>
<P>
Wakil's coffin was taken out of his village house at 4:00 p.m.
local time (GMT 13:00) and went straight to the central mosque for
other prayers before being moved to the village cemetery.
</P>
<P>
All public offices in Zanzibar were ordered to wind up their
business at noon to give time for civil servants to attend funeral
services of the veteran statesman who devoted most of his energy
and time to the country's development.
</P>
<P>
Wakil served as Tanzanian ambassadors to the Federal Republic
of Germany, Holland and Guinea in 1960s and 70s. He was appointed
Chief of Protocol in Tanzania's Foreign Ministry in 1977.
</P>
<P>
He became Zanzibar's President in 1985, replacing Ali Hassan
Mwinyi who became Head of State of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Abdul Wakil, having completed his term in office,
declined to stand for a second term in office in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Although the Indian Ocean islands of Zanzibar joined Tanganyika
in 1964 to form the United Republic of Tanzania, it is a
semiautonomous state with its own government and parliament.

<HEADLINE> Islam in Uganda to Get Permanent Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
handed some land titles to Muslim leaders in the country on
Wednesday evening, making it possible for Islam to have a
permanent home there.
</P>
<P>
The land, about 10 acres, was leased to the leadership of the
Uganda Muslim Supreme Council (UMSC) with a leasehold of 99 years
and is for the building of a mosque complex and offices of the
UMSC, according to a press release from the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
Sheik Muhammad Ssemakula, the Mufti of Uganda, expressed his
gratefulness to the government and particularly to President
Museveni for the issuance of the titles.
</P>
<P>
Since Islam was introduced in Uganda in 1844, it has never got
a permanent home for its central governance until today, he said.
</P>
<P>
About one quarter of the 22.5 million Uganda population are
Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Iran Predicts Rise in Non-oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- With planned reforms in the
economic structure, Iran's non-oil exports are expected to further
rise from the current level of 3 billion U.S. dollars, Minister of
Commerce Mohammad Shariatmadari said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are serious in removing snags in the way of non-oil
exports," the minister said, quoted by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the total volume of Iran's non-oil exports is not very
high because of obstacles to domestic production and lack of
competitiveness of the produced goods.
</P>
<P>
He added that lack of appropriate packing and processing
industries, incongruity between exports-related organs, and
inadequate banking credit allocated to non-oil exports are among
the hindrances that should be overcome.
</P>
<P>
On the Iran-U.S. trade relations, Shariatmadari said Americans
are looking for new markets, such as Iran, to sell their goods and
this is the reason for U.S. lifting of restrictions on grains and
medicine sales to Iran.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iran is ready to purchase goods based on
competitive prices. "Because American goods lack exports insurance
cover, they will not be competitive in the Iranian market," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. have had no diplomatic relations for 20 years
and Washington is keeping a wide-ranging economic sanctions on the
country.
</P>
<P>
Shariatmadari said Iran's trade with Arab countries has been on
the rise since Iranian President Mohammed Khatami came to power in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Saudi Arabia are cooperating in the production of spare
parts, tiers and petrochemicals and will hold trade fairs on each
other's soil.
</P>
<P>
Iran has trade relations with 158 countries. But trade with 85
countries suffered deficits in 1997, things improved in 1998 with
the figure dwindling to 70, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to have adequate supervision over trade with
other countries to turn around our balance of trade," the commerce
minister stressed.

<HEADLINE> Erekat: Third Redeployment Not to Cover Villages Near Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The maps for a long-overdue Israeli
troop withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank did not cover
villages bordering Jerusalem, said Palestinian chief negotiator
Saeb Erekat here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel's security cabinet Wednesday narrowly approved a heavily
revised withdrawal map that did not include the Arab village of
Anata on the fringe of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who rejected previous Israeli
pullback proposals and insisted he be given more populated areas
near Jerusalem, has accepted the new map.
</P>
<P>
The areas to be handed over to the Palestinians include towns in
Jenin, Ramallah, Hebron, Bethlehem, Tulkarm and Qalqilia provinces,
said Erekat, adding that they are relatively close to Jerusalem,
but do not border on the city.
</P>
<P>
The areas amount to 341 square kilometers including 280 square
kilometers to be transferred from Area B (under Palestinian civil
administration) to Area A (under full Palestinian control), 56
square kilometers from Area C (under Israeli control) to Area A,
and the remaining area from Area C to Area B, said the chief
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
This redeployment will increase the areas under full Palestinian
control to 810.2 square kilometers and the areas under Palestinian
civil control to 24.7 square kilometers, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Israel will carry out the pullback on
Monday or Tuesday if the full Israeli cabinet approves the
withdrawal map at its regular, weekly session Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the villages closer to Jerusalem such as Anata, he
said the remarks made by some Israeli officials constituted test
balloons and that Anata was not in the sphere of the Holy City and
could not substitute it with others.
</P>
<P>
"For us, Jerusalem means the Old City as shown by the pre-1967
war border line," Erekat added.
</P>
<P>
Barak initially planned to hand over Anata to Palestinian
control, but backed down due to vehement protests from the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said Anata, Azizia and Abu Dis are in Area B and will be
transferred to full Palestinian control in the future.
</P>
<P>
The maps were worked out by Erekat and Israeli chief negotiator
Oded Eran during their meeting Tuesday night in the West Bank city
of Jericho.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Confident OPEC not to Raise Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Oil producing countries will agree
to maintain the current oil output levels at the forthcoming OPEC
ministerial meeting later this month, said a senior Iraqi official
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad
Rashid said that from those private contacts with his counterparts
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), he got
the impression that the OPEC will not loosen its reins on oil
output, thus foiling the U.S. attempts to raise oil output just to
drive down prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil exports of Iraq, who has been under sweeping U.N. sanctions
since 1990 for its invasion of neighboring Kuwait, are monitored by
the U.N., not by the OPEC.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said he believed that OPEC countries will press for a
rollover of the current oil output ceiling of some 26 million
barrels a day until the end of summer.
</P>
<P>
"We shall strive and fight for that as we have most OPEC
countries behind us," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Saudi Arabia and Iran, two heavy-weight producers of
OPEC, have agreed that world oil producing countries should
guarantee adequate and timely supplies for the good of the world's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Such a move was viewed as a signal that major oil producers will
ease their present production curb which was agreed upon by OPEC
and non-OPEC members last March to uplift oil prices which dropped
to an all-time low in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a recent meeting between Saudi
Oil Minister Ali al-N'aimi and his Iranian counterpart Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh in London.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers are scheduled to hold their annual meeting in
Vienna on March 27 to decide whether to extend or slightly ease the
one-year production reduction agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement due to expire by the end of this month, OPEC
members began to slash their output by 1.7 million barrels per day
from April 1, 1999, while non-OPEC producers cut their daily
production by 400,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. officials, including President Bill Clinton, have
been lobbying for a rise in oil production to cool off the surging
oil prices, which rose to as high as 34.13 U.S. dollars a barrel,
the highest since November, 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq deemed the oil prices as "proper" and "acceptable"
compared with those in the past 10 years except 1998, taking into
consideration of the 25-30 percent inflation rate from 1990 to now.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 6 Injured in U.S.-British Air Raids on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes
attacked civilian and service installations in southern Iraq on
Tuesday, killing one civilian and injuring six others, an Iraqi
military spokesman anounced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, the spokesman
said that at the time of 21:25 (1825 GMT), American and British
warplanes, in 19 formations, made armed sorties from Saudia Arbia
and Kuwait flying over the southern provinces of Basra, Thi-Qar,
Muthana, Qadissiyah, Najaf and Misan.
</P>
<P>
The enemy warplanes bombed civilian installations, leaving one
civilian dead and six others including a child wounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's air-defense artillery confronted with the enemy planes
and forced them to flee back to their bases in Saudia Arabia and
Kuwait, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched the four-night air strikes
against Iraq in December 1998, their warplanes have made a total of
19,583 armed sorties over the two no-fly zones in southern and
northern Iraq, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led Western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War, with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from possible attacks by the Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has never recognized the no-fly zones, which were not
directly covered by a U.N. Security Council resolution.

<HEADLINE> Funds Allocated for Israeli Withdrawal From South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Ministry on
Wednesday appropriated 300 million shekels (75 million U.S.
dollars) to the Defense Ministry for the pullout of the Israel
Defense Force (IDF) from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The total cost for the IDF withdrawal from south Lebanon will be
about one billion shekels (250 million dollars) and the ministry
will continue to allocate the money for the pullout, said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak promised to withdraw the IDF from the
security zone in south Lebanon by July this year and the Israeli
cabinet endorsed the plan earlier this month, which will be carried
out with or without a peace agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
It is still uncertain if Israel can reach a peace deal with
Syria, and the General Staff's Operation Branch of the IDF
presented to Barak on Sunday its plan for a unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The plan, codenamed Morning twilight, said that Israel's
unilateral border adjustment along the international boundary with
Lebanon by moving the border fence northward and westward into
Lebanese territory will be effectively preserved in the event of
the Israel's unilateral pullout.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-proclaimed aim of protecting its northern security from cross-
border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the IDF will remove at least ten outposts deep
inside the security zone, but leave another eight outposts a few
hundred meters from the border in place.
</P>
<P>
The border adjustments, which the IDF has carried out for years,
are aimed at overcoming the topographical inferiority of Israel's
border settlements, which were vulnerable to attacks from inside
the security zone, said the plan.
</P>
<P>
A buffer zone, about 500 meters wide immediately to the north of
the border, will be set up to thwart effective use of light arms
and of light antitank missiles, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
To control this buffer zone, the IDF will make use of advanced
observation and firing methods, and probably declare the buffer
area a no-entry zone that anyone who conducts belligerent activity
from within it will be attacked.
</P>
<P>
If negotiations with Syria are not resumed by May, the IDF,
under the plan, will begin preparations for a unilateral pullout at
the government's instructions.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Issue Report on Kurdish Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry is
working on a comprehensive report on the issue of "Turks of Kurdish
origin" and Turkey's current practices towards ethnic minorities,
Turkish Daily News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report is aimed at pushing for readjusting Turkey's present
laws and regulations concerning ethnic minorities so as to fit
those of the European Union (EU) and to meet the Copenhagen
criteria before Turkey's accession talks for a full EU membership
starts.
</P>
<P>
It will address the thorny issue of Turkish citizens of Kurdish
origin by reviewing the constitution and relevant articles of the
Lausanne Peace Treaty of 1923.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to address the controversial issue of whether the
Kurds should be allowed to produce TV broadcasts and issue
publications in the Kurdish language, the report will explore the
practices of EU member countries on such issues and the ways of
solving the problem in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed that the already-completed first part of the
report examines current EU practices in about 20 pages.
</P>
<P>
The policies exercised in EU member France, which recognizes
equal citizenship regardless of ethnic background or language,
appear to be a good model for Turkey to follow in addressing its
own problems, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In France, French is recognized as the solely official language
to be taught in state schools but its constitution allows citizens
from various ethnic groups to run private schools where their
respective languages are taught.
</P>
<P>
The report's second part, still under preparation, will examine
the Constitution of 1982 and the Lausanne Peace Treaty, it said.
</P>
<P>
It argues that Article Two of the Constitution, which covers a
policy of discrimination among Turkish citizens, should be amended
to grant all Turkish citizens equal rights regardless of their
ethnic roots and religion.
</P>
<P>
The article is also believed to have violated Article 39 of the
Lausanne Treaty which says that "no restrictions shall be imposed
on the free use by any Turkish national of any language in private
intercourse, in commerce, in religion, in the press, or in
publications of any kind or at public meetings."
</P>
<P>
If the necessary constitutional amendments are made, there would
be no room left for the EU to impose concepts such as minority
rights for the Kurds on Turkey, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds, believed to number more than 30 million, are living
in
mountains straddling the borders of Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria and
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, clashes between the Turkish government forces and
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party, which has been fighting for
greater autonomy in the Kurdish-populated southeast, has claimed
37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Azerbaijan Stress Importance of Regional Security, Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Maintaining security and stability
in the Caspian Sea region is in the interest of both Iran and
Azerbaijan, Iranian President Mohammed Khatami said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our interest is realized under a stable and lasting security
and no one, but ourselves, can establish security in our region,"
Khatami told visiting Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Vilayat Guliev.
</P>
<P>
Preserving security is contingent on strengthening of ties based
on mutual understanding and the principle of non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea is rich in oil resources, and Iran maintains
that the littoral states should cooperate in developing and
utilizing the reserves.
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijani foreign minister, who arrived here on Monday,
congratulated Khatami on the country's the successful parliamentary
elections last month, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the elections indicated that human rights are
observed and democracy is practiced in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Given the historical ties between Tehran and Baku and Iran's
important role in the region, the two countries should strive to
strengthen cooperation, the official stressed.

<HEADLINE> NATO Backs Rubin, Solana Stance on Kosovo Albanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- NATO on Wednesday expressed its
support for international envoys' tough talking with the Kosovo
Albanians by confirming reinforcement of two battalions.
</P>
<P>
A NATO spokesman said that he expected to see in the next few
days more reinforcement but he described the reinforcement,
demanded by NATO Supreme Commander Europe Wesley Clark as
temporary and not permanent.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who asked to remain anonymous, said that the
North Atlantic Council, NATO's decision-making body, greatly
supported the firm message delivered by the United States
Undersecretary of State James Rubin and European Union Common
Foreign and Defence Policy High Representative Javier Solana to
the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The message was if the Kosovo Albanians really wanted
international assistance they should not destabilize the situation
in Kosovo and around. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
described during a recent trip to the region the current Kosovo
situation as a "hot spring".
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led multinational peacekeeping force, KFOR, now with a
troop level of 37,000 in Kosovo, has already got the instruction
from NATO to step up intelligence collection on the agitating
activities that are reportedly to have spread from Kosovo into the
Serb Republic of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to make sure
that the agitation does not come from Kosovo, according to the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A NATO presence does not mean that the Kosovo Albanians can
take to activities that threaten regional stability, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
NATO ambassadors also met on Wednesday with their counterpart
from Russia, for a NATO-Russia council meeting for the first time
since the western military alliance started to bomb Yugoslavia
last March.
</P>
<P>
The council discussed issues of how to explain to each other
their respective new strategic concepts endorsed last April and
this January, how to better control conventional and nuclear
weaponry and how to cope with the situation of Kosovo.

OTTAWA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien announced the forming of the Liberal Party's election
committee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he was delighted that party members"

Immigration Minister Elinor Caplan.
</P>
<P>
Chretien led the Liberals to a crushing victory in 1993 and to

<HEADLINE> U.S. Current Account Deficit Hits New High in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. current account
deficit surged to an all-time high of 338.9 billion U.S. dollars
in 1999, more than 100 billion dollars higher than the deficit for
1998, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in the current account, which measures not only
trade in goods and services but also investment flows and foreign
aid payments, was up 53.7 percent from the previous record of 220.
6 billion dollars posted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit set records in all four quarters,
closing out with 99.8 billion dollars in the fourth quarter. That
was 11.1 percent above the 89.1-billion-dollar deficit in the
third quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
The rising trade deficits have increased pressures on the
Clinton administration to erect protectionist trade barriers to
protect American workers, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The current account is considered the best measurement of a
country's international economic standing because it measures not
just the goods and services reflected in the government's monthly
trade reports but also investment flows between countries and
unilateral transfers, a category that reflects U.S. foreign aid
payments.
</P>
<P>
For 1999, all categories showed deterioration. The country's
deficit in goods widened by 100.2 billion dollars to 347.1 billion
dollars. America enjoys surpluses in the services category, which
measures such things as airline travel, but for 1999 that surplus
shrank to 79.6 billion dollars, compared to 82.7 billion dollars
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in investment earnings widened to 24.8 billion
dollars in 1999, more than double the 12.2 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The United States is now the largest debtor nation, meaning
that foreigners own more in U.S. holdings than Americans earn
overseas. That imbalance means that foreign investment earnings
each year also surpass the earnings of U.S. corporations and
individuals on their overseas holdings.
</P>
<P>
The category of unilateral transfers, which includes foreign
aid, climbed to a deficit of 46.6 billion dollars, up from 44.1
billion dollars in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Begins Open Debate on Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
kicked off an open debate on Angola on Wednesday morning as some
of African nations brace for a counter-attack on a U.N. report on
how the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) has been able to circumvent U.N. sanctions by illegally
selling gems for weapons.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Security Council sanction committee,
Robert Fowler of Canada, was the first to speak at the debate. He
is expected to be followed by representatives from at least 22
countries, including foreign ministers of Angola, Togo, Burkina
Faso, South Africa and Belgium, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Rwanda, Zambia and Bulgaria are also
expected to speak at the open Council debate, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The report, compiled by the U.N. Sanction Committee headed by
Robert Fowler of Canada, spells out how UNITA has been able to
sidestep U.N. sanctions by buying weapons, mainly from Bulgaria,
having them shipped to African nations and paying for them with
diamonds from mines it controls.
</P>
<P>
Primarily, the report accuses President Blaise Compaoro of
Burkina Faso, President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo and the late
Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko of having personally received
diamonds for having helped UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi with arms
and fuel shipments in violations of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Burkina Faso, Togo, Rwanda and Bulgaria have denied the
allegations. Togo is to host a summit of the Organization of
African Unity in July.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed an arms and fuel embargo on UNITA
in 1993, a year before the United Nations brokered a peace
agreement between the rebels and government. In 1998, six months
before the peace agreement collapsed, the Council expanded the
measures to include a ban on rebel diamond exports, which are
estimated to have supplied the group with up to 4 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Togolese Foreign Minister Joseph Koffingoh denied Monday that
any weapons or diamonds were shipped through the country, saying
the only help Togo gave to Angola was to accept refugees, which it
was doing on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister of Burkina Faso, Issouf Ouedraogo, denied
the U.N. allegations against his president and said his U.N.
ambassador would make a full statement when the Security Council
holds an open meeting on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> EU Stresses Food Safety on Consumer Rights Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union stressed on
Wednesday food safety and consumer protection on computer networks
to mark the International Consumer Rights Day.
</P>
<P>
David Byrne, EU's health and consumer protection commissioner,
told a one-day conference here that the business community could
not and should not underestimate the economic power of consumers
and it needs the confidence of consumers to prosper.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner estimated that some 5,000 billion euro (4,850
billion U.S. dollars) would be spent on goods and services this
year alone across Europe and he asked public authorities to play
their due role in safeguarding the rights and interests of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
The consumer rights include the rights to be protected, to be
informed, to choose and to be heard.
</P>
<P>
Byrne said that he hoped the one-day conference in Brussels
would ensure the consumer voice was heard loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
The consumers of foods need to restore their confidence after
the European countries have been plagued by mad-cow diseases and
food contamination in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, proposed to complement and modernize EU food
legislation by 2002 and to set up a European Food Authority as the
authoritative source of scientific advice and information for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner urged that his institution gets to ensure that
most online transactions are trouble-free so as to boost the
confidence of consumers with e-commerce and with its easy-to-use

<HEADLINE> European Plane Makers Complain About EU Fuel Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- European airplane manufacturers
on Wednesday lodged strong complaints about a European Union
proposal to ask EU member states to tax commercial aviation fuels.
</P>
<P>
The European Association of Aerospace Industries said that the
European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, was
not taking the best way to address the environmental impact of
civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
The EU proposal, coming out at the end of months of debate,
still needs a unanimous support by all the 15 EU member states to
be effective.
</P>
<P>
The European Association of Aerospace Industries said that the
commission's approach toward taxation would not be the best way
out in that the commission's own study had shown that taxation of
flights within the EU would yield a reduction of only 0.26 percent
of total carbon dioxide emissions from airplane transportation.
</P>
<P>
It added that the EU executives should look elsewhere for
alternative measures to reduce air pollution, measures such as en-
route charges, emission trading and voluntary agreements.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission tried to introduce a similar tax in
1997 but member states rejected it.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that the commission proposed taxation would only
force up the prices of flight tickets and may even squeeze smaller
airlines out of service.

<HEADLINE> Hackers Attack Canada's Sensitive Systems 531 Times: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's most sensitive military
and government computer systems were attacked 531 times between
October and November last year, The Globe and Mail reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a study conducted in the two months, the newspaper said
international hackers launched 34 denial-of-service attacks on the
federal computers without success.
</P>
<P>
The cyber sleuths also detected 23 failed attempts to break
into computers and steal or alter data. In addition, the study
recorded a total of 474 surreptitious probes for system
vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
Six systems frequently under attacks included the Department of
National Defence, the Communications Security Establishment,
Correctional Services, Transport Canada, Public Works and the
Canadian International Development Agency, according to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Most attacks appear to have come from within Canada, Britain
and the United States, with a handful number identified from 29
other countries, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The study, which was commissioned by the Canadian federal
government, recommends establishing a central hack-attack
reporting and response office within the federal government.

The Security Council also reiterated that the Government of
Haiti bears particular responsibility for the further
strengthening and effective functioning of the Haitian National
Police and the justice system.
</P>
<P>
The Council commended the Secretary-General for ensuring a
phased transition to the International Civilian Support Mission in
Haiti(MICIVIH)) and recognized that economic rehabilitation and
reconstruction constitute a major task facing the Government and
people of Haiti.
</P>
<P>
The Council called on the international community to provide
assistance for the sustainable development of Haiti.
</P>
<P>
The Council welcomed the initiative of the United Nations
Economic and Social Council to develop a strategic framework and a
comprehensive approach for a long-term United Nations programme of
support for Haiti and underlined the vital link between national
stability and economic and social development.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Angola Report Conducive to Ending War in Angola, Fowler Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chairman of a U.N.
Security Council sanction committee said here Wednesday that the
committee's report is conducive to ending the long-standing civil
war in Angola by cutting off the financial and arms supplies for
the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (
UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The committee chairman, Robert Fowler of Canada, told an open
Security Council debate, "This report will, if acted upon, have a
real and substantial impact on UNITA's ability to wage war -- by
reducing its revenues, increasing its costs, and choking off its
supply."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council kicked off an open debate on Angola
on Wednesday morning as some of African nations brace for a
counter-attack on a U.N. report on how the rebel National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has been able to
circumvent U.N. sanctions by illegally selling gems for weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has repeatedly declared UNITA, led by
Jonas Savimbi, to be the principal cause of the resumption of
Angola's civil war. More than one million people have lost their
lives during the 30 years of war in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
"Two hundred more died each day," Fowler said. "It is a
brutally vicious war in which the principal victims are innocent
civilians."
</P>
<P>
The report, compiled by the U.N. Sanction Committee headed by
Robert Fowler of Canada, spells out how UNITA has been able to
sidestep U.N. sanctions by buying weapons, mainly from Bulgaria,
having them shipped to African nations and paying for them with
diamonds from mines it controls.
</P>
<P>
Primarily, the report accuses President Blaise Compaoro of
Burkina Faso, President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo and the late
Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko of having personally received
diamonds for having helped UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi with arms
and fuel shipments in violations of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Burkina Faso, Togo, Rwanda and Bulgaria have denied the
allegations. Togo is to host a summit of the Organization of
African Unity in July. Their representatives are expected to speak
at the Wednesday Council debate.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed an arms and fuel embargo on UNITA
in 1993, a year before the United Nations brokered a peace
agreement between the rebels and government. In 1998, six months
before the peace agreement collapsed, the Council expanded the
measures to include a ban on rebel diamond exports, which are
estimated to have supplied the group with up to 4 billion U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Warns of N.Irish Crisis Ahead of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said
on Wednesday the Northern Ireland peace process was in deep crisis
and there was little possibility of any breakthrough in Washington
talks.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at Dublin airport as he prepared to leave
for the United States for St Patrick's Day talks on the province's
future, the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
Politicians are gathering in Washington for meetings with
President Bill Clinton to coincide with Friday's celebrations of
St Patrick's Day, Ireland's national day.
</P>
<P>
They must try to restart the process after Britain last month
suspended Northern Ireland's home rule institutions over lack of
progress on disarmament by Irish Republican Army (IRA)guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said it
was "absolutely imperative" the province's self-rule executive be
restarted before a May 22 target to complete disarmament -- a
deadline he admitted was unlikely to be met.
</P>
<P>
But he said the revival of the executive was linked to the
disarmament process and he criticized Adams for suggesting the
government drop its insistence on weapons "decommissioning".
</P>
<P>
"Realistically I have to say the prospects of achieving
complete decommissioning by May 22 are poor," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political ally in the campaign for a
united Ireland, renewed its call for Britain to restore the power-
sharing institutions which had brought together majority
Protestants and representatives of the Roman Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen, also on his way to the U.S,
said the talks in Washington would be a chance to review progress
following meetings in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government has been trying to advance the process by
urging Britain to reduce its military presence in Northern Ireland
while seeking a declaration from the IRA that its war is over.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said Britain would only cut troop levels in Northern
Ireland for security reasons, not politics.
</P>
<P>
"Normalization is not about concessions and not about wishful
thinking. It reflects precisely what is happening on the ground,
the progress we have made and the progress we have yet to make,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
While the IRA and the major Protestant paramilitary groups are
sticking to ceasefires, violence has returned to Northern Ireland.
Much of it is blamed on renegade splinter groups.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls For Timely Elections in Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Wednesday urged Haitian Government to hold
elections timely.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the 15-member Security Council reviewed
the latest report by the U.N. Secretary-General on the current
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council stressed in a presidential statement that
timely, free and fair elections are crucial to all aspects of
Haiti's development and strongly urged Haitian authorities to work
cooperatively together in order to finalize arrangements for
holding credible elections as rapidly as possible so as to restore,
promptly and fully, the lapsed Parliament and independent local
governments.
</P>
<P>
On march 3, Haiti's provisional Electoral Council postponed the
vote originally scheduled for March 19, citing continuing problems
with registration. Five days later, the Council set April 9 as the
new date.
</P>
<P>
Haiti's President Rene Preval said the Council had no authority
to announce a new date without presidential approval, which cast
fresh doubt on the elections in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
Preval dissolved parliament in January of last year on the
grounds that the terms of two-thirds of the Senate and all of the
Chamber of Deputies had expired.
</P>
<P>
The results of Haiti's last elections of April 1997 were
annulled because of fraud.

<HEADLINE> EP Votes for Ban Lifting on British Chocolate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament voted on
Wednesday to lift a 30-year-old ban on the sale in the European
continent of British milk chocolate.
</P>
<P>
Though Belgium, France and the Netherlands voted against the
new regulation, their opposition was overruled by the majority
that included Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Ireland,Portugal
and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The vote of the European legislators cleared obstacles for
final approval by the 15 European Union member states at a
European council of ministers later on.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament passed the proposed new chocolate
regulation that allows production of chocolate using as much as 5
percent of vegetable fats other than pure cocoa butter and the end
product is still called chocolate.
</P>
<P>
But British milk chocolate thus made have to be called as
family milk chocolate in order to be sold in the rest of the
European Union, of which seven member states are also producing
chocolate using vegetable fats.
</P>
<P>
The proposed regulation, first agreed upon by EU ministers last
October after more than 15 years of debate, allows the usage of
six types of vegetable fats to be used in the production of
chocolate but the product has to be clearly labelled as such.
</P>
<P>
Chocolate purists on the European continent, especially in
Belgium and France, have been arguing that the cheaper British
milk chocolate is an inferior product and some even warn that the
proposed regulation would affect adversely third-world countries
that produce cocoa butter.
</P>
<P>
The European Union consumes almost half of the world's total
cocoa butter.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Recommends to Double Iraq's Funds for Oil Spare Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under a Security Council resolution adopted in early 1998, Iraq
could draw 300 million dollars from its oil revenues in a period
of six months to import oil equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. sources, as of January 31, 2000, contracts
worth 1.5 billion dollars has been put on hold, and the United
States, one of the 15-member of the sanctions committee on Iraq,
has put on hold contracts worth more than 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Annan emphasized in the report that the large number of
contracts placed on hold, particularly those on electricity, water,
sanitation, transport and the telecommunications, were far too
high and had an impact on the health and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
In the health sector, Annan once again urged an increase in the
amount of money that Iraq could spend on public health care.
</P>
<P>
Citing acute respiratory infection, pneumonia and other severe
illness, the U.N. chief said that only one child in 10 was being
correctly treated and only 17 percent of the health workers in the
country could get adequate training.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the state of key aspects of health care
provision, Annan said "Neither the improvement in the distribution
nor in the health infrastructure envisaged in my supplementary
report have materialized."
</P>
<P>
Iraq is now allowed to export unlimited oil, partly to buy food,
medicine and other necessities for its people. It has been under U.
N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Greek-Turkish Ties Depend on Cyprus Problem, Says ND Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Greece's main opposition New
Democracy (ND) leader Costas Karamanlis warned Wednesday that full
rapprochement between Greece and Turkey could not be completed
without a viable solution for the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar here Wednesday, Karamanlis said that his
party did not reject the notion of dialogue with Turkey, but such
a dialogue should be based on respect for territorial integrity
and sovereign rights, respect for international law and treaties
as well as the renouncement of the threat to use force.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that Greece was willing to support Turkey's
entry into the European Union (EU) as long as the neighboring
country behaved as a European country and not as an international
troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
As for the Cyprus problem, Karamanlis stressed that Turkey
must work towards a fair solution for the island republic, a
solution which guarantees the co-existence of Cyprus' two
communities through a federation that will eventually become a
full EU member state.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have closely gone to war
three times in the past 26 years over their territorial dispute in
the eastern Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem, but the two
neighbors have since last June taken steps to improve their
strained relations, with the holding of several rounds of low-
level dialogue and the signing of nine bilateral cooperation
agreements.

KAMPALA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
held talks with U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations Bernard Miyet here on Wednesday to discuss the
deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Miyet told a joint press conference after the meeting that he
briefed Museveni on the steps being taken by the U.N. to implement
the resolution of the U.N. Security Council to deploy 5,500-strong
peacekeepers in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted last month will help push forward the
implementation of the Lusaka agreement which the U.N. believes is
the most viable tool to solving the conflict in the vast central
African country, Miyet said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the leaders of Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola, the DRC
and Rwanda had given their assurances about the security of U.N.
peacekeepers and full cooperation to allow the U.N. observing
mission to carry out its work.
</P>
<P>
Museveni reiterated his full support for the Lusaka agreement
and welcomed the U.N. decision to deploy peacekeepers to monitor
the ceasefire. All the warring parties to the DRC conflict signed
the Lusaka agreement last year.
</P>
<P>
Miyet has visited the DRC, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Rwanda in an
effort to gain firm commitment to peace from the parties concerned
before the deployment of peacekeepers.

NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The seventh International
Horticulture and Floriculture Trade Exhibition, organized by
Kenya's Event and Conference Organizers Ltd, opened in the Kenyan
capital Nairobi on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Launched by Kenyan Minister of Agriculture Chris Obure, the
three-day event has attracted 105 growers, suppliers, exporters
and importers from over a dozen of countries including Britain,
France, Germany, Greece, Norway, Spain, Poland, the Netherlands,
Israel, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The exhibitors, including some 40 Kenyan companies, will
display their wide ranges of new products, planting and breeding
technology, materials and equipment related to the horticultural
industry such as chemicals, fertilizers, cooling and irrigation
facilities.
</P>
<P>
During the event, a seminar will be held by the organizer,
focusing on management and control in horticulture, world
marketing and trade demand in relation to horticulture.

<HEADLINE> Refugees in Guinea Bring Pressure on Environment: UNEP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- About 600,000 refugees in
southern Guinea from Sierra Leone and Liberia have brought great
pressure on the environment of the host country, a newly released
report by the Nairobi- based United Nations Environment Program
(UNEP) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the rural areas of Guinea, where the refugee camps are
situated, the demand for food has led to the transformation of
forest areas into arable lands and this has had severe impacts on
the biodiversity and water systems, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to UNEP Executive Director Klaus Toepfer, "many
displaced people have sought refuge in urban centres, where
populations have increased sharply with resulting waste removal
and water problems."
</P>
<P>
"The authorities have simply not been able to cope with such a
massive increase of population and in a number of areas sanitation
management systems have completely collapsed, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP report, which was based upon a desk-study followed by
a joint field mission to Guinea, was forwarded to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan last Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the UNEP-led team appealed for more
international support and assistance to the West African country.
The United Nations should develop an action plan to incorporate
sustainable use and management of natural resources in the
country, it said.

<HEADLINE> Five S. Africans Supporting UNITA Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa on Wednesday
has received a United Nations report on sanctions busting in
support of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The report identified five South African citizens helping UNITA
procure arms since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Among them are two South African brothers named Ronnie and Joe
de Decker who have supplied UNITA with arms such as mortar bombs,
anti-tank and anti- aircraft weapons, grenades, small arms,
ammunition and medicines procured from Eastern Europe worth five
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, they even arranged for foreign instructors to train
UNITA soldiers how to use the SAM16 missile system.
</P>
<P>
Another South African national named Piet Hand was reported to
have contacts with a number of licensed small mine operators in
South Africa. He laundered UNITA diamonds by mixing them with
stones produced from the small mines.
</P>
<P>
The fourth South African mentioned in UNITA's supply chain is
Johannes Parfirio Parreira, who has sold 50,000 pairs of military
boots to UNITA, as well as socks and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The last South African identified in the report is Jacques
"Kiki" Lemaire, who provided aircraft to carry weapons destined
for UNITA.
</P>
<P>
A panel of experts compiled the document after a six-month
investigation into transgressions of the fuel, arms, travel,
financial and diamond trade embargo by the U.N. against UNITA,
which came into effect in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Vows to Resist U.S. Pressure to Lift Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi official said
Wednesday his country Iraq is determined to foil the U.S. scheme to
pressure the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
into increasing oil output.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. sought to fluctuate oil prices in order to reap profits
through speculation on the international oil market, said Oil
Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has so far failed to secure concrete pledges from the
OPEC members for a substantial rise in production in spite of
furious lobbying, he said. "The worst that could happen will be a
marginal increase that is not bound to flood the market or result
in a price dive."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Iran, two OPEC heavyweights, have agreed that
oil producers should guarantee adequate and timely supplies for the
good of the world's economy, hinting at a possible ease of current
production curbs.
</P>
<P>
The curbs, imposed by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers since
last year, have salvaged oil prices from below 10 U.S. dollars a
barrel to above 30 dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that it would not bow to the U.S. pressure on
the OPEC members to raise oil production at the upcoming OPEC
ministerial meeting on March 27 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led Western oil-consuming countries have urged OPEC
members to lift production in the third quarter this year so as to
drive down oil prices, which have been steadily hiking to some 35
dollars a barrel, the highest since November 1990.
</P>
<P>
On March 7, U.S. President Bill Clinton warned that OPEC members
could face sliding demand and eventually less revenue if oil prices
remain at the current high level.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq deemed the oil price as "proper" and "acceptable"
compared with those in the past 10 years except 1998, taking into
consideration of the 25-30 percent inflation rate from 1990 to now,
Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that due to U.S. manipulation, oil prices in the
world oil market fluctuated sharply from the end of 1997 to mid-
1999, when the oil output surged in an unjustifiable way and the
prices once collapsed to as low as nine dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Rashid will attend the annual OPEC ministerial meeting, which is
to decide whether to enhance oil production to offset a shortage
that now stands at more than 2 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Second only to Saudi Arabia in oil reserves, Iraq produced 3
million barrels per day before U.N. imposed the crippling economic
sanctions. It now produces 1.9 million barrels a day due to its
dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Iraq has been under
severe U.N. sanctions and is allowed to use part of its oil exports
revenue to buy humanitarian supplies for its people whose life was
shattered by the hardships incurred from the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Keep Policy of Supporting Unity of Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt, which has resumed ties
with Sudan at the ambassadorial level, will maintain its policy of
backing the integrity and unity of Sudan, the Sudanese daily Alwan
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Egypt's new ambassador in Khartoum,
Mohammed Asem Ibrahim, as saying that Egypt objects to the calls
for self-determination of southern Sudan, which may lead to Sudan's
disintegration.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, who presented his credentials to Sudanese
President Omar el-Bashir on Tuesday, said the issue of Sudan is an
internal affair and it is in Egypt's interests to see a united
Sudan free from political conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Egypt withdrew its ambassador from Khartoum in 1996 after an
abortive assassination attempt against Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Abeba in June 1995. Cairo
suspected that Khartoum masterminded the murder.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two countries thawed after Bashir sidelined
Hassan al-Turabi, who was seen as the Islamist ideologue behind the
government
</P>
<P>
"Sudan is our shield, and we are not involved in any internal
conflicts in Sudan," Ibrahim noted.
</P>
<P>
On coordination between the U.S and Egyptian roles in Sudan, and
the recent visit of the U.S. envoy, Harry Johnston, to Khartoum,
the ambassador said Egypt share similar views on the issue of Sudan
not only with the United States but also with Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Harry Johnston has said that the United States is not supporting
the separation of southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim said that the U.S envoy's first tour of Sudan was a
positive move coming after relations between Washington and
Khartoum severed, and this means a more international recognition
of Sudan and further development of Sudan's ties with the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Washington closed its embassy in Khartoum in February 1996 in
the wake of the imposition of international sanctions on Sudan for
failing to extradite perpetrators of the abortive assassination
attempt against Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Washington, however, sent in 1997 a roving diplomatic mission to
Khartoum but such representation froze after the terrorist attack
on two U.S embassies in east Africa in August 1998, killing 12
Americans among 224 others.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, U.S warplanes bombed a chemical factory near
Khartoum thought to be owned by Osama bin Laden whom Washington
blamed for the embassy bombings and other anti-American activities.
</P>
<P>
On the Libyan-Egyptian initiative on the issue of Sudan, the
Egyptian ambassador said Egypt and Libya, having the longest
international borders with Sudan, are seriously affected by and
thus worrying about the Sudan conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Cairo and Tripoli last August called for holding a conference on
national reconciliation of Sudan, which would be attended by the
Khartoum government, and the northern opposition in exile and the
southern rebels, in a bid to end the 17-year-long civil war.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Becomes More livable: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok, a city notorious for its
serious air pollution and traffic jam, becomes more livable with
better conditions and environment, the Thai News Agency (TNA)
Wednesday quoted a recent survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 52.7 percent of the 12,420 respondents to the survey,
conducted by Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), said that
they found that the city has become cleaner and greener in the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
Less litter in public places and more impressive decorations
make the city more enjoyable to live for Bangkokians, said the
survey, conducted between December 27, 1999 and January 20, 2000
in 50 districts of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BMA is carrying on its plan to further develop
and decorate Bangkok into an even greener and more livable city
after the World Bank declared last month the capital city Asia's
prototype city in air pollution management, TNA said.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted Deputy Bangkok Governor Mahintra
Tanboonperm as saying that the planned development and decorations
of the city include the erection of fountains and symbolic
sculptures in key areas.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet OKs Thai Airways' Privatization Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has endorsed the
privatization plan of the Thai Airways International Plc (THAI),
government spokesman Akrapol Sorasuchart said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, which aims to raise fresh capital, THAI will
sell about 400 million new and existing shares this year, cutting
the state's holding in the national carrier to 70 percent from 93
percent, Akrapol was quoted by Thailand News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
THAI will issue about 300 million new shares while another
tranche of about 100 million shares will come from the holding of
the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry now holds 1.3 billion shares, or 93
percent stake in Thai Airways. The sale will reduce its stake to
70 percent under the expanded equity.
</P>
<P>
The airline first announced a plan to issue new shares to raise
capital last June, with the aim of cutting the Finance Ministry's
holding as a step toward privatization.
</P>
<P>
A Merrill Lynch report has said the company had debt at 9.6
times its equity at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Revenues from the sale of the firm's new shares are required to
be used only for its debt payment scheme.
</P>
<P>
Privatization of some state enterprises is a key to the Thai
government's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some foreign airlines, including Singapore
Airlines, have shown interest in bidding for a share in the Thai
carrier.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Inventories, Sales Rise in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Businesses boosted their
stockpiles of goods on shelves and backlogs moderately in January,
while sales climbed at an even faster rate, pushing down supplies
to the leanest level on record, the Commerce Department said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Business inventories rose by 0.5 percent in January to
seasonally adjusted 1.15 trillion U.S. dollars, slightly stronger
than the 0.4 percent rise many analysts were predicting. That
matched the gain in inventories posted in December.
</P>
<P>
It was the 13th straight month in which businesses added to
their inventories.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, business sales grew by 0.8 percent to 876.6
billion dollars, following a sizzling 1.2 percent rise in December.
</P>
<P>
January's sales increase brought the inventory-to-sales ratio
to a record low of 1.31, meaning it would take 1.31 months to
exhaust inventories at the January sales pace, further evidence of
a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
Many economists predict the Federal Reserve will boost interest
rates for a fifth time since June at their meeting next week to
keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
In January, wholesalers increased their inventories by 0.7
percent to 306.7 billion dollars, following a 0.4 percent increase
in December. Retailers boosted their inventories by 0.5 percent to
371.8 billion dollars, and factories' inventories grew by 0.3
percent to 471.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the sales front, factories posted the biggest gain with
sales rising a sizable 1 percent to 371.7 billion dollars.
Wholesalers saw their sales rise 0.8 percent to 242.1 billion
dollars, while retailers posted a sales increase of 0.4 percent to
262.8 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Up in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The industrial production at
the nation's factories, utilities and mines rose at a slower-than-
expected pace in February as the output of cars, carpeting and
appliances fell after posting strong gains the month before, the
Federal Reserve reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production increased by 0.3 percent last month,
weaker than the 0.5 percent gain many analysts were forecasting.
That followed a big 1.1 percent leap in production in January.
</P>
<P>
Operating capacity was 81.7 percent in February, the same as
the month before and slightly less than some analysts expected.
Capacity was below levels usually associated with a pickup in
inflation.
</P>
<P>
February's production was held back by a 1.7 percent decline in
the production of automotive products, including cars and trucks.
It also was dampened by declines in the output of carpeting and
furniture, which fell 1.1 percent, and a 2.5 percent drop in
output of consumer appliances.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said business
inventories rose by 0.5 percent in January while sales grew at a
faster rate of 0.8 percent, bringing the inventory-to-sales ratio
to a record low of 1.31. That means it would take 1.31 months to
exhaust inventories at the January sales pace, further evidence of
a booming economy.

Many economists expect the Federal Reserve to boost interest
rates for a fifth time since June at its meeting next week to slow
the economy and keep inflation under control.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Begin to Eliminate Chechen Rebel Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russian armed forces have
began a new stage of operation in Chechnya to eliminate the rebel
leadership, said the Russian General Staff Chief Anatoly Kvashnin
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The operation will be carried out "either as was the captured
Chechen commander Salman Raduyev scenario or they will be killed,"
Kvashnin said.
</P>
<P>
This phase will take a long time, he said, noting that "the
duration will be determined by the concrete situation and
realistic possibilities."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other steps will be taken against the militants who
melted into the villages. "They should be prevented from
continuing their sabotage and intimidation of the population,"
Kvashnin said.
</P>
<P>
"The elimination of the organized armed formations that held
sway over specific regions has been brought to an end. We control
all of Chechen territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kvashnin vowed to eliminate all militant figures, including
Basayev, Khattab and the brought-in mercenaries, adding that the
Russian armed forces will be used in special actions.
</P>
<P>
He denied assertions that rebel leaders gave up Raduyev in
exchange for the possibility of fleeing abroad by Basayev, Khattab
and Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
Asked about acting Russian President Vladimir Putin's idea of
introducing direct presidential rule in Chechnya for two years,
Kvashnin said that "such decisions depend on the concrete
development of the situation."

<HEADLINE> Indian Parliament Gives Final Approval to Telecom Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indian parliament granted
here Wednesday its final approval to the Telecom Regulatory
Authority of India (TRAI) Bill (Amendment 2000), which aims at
strengthening the regulatory role of the TRAI while transferring
its power of disputes adjudication to a special independent
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed by the Lok Sabha, or the lower house on March
13, was adopted by the Rajya Sabha, or the upper house, by a voice
vote on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a debate on the bill, Indian Communications
Minister Ramvilas Paswan said that the amendment was intended to
strengthen the telecom regulatory body instead of divesting its
powers as charged by some opposition parties in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bill, the TRAI would have powers to fix tariff
besides regulating and giving recommendations on new
telecommunication services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal
would be created for adjudicating disputes between a licensor and
a licensee, the service providers and the consumers, which, the
government said, would help reduce the burden on the TRAI.
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to make the regulator strong by giving more
powers and the two bodies have been made fully independent,"
Paswan said. "We have transferred some powers from the erstwhile
regulator to the newly set up tribunal and no power has been taken
away."
</P>
<P>
The Bill has caused a major controversy in the Indian
parliament and some opposition members who charged the government
with rushing through the bill and staged a walk-out when the lower
house cast vote on it Monday.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Biggest Debt Defaulter Declared Bankrupt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Central Bankruptcy
Court Wednesday adjudged that Thai Petrochemical Industry Plc (TPI)
, the country's biggest debt defaulter, is insolvent.
</P>
<P>
The court also ordered TPI to reorganize, but the company's
existing management will continue to act as interim executive
under the supervision of the official receiver.
</P>
<P>
The steering committee of creditors of TPI, representing
financial institutions that hold more than 68 percent of TPI's 3.4
billion U.S. dollars debt, announced their satisfaction with the
court's decision, a press release of the committee said.
</P>
<P>
The official receiver will be responsible for determining which
creditors are entitled to vote at the planner appointment meeting.
</P>
<P>
The official receiver will also arrange for the scheduling of a
planner appointment meeting among TPI's creditors, which is
expected to occur in the next four weeks.
</P>
<P>
All 148 creditors with claims arising prior to the order for
the reorganization are entitled to vote for the appointment of the
planner.
</P>
<P>
The committee is confident that a creditor supported and court
sanctioned planner will submit a comprehensive rehabilitation plan
of TPI to the creditors within the required 90 days.
</P>
<P>
TPI defaulted soon after the devaluation of the Thai baht in
July, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The debt deal has been under negotiation since August 1997,
when TPI declared a unilateral moratorium on debt interest and
principal payments, citing losses because of the baht's sudden
slide from around 25.8 baht per dollar in July 1997 to around 32
by mid-August.
</P>
<P>
Among its main foreign creditors are the World Bank's
International Finance Corp, Bank of America, Citibank, Australia
and New Zealand Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and Sanawa Bank.

Ericsson (Thailand) Ltd., said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Kemvall said that Ericsson
achieved a net sale of 6.3 billion baht (165.8 million U.S.
dollars) in 1999, an increase of about 15 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Against the downward trend of Ericsson's market share in the
world's mobile phone market, which dropped from 15 percent to 12
percent in 1999 due to technical trouble, the company's share in
the Thai market grew from 15 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kamvall expected his company will have better performance in
1999 but gave no figures for the expected sales increase.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson (Thailand) has also established contract with leading
local mobile phone service company, the Advanced Info Service, to
promote wireless e-commerce, which will be launched in the second
half of this year in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson is promoting its mobile internet technology, which,
according to the company, will be as common as fixed internet in
four years.
</P>
<P>
President of Ericsson Group Kurt Hellstrom said at the press
conference that personalized service like mobile internet is what
the customers want.
</P>
<P>
"With mobile internet, you can access to the internet anywhere,
anytime and the technology of combining mobile and internet is
what the Ericsson's strength lies," he said.

<HEADLINE> East African Countries to Join Hands in Curbing Flow of Small Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the Great
Lakes Region and Horn of Africa countries signed a declaration
here on Wednesday, vowing to join efforts to stem the
proliferation of small arms and create a conducive environment for
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that ministers from Burundi, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea,
Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan and Uganda gathered together and reached a
consensus over the problem.
</P>
<P>
They all recognized the devastating consequences caused by the
proliferation of small arms and the inadequate capacity of the
countries to patrol and monitor their borders.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the need for information sharing and cooperation
in all matters relating to illicit small arms and light weapons
among governments and civil society.
</P>
<P>
They also urged source countries to ensure that all
manufacturers, traders, brokers, financiers and transporters of
small arms and light weapons are regulated through licensing.
</P>
<P>
They will hold a follow-up conference on the issue as soon as
possible, Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana revealed.
</P>
<P>
The four-day ministerial conference, which started Sunday, was
a preparatory meeting for the U.N. Conference on Small Arms in
2001.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Win Presidential Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Governor George W. Bush won Democratic and Republican
presidential nomination respectively after Tuesday's primaries in
six states.
</P>
<P>
Both of them celebrated Tuesday night after anticlimactic
primaries in the six Southern states -- Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas.
</P>
<P>
The contests pushed each man well beyond the number of
delegates needed to win their parties' presidential nominations at
the national conventions this summer.
</P>
<P>
Associated Press reported that Bush's delegate count would
reach 1,093, and Gore's would reach at least 2,530, far more than
required by each party.
</P>
<P>
Before today's vote, Bush had 701 of the 1,034 delegates needed
to win the Republican presidential nomination, while Gore had 1,
921 of the 2,170 required for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Bush won primaries on March 7, when contests were held
in 16 states and became de facto presidential candidates after
their rivals, former Senator Bill Bradley and Senator John McCain,
were forced to drop out of the race.
</P>
<P>
Both men are now focused on the coming general election battle
which are expected to be tough and bitter.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he was braced for Gore's "politics of personal
destruction and distortions", while Gore argued Bush's "risky tax
scheme" would hurt the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
"We must face one more Clinton-Gore campaign. ... This time we
will prevail and they will fail," Bush told a cheering crowd in
Austin, Texas, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There are two avenues leading from November of 2000. The path
that I want to lead our country toward continues our prosperity,
uses the surplus for constructive purposes," Gore told his
supporters in Tallahassee, Florida.

<HEADLINE> Japan Forced to Scoreless Tie in Soccer Friendly with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Goalkeeper Jiang Jin showed fine
reflexes to help save China from a loss in a friendly against
Japan Wednesday in Kobe, Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japan was on the offensive for most of the game but they failed
to convert their scoring chances as the 1.98-meter goaltender
displayed amazing performance to neutralize the attack of the home
side.
</P>
<P>
Japan's head coach Philippe Troussier had hoped for a win as he
recalled Italian Serie A players Hidetoshi Nakata and Hiroshi
Nanami as well as Spanish-based Shoji Jo for the game.
</P>
<P>
The three European-based players almost broke the ice in the
48th minute with Nataka and Jo set up Nanami's shot, which found
the safe hands of Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Nanami fired a left footer from outside the area on a free kick
in the 67th minute, only to see Jiang again dump the attempt.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, midfielder Shigeyoshi Mochizuki dived for a
header in the area but Jiang blocked the shot with his left foot.
</P>
<P>
Masashi Nakayama, Japan's only goal scorer in the World Cup
finals, did
find the back of the net but was ruled offside.
</P>
<P>
In the last 15 minutes China tried to fight back but also
failed to make any breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have a level record standing at 7-2-7. In the
last previous encounter, China beat Japan 2-0 in the Dynasty Cup
in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- As the information revolution
sweeps the world, dozens of mayors, company chief executive
officers (CEOs), researchers from the Asia-Pacific region, and
representatives from international organizations are scheduled to
gather at a forum in Shanghai to discuss how this revolution is
affecting cities.
</P>
<P>
The High-Level Forum on City Information in the Asia-Pacific
Region, will be held on June 5-7, organizers said at a press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The forum is co-sponsored by the United Nations Development
Program, the municipal government of Shanghai, China's Ministry of
Information Industry, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that before long, half of the world's
population will live in cities, and that by 2020, the population
of cities in the Asia-Pacific region may account for half of the
global population. Therefore, information technology in cities
will be vital to world economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Major topics of discussion at the forum include trends and
strategies for the development and application of information in
cities, infrastructure, e-commerce, and regional cooperation in
these areas.
</P>
<P>
Participants will sign a Shanghai Declaration to accelerate
cooperation among Asia-Pacific cities in this regard, organizers
revealed.
</P>
<P>
A commercial hub of the Pacific, Shanghai is witnessing the
hectic development of its information industry.
</P>
<P>
During the forum, a series of roundtable meetings for mayors,
symposiums, and exhibitions on telecommunications and the Internet
will be held.
</P>
<P>
Nitin Desai, UN deputy secretary-general for economic and
social affairs, is expected to address the forum.
</P>
<P>
To date, Lucent Technologies, Simens, Ericsson, Mitsubishi, and
Fujitsu have confirmed that they will send delegates to the forum.
</P>
<P>
Participants are expected to establish a regional committee for
cooperation in city information at the upcoming forum, which is
held every three years.

HEFEI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The initial stage of a bridge over
the Yangtze River in the city of Wuhu in east China's Anhui
Province was completed today with the installation of a 1,272-
meter-long steel beam span.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Wuhu Yangtze River Bridge, a state key
project for the 1996-2000 period, will cost some three billion
yuan and is expected to be completed by the end of this September.
</P>
<P>
The work required for the construction of this bridge is
equivalent to that required for the building of the Yangtze River
bridges in the cities of Wuhan and Nanjing. However, this project
will be finished in three and a half years, shorter than the time
needed to build the other two bridges, according to a project
engineer.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Residents Protest Nullification of Poll Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 Iranian residents on
Wednesday staged a sit-in in Tehran to protest the nullification of
the polling results of the 6th Majlis (parliament) in some
constituencies by the powerful Council of Guardians.
</P>
<P>
The residents, mostly from the towns of Minab, Jask and Roudan
in the Persian Gulf province of Hormuzgan, were sitting in front of
the Interior Ministry building, carrying placards calling for
acknowledgment of the polling results in the three towns.
</P>
<P>
One of the demonstrators, Abbas Nazari, said that they were
representing the people of their towns and that the demonstration
was aimed at attracting the attention of the authorities to their
case.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Guardians, which was the major supervisor of the
elections held last month, had proceeded to cancel the polling
results in some constituencies without presenting any evidence or
explanations, the Interior Ministry said earlier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the reformist May 23 Front also voiced its concern
over the council's move, saying five elected parliament members
from the alliance would not be able to enter the Majlis because of
the cancellation of some polling results.
</P>
<P>
The May 23 Front is an alliance of reformist parties which
support President Mohammed Khatami. The alliance won a landslide
victory in the elections, a result which dismayed the
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Guardians gave no documented reasons except to
say that some votes in Minab, Jask and Roudan had been "purchased"
and some of the voters had been "bribed", Nazari said.
</P>
<P>
He further stressed that the sit-in protest would continue until
the demonstrators received convincing answers to their questions
from concerned authorities.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration came only two days after a prominent reformer,
Saeed Hajjarian, was shot by unidentified gunmen in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, who is still in a coma in hospital, is a close
adviser to President Khatami and also managing editor of the
reformist Persian daily Sobh-e Emrouz which the conservatives
dislike.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, also one of the leaders of the May 23 Front,
reportedly played a major role in the reformers' overwhelming
victory last month.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Mossad Deputy Head Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Amiram Levine, deputy head of
Israel's intelligence organization Mossad, resigned on Wednesday,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Levine submitted his resignation letter to Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Barak accepted the letter with regret, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Levine was hoping to be appointed as head
of Mossad, but Barak had decided not to change the leadership of
Mossad while the leadership of the General Security Service (GSS)
was changing hands.
</P>
<P>
GSS is mainly in charge of internal intelligence while Mossad is
responsible for overseas operations.
</P>
<P>
Deputy GSS Director Avraham Dichter, known as "Avi," had been
named GSS Director to replace Amy Ayalon, who had served the post
for four years, Barak announced Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Dichter's appointment is to take effect "within next few
months."
</P>
<P>
A former member of the General staff Reconnaissance Unit of the
Israel Defense Force, Dichter, 47, joined the GSS in 1974 as a
bodyguard. Last November, Dichter was named deputy to Ayalon.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Doctors More Optimistic on Conditions of Wounded Reformer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Latest medical results show that
the conditions of Saeed Hajjarian, an Iranian reformer who was shot
by unknown gunmen, are better and there is growing hope for his
survival.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian was in a better state in terms of responsiveness,
compared to previous days, but "of course not in all reflexes but
in the brain section," Dr. Seyed Mohammed Qodssi, spokesman of the
medical team treating Hajjarian, said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hajjarian's blood circulation was under full
control, and the medical team had just decided to lower the
respirator, hoping he could breath normally in a few days.
</P>
<P>
The doctor also said the medical team was hopeful that Hajjarian
would regain all his mental functions, including memory, once he
recovered completely, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, one of the vanguards of Iran's reform campaign, has
been in a coma since he was shot by two unidentified persons in
front of the Municipal Council of Tehran last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The assailants, riding a powered motorcycle, fled from the scene
and are still at large. Hajarrian's newspaper Sobh-e Emrouz (This
Morning) reported on Wednesday that the motorcycle was found by
police.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities have formed several special committees to
hunt down the assailants. But so far no person or group claimed
responsibilities for the assassination bid.
</P>
<P>
The attack came as tensions ran high in Iran following the
landslide victory of reformers in parliamentary elections last
month over their conservative opponents, who dominate the country's
most sensitive organs, including the armed forces and the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, 46, a former deputy intelligence minister, is a close
adviser to moderate President Mohammad Khatami and deputy chairman
of Tehran Municipal Council. He is also the managing director of
reformist Sobh-e Emrouz daily, which the conservatives dislike.

<HEADLINE> Delhi Police Promise Foolproof Security for Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The 55,000-strong police force
in the Indian capital has been put on a "general state of alert"
to ensure "foolproof security" for U.S. President Bill Clinton,
who is expected to come here for a five-day visit starting on the
evening of March 19, Delhi Police Commissioner Ajai Raj Sharma
said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Vigil is being maintained across the city and police is in a
general state of alert," Sharma told the Press Trust of India
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Security measures taken by the Delhi police force included a
close watch on the large number of Afghan refugees in the capital
and a constant vigil on the entry and exit points to the city, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his force is closely coordinating with American
and Indian intelligence and security agencies to ensure "foolproof
security" for the visiting U.S. president, whom he described as a
"very threatened person."
</P>
<P>
All security arrangements would be in place by March 17, two
days ahead of Clinton's arrival, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about how the police would deal with the proposed "
protest actions" against the Clinton visit planned by some left-
wing organizations here, the police chief said: "We will not allow
the visit to be disturbed at any cost ... We will stop them where
we feel necessary."
</P>
<P>
He noted that there would be some restrictions on traffic
movements in the city during Clinton's visit, adding that "they
would be publicized much in advance" to avoid any inconvenience to
the general public.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The city police of Rawalpindi,
twin city of the Pakistani capital, has busted an international
gang of criminals, arresting 14 accused and recovering currency
notes and valuables worth millions of rupees.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Deputy Inspector General of Rawalpindi
Range Fareed Nawaz at a press conference in Rawalpindi Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the gang was carrying out its activities all over
the country and abroad as well and it was allegedly involved in
161 cases of dacoity and looting of which 100 were registered at
Lahore, 31 at Rawalpindi, 15 at Islamabad, 10 at Sheikhpura and
five at Peshawar.
</P>
<P>
Beside local and foreign currency worth 1.7 million rupees (34,
000 U.S. dollars), valuable properties having a total value of
over 50 million rupees (about one million dollars) were also
recovered from the gang members. One of the gang members was also
running a guest house in Islamabad, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fareed Nawaz said that the bunch of criminals remained active
during the past two years and it was involved in the looting of
overseas Pakistanis on their return at the Airports as well as
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
He said that the members of the gang pretended to be officers
of the official security agencies such as the Customs and the
Intelligence Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The accused used to chase overseas Pakistanis who return to
their homeland. Some members of the criminal gang were also
involved in criminal activities in Singapore, Malaysia, Bangkok,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, France, Italy, Spain, Holland, Turkey,
Bulgaria, Bhutan and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Occupies Important Position in U.S. Strategic Thinking: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad said here Wednesday that the country today "occupies a
very important position in U.S. strategic thinking."
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen here on the visit of U.S. President Bill
Clinton to the country on March 20, Azad said that the
relationship between Bangladesh and the United States today has
become multidimensional and "covers the entire spectrum of
political, trade, economy and investment as well as in the field
of defense."
</P>
<P>
"The United States is the most important trading partner of
Bangladesh," he said, adding that the United States also happens
to be the largest importer of ready-made garments of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, U.S. investments which were nearly 25
million U.S. dollars three years ago have now reached 750 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
A number of U.S. companies are also involved in oil and gas
exploration in the country, he pointed out, adding "it is thus
clear that from commercial point of view the United States finds
tremendous potential in Bangladesh."
</P>
<P>
In the field of the foreign policy, "the rational and realistic
policies of the Bangladeshi government have also been appreciated
by the United States," Azad said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed that Bangladesh's membership of
the U.N. Security Council, its hosting of the summit of non-
aligned countries next year, its realistic policy on disarmament
and security issues, its concern for peace, security and
development in the region and its efforts to defuse tension in
South Asia have also been appreciated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Azad said the visit of President Clinton "would be a landmark
in our relationship which would lay the foundation of an enhanced
partnership between the two countries on the basis of mutual
benefit and respect."

<HEADLINE> More Arrests Made in Sri Lanka Over Terrorist Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Nine more persons have been
arrested in connection with a terrorist bomb attack and shooting
spree which killed at least 29 people in Colombo last week, a
senior Sri Lankan investigator said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Crime Detection Bureau (CDB) Bandula
Wickremasinghe said that 17 suspects so far had been taken into
custody over Friday evening's orgy of violence which ended at dawn
Saturday when eight Tamil Tiger suicide bombers were either killed
or blew themselves up.
</P>
<P>
He said that a lot of information have surfaced by the use of
documents recovered from those suicide bombers of Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who failed in their attempt to ambush
a ministerial motorcade along a strategic highway leading to
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are being carried out by a CDB's special police
team into the breach of security on the highway where security was
tight as it was frequented by lawmakers and political leaders.
</P>
<P>
Officials close to the investigation said they were also trying
to find out where the LTTE suicide bombers stored their arsenal of
weapons which included armor-piercing rocket propelled grenades,
light machine guns and claymore mines.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that LTTE suicide bombers had for the first time
used timing devices during Friday's suicide attack which was
apparently aimed to target Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha
Ratwatte who was in charge of the war effort against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE bombers had activated a switch to set off the
explosives stuffed into their jackets to go off within an hour of
launching the attack, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting a 17-year-old war to carve out a
separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and
east, have been blamed for dozens of suicide bombings in Colombo
and other cities over the years.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Assistant
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Bernard Miyet said
the African countries he has so far visited have shown their
commitment to the peaceful solution to the conflict in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Miyet told reporters that during his two-day visit to Rwanda,
he met with Rwanda's President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice
President Paul Kagame to discuss operations of the U.N.
peacekeeping force to be deployed in the DRC, Rwanda News Agency
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to the parties concerned to live up to their
commitment in order to implement the peace agreement signed in
Lusaka last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Miyet added that he requested the DRC government to assure
freedom of movement to the military observers who will soon be
deployed in the country.
</P>
<P>
Miyet has already visited the DRC, Namibia and Zimbabwe and
will travel on to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola have troops in the DRC to help
President Laurent kabila's government fight the rebel groups
backed by Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
A ceasefire agreement was signed by all warring parties in
Lusaka last July and August, but both sides accused each other of
violations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on February 24 authorized the
deployment of 5, 537 military observers and troops to monitor the
ceasefire, but warned they would not be sent without firm
commitments to peace from the warring parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's leading
newspaper, applauds the successful conclusion of the Third Session
of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) in an editorial to
be published tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The editorial describes the conference as a "very important"
and "fruitful" one.
</P>
<P>
The conference has implemented the directive of the Party
Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, summed up basic
experience on the basis of the development of the international
and domestic situations, and put forward the tasks for this year.
</P>
<P>
"It was a democratic, truth-seeking, united, and inspiring
conference," it says.
</P>
<P>
This year, the final year of this century, China will draw up
its tenth "five-year plan" and initiate the third of its three-
step strategic objectives to build China into a fairly developed
country by mid-21st century. Therefore, the year 2000 serves as a
link between the past and future, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Though China shoulders the arduous tasks to promote reforms,
development, and maintain social stability, there are a number of
factors favorable to the accomplishment of these tasks, it says.
</P>
<P>
Most important at the present stage is the implementation of
all resolutions approved by the NPC, the editorial concludes.

<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan and Russia's human rights representative Oleg Mironov
reached wide consensus on human rights issues during their meeting
here today.
</P>
<P>
Both sides held that China and Russia share a wide-ranging
understanding of human rights issues, and both advocate that the
international community should respect the measures countries take
to promote and protect human rights according to their particular
situation and reality.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also believe that countries should resolve their
differences on the issue of human rights through equal dialogue
and on the basis of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Countries should be allowed to establish their own human rights
models in line with their own circumstances, they agreed.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that certain countries should not force other
countries to accept their human rights models, and they strongly
rejected interference by one country into the internal affairs of
another on the pretext of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Both the theory of "human rights overriding sovereignty" and "
double standards" on human rights issues should be adamantly
rejected, and the politicization of human rights issues should
also be opposed, they agreed.

Both sides highly evaluated the efforts by both governments to

fruitful cooperation in the realm of international human rights.
</P>
<P>
Tang pointed out that the issue of Chechen is not a human
rights issue, but is rather a sacred cause of preserving the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government unswervingly supports the Russian
government's stand on the Chechen issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mironov said that Russia highly evaluates the Chinese
government's principled stand on the Chechen issue.
</P>
<P>
Russia will make every effort to prevent any anti-China
proposals from passing during the human rights conference this
year, he promised.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Wang Guangya and Mironov also
held in-depth exchange of views on protecting and promoting the
work of human rights.
</P>

Mironov arrived in Beijing on Tuesday at the invitation of the

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Talks to Start on March 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Palestine
Liberation Organization Executive Committee, Mahmoud Abbas said on
Wednesday the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will resume on March
20 in Washington and last for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Voice of Palestine radio, Abbas, also
known as Abu Mazen, said the negotiations will discuss interim and
final issues, including the third and last phases of Israeli forces
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Abbas said the PLO declared in its Tuesday meeting the formation
of the Palestinian delegation, which comprises Saeb Erekat, chief
negotiator in the transitional period and Yasser Abed Rabbo, chief
negotiator in the final-status talks, together with a number of
experts and specialists.
</P>
<P>
A new round of interim phase negotiations will be held Wednesday
between the Palestinian side headed by Erekat and the Israeli side
headed by Oded Eran, during which the two sides will deal with the
maps of Israel's withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's decision not to hand over
Anata village which is close to Jerusalem, Erekat told reporters
Wednesday the Israeli government is dealing with matters as if they
were test balloons.
</P>
<P>
The areas surrounding Jerusalem are not the holy city itself, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"For us, Jerusalem is the old city, Salah Uddin street, Shafat
and all areas that were illegally annexed to Israel after the war
of June,1967," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want Jerusalem, or at least its Arab east part,
be the capital of their future independent state. But Israel has
repeatedly claimed that the holy city is its indivisible and
eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security cabinet approved on Wednesday the maps of the
much-delayed 6.1 percent withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The maps will be submitted Sunday to the full cabinet for final
ratification and they will also should be endorsed by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat before the implementation, which is likely to
take place next week.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Ratifies Israeli Withdrawal Maps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has
approved the maps for a promised but much-delayed Israeli troops
withdrawal from the West Bank, Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat saw the maps and expressed ratification," Erekat said.
but he did not say if the maps include Arab villages close to
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal from 6.1 percent more land of the West Bank under
the terms of a peace deal signed last September in Egyptian Red Sea
resort Sharm el Sheikh should have taken place on January 20. It
was put on hold due to the difference between the two sides over
which areas should be handed over to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The land dispute also led to the month-long deadlock in Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks and caused the two sides to miss a February
13 deadline for a framework agreement on a permanent peace. The two
sides have agreed to resume talks on March 20 in Washington.
Erekat said he and Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran met Tuesday
night in the West Bank city of Jericho, finalizing the maps.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said the maps that have been endorsed by Israeli security
cabinet earlier in the day were officially submitted to the
Palestinian side Wednesday morning and the pullout is expected to
be carried out Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The maps will be submitted Sunday to the full Israeli cabinet
for final ratification.

PHNOM PENH, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A two-day National Symposium

service and courts, and raise officials' salaries in order to
achieve a sustainable development and enhance the confidence of

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows to Minimize Oil Prize Hike Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that his administration is doing its best
to cushion the impact of the latest round of oil price increases
on consumers, especially the poor.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement released here, the president said he has
already instructed the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure
that prices of basic goods remain at the pre-March 11 oil price
hike levels.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered the Department of Transportation and
Communications to make sure that there would be no fare increases
following the oil price increase.
</P>
<P>
Estrada pointed out that despite the 80-centavo (0.02-U.S.
dollar) per liter average fuel price increase, Philippine oil
prices still remain the lowest among non-oil producing countries
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president said he will continue his dialogues
with oil companies to convince them to refrain from increasing oil
price further.
</P>
<P>
With oil price movements in the world market beyond his control,
the president instead was able to convince oil companies last
Friday to temper the latest increases in the prices of their
petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The oil companies agreed to Estrada's request to moderate fuel
prices to only an average of 80 centavos per liter for gasoline
and diesel, instead of their original proposal of 2.20 pesos (0.05
dollar) per liter.

<HEADLINE> S. African Parliament to Pass Protected Disclosures Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Employees in both the
private and public sectors will soon be able to blow the whistle
on corruption and other malpractice in their organizations without
fear of reprisals, according to the Protected Disclosures Bill
approved by the South African National Assembly's justice
committee Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill provides a framework for employees to disclose
information on unlawful or irregular conduct by their employers or
other employees.
</P>
<P>
Whistle blowers will be protected from reprisals provided they
make their disclosures to a legal adviser, employer, Cabinet
minister or member of provincial executive council, and certain
other categories of people, according to the bill.
</P>
<P>
A retrospective clause in the bill provides that disclosures
can be made about misdeeds committed before the act comes into
operation.
</P>
<P>
Johnny de Lange, chairman of the justice committee, said it was
"another cornerstone in the fight against corruption and other
nefarious activities".
</P>
<P>
He said the bill is expected to be passed by the full Assembly
next month.

TOKYO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan joined Spain and South
Korea in the Sydney Olympics after they defeated Malaysia 5-2
Wednesday in the men's field hockey qualifiers at Osaka, Japan.

Spain, which finished runners-up at the Atlanta Olympics,
blanked lowly Belarus 5-0 in Group B as South Korea downed New
Zealand 5-2 for their fifth successive win in Group A.
</P>
<P>
The remaining three qualifying spots were wide open after
Britain recovered from a 2-5 drubbing by Poland on Tuesday to
defeat Belgium 4-3 in their last match on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Britain stood second with seven points in Group A, while both
Poland and Japan were locked with six points each and a game in

ROME, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Austrian superstar Hermann Maier
captured the men's World Cup downhill title at Bormio, Italy on

downhill event of the season.
</P>
<P>
Maier, the world and Olympic champion, finished second with a

Ghedina by nearly two seconds.
</P>
<P>
Trinkl clocked a winning time of 1 minute 58.31 seconds for his
second win at Bormio, the other was in 1994, and the fourth
downhill win of his career.

<P>
On the other hand, more than 300 policemen were commended. "Bad
members shall not be tolerated and rewards and punishments shall
be meted out strictly and fairly," a senior police officer was
quoted by local media as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police sources also said that training courses for the police
will be strengthened, and Macao's public security police will have
more information exchanges with police departments in neighboring
areas, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
Poor public security has been an annoying problem in the past
several years. As Portuguese rule of Macao was ending, there were
rampant activities of gangs who scrambled for profits mainly from
the gambling business in Macao. And some police were believed to
be involved.
</P>
<P>
Since March last year when a local resident of Chinese origin
took over the command of public security police in Macao, the
tightening of discipline has been taken as a major task among the
police.

<HEADLINE> HK Firms Urged to Be Active in New Internet Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A world leading e-business
provider Wednesday urged Hong Kong business community to be
actively engaged in the new Internet economy, saying "opportunity
is just a 'click away' in the Asia-Pacific region".
</P>
<P>
Companies and governments must embrace the Internet economy
that is quickly taking shape in Asia, said Dick Brown, chairman
and chief executive officer of EDS, a global leading provider of e-
business and information technology services with 9,000 business
and government clients in more than 50 countries and regions
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of leading Hong Kong business people at an
American Chamber of Commerce luncheon, Brown discussed several
strategies for the new Internet economy that is encompassing
commerce throughout Asia-Pacific region and around the globe.
</P>
<P>
Citing a recent survey of 2,000 chief inspection officers (CIO)
from large global companies, Brown said the number one issue they
face is how to link new technologies to business strategies.
Interestingly, enough, only 20 percent of the CIOs surveyed are
actually looking at mapping technology to business objectives,
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities for those that take the leap of faith into
the Internet world will be great and Asian business-to-business e-
commerce will top 272 billion U.S. dollars by 2003, with overall
Asian e-commerce reaching 340 million U.S. dollars," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
In the Asia-pacific region, Internet use is predicted to expand
by 422 percent within the next five years and the growth of the
web has been rapid, but Brown stressed that websites should be
more than a new advertising channel.
</P>
<P>
It should integrate supplies, partners, customers and even
governments, to create digital value chains, Brown said, adding
that companies should look at leveraging the Internet to engage
customers in new ways and offer them new levels of service.

As a result, several thousand passengers were stranded at the

The hot line also deters businesses from engaging in illegal

Complaints Center said that of all the economic cases disclosed by
the public by telephone last year, 708 were proved valid and were
settled with fines totaling 2.7 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 123 well-known companies in China announced
today that they will join hands with local law enforcement
agencies to crack down on fake products.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, no company boss will say that March 15 is only for
consumers. By banning counterfeit and substandard commodities,
company's rights and interest are actually protected, and because
of this, it's also a special day for companies," a Beijing-based
company representative told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jianhua, an official with the China Consumers Association,
said that consumer complaints have changed fundamentally in China
in recently years, with the focus shifting from poor quality goods
to the service sector.
</P>
<P>
"As telecommunications products become increasingly popular,
related complaints have also surged fastest of all services, and
this is likely to remain so this year." He said.
</P>
<P>
He called on related department to speed up efforts to improve
after-sale services and ease consumer inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
The Consumers Association is now cooperating with local
telecommunications departments to build a nationwide computer
network which will facilitate better on-line services for solving
consumer problems and easing the load on the phone system.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security cabinet
approved on Wednesday the maps of Israeli promised but delayed
troops withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank, a statement
issued by the Prime Minister's office said.
</P>
<P>
Nine ministers in the security cabinet that consists of leaders
of the parties within the ruling coalition and several key members
of the Prime Minister Ehud Baraks's One Israel voted on the maps
Wednesday, with five for, three against and one abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky of the Ysrael Ba'aliya,
Construction and Housing Minister Yazhak Levy of the National
Religous Party and Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli Yishai of
Shas voted against the maps.
</P>
<P>
The revised maps were a compromise between Israel and the
Palestinians that was reached Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not specify which areas would be handed over
to the Palestinians. Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said
earlier in the day that no areas close to Jerusalem would be
included in the handover that has been put on hold for nearly two
months due to disputes between the two sides over the shape of the
land.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side wants Israel to include the areas close to
Jerusalem, a demand rejected by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky said after the security cabinet meeting that he in
principle has no objection to the handover of the Arab villages
near Jerusalem to the Palestinians, but these villages should be
transferred at later stage of the peace talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran is to brief his Palestinian
counterpart Saeb Erekat on the outcome of the security cabinet
meeting. The pair met Tuesday night in the West Bank city of
Jericho and finalized the maps prepared by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The maps will be submitted Sunday to the full cabinet for final
ratification and they will also should be endorsed by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat before the implementation, which is likely to
take place next week.

<P>
Akyol said Turkey was very sensitive about racism and xenophobia
and stressed the integrity of the Turkish nation "which includes
Kurds who are respected equally."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been fighting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party
that had been engaging armed struggle since 1984 for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>

The Indian government would not have conducted nuclear tests in
1998 if it had "buckled under pressure", Singh told members of the
Rajya Sabha, or the upper house, here on Wednesday.
</P>

Some members of the Indian parliament have suspected that the
government might make major concessions on the issue of India's
signing of the CTBT during Clinton's five-day visit to the country
next week.
</P>
<P>
Singh said that the government had reaffirmed its position on
the CTBT issue repeatedly in both houses of the parliament and
that it was an "unfair observation" to say India was buckling
under pressure on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the reported statement by Clinton that
situation along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir was
dangerous, the Indian foreign minister simply noted that "we do

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Suggested to Get Cheap Hydropower in Exchange for Exporting Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh could get hydropower at
a cheap price in exchange for exporting gas, currently the main
source of power in the country, a top U.S. business leader in
Dhaka said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Forrest E. Cookson, president of American Chamber (AmCham) in
Bangladesh said Bangladesh could consider the strategy of
investing on hydroelectricity in Nepal and Bhutan if it decides to
export gas to India under a mutual cooperation for the common
interests of all.
</P>
<P>
Cookson said the idea, if implemented, would not only greatly
reduce the domestic requirement for gas and give Bangladesh a long-
term solution to its electricity problem, but also benefit the
countries concerned, including India.
</P>
<P>
The donors and international business circle would naturally be
interested in providing assistance for such an integrated project
under a regional cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Gas Export will feature prominently during U.S. President
Clinton's visit to Bangladesh on March 20 as international oil
companies, including Unocal from the United States, are pressing
for Bangladeshi government's allowance of gas export to any
country, so as to recover their investment and make profit.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government, however, said that Bangladesh would
consider the possibilities of exporting gas only after becoming
sure that it had a reserve for 50 years for its own. The major
opposition parties also took a similar stand on gas export.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimate, Bangladesh has a gas reserve of
nearly 13 trillion cubic feet which will be exhausted in 35 years
under the current reserve-to-production ratio.
</P>
<P>
It is widely reckoned that some new production-sharing
contracts on energy sector would be signed during President
Clinton's short stay in the country. However, it is still unknown
as yet whether the Bangladeshi government would agree to export
gas.

receivable valued at one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the ICBC will buy the accounts
receivable arising from Motorola's product distribution, after
interest is deducted, and the ICBC will provide capital to
Motorola, which will be paid back to the bank when recovered.
</P>
<P>

strategy the bank initiated in line with market demand, and the
move is expected to satisfy corporate demand for new financial
services.
</P>
<P>
He said that opening of the new business will help accelerate
circulation of corporate capital, which caters to the increasing
demand of economic development and commercial credit. It also
helps improve China's existing businesses in the financial market.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Redetermines Source of Yangtze River (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist using
satellite imaging technology has determined that the Damchu River
on northwest China's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is more likely to be
the source of the Yangtze River than the well-known Tuotuo River.
</P>
<P>
The Damchu, which is larger than the Tuotuo in terms of both
water flow and drainage area, is the true source of the longest
river in China, says Dr. Liu Shaochuang from the Institute of
Remote Sensing Application under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that his conclusion was drawn after intensive analysis
of the remote sensing data obtained through satellite imaging and
some topographic data.
</P>
<P>
Before this, some scientists have doubts about the theory that
the Tuotuo River, which starts from the snow-covered Geladandong
Mountain in northwestern Qinghai Province, is the source of
Yangtze River. But no conclusive data has been available to
support their opinions.
</P>
<P>
Just like the Tuotuo, the Damchu, which starts in the northern
foothills of the Tanggula Mountains in Qinghai Province, is a
tributary of the Tongtian River, a trunk stream of the upper
reaches of the Yangtze River, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
He said the Damchu River is 360.8 kilometers in length, or 3.2
kilometers longer than the Tuotuo River, and the water flow and
drainage area of the Damchu is 6 times and 1.8 times respectively
larger then the Tuotuo.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that his conclusion remains to be authorized by the
state. He currently is seeking financial support for an on-the-
spot investigation of the source of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he used the same technical methods to determine that
the Lantsang River starts at a river in the Yushu area of Qinghai
Province.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Redetermines Source of Yangtze River (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the long history of China, many Chinese have attempted to
track down the source of the Yangtze River. In 1976, China sent
experts to the Yangtze to investigate the matter.
</P>
<P>
The expedition group found that the Tuotuo River, which was
about 375 kilometers in length, was the longest of the five major
tributaries at the Yangtze River's source area, while the Damchu
River was only 357 kilometers. The Tuotuo River was then
recognized as the source of the mighty Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Liu explained that satellite imaging is much more accurate than
the techniques used in the past, and it is natural that the new
result will differ from the old one. In addition, environmental
changes at the source of the river can also cause minor changes in
the length of the source rivers.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River, 6,300 kilometers in length, is the third
longest river in the world, following the Nile in Africa and the
Amazon in South America. The drainage area of the river is 1.8
million square kilometers, with more than 400 million people
living along the river. The industrial and agricultural output
value of the area accounts for 40 percent of the country's total.

<HEADLINE> Ten Percent of Chinese Private Enterprises Have Labor Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of private enterprises
in China that have established labor unions stands at 120,209,
accounting for 10 percent of the total, said an official with the
All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU).
</P>
<P>
China presently has more than 1.28 million private enterprises
but the majority of them have failed to protect their employees'
legitimate rights and interests, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The ACFTU established labor unions in the private sector in
1988, and an office was set up here in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
The office has helped the unions in private enterprises to
develop systems for negotiation and collective bargaining. More
than 60,000 labor unions were set up last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, there were 2.44 million trade union members
in the private businesses that have trade unions, accounting for
82.7 percent of their combined work force.
</P>
<P>
"Although labor unions have been set up, they have not taken a
key role in enterprises," said the official. "We'll try to do more
to bring them into full play."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Warns Against "Taiwan Independence" (Writhru 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While declining to confirm the possibility of China engaging in
military exercises before the Taiwan election, Zhu said the
Chinese government policy of not promising to give up the use of
force to resolve the Taiwan question is directed against foreign
intervention and separatist forces in Taiwan but not against the
Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his worries about recent dramatic changes concerning
the Taiwan election, Zhu urged Taiwan people not to act on impulse,
"lest they should regret."
</P>
<P>
Zhu cited recent plunging stock prices in Taiwan as evidence of
widespread worries and anxieties of the Taiwan people, who fear a
possible war across the Taiwan Strait in case pro-independenc
forces come into power in Taiwan as a result of the election.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief in Taiwan people's political wisdom and
his trust for them to make a "wise, historic choice".
</P>
<P>
"But there are only three days left for the Taiwan election,
and the result is hard to predict, since anything unexpected could
happen," he warned, calling for vigilance on the part of all
Taiwan compatriots against pro-independence forces.
</P>
<P>
On the question of current tension across the Taiwan Strait,
Zhu said, there was first the "two state" theory, then came the
White Paper on the Taiwan issue. "If there had not been the 'two
state' theory, perhaps there would not have been the White Paper,"
he said, adding the White Paper explains comprehensively and in
detail China's principles and policies on the Taiwan issue and
does not contain any new content.
</P>
<P>
He also explained reasons why the White Paper has met with such
strong reaction from the outside world. "It is because there are
some people in a certain country who have all along been against
China and taken China as its potential enemy, and who want to use
Taiwan as an unsinkable aircraft carrier against China; and that
is why they want to see the Taiwan question drag on indefinitely."
</P>
<P>
He urged "a shift from threat to dialogue across the Pacific
Ocean", instead of "a shift from threat to dialog across the
Taiwan Strait" as was proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton in a
speech he made at Johns Hopkins University on March 12.
</P>
<P>
But the premier said at present he does not want to relate the
Taiwan question to the United States, not to Sino-U.S. relations
in particular.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Warns Against "Taiwan Independence" (Writhru 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji warned here
today that China will not tolerate "Taiwan independence" and that
the Chinese people are ready to shed blood and sacrifice their
lives to defend the unity of their motherland and the dignity of
the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
He made the warning at a press conference here which was held
shortly after the conclusion of the 3rd Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the upcoming Taiwan election is a local
election, that the election is the Taiwan people's own affair, and
that the Chinese government will not interfere.
</P>
<P>
"But I want to make clear here that whoever comes into power in
Taiwan after the election must not go about 'Taiwan independence',
nor will 'Taiwan independence' in whatever form be allowed," he
stressed, adding, "this is the bottom line of the Chinese
government and represents the common wish of the 1.25 billion
people in China."
</P>
<P>
"Our consistent principle on the settlement of the Taiwan
question has been 'peaceful reunification' and 'one country, two
systems', but we do not promise giving up the use of force to
resolve the Taiwan issue," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
"We will support whoever upholds the 'one China' principle, and
we can hold negotiations with him on any question and are ready to
make concessions on our part," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever goes about 'Taiwan independence' is doomed," he said.
"Because such a proposition runs against the wishes of the Chinese
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and runs against the
wishes of overseas Chinese and people of Chinese origin all over
the world."
</P>
<P>
The premier rebuffed the presumption that China dare not use
force to resolve the Taiwan question. "Some people are calculating
how many aircraft, missiles and warships China possesses, and have
concluded that China dare not and will not use force (to resolve
the Taiwan issue)," he said. "According to such kind of
calculation, Hitler would long have ruled the whole world."
</P>
<P>
"People making such calculations don't know about the Chinese
history. The Chinese people are ready to shed blood and sacrifice
their lives to defend the unity of their motherland and the
dignity of the Chinese nation," Zhu stressed.

<HEADLINE> Israel's GDP in 1999 Higher Than Expected: Statistics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel's gross domestic product
(GDP) for 1999 grew by 2.2 percent, higher than the earlier 2
percent estimate, figures issued Wednesday by the Central Bureau of
Statistics (CBS).
</P>
<P>
The 1999 economic growth, the same as that in 1998, continued a
slip that began in 1996 when GDP grew by 4.6 percent after the 6-7
percent in 1994-1995.
</P>
<P>
GDP per capita, a measure of the living standard, fell by 0.2
percent in 1999, the same fall as in 1998, to 66,935 shekels (16,
000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the country's unemployment for 1999 reached 8.9 percent, up
from 8.5 percent a year earlier and 7.6 percent in 1997. This rate
was slightly lower than CBS' original estimate of 9.0 percent for
1999.
</P>
<P>
The business sector grew more slowly in 1999, up 1.8 percent
from that of 1998. This was the lowest growth rate for the sector
in recent years. In addition, labor productivity fell by 1.9
percent in 1999, after rising 2.2 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown was also felt particularly in the construction
sector, where gross output fell by further 10.6 percent, after a
fall of 5.8 percent in 1998. The agricultural sector also recorded
a 5.9 percent fall in output in 1999 while the industrial sector's
growth was only at 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The traditional manufacturing sector, which includes food,
textiles and clothing, registered hardly any growth at all in 1999.
</P>
<P>
National disposable income reached 62,000 shekels (15,500 U.S.
dollars) per year in 1999, but net savings fell to 2.9 percent of
disposable income, down from 4.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Exports of goods and services rose by 9.7 percent in 1999,
higher than CBS' original estimates of 7.4 percent. Growth was
particularly strong in the second half of the year, when exports
increased by 20.6 percent on an annual basis, compared to growth of
7.6 percent in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The leading items in export were diamonds, up 16 percent,
computer programming service, up 13.9 percent and tourism, which
increased by 12.6 percent. However, imports also rose sharply in
1999, up 14.4 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Israel's trade deficit in 1999 ballooned to 3.1
billion U.S. dollars, up from 2.1 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Local economists said that Israel's GDP growth would be better
this year if progress were made in the Middle East peace process.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak appeared to make an abrupt
about face Tuesday, cancelling plans to include the village of
Anata near Jerusalem in the upcoming 6.1 percent West Bank
withdrawal. The decision to replace Anata with other areas followed
right-wing criticism of the plan, which was leaked to the press
prior to its approval by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians reacted to this decision with disappointment.
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said every time the
Palestinians begin a serious effort to regain the momentum of the
peace process, the Israeli government sets off a political balloon
test at their expense.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who is campaigning for
presidency, has told American Jewish leaders that if elected, he
will honor an agreement with the Barak government delaying the
transfer of the American embassy to Jerusalem until a final status
accord is forged between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Gore's statement indicated that Barak and U.S. President Bill
Clinton have worked out an agreement concerning the deferral of the
implementation of a United States law requiring the American
embassy to move to Jerusalem by May 1999.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Officially declaring its newly developed Arrow-2 missile
defense system operational on Tuesday, Israel became the first
country in the world to have the capacity to defend itself against
ballistic missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow-2 system will definitely help enhance Israel's defense
capability in the years to come, Barak said while commenting on the
operation of the system. A U.S.-Israel joint venture, the system
will cost 2.2 billion U.S. dollars by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced Tuesday that the
new chief of Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency will be a man
who served in the elite army commando unit Barak once headed.
Avraham Deichter, 47, served in the Sayeret Matkal commandos and in
several key positions in the Shin Bet, Barak's office said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Deichter's main challenge will be fighting terror. Several
militant Islamic groups have sworn to torpedo the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Former Malaysian Police Chief Jailed Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's former Inspector
General of Police Abdul Rahim Noor was Wednesday jailed two months
and fined 2,000 ringgit (about 526 U.S. dollars) for assaulting
former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in a police lock up in
1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court, which passed the
sentence, allowed stay of execution for the former police chief
pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Rahim Noor Tuesday pleaded guilty after the prosecution
amended the charge against him from one under Section 325 of the
Penal Code which carries a maximum jail term of seven years and a
fine at the discretion of the court on conviction to Section 323
which carries a jail term of up to one year and a fine of up to 2,
000 ringgit (about 526 U.S. dollars) or both.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year old Rahim, who resigned as the police chief on
January 8 last year, confessed to assaulting Anwar before a Royal
Commission of Inquiry set up to investigate injuries sustained by
Anwar while under detention in a lock-up at the federal police
headquarters here on September 20, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economy Grew 4.3 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian economy grew 4.3
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello pointed out Wednesday the economy was
bolstered by spending on the massive military commitment in East
Timor and a consumer spending splurge.
</P>
<P>
"The economy has now grown at or above four percent for 11
consecutive quarters - a growth rate which is unrivaled in the
last 30 years," Costello said.
</P>
<P>
He believed the Australian economy has the potential to sustain
growth of 3.5 to four percent over the early years of this decade.
</P>
<P>
If growth continues at current rates, unemployment would drop
below 6 per cent within two years to the lowest level since 1981,
he added.
</P>
<P>
However there are different views. Australian Associated Press
quoted the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry as saying
that the growth figures were superficial and held up only by East
Timor, which lifted military spending 18.6 per cent. "Today's
national accounts are a clear warning that would be madness to
ignore," the industrial body said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition treasury spokesman Simon Crean said the figures
showed business investment and household savings collapsing, with
consumer spending accounting for 90 per cent of the growth in the
economy.

<HEADLINE> Early Presidential Election Voting Starts in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia's overseas vessel crews,
personnel of polar stations and residents of a number of remote
areas started early voting in the presidential elections Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Central Electoral Commission (CEC) said an
estimated 250,000 people out of the 108 million Russian voters
will take part in the early voting.
</P>
<P>
Ten constituencies of Russia have remote areas to enjoy early
voting, among them the Republic of Tuva, Buryatiya, Kalmykiya, the
Komi-Permackij autonomous district, the Nizhni Novgorod, Kemerovo,
Irkutsk, Arkhangelsk, Sakhalin and Amur regions, said CEC Chairman
Alexander Veshnyakov.
</P>
<P>
As a rule, early voting in remote areas is done within a day
from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. (0500 GMT to 1700 GMT). Still, exceptions
are possible when a group of voters is on combat duty far away
from a polling station. In such cases, the voting can last for two
or more days, but it cannot take place after the universal
elections date in the country.
</P>
<P>
Early voting is also possible outside the territory of Russia
if a foreign country does not have Russian diplomatic missions or
they are far away from residence of Russian nationals.
</P>
<P>
Veshnyakov said the CEC will meet with all 12 presidential
candidates or their representatives Wednesday to discuss the
organization of observers' work, exchange information on elections
and possible law violations.
</P>
<P>
The CEC wants to warn all candidates against "intentions which
may run counter to the law," said the chairman.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Consumers Use Internet for Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Consumers in China may turn to
the Internet to get to the bottom of their disputes with
manufacturers and sellers of fake and shoddy products.
</P>
<P>
A special consumer complaint website has been jointly set up by
the China Central Television (CCTV) and eight popular dot.com
companies to deal with gripes about everything from poor product
quality to bad after-sales service.
</P>
<P>
The complaints will be forwarded to the China National
Consumers' Association, the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce, the State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision or
the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the China Quality Information network, established
by the State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision, offers
authoritative product quality information.
</P>
<P>
China has designated March 15 as the annual day to clamp down
on fake and shoddy products and increase public awareness of
consumer rights.
</P>
<P>
In addition to logging onto the Internet and calling hotlines,
consumers may consult experts available in the downtown areas of
over ten large cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Zhengzhou and
Guangzhou today for free appraisals of their jewelry, textiles or
eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey found that Chinese shoddy and fake products
have appeared in a variety of goods including clothing, pesticide,
fertilizer, food, pharmaceuticals, cigarettes, liquor,
construction materials and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
China has launched a three-year campaign to crack down on the
fakes and support high-quality goods, and designated 500
commercial streets in major and medium-size cities across the
country as pilot zones free of shoddy products.

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu Confident of U.S. Congress Passage of PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said here
today that he is confident that the Permanent Normal Trade
Relations (PNTR) status for China will be passed by the U.S.
Congress.
</P>
<P>
"PNTR status for China is the basis and prerequisite for the
China-US Agreement concerning China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO)," Zhu said at a press conference following the
closing of the 3rd Session of the 9th National People's Congress (
NPC) this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral win-win agreement was won through hard efforts
after 13 years of negotiations, and was reached under the direct
leadership of President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is a solemn agreement between the two governments, which
have the responsibility to win approval from the congresses of
both countries and make it into law, Zhu said, adding that the
Chinese Government has made its due efforts and there is now no
problem for the NPC to pass it.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that President Clinton has promised and did make
efforts to get it passed by the U.S. Congress. He quoted Clinton
as saying that if the U.S. Congress does not pass the PNTR status
for China now, it will spend the next 20 years regretting for it.
</P>
<P>
The premier added one sentence to Clinton's remarks that if the
U.S. Congress does not pass the PNTR status now, it will not only
be regretting for the next 20 years, but even in hundreds and
thousands of years later. The U.S. people will feel regretful when
they look back into this period of history, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"I am fully confident of the wisdom and sensibility of the U.S.
Congressmen," he said. "The PNTR will be passed."

BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- "Taiwan independence" is never
allowed and "Taiwan independence" in whatever form is not
acceptable, said Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji here today.
</P>
<P>
"No matter who comes into power in Taiwan in the election, we
won't allow the 'independence of Taiwan' to happen," he stressed,
adding "this is the bottom line of the Chinese government on the
Taiwan Issue."
</P>
<P>
"Our consistent policy for the settlement of the Taiwan issue
has been 'peaceful reunification' and 'one country, two systems',"
he said. "But we absolutely do not promise giving up the use of
force (for the settlement of the Taiwan issue)."
</P>
<P>
"We will support whoever supports the 'one China' principle,
and we can hold negotiations with them on any question and are
ready to make concessions on our part," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever proposes 'Taiwan independence' will be doomed," he
warned. "Because such a proposition runs against the wishes of the
Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and runs
against the wishes of all Chinese in the world."

<TEXT>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference shortly after the 3rd
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress concluded.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as "untrue" reports by certain foreign news media
that China would stop introducing the U.S. CDMA systems.
</P>
<P>
He said the State Council has entrusted China Unicom, a
telecommunications giant, to take charge of all relevant
purchasing affairs.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom has recently initiated a bidding for the purchase,
which calls for still more coordination with the Ministry of
Information Industry and the State Development Planning Commission,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The purchase issue will be settled before long, with completion
of necessary procedures, he said.
</P>
<P>
China, whose mobile phone capacity ranks the second in the
world, has been adopting the GSM mobile phone systems.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on the participation of private
enterprises in the telecommunications sector, the premier said, as
China allows foreign investors to engage in the development of its
telecommunications sector, it will naturally permit domestic
private firms to enter into the field.

<HEADLINE> China to Set up Sound Social Security System Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said here
today that China will, before long, be able to set up a relatively
sound social security network.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark this afternoon at a press conference held
shortly after the conclusion of the 3rd Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
A law in this regard will be enacted by the end of the year,
and necessary funds are being pooled from society at large, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China has established a social security system for a long time,
but it was far from being complete, he noted. Large numbers of
workers are laid off during China's economic restructuring, and
many laid-offs have to stay at re-employment centers set up by
their original enterprises, living on aid and assistance from the
state, employers, and society at large.
</P>
<P>
This is not a sound social security network, however, Zhu said.
"That's why China needs to build up an independent social security
system with all walks of life contributing to it."

<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has
said there is no time-table for the full convertibility of the
Chinese currency under the capital account, due to the fact that
the country still lacks a strong ability of supervision over the
financial field.

So far, China has opened up the capital market under the

conclusion of the Third Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government is now studying proper ways to
allow continued cooperation between the People's Liberation Army (
PLA) and commercial operators on the development of the CDMA
system, a new generation of mobile telephony, and to meet the
PLA's needs for mobile telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the PLA have conducted joint trial operation of
CDMA systems in four cities together with China Telecom. However,
the Central Military Commission (CMC) has decided that the PLA
must break links with enterprises under its control and that the
PLA cannot involve itself in any commercial activities or run any
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu Pledges Greater Efforts to Fight Corruption (more detailed) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said here
today that China is striving to improve its legal system and
strengthen law enforcement in its fight against corruption at a
press conference held by the just-concluded 3rd Session of the
Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question from a German reporter, Zhu said that
China has made tremendous achievements in its anti-corruption
fight in recent years and punished more corrupt officials than any
other country in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption has been a major problem facing all governments in
the world since the first government was created in human history,
and the Chinese government is no exception," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's government and judiciary have been tough in meting out
punishments in accordance with law to officials involved in
bribery, embezzlement and other criminal activities, but people
are still not satisfied with the result, he admitted.
</P>
<P>
Around 700 out of the over 2,700 NPC deputies voted against or
abstained when the work reports of the Supreme People's Court and
the Supreme People's Procuratorate were voted on at the NPC
session, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that people are not satisfied with our anti-
corruption work," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He listed the crackdown on smuggling as one of the most
noticeable achievements in the anti-corruption drive, citing
recent exposures of smuggling cases in Zhanjiang and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Because of the crackdown on smuggling, China's customs revenue
last year increased by 100 percent over 1998, and the extra
revenue was used last year to increase pay for 84 million low-
income people, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see a clear linkage between corruption and the one-
party rule in China," he said, noting that many governments are
corrupt even though they operate in countries with a multi-party
system.
</P>
<P>
"Most important of all, the cure to the problem is the
establishment of a system of the rule of law and law enforcement,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese media are also improving their coverage of corruption,
he said, pledging that more and more corrupt cases will be
publicized.

He indicated, for the resumption of dialogue," a suitable

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns Against Unsafe Injection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Unsafe injection practices
throughout the world result in millions of infections which may
lead to serious disease and death, the World Health Organization (
WHO) warned in a statement released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Each year, over-use of injections and re-use of dirty syringes
and needles combine to cause an estimated 8-16 million hepatitis B
virus infections, 2.3-4.7 million hepatitis C virus infections,
and 80,000-160,000 infections with HIV/AIDS worldwide, according
to WHO studies.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, WHO said, a large proportion of hepatitis C
infections were caused by unsafe injection practices. In
particular, it appears that improperly sterilized needles were
used to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease.
</P>
<P>
About 13 percent of the Egyptian population is infected with
hepatitis C virus, leading to a high burden of chronic liver
disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
"Although most injections given in the world follow safe
clinical practices, poor injection practices continue to transmit
viral hepatitis and other infections on a large scale in many
countries. Appropriate measures can and must be taken to avoid
this route of transmission of disease," said Yvan Hutin of WHO's
Blood Safety and Clinical Technology Department.
</P>
<P>
In response to growing concern, WHO and several international
partners sharing a common goal in safe and appropriate use of
injections worldwide joined forces in October 1999 as a Safe
Injection Global Network (SIGN), which is co-ordinated by a
secretariat located at the WHO headquarters here in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
To prevent injection-associated infections worldwide, SIGN
recommends that countries implement a three-element strategy: to
change behavior among patients and healthcare workers to reduce
injection over-use and achieve injection safety, to ensure
sufficient availability of sterile syringes and needles, and to
appropriately destroy waste after use.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Develop-the-West Strategy (Update) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said today
that businesspeople from overseas are welcome to invest in the
west-east gas pipeline that runs through eight provinces and
cities with a total length of 4,200 kilometers from Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region in northwest China to eastern Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors can be allowed to have controlling shares in
and manage the project, which is scheduled to be completed within
two years, Zhu said, adding that west China will be granted the
same open preferential policies as was east China.
</P>
<P>
Overseas securities companies, banks, and insurance firms are
also encouraged to take part in developing China's west, the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark here this afternoon at a press conference
held shortly after the 3rd Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress concluded.
</P>
<P>
The central government has begun to put large amounts of money
into west China in a bid to improve infrastructure and eco-
environment. "Now we have sufficient supply of grain, so we have
asked farmers to return farmland to forests, pastures and lakes,
and in so doing can we create a beautiful ecological environment
and business environment for overseas investment, in west China,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Development of traditional industries in east China have been
saturated, while developing west China has come to a critical
stage, he said, adding that developing the western region is a
long-term arduous task to require the hard work of one generation,
two generations, or several generations.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji said that the large-scale development of the
country's central and western regions is a major policy decision
made by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee for
the new century in accordance with the late leader Deng Xiaoping's
strategy for China's modernization drive, which encompasses the
development of both the coastal and interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Western China including nine provinces and autonomous regions
and one municipality, with a total area of 5.4 million square
kilometers and a population of 285 million, accounting for 56
percent and 23 percent respectively of the national total.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Warns Against "Independence of Taiwan" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji warned
here today that China will not tolerate the "independence of
Taiwan" and that the Chinese people are ready to shed blood and
sacrifice their lives to defend the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of their motherland.
</P>
<P>
He made the warning at a press conference here which was held
shortly after the conclusion of the 3rd Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
"Some people have made some calculations about how many
aircraft, missiles and warships China possesses, and presumed that
China dare not and will not use force based on such calculations,"
Zhu said, "If such kind of calculations are feasible, Hitler would
have ruled the whole world."
</P>
<P>
"People making such calculations don't know about the Chinese
history. The Chinese people are ready to shed blood and sacrifice
their lives to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
the motherland," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his worries about recent dramatic changes in Taiwan,
Zhu urged Taiwan people not to act on impulse, otherwise "they
will have no other opportunity to regret."
</P>
<P>
Zhu cited plunging stock prices at the Taiwan stock market as
evidence showing the worries and anxieties of the Taiwan people,
who fear about possible war across the Taiwan Strait in case pro-
independenc people come into power during the election.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief in Taiwan people's political wisdom and
his trust for them to make a "wise, historic choice".
</P>
<P>
"But there are only three days left for the Taiwan election,
and the result could be hard to predict, since anything unexpected
could happen," he warned, calling for vigilance on the part of all
Taiwan compatriots against pro-independence forces.

<HEADLINE> Zhu: There Must be a Shift From Threat to Dialog Across Pacific Ocean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said here
today that there must be a shift from threat to dialog across the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark at a press conference following the
conclusion of the 3rd Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress, when commenting on U.S. President Bill Clinton's speech
at Johns Hopkins University on March 12, which is quoted as "There
must be a shift from threat to dialog across the Taiwan Strait."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that there was first the theory of "two states," then
came the white paper on the Taiwan issue. The white paper
comprehensively and in detail explains China's principles on Deng
Xiaoping's idea of peaceful reunification, "one country, two
systems" and President Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposal.
</P>
<P>
As for the position that the Taiwan issue cannot drag on
indefinitely, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping had said it as
early as in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan issue drags on indefinitely, how can we not
resort to the use of force to resolve it? Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Why the white paper on the Taiwan issue has caused such a
strong reaction, it is because some people in a certain country
have all along taken China as its potential enemy, take Taiwan as
an unsinkable aircraft carrier, and use it against China.
</P>
<P>
That is why there is a threat to interfere with China's
handling of the Taiwan issue from a certain country after the
white paper on the Taiwan issue was published, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has joined other Gulf
Arab states in banning the import of Danish beef and related
products for fear of the "mad cow" disease, a local daily reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are urged to get rid of these products, Director
General of the Food Department at Kuwait Municipality Jamaan Al-
Hajeri told the Arabic language newspaper Al-Seyassah (Politician).
</P>
<P>
Al-Hajeri said the ban was decided on by a technical committee
formed recently to study the issue.
</P>
<P>
The municipality will confiscate all Danish beef products from
the local market and has requested dealers to destroy related
products in hands, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United
Arab Emirates have also reportedly slapped a ban on Danish beef
products.
</P>
<P>
Danish Agriculture Ministry announced the presence of the "mad
cow" disease at a farm in Jutland on February 28.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Planes Bomb South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes Wednesday morning
launched three attacks on Lebanese guerrilla targets north to the
Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon, Lebanese security sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes fired eight missiles on the suspected outposts
of Hezbollah, or Party of God in retaliation for an earlier attack
by the Syrian and Iranian-backed guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
In the attack, Hezbollah launched 14 Katyusha rockets on two
Israeli positions near the international border.
</P>
<P>
So far, there have been no reports about casualties in the
Israeli raids.
</P>
<P>
Israel's intensified bombardment came three days after an Arab
foreign ministers' conference was held in Beirut. A resolution of
the conference harshly denounced Israel's aggression and attacks on
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Though Israel has decided to bring its troops out of south
Lebanon by July, Hezbollah has not slacked in its attacks.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which is seeking the full return of the Golan Heights
seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, insists on simultaneity
in ending Israeli occupation of Syrian and Lebanese lands.

<HEADLINE> Singapore MPs Concerned over Falling Birth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore parliament members
have voiced their concerns both in and outside the parliament over
the plummeting birth rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
The issue of making babies gripped the parliament Tuesday as
MPs debated on the budget estimates of the Ministry of Community
Development and Sports.
</P>
<P>
MP S Vasoo said the situation is serious as the country's total
fertility rate has dropped from 2.8 percent in 1970 to 1.5 percent
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that an inter-ministerial committee on family life
and development be set up to explore ways to reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
If left unchecked, he said, there will not be enough to defend
the country and also not enough workers to keep economy growing.
</P>
<P>
MP Wang Kai Yuan exaggerated things just to raise an alarm,
warning that "a nation that cannot revert its declining birth rate
is effectively committing collective suicide."
</P>
<P>
MPs argued heatedly in the parliament and gave out different
versions in exploring causes for the problem.
</P>
<P>
Wang Kai Yuan said the root of the problem lies in the
perceptions of young women towards family life and suggested that
schools inculcate the "desire for children in our young women."
</P>
<P>
However, MP Lily Neo contradicted his reasoning, saying it was
the men who need their mindset changed.
</P>
<P>
She underlined that husbands cannot depend on their wives to
take charge of the household as well as parenting.
</P>
<P>
She also urged the ministry to mount a campaign to encourage
working couples to have more babies.
</P>
<P>
One day earlier, MP Yu Foo Yee Shoon, who doubles Senior
Parliamentary Secretary, told a seminar on women that among
university graduates aged 35 to 44, ten percent of the male and 25
percent of the female remain single and of those having high
schoolings, 11 percent of the male and 21 percent of the female
are leading single life.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the most difficult job she had experienced
since her involvement in politics 10 years ago was to promote
marriage and baby-making.
</P>
<P>
She expressed hope that Singapore's fertility rate would
rebound in the new century from current 1.48 percent to 2.1
percent which a population needs to replace itself.

<HEADLINE> Insecurity Forces African Countries to Break IMF Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- African countries have failed to
fulfil requirements set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
because they have to deal with insecurity resulting from the
spread of illegal arms, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has said.
</P>
<P>
Firearms in the wrong hands had added fuel to criminal
activities, forcing governments to channel more resources to
maintaining peace, Moi said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Many African countries are forced to follow IMF rules. But
what happens when insecurity takes its toll on the region and we
are forced to break these rules? There can be no economic
development where there is no peace," Moi said at the Great Lakes
Region and Horn of Africa Conference on Proliferation of Small
Arms and Light Weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is more important to us than the security of our
people and their freedom from living in fear," he added.
</P>
<P>
He asked African countries to form national commissions to
check the proliferation of illegal arms.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to manufacturers and suppliers of small arms
to establish strong monitoring mechanisms to control the source of
illicit arms.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference, which started on Sunday, has brought
together foreign ministers and senior officials from nine other
African countries, including Tanzania, the Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi,
Uganda, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of
the Congo.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Maize Deficit to Ease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's maize deficit for the
1999/2000 season will not be as severe as expected owing to a
better harvest in the short rainy season and a revision of
domestic needs, officials and analysts have said.
</P>
<P>
The February to March short rains harvest rose to 430,000 tons,
compared with the average output of 410,000, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) famine early warning system
showed production was projected at 2.6 million tons, compared with
an earlier estimate of 2.52 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the national consumption is estimated at 2.81
million tons annually against an earlier forecast of 2.9 million
tons and that leaves a deficit of 210,000 tons instead of 380,000,
according to sources from the Kenyan government.
</P>
<P>
"Earlier estimates were based on a population of 30 million
people, but now we are using the new figure of 28.7 million
obtained from the recent census," said one analyst.

<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese companies announced
today that they would allocate part of their shares to investors
in the secondary market, marking the beginning of China's reform
in initial public offering (IPO) by enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to their announcement, the Dahua Co. Ltd. in Cangzhou
city of north China's Hebei Province will be offering 80 million
shares to the public, of which 32 million shares will be available
to secondary market investors.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Cement Co. Ltd., which is offering 70 million
shares to the public, will also offer part of the shares to
secondary market investors.
</P>
<P>
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced
last February that after allocations to securities investment
funds, enterprises would have to offer half of the remaining
shares to secondary market investors in their IPOs.
</P>
<P>
According to the CSRC, secondary market investors can purchase
1,000 shares of new stocks for every 10,000 yuan in market value
of stocks they currently hold.
</P>
<P>
The reform was welcomed by the market. Analysts said it would
establish an interaction between the primary and secondary markets,
reduce the unreasonably high profit in the primary market and
increase capital supply to the secondary market.

The Year 2000 marks the turn of the century, Li said, noting

The goals for this year has been set, guiding principles and
policies clarified, and the most important of all is to ensure the
implementation of them, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He called for the entire Chinese people to rally more closely
around the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at the core, uphold the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, and work harder still to greet the new century with
outstanding achievements.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economy Technologically Sophisticated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CANBERRA, March 15 (Xinhua) - Viewing Australia as an old
economy was completely outmoded, Australian Treasurer Peter
Costello said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Those people who are in the camp that says Australia is an old
economy do not have an accurate read on the sophisticated
Australian economy of today," Costello told reporters, saying that
"this economy, like most industrialized economies, is building a
sophisticated services base and the view that Australia is just a
farm and a quarry is completely outmoded."
</P>
<P>
Costello said while mining and agriculture were still important,
they made up just 3.4 per cent and 4.5 per cent of GDP
respectively, compared to 6.9 per cent for finance and insurance.
</P>
<P>
Australians owned more mobile phones per head of population than
Americans and had a high rate of ownership of personal computers
and Internet use, giving e-commerce good penetration.
</P>
<P>
"On the empirical evidence, the Australian economy is a very
technologically sophisticated economy, the uptake of new
technology in Australia is very quick and very widespread by world
terms," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in January
2000 was estimated at 9.3 percent in the Philippines, higher than
the rate of 9 percent in the same period last year, the government
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Office said in a press statement issued
here that unemployment levels increased accordingly by 153
thousand from 2.8 million to 2.95 million.
</P>
<P>
The National Capital Region, Central Luzon, Suthern Tagalog and
Central Visayas posted two-digit unemployment rate of 16.2, 10.5
and 10.1 percent respectively, the office added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the employment rate dropped to 90.7 percent this
year form 91 percent last year, indicating that the increase in
the number of employed persons did not keep up with the increase
in the labor force population.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, persons joining the labor force
population expanded to 31.8 million in January 2000 from 31.2
million a year ago, or an increase of 2.2 percent or 680 thousand.
</P>
<P>

decreased by 152 thousand and the corresponding underemployment
rate dropped by 0.9 percentage point, from 22.1 percent to 21.2.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says Chechen Rebels in Key Village Defeated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russian federal forces have
virtually ended a week-long operation to crush a large Chechen
rebel group led by warlord Ruslan Gelayev in a village near the
exit of the key Argun valley, a top Russian military official said
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
"The band of the Chechen field commander Ruslan Gelayev, which
entrenched itself at the village of Komsomolskoye in south
Chechnya, has been practically rooted out, and there is no
resistance as such from it," Colonel General Alexander Baranov,
acting commander of the Russian federal forces in Chechnya,
confirmed on the TV Vremya program.
</P>
<P>
The Russian units had been confronted by an estimated number of
500 rebels, around 400 of which were killed and another 56 were
captured during the fighting, said the general.
</P>
<P>
He said "there were several places" at Komsomolskoye where
bandits were "hiding in basements." They surfaced and opened fire
sporadically, but "they were blocked."
</P>
<P>
The general said that "with the onset of dusk, shooting and
resistance stopped." Federal troops surrounded several community
buildings, and destroyed its basement rooms.
</P>
<P>
Baranov said Gelayev and his family could be among the rebels
remaining in the besieged village, which is his native village in
the Urus-Martan district.
</P>
<P>
"I think he could not escape," Baranov said, adding that
Gelayev could either be killed or "lying low in some cellar."

<HEADLINE> Housing Attracting Huge Funds Amid Steady Growth of Fixed Asset Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China's fixed-asset investment
amounted to 95.5 billion yuan (11.5 billion U.S.dollars) in the
first two months this year, growing 8.6 percent on an annual basis,
the National Bureau of Statistics said today.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the real estate sector enjoyed the fastest growth
of 19.8 percent, hitting 24.6 billion yuan (3 billion U.S. dollars)
, with one-third of the money going to commercial housing.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the bureau attributed the rapid growth to the
further implementation of housing reforms and resurgent sales of
commercial housing.
</P>
<P>
Between January and February, investment in the industrial
sector picked up thanks to the strong growth in renovation
projects. Total investment reached 30.9 billion yuan (3.7 billion
U.S.dollars), up 8.2 percent year on year.
</P>
<P>
China launched 2,874 new projects in the two months, 818 more

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Official Cash Rate Raised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's central bank,
the Reserve Bank, increased the official cash rate (OCR) from 5.25
percent to 5.75 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The OCR is the rate at which banks lend money to each other and
also the key base interest rate that determines home mortgage
rates and influences returns on deposits.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the OCR means homeowners and borrowers will pay
higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Some local bank economists predict floating mortgage rates in
New Zealand will hit nine percent this year and 10 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
At present, the major banks in the country are offering
mortgages at a floating rate of 7.6 percent, which is up from 6.5
percent last October.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the increase, Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash
said the rise is necessary because the New Zealand economy has
been growing at a rate of three to four percent in the past year.
</P>
<P>
"Barring surprises, we expect growth will continue at a broadly
similar pace over the next two to three years," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the third interest rate rise in four months. But, Dr
Brash said he is confident the increases in November and January
have been justified.
</P>
<P>
He warned that New Zealand has not reached the economy in which
low inflation can partner high economic growth.

<HEADLINE> ATA Forecasts 40 Percent Rise in Airline Fuel Costs in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Airline fuel costs in 2000
could rise by 4.4 billion U.S. dollars, or 40 percent, over 1999,
almost as much as the industry made in profits last year,
according to an industry association forecast.
</P>
<P>
On an annualized basis, the Air Transport Association (ATA)
forecast that jet fuel costs will rise to 14.6 billion dollars in
2000 from 10.2 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The ATA compared the projected 4.4-billion-dollar rise in fuel
costs to the 4.85-billion-dollar net profit the industry earned in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources believe that fuel is the airline industry's
second largest cost, after labor. Last year, 8.8 percent of
revenue was used to pay for jet fuel and the figure is expected to
rise to 12.1 percent this year, the ATA said.
</P>
<P>
Despite better fuel efficiency, the high costs must mean an
increase in ticket costs, said the ATA, whose member carriers
transport 95 percent of U.S. passenger and cargo traffic.
</P>
<P>
"Our costs are going up dramatically and airlines have no
choice but to pass these increased costs, as much as possible, on
to the consumer," ATA Chief Economist David Swierenga said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Fuel prices began an upward climb in the latter part of last
year. Last week U.S. oil prices rose to more than 30 dollars per
barrel, a nine-year high since the end of the Gulf War in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Engineers' Strike Enters 36th Day Without Sign of Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co., the largest
aircraft maker in the world, and its 17,000 striking engineers are
girding for a lengthy work stoppage, with both sides saying on
Tuesday they saw no reason to expect an imminent settlement of the
35-day walkout, according to reports from the Seattle-based
company.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we have made our final offer and there are no
indications of movement back to the bargaining table," Boeing
labor spokesman Peter Conte said. "We continue to believe we are
at an impasse and are deadlocked."
</P>
<P>
Even with commercial jet deliveries slowed to a trickle by the
strike of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in
Aerospace (SPEEA), Boeing insists the parties have nothing to talk
about.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has delivered just two jets since March 1 after
squeezing out 15 of 30 planes slated for delivery after the strike
began on February 9.
</P>
<P>
SPEEA, for its part, claims that about 18,000 of the 21,000
engineers and technicians represented by its Seattle bargaining
unit are on the picket line demanding better wages, benefits and
bonus pay than the company has offered.
</P>
<P>
SPEEA leaders have said they are still willing to talk, denying
Boeing's claim of impasse -- an important legal definition that
could ultimately allow Boeing to effectively fire strikers by
hiring permanent replacements.
</P>
<P>
"We're still perplexed by (Boeing's) lack of reaction. We're
still willing to meet with them. We've always tried to keep some
channel open," SPEEA spokesman Bill Dugovich said.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts and labor experts say they find Boeing's
stance puzzling, since the amount of money separating the two
sides seems rather minor, considering the potential damage to the
company's bottom line and its image.
</P>
<P>
SPEEA engineers, earning an average of 63,000 U.S. dollars a
year, and technicians, earning 45,000 dollars, have said they were
insulted that Boeing failed to offer a bonus like the 10-percent
payout to 44,000 machinists last summer.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Electronics Exports Surging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's electronics
exports are predicted to hit one billion NZ dollars (493 million U.
S. dollars) in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest study commissioned by Trade NZ and
Industrial Research and Technology NZ, the industry has a heavy
export focus, selling 80 percent of its products and services
offshore. The study, based on information from 68 New Zealand
companies and estimated to cover about 90 percent of the sector,
showed that earnings from the export of electronics products and
services during the year 1999 are expected to exceed 800 million
NZ dollars (394.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Stephen O'Neill, manager of the electronics sector of Trade NZ,
was quoted as saying that it is likely total export earnings from
the industry will approach one billion NZ dollars by the end of
this year, based on the strength of the sector's growth over the
past two years. The challenge for Trade NZ, he said, is to help
the industry broaden and deepen its export base.
</P>
<P>
Most New Zealand electronics exporters are in the industrial
and commercial field, with smaller numbers in the healthcare,
radio communications and agricultural markets, he said. But, he
added, 18 largest companies in the sector contribute 90 percent of
exports.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the United States takes 30 percent of
New Zealand's electronics exports, followed by Australia, with 23
percent,Europe 21 percent, and Asia 13 percent. "All these markets
plus China and the Middle East are predicted to have good growth
prospects in future," it said.

He said his office will continue and improve the investigation

headquarters of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI).
</P>
<P>
"We will ask for permission from the president to start
investigating the alleged involvement of high officials," he was
quoted by the Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the police has set up a special team to deal with
investigations, adding that up to now, the team has questioned at
least 51 people, including protesters, victims and suspects.
</P>

<HEADLINE> IMF Lauds Nepal's Macro-Economic Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary Fund (
IMF)has praised in its annual country report Nepal's macro-
economic stability and improvement in the external position.
</P>
<P>
In its Public Information Notice, available here Wednesday, the
IMF said that its Executive Board expected the Nepalese economy to
grow at an encouraging 6 percent during the current fiscal year
ending in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
The board has, however, expressed serious concerns over the
fiscal side.
</P>
<P>
"Fiscal performance in 1998/1999 was disappointing, continuing
the trend of underperformance on revenue and development spending,
" the notice said. "The overall deficit before grants was 6.25
percent of GDP, while total revenue amounted to 10 percent of GDP,
lower than budgeted and those of previous two years."
</P>
<P>
On the performance in the first quarter of the current fiscal
year,the board said faster development spending and an increase in
civil service allowances have led to higher-than-expected domestic
financing.
</P>
<P>
The board has also shown concern over the excess liquidity in
commercial banks, saying that a fairly loose monetary policy has
led to excess liquidity in commercial banks, much of which has
been placed in foreign currency assets.
</P>
<P>
After converting the accumulated overdraft of the government
into treasury bills, Nepal's central bank has disposed of over
half of these securities, according to the notice.
</P>
<P>
"Reflecting the limited lending opportunities and excess
liquidity,the interest rates on treasury bills have been negative
in real terms since December 1997," the notice said.

condition of a member country after consulting and discussing with

<HEADLINE> IMF Warns Indonesia Over Possible Loan Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (
IMF)has requested Indonesia to take swift action to break its
private debt deadlock, and warned lending could be halted again if
the key players in the national banking scandal were not brought
to justice.
</P>
<P>
"We would have to reconsider the program as we did in the past,
"IMF's Senior Representative in Indonesia John Dodsworth was
quoted by the Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying, referring
to the Bank Bali scandal.
</P>
<P>
The scandal, which helped wreck former president B.J. Habibie's
political career last year, revolves around a 60 percent
commission paid by Bank Bali to a firm run by a leading member of
the former ruling Golkar Party for the recovery of 904 billion
rupiah (129 million U.S. dollars) in loans from the Indonesian
Banking Restructuring Agency (IBRA).
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended loans to Indonesia last year over the scandal,
but signed a new agreement in January this year under which it
committed to disburse aid package mounting to 5 billion U.S.
dollars over the next three years to the country.
</P>
<P>
As a part of the agreement, Indonesia pledged to improve
governance and take steps to force companies to begin
restructuring their debts as well as negotiate with creditors.
</P>
<P>
So far just a little bit of commitment has been implemented.
</P>
<P>
"The new strategy announced earlier by the government is only
partly in place," Dodsworth said, adding that while IBRA had shown
progress, the setting up of a special team to investigate
corruption in the judicial system was not in place.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that one reason for the continued stalemate over
private debt was the failure of the bankruptcy court here to deal
with several high-profile cases.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing wrong with the bankruptcy law. It is the
application of that law that creates the problems. The bankruptcy
law is not working," he added.

<HEADLINE> Water Deemed as Serious Problem in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Environmentalists have warned that
due to the seriously lost forest cover, water has become a serious
problem in the Philippines, Philippine News Agency (PNA) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At present, of the country's 30-million-hectare total land area,
less than 20 percent has forest cover, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
The forest cover loss means the disappearance of very vital
watersheds and catchment basins which recharge the water drawn
from the surface and from the aquifer, environmentalists explained.
</P>
<P>
In addition, due to the inefficient water use, the degradation
of available water by pollution, and the unsustainable use of
underground water in aquifers, the Philippines is in for a big
water problem in the new millennium, environmentalists warned.
</P>
<P>
They urged proper water management and development of a water
conservation culture including the rehabilitation of lost
watersheds.

<HEADLINE> EU Formally Nominates New Candidate for IMF Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Tuesday
formally nominated Germany's Horst Koehler as its candidate to
head the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at an IMF board meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, the international financial organization
noted that Portugal's representative to the IMF Joao Santos had
proposed Koehler, a former German deputy finance minister who now
heads the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, on behalf of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
German board member Bernd Esdar, in a separate statement
introducing the EU's new candidate, said Koehler was "eminently
qualified to lead the fund at the dawn of a new century."
</P>
<P>
"The extraordinary and complex challenges facing this
institution demand a strong and experienced leader with the
strength of character to steer a steady yet flexible course. Horst
Koehler's background meets this test," Esdar said.
</P>
<P>
"Executive directors will continue their consultations with
each other and their national authorities on the next steps," the
institution said, adding "No decision has been made on the timing
of any vote."
</P>
<P>
Koehler is the EU's second candidate to lead the IMF. The first
nominee, Caio Koch-Weser, pulled out last week after the United
States made clear it would not back him for the job. Japan had
formally withdrawn former Vice Minister of the Finance Ministry
Eisuke Sakakibara as a candidate to head the fund, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has promised to support Koehler,
with Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers lauding on Tuesday that
Koehler would bring extensive international experience to the
position.
</P>
<P>
The White House noted that the IMF's "excellent management team
" would remain in place.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Afford to Protect Forest Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Qingyuan County of
east China's Zhejiang Province used to cut large quantities of
wood to cultivate cash-earning mushrooms, a table delicacy, but
today, they themselves plant trees for cultivating mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
Qingyuan County, known "China's Mushroom City", is the first
place in the world to plant mushrooms and has a history of 800
years.
</P>
<P>
At present, 50 percent of the county's total income and the
city's per capita income come from mushroom growing.
</P>
<P>
A survey on the county's forest resources show that local
forest reserves were 7.43 million cubic meters in 1984, the figure
decreased to 4.78 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the sustainable development of the mushroom growing,
the county government established a license system in early 1999,
under which the county government decides the total mushroom
output in accordance with the conditions of forest resources and
the demand on the market and issue licenses to mushroom growers.
</P>
<P>
More than 24,000 households are engaged in mushroom growing,
accounting for 55 percent of the county's total, statistics also
show.
</P>
<P>
This spring, local farmers planted 800,000 trees on hill slopes
and private plots. The county government also invested large sums
of money in planting trees.

<HEADLINE> WB-funded Project Benefits East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province in east China will
make a profit of 7 billion yuan (about 840 million U.S. dollars)
this year from afforestation projects funded by the World Bank
since 1991, official sources have said.
</P>
<P>
The province invested 700 million yuan (about 84 million U.S.
dollars) in the past decade in planting 180,000 hectares of trees.
</P>
<P>
Anhui has vast hilly areas suitable for planting trees. The
province has 4.1 million hectares of forest areas, covering 28.9
percent of the provincial total land area.
</P>
<P>
The afforestation projects the province launched in the past 10
years have resulted in 97,000 hectares of fast-growing high-yield
trees, 33,3000 hectares of artificially-planted trees and 50,000
hectares of fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province also established nine forestry
product processing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimated, these projects may produce 21.5 million
cubic meters of timber, and 302,6000 tons of fruits.
</P>
<P>
 The added that they can produce a profit of 16.217 billion
yuan (about 1.92 billion U.S. dollars), which means a net income
of 7 billion yuan (840 million U.S. dollars) after deducting cost,
investment and taxes.
</P>
<P>
While helping increasing the province's vegetation by three to
five percent, these projects helped reduce the soil erosion in the
project areas.

<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited China Bank
Association is scheduled to make its debut during the first
quarter of this year, China Daily reports today.
</P>
<P>
The association, a non-governmental organization that includes
four state commercial banks and ten other commercial banks
nationwide, should open within the first three months of the year
according to the central bank's plan, the newspaper quoted a
spokesperson for the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China(ICBC)
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plan, however, still requires the approval of the Ministry
of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The association's major function will be coordinating operation
of the commercial banks to avoid malicious competition, and ICBC
president Jiang Jianqing will become its first chairman.
</P>
<P>
Liu Mingkang, president of the Bank of China (BOC), said that
the association will encourage experienced exchange and fair play
between commercial banks and facilitate communication between the
central bank and the commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders said that foreign bankers in China are also
considering establishment of a similar association to reflect the
problems they have met when conducting business in China.

<HEADLINE> Leading Grain Producer to Restructure Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China's leading grain producer
Henan Province plans to spend 150 million yuan this year
facilitating the restructuring of its agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The province will focus its restructuring effort on reducing
the acreage for farm products that are in oversupply and of poor
quality and developing marketable cash crops, livestock breeding
and aquiculture according to Ma Zhongchen, secretary of Henan
Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and a deputy
to the National People's Congress, in session here since early
March.
</P>
<P>
Adjusting the agricultural sector has been listed as a major
task for the provincial government as stockpiles of farm products
such as grain and cotton mount nationwide, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
He said Henan has encountered similar problems as growth of its
rural economy and farmers' income has slowed down in recent years.
The province recorded a grain output of 42.53 million tons last
year, with annual average per-capita income of rural residents
exceeding 1,948 yuan.
</P>
<P>
A major problem for the agro-sector in Henan lies in an
unbalanced development in farming and other agro-sectors such as
forestry, animal husbandry, fishing and the cultivation of cash
crops, Ma said. Output of grain accounts for 72 percent of the
agricultural output in Henan, and the rising stocks of cotton and
grain stand out as a prominent problem for the province.
</P>
<P>
To further restructure its agricultural sector, Henan plans to
develop the processing of agricultural by-products, and the first
step is to establish 50 big processing enterprises, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the government financing of 150 million yuan
this year, the province will encourage financial institutions to
render strong support to the restructuring effort and encourage
private investment as well.
</P>
<P>
Related provincial departments are also planning an information
network and a system to facilitate the spreading of agrotechniques
in rural areas to facilitate the restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
Henan with 90 million people is the most populous province in
China. It scored 45.8 billion yuan in Gross Domestic Product last
year, the fifth largest in the nation.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Propose Law to Spur Shipbuilding Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A group of deputies of the
National People's Congress (NPC) have submitted a proposal to the
annual NPC session, which is to end here later today, urging the
enactment of a specific law on accelerating the pace for the
growth of China's shipbuilding industry.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was set forth by NPC deputies from Shanghai, the
municipality with largest shipbuilding industry in China, on March
10 and the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for
National Defense gave a reply on March 13, voicing its agreement
with the deputies and regards shipbuilding as a "strategic
industry with the most typical features of integrating the defense
industry with civil sector."
</P>
<P>
This has been so far one of the first NPC proposals that have
been given replies most promptly.
</P>
<P>
China's maritime territory covers three million square
kilometers, teamed with quite a number of straits and islands,
which are of important strategic importance and become "hot zones"
drawing world attention.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Youjun, one of the NPC deputies who raised the bill, said
China should develop its shipbuilding industry for both defense
and commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China should mainly rely on its own efforts to
improve the equipment of its ocean-going vessels, Zhang said, its
economic growth requires the support of vast merchant fleets,
propped up by a booming shipbuilding sector with a concentration
of new and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese legislators have suggested repeatedly in the past
decades drafting the law to revitalize the country's shipbuilding
industries, following the examples of Japan and the Republic of
Korea, which had enacted similar laws and already become two top
shipbuilding nations in the world.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Pilot New Laws on Graft Fighting, Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, a pioneer in
the country's two-decade reform and opening drive, is now
experimenting with the enactment of new laws on corruption
fighting and foreign trade, said Zhu Senlin, the province's top
legislator and a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC),
in session here since early March.
</P>
<P>
The NPC will enact similar national laws on the basis of
experience obtained from the pioneering legislative work of the
southern province, which accounts for 40 percent of the country's
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, Guangdong has served as an experimental ground for
legislation for the nation. Of the more than 300 local laws and
regulations the province has enacted since then, about 60 percent
are of a pioneering and experimental nature, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He said, currently, the provincial people's congress has
organized a group of law experts to study laws and regulations to
deal with problems that may arise after China enters the World
Trade Organization (WTO.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province is actively exploring ways to make the
process of legislation more scientific and transparent, Zhu said.
For example, the standing committee of the provincial people's
congress last year held public hearings on regulations it intended
to enact on public bidding for construction projects.
</P>
<P>
If the proposed Law on Legislation, or law on law-making, is
adopted by this NPC session, it will enable Guangdong's
legislative work to become more standardized and improve the
quality of its legislation, Zhu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica will resume talks
with Nicaragua to resolve the dispute regarding navigation in the
San Juan River, which borders Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Foreign Minister Roberto Rojas will travel to
Nicaragua Wednesday to represent his country in the negotiations.
The talks will be held on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of American States (OAS) named its General
Secretary Cesar Gaviria facilitator of the process last week.
</P>
<P>
The San Juan River, which both countries share a border for
nearly 300 kilometers, belongs to Nicaragua, according to
prevailing treaties. Costa Rica, however, has the right of free
navigation.
</P>
<P>
A dispute arose in June, 1998, when the new Costa Rican
government rejected the presence of a Nicaraguan military man in a
Costa Rican police boat. In response, the Nicaraguan side
prohibited the transit of armed Costa Rican police officers.
</P>
<P>
That decision, according to San Jose authorities, violated the
treaty and other regulations of free navigation in the river.

WUHAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese workers have been operating
at full-force to complete reinforcement of 54 sections of
embankments along the Yangtze River in the run-up to the summer
flood season.

<P>
The work stretches between Jingzhou city of central China's

<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province is determined to build itself into a maritime money-maker
in ten years.
</P>
<P>
In an address to a provincial meeting on maritime affairs,
Deputy Governor Ou Guangyuan said he wants Guangdong's maritime
sector to contribute more than ten percent to the province's gross
domestic product (GDP) in ten years.
</P>
<P>
The added value created by the maritime sector presently makes
up 6.6 percent of Guangdong's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is the biggest beneficiary of China's reform and open-
up drive. It has an offshore area of 450,000 sq. km, more than
double the province's land area.
</P>
<P>
The deputy governor explained the construction of four major
economic zones along the coast would push Guangdong to explore
marine resources. The zones are the area around the estuary of the
Pearl River, the eastern and western Guangdong maritime
development zones, and zones based on the province's numerous
islands.
</P>
<P>
These zones will specialize in maritime transport, marine
fishery, petrochemical industry and marine processing.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will set aside 10 million yuan
annually in funding for comprehensive maritime development
purposes, over the next five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Simone Inzaghi scored four goals as
Italy's Lazio drubbed French club Olympique Marseille 5-1 in the
Champions League on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The victory boosted Lazio's confidence, lifting the team into
second place in Group D, a point ahead of Feyenoord who have seven
points following their 3-1 defeat to Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
Inzaghi opened the scoring in the 17th minute on a pass from
Pavel Nedved and came close to adding a second six minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Marseille then blasted the ball into the net in the 27th minute
but the goal from Jacques Abardonado was ruled out for offside.
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later Inzaghi struck again as he netted on a Sergio
Conceicao pass and within two minutes he completed his hat-trick
when he pounced on a deflected shot from Alen Boksic.
</P>
<P>
Marseille pulled one back in the 50th minute on a Jerome Leroy
header and stepped up their attack.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later Inzaghi was awarded a penalty kick after
being fouled in the area but failed to score from the spot.
</P>
<P>
Inzaghi then grabbed his and Lazio's fourth as he tapped in a
Conceicao cross-shot from close range in the 71st minute.
</P>
<P>
Boksic completed the rout when he headed home a pinpoint cross
from Conceicao.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province has
got everything ready for the challenges that will face the tourism
industry once China enters the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Du Yunsheng, head of Hubei
Provincial Tourism Bureau, said that his province will offer
carefully-planned tour packages to such popular sites as the Three
Gorges along the Yangtze River, the primitive forests at
Shennongjia of western Hubei, and central Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province will also invest more in building
hotels and other facilities while improving general tourism
services.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, construction of highways connecting
to major scenic sites, including the highway linking Yichang, the
nearest city to the Three Gorges Dam, with the Shennongjia
Primitive Forest Zone, and mountain roads which bring Jiugong and
Dabie mountains to the outside world, will be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
New air routes connecting Wuhan, the provincial capital of
Hubei, to Southeast Asian countries such as Japan and the Republic
of Korea (ROK) will be opened.
</P>
<P>
The Hubei tourism industry now generates about 400,000 jobs in
the province and contributes 6.2 percent to the province's GDP.

HOHHOT, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Sun Shuyan, a 32-year old woman in
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has become the
first individual in the country to be involved in the screening
and distribution of 16-mm films.
</P>
<P>
People in the Inner Mongolian highlands have few means of
entertainment, as telecommunication, transportation, and power
supplies are underdeveloped. And many local screening companies
are reluctant to buy new films and upgrade their machines since
the Central government abolished subsidies for showing movies.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the regional officials have encouraged
private enterprises to enter the market by offering preferential
policies, such as 50 percent discounts on film rental.
</P>
<P>
Sun, a businesswoman, was excited to see related government
documents on February 12 this year. She made an decision instantly
to have a try as she had long noticed that herdsmen and those in
economically backward areas could not have much chance to see
films.
</P>
<P>
Film screening and distribution has long been under state
control in China.

<HEADLINE> Leeds Manager Tells Arsenal Boss to Stop Moaning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Leeds manager David O'Leary believes Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger
should stop moaning about the rigors of the UEFA Cup, saying the
Gunners should not be in the tournament in the first place after
their Champions League exit.
</P>
<P>
O'Leary has criticized the format of this season's UEFA Cup
since the start of the competition, because it allowed some
Champions League sides to enter after failing at the first hurdle.
</P>
<P>
Wenger's Gunners joined the UEFA Cup at the third-round stage
but, after their weekend defeat at Middlesbrough, he criticized
the tournament, saying fixture congestion reduced recovery time
for his players between matches.
</P>
<P>
O'Leary has known this fact since being paired with Partizan
Belgrade in the first round, a Champions League team who failed to
come through the early qualifying rounds.
</P>
<P>
O'Leary, whose side face Slavia Prague in a UEFA Cup quarter-
final first-leg tie this Thursday at Elland Road, has little
sympathy with Wenger and his team's plight.
</P>
<P>
"Goodness knows what they (UEFA) will come up with in the
summer," said O'Leary. "But you've just got to get on with it
because they're the rules, although they change every year as they
try to spice things up.
</P>
<P>
"You never know, they might come out of the Champions League
and into the semi final next year.
</P>
<P>
"I think Mr. Wenger was going on about the UEFA Cup and saying
it's a strain on his side. I personally don't think they should
even be in it. Why didn't they say when they came out of the
Champions League that they didn't want to be in the UEFA Cup in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
"Now I like Arsenal Football Club and I've got many great
friends there. But I just hope a UEFA Cup team wins this because
that would be great for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"We don't moan about the tiredness and the games, we just get
on with it. Hopefully we can keep going. We haven't got the
capacity to do it, but we're defying the logic on that one," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Souness Becomes Blackburn Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Graeme Souness has signed a three-
and-a-half-year deal with English first division soccer club
Blackburn to take the post as the club's new manager.
</P>
<P>
The former Liverpool, Rangers and Southampton boss took over at
Ewood Park from caretaker boss Tony Parkes.
</P>
<P>
He has been working as a TV pundit since leaving his job as
coach of Portuguese side Benfica last year.
</P>
<P>
Parkes had initially been handed the job until the end of the
season - but Sunday's shock defeat by Crewe all but ended
Blackburn's hopes of claiming a play-off place and forced Rovers'
directors into a U-turn.
</P>
<P>
Souness takes the job with immediate effect, but Parkes - who
has so often bailed out Rovers in times of trouble - will stay on
as his assistant.
</P>
<P>
"This is a wonderful opportunity and just the sort of challenge
I relish," Souness said.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted to be back in day-to-day management,
particularly as the chance has come at a club as ambitious as
Blackburn Rovers," he added.

CAIRO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey has repaid a total of 272.7 million U.S.
dollars of foreign debt on March 1-14, said the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 2.66586 billion dollars of foreign debts
have been refunded since January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Azerbaijan welcomes more Iranian construction firms to
do business in the country, said visiting Azeri Foreign Minister
Vilayat Guliyev on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made during his meeting with Iranian Minister of
Housing and Urban Development Ali Abdolalizadeh, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two sides would sign contracts in
various areas particularly in road and transportation during the
forthcoming visit by Azeri President Geidar Aliyev to Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said his country was interested in inviting Iranian
construction firms to help build the Azeri Foreign Ministry
building in Baku and the Baku-Astara freeway.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Abdolalizadeh said that Iran sees Azerbaijan as a
brotherly country and is ready to help Azerbaijan carry out its
development projects.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish government has been urged to open the
border between Turkey and Armenia to facilitate business activities
and boost bilateral trade, the Anatolia News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey keeps its border gates with Armenia closed primarily due
to the territorial disputes between Turkey's two Caucasus neighbors
-- Armenia and Azerbaijan, said a business leader in a province in
the Black Sea region.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey should not only exert efforts to help find a solution to
the problems between Azerbaijan and Armenia, but also accelerate
the preparations for the opening of its border gates with Armenia,"
said Sadan Eren, chairman of the Executive Board of the Chamber of
Commerce and Industry in the Trabzon Province.
</P>
<P>
Turkish products worth 100 million U.S. dollars had found way
into Armenia annually via Georgia and Iran, according to Armenian
officials.
</P>
<P>
This means that Turkey has lost at least 20 to 30 million
dollars a year due to the closure of the border, he said. For this
reason Turkey should approach Armenia to open the border gates as
soon as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- Oman's imports volume went down from 2.2 billion
riyals (5.72 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998 to 1.8 billion riyals
(4.7 billion dollars) in 1999, said the Central Bank of Oman.
</P>
<P>
The drop was mainly attributed to a tariff hike on accessories
by 5 percent last year, thus making importers pay more fees and cut
down their activities.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 the Omani government decided to raise customs duties to
offset the impact of revenue losses caused by oil output reduction.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's exports volume in the first six months of the
1999/2000 fiscal year went up to 2.9 billion U.S. dollars from 2.1
billion dollars in the same period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
During the past six months, Egypt's oil exports earnings stood
at 453.4 million dollars and commodity exports volume at 339
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Release 15 Palestinian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel will release 15
Palestinian political prisoners in the coming days as a goodwill
gesture to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, Israel Radio
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators on the prisoner affair
reached agreement on the number of prisoners to be released after
several hours of talks in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice, lasts four days starting
from Thursday. Hisham Abdel-Razek, Palestinian minister of prisoner
affairs who led the Palestinian negotiating team, said the two
sides would discuss more release after the holiday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side had demanded that Israel free 100
Palestinian political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The decision to release the 15 Palestinian prisoners came
several hours after the Israeli security cabinet approved a long-
overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank,
which cleared the way for a resumption of peace negotiations in
Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
Israel has freed some 450 prisoners since Prime Minister Ehud
Barak signed an interim peace deal with Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat last September.
</P>
<P>
The release of Palestinian political prisoners is an emotional
issue for both Israel and the Palestinians. The latest Israeli
gesture is expected to improve the atmosphere between the two
sides. Israeli is still holding more than 1,500 Palestinian
prisoners.

<HEADLINE> International Community Urged to Push For Solution to Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
on Wednesday urged the international community to push for a
solution to the Cyprus issue, Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National
Assembly, Clerides who is on a four-day working visit to Paris
criticized the Turkish Cypriots for setting preconditions for the
talks on the reunification of the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled south
and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus' government has insisted that the Cyprus issue must
be resolved on the basis of the establishment of bizonal,
bicommunal federation in line with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
But the Turkish Cypriot leadership has refused to have face-to-
face talks with President Clerides, a Greek Cypriot, unless the
breakaway state in northern Cyprus be recognized internationally as
a prelude to reunification in the form of a two-state
confederation.
</P>
<P>
So far, the two communities on the island have held two rounds
of proximity talks in New York and Geneva respectively, and the
third such talks is scheduled to take place in New York in May.
</P>
<P>
Referring to U.N.-sponsored proximity talks, Clerides said
that "new complications arises", because Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash is now bringing up preconditions for the talks,
demanding that they be met before any discussion on the core issues
of the Cyprus issue take place.
</P>
<P>
Clerides urged the international community to exert the
appropriate influence on Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership,
in order to give the decisive impetus to settle the Cyprus issue, "
in the context of the U.N. Security Council parameters."
</P>
<P>
Clerides also said that Cyprus' accession to the European Union
(EU) will benefit all the communities of the island and act as a
catalyst towards a solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started substantive accession talks with the EU in
November 1998. It hopes to be admitted as an EU member by January
2003.

<HEADLINE> Iran Slams U.S. for Delivering Advanced Missiles to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday slammed the
United States for delivering advanced missiles to Israel, saying
that the U.S. move would result in new instability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Defense Ministry spokesman Kaywan Khosravi said that the
delivery took place at a time when the U.S. government, by ignoring
the legitimate rights of the independent countries, has begun a
wide-spread effort to impose restrictions on their legitimate
defense needs.
</P>
<P>
Israel on Tuesday announced the newly-developed Arrow-2 missile
defense system, a U.S.-Israel joint venture, operational. The
system is quite capable of dealing with Scud and Scud-derived
ballistic missiles in the arsenals of Syria, Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, the strengthening of Israel's military might
will lead to new security formations in the region," the Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted Khosravi as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel's wide-spread utilization of air-to-ground
missiles against the residential areas of southern Lebanon is an
indication of expansion of militarism in the area.
</P>
<P>
"Delivery of new missiles to Israel, on the pretext of imaginary
threats, only reveals Washington's destructive role in peace and
security in the region," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Blames Enemies for Assassination Attempt on Reformist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on Wednesday lashed out at "enemies" for attempting
the life of a prominent reformist ally of the moderate President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The assassination attempt on Deputy Chairman of the Tehran
Municipal Council Saeed Hajjarian a few days ago was part of a plot
which might endanger national interest, Khamenei said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
He said that creating tensions and an atmosphere of terror in
the society was among the major aims pursued by "the plotters and
the enemies," the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Without naming the "enemies," the Iranian leader said that the
recent terrorist attack on Hajjarian, which occurred shortly after
the key parliamentary polls on February 18 and on the eve of Iran's
new year on March 21, was in line with "the satanic objectives
followed by the enemies."
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, a former deputy intelligence minister and managing
director of the reformist Sobh-e Emrouz (This Morning) daily, is
still in a coma after being shot by yet unidentified gunmen on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I call upon all the competent agencies to investigate the case
of this organized conspiracy which targets the national stability
and the system," Khamenei said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader also slammed the mortar attacks by the Iraq-
based military opposition Mujahedin Khalq Organization on a
residential block in northern Tehran on Monday, a day after the
assassination attempt on Hajjarian.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which occurred simultaneously with the assassination
incident, should serve as an alarm to the public that the enemy is
seeking nothing but to disturb the national security of Iran,
Khamenei said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pledges to Lobby Congress for China PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
has pledged his support for the Clinton administration's China
trade bill and vowed to persuade Congress into normalizing trade
relations with China on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
He made the address at an elementary school near his farm in
Carthage, Tenn., shortly before he voted in the Democratic
presidential primary, according to a report from the Wall Street
Journal Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) would
boost labor and environmental protections in China, Gore said,
apparently in response to critics from labor and environmental
groups in the Democratic Party who stand against the WTO as well
as China's accession into the trading bloc.
</P>
<P>
China's agreement to open its markets and liberalize Internet
service will raise its awareness of environmental problems and
labor rights and increase the pressure for improvements in this
regard, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we are an outlier and China joins the WTO and has normal
trading relations with other members of WTO and not with us, then
our ability to get improvements in the WTO in the future is
limited," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore said he would work with the administration's economic team
"in trying to bring people together around a formula that gets a
majority."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thomas J. Donohue, president and chief executive
officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in an article
published by The Journal of Commerce Tuesday that "business must
win" congressional approval of China PNTR, because "billions of
dollars" and "millions of jobs" are at stake in the battle.
</P>
<P>
"If Congress green-lights normal trade relations, a landmark U.
S.-China trade deal negotiated last November will kick in,
cracking open the Asian giant's vast markets to American
businesses, slashing tariffs on a wide range of American goods and
services, wiping out import duties on high-tech goods by 2005, and
boosting American exports by over 15 billion dollars over five
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Donohue said the China trade agreement will bring about
billions of dollars in new business to ship, rail, truck and
airline companies in the United States, and thousands of new, good-
paying jobs in manufacturing, services, transportation and
agriculture to American workers.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, he added, "our nation's burgeoning high-
tech industry will have access to an enormous new market. Farmers
will be able to sell more of their products."
</P>
<P>
Even labor unions may benefit from the deal, Donohue said,
since their membership may increase from the expanded need for
longshoremen, locomotive engineers and Teamster truck drivers as
trade grows with China.
</P>
<P>
"There's something in this agreement for everyone," he said.
</P>
<P>
Donohue argued that it is wrong to say "increased trade with
China will ship jobs overseas," because every one billion dollars
in U.S. exports creates 20,000 good jobs.
</P>
<P>
He also said that increased trade creates wealth, which help
pay for a clean environment, especially in developing nations, so
it holds no water to allege that trade with China will "destroy
the environment."

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A cargo train has run down a
bus causing injuries to at least 20 of its occupants in the
Gregorio A-Garcia-Tlahualillo railway junction, in Mexico's
northern state of Durango, said Wednesday the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The accident, in which the train locomotive hit the rear of the
bus, occurred Tuesday, and was attributed to the driver's lack of
precaution and to a dust storm that reduced visibility in the zone,
said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The victims, workers of the Bulls Deming firm, were taken in
several vehicles to clinics in the Francisco I. Madero and Torreon
municipalities, in the neighboring state of Coahuila.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses of the collision said that the train locomotive, that
was pulling four boxcar wagons and had the city of Torreon as its
destination, had not the front lights on, despite the poor
visibility, and it only sounded the horn at the grade crossing.
</P>
<P>
One of the victims is seriously injured with head traumatism,
while the rest underwent minor injuries, according to the medical
report.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian members of parliament
ended second reading of Bill C-20 early Wednesday after a
protracted debate of more than 30 hours since Monday.
</P>
<P>
Only two of the proposed 411 amendments to the controversial
bill passed during the marathon voting session.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the two amendments, the country's aboriginal
will enjoy a say on whether referendum results give Quebec the
right to secede from Canada.
</P>
<P>
A third reading is yet to be called before the bill is finally
adopted as federal referendum legislation, which will make
separation of Quebec from Canada ever more difficult.
</P>
<P>
All but eight amendments came from the Bloc Quebecois, which
tried to stall the bill by proposing as many as 403 amendments for
debate.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal government tabled the bill in December to enshrine
into law a 1998 Supreme Court decision which requires Quebec must
win a clear majority from a clearly-worded question before it can
separate from Canada.

BOGOTA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's industrial growth in
January was 11.5 percent, compared to the same month of 1999,
according to a poll revealed by local entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The study made by the National Industrialists Association (ANDI)

the construction, graphic arts, plastics and other productive
sectors of the country.

Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo said that the January
result is the best of the last 20 months for production," related
to the low rates of banking interest and the management of the

Figures registered last December for commercial activity
presented a 4.2 percent growth, which contrasted with the general
drop of sales along 1999, estimated at 7.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Zyuganov Urges to Build Renovated Soviet Power in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov on Wednesday called for establishing renovated
Soviet power and restoring people's power and social justice in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve this goal it will be necessary to take a
number of measures urgently: limit the powers of the head of state,
create a government of people's trust, restore the independence of
the judiciary, guarantee an efficient prosecutor's office and
budget federalism, Zyuganov told a meeting of intellectuals at the
State Duma, lower house of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He denied claims that he has no clear program or team, saying
his program has been "intentionally hushed up."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the essence of this program, he said it calls for a
new economic policy "which will encourage people to work, not
steal or get drunk."
</P>
<P>
He called on the intellectuals to support him in the upcoming
presidential elections on March 26, expressing the political will
to implement this program and set up a skilled professional staff.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Zyuganov also said he disagrees with the newly
published views of acting Russian President Vladimir Putin on
communist party prospects.
</P>
<P>
In the book "From the First Person. Conversations with Vladimir
Putin," which has just come off the press in Moscow, Putin said
that the communist party "will either change its program
guidelines and then become a major left-wing party or will be
unable to do so and then gradually walk off the political stage."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on these remarks in an interview, Zyuganov said the
Communist Party program "has absorbed all the best from the
communist movement, the socialists, the social-democrats and the
national patriotic parties of the world." For this reason, he sees
no need to reform the Communist Party of the Russian Federation(
KPRF).

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica To Intensify Joint Patrolling with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica will intensify in the
next months the joint patrolling of its territorial waters and air
space with the United States to combat drug trafficking, Public
Security Minister Rogelio Ramos told Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. Coast Guard Service frigates have been patrolling
Costa Rican waters, one in the Pacific Ocean and the other in the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
"We have a stronger operative capability now. We have carried
out more than one hundred operations in the sea. One hundred and
nineteen boats were inspected in the last days," said the minister,
without having found drugs so far.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rica-U.S. joint patrolling of the territorial waters
and air space of this nation was approved by the Costa Rican
Legislative Assembly in the last days of 1999, in the middle of
criticism of sectors that said that this is not an adequate
measure to thwart drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Experts on the matter say that drug traffickers intensified
their operations in Central American waters after a series of
seizures of cocaine cargoes in the Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
This process included the preparation of Costa Rican boarding
teams of six persons, who operate in the U.S. frigates, within the
12 miles of sovereign waters.
</P>
<P>
This surveillance permitted to detect a Mexican tuna boat that
was spilling oil in the sea, that was captured and sent to the
Puntarenas port, where it is detained and under investigation.
</P>
<P>
"The protection of marine life is also part of the joint
patrolling agreement, and is a function of great importance," said
Ramos.

<HEADLINE> IDB Lends 180 Million Dollars to Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of a loan of 180
million U.S. dollars to the municipality of Rio de Janeiro of
Brazil to support the second phase of a program to provide
infrastructure, social services, and property rights in favelas,
the low-income neighborhoods ringing the city and mountainsides.
</P>
<P>
The resources will finance infrastructure including, among
others, water and sanitation, storm drains, roads, electricity and
street lighting, garbage collection systems, and environmental
protection, such as reforestation to prevent erosion, the
Washington-based bank said.
</P>
<P>
The program, known as Favela-Bairro II, represents an
integrated approach to community and urban development and will
rely on community participation for the planning, execution, and
follow-up of the projects, including the operation of social
services.
</P>
<P>
Investments will be made in early childhood development
programs and a range of prevention and social support programs for
children and teens under 18, which constitute the main at-risk
groups in the poor communities of the favelas. Technical training,
technical assistance and complementary educational projects will
increase job and income opportunities for favela residents.
</P>
<P>
The IDB supported the first phase of the program, benefiting
250,000 of the 1.2 million fevela residents, with a loan of 180
million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Some 230,000 persons are expected to benefit from the program's
second phase, including 14,000 children.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the second phase of the program is 300
million dollars. The IDB loan is for a 25-year term, with a four-
year grace period, at the currency pool annual interest rate, now
6.44 percent. Local counterpart funds total 120 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Inflation Up in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's inflation rate was up to
2.7 percent in February from 2.4 percent recorded for the previous
month, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It's the biggest single jump since June 1995 with fuel prices
in February rising by 22.1 percent from January. Gasoline prices
increased by 3.1 percent at the same time, largely due to higher
crude oil prices spurred by tighter supplies.
</P>
<P>
The higher energy costs were somewhat offset by a drop of 7.3
percent in prices for fresh vegetables, as well as by a decline of
2.4 percent in fresh fruit prices.
</P>
<P>
Consumers also got some relief from lower prices on computers
equipment, according to the official agency.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Canada expects the country's inflation to rise to 3
percent in the first quarter of the year, as an effect of the on-
going economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
The bank raised interest rate by a quarter of one percentage
point to 5.25 percent in early February and has not ruled out
further act to keep a lid on consumer prices.

<HEADLINE> Luzhkov's Fatherland Movement to Support Putin for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Fatherland movement leader,
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, said Wednesday that his party is
prepared to support Russian acting President Vladimir Putin in the
March 26 presidential elections "under certain conditions."
</P>
<P>
Fatherland will support Putin if he guarantees democratic
freedoms in Russia, rejects the dictatorship of oligarchs in the
economy and politics, supports the development of the economy's
real sector and pledges to mobilize resources for the social
sphere, science and culture and guarantees the consolidation of
state authority, Luzhkov said at a conference of Fatherland's
Moscow branch.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov said he sees "Putin's extended hand, a partner's hand."
We do not push this extended hand away and are prepared to shake
it as a sign of our partnership," he added.
</P>
<P>
The positions of Putin and Fatherland have moved more closely
together recently with Putin effectively supporting Fatherland's
policy, Luzhkov said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, "we cannot support Putin unconditionally,"
he said. That would be tactically and politically improper,
Luzhkov said.
</P>
<P>
Fatherland supports Putin's position on Chechnya, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Sees Advantage in Fiat-GM Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The alliance between Fiat and
General Motors announced on Monday should bring both car makers
advantages and offer them growth possibilities in a "very
competitive context", Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Confirming that the government received advance notification
that negotiations on the deal were in the pipeline and would
probably be successful, he told Lower House question time that a
full assessment would only be possible when all the details have
been filled in and "fully pondered".
</P>
<P>
He also said the government would be keeping a close eye on
what happens to factories, job levels and research expenditure in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
In this context, he pointed to interviews in which Fiat's
honorary chairman Gianni Agnelli reasserted the group's Italian
roots and its commitment to the Italian economy and Italian
society.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that only Fiat could choose its own partner, D'Alema
said the best way of guaranteeing growth and job creation is to
have competitive companies, "and this does not depend on
government directives."
</P>
<P>
According to the prime minister, the agreement seems to provide
guarantees for the three prime chapters of employment, factories
and R&AMP;D(research and development).
</P>
<P>
In other points, D'Alema said that the alliance offers the
Italian auto industry, which means Fiat, "new opportunities for
technological and productive rationalization as well as new
prospects for growth in a context dominated by intense competition
and large economies of scale."
</P>
<P>
More generally. D'Alema said Italian capitalism is undergoing
deep change and will continue to do so still more.
</P>
<P>
"A capitalism which is less provincial and stunted, more open
and diversified is an essential condition for the country to grow
and compete," said the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Italian Oil Company ENI in Record Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Eni, the Italian oil and fuels group,
reported record profits of 5,538 trillion lire (about 2.76 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1999, an increase of 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the preview of its consolidated accounts, the former
public company in which the Italian Treasury Ministry still
maintains a small stake said the record profits are primarily due
to the recent increases in international oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Other factors were said to be complete of the cost reduction
plan, improvements in the financial situation and an increase in
gas sales and gas transported for third parties.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that operating profit in the Exploration and
Production division were four times higher than in 1998,
contributing over 50 percent of consolidated operating profit (16
percent in 1998).
</P>
<P>
Rationalization permitted a pre-tax cost reduction of about 520
million euros last year. Gas sales rose by 8.2 percent and gas
transported for others by 13.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Eni sold 69.24 billion cubic meters of gas in Italy.
Sales of petroleum products in Italy and abroad totaled 51.82
million tons, down 4.4 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema agreed Wednesday that further
measures were needed to increase stability in Kosovo and boost the
effectiveness of the United Nations peacekeeping mission there.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Italian premier's office Wednesday evening
said that Clinton and D'Alema had discussed the problem of Kosovo
by phone.
</P>
<P>
"The telephone conversation enabled them to exchange views on
the situation in Kosovo, in particular on the need for combined
efforts to restore internal stability," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In the light of recent tensions, the two leaders agreed on the
urgent need for further measures to consolidate the UN mission,
strengthening especially the police force and supplying the
economic means necessary," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the U.S. was prepared to provide more funds for
the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).
</P>
<P>
It said that Clinton had thanked Italy for its decision to send
more troops to the region and, on a more general level, for its"
continued contribution to creating peace in the Balkans."
</P>
<P>
The statement highlighted D'Alema's call for the European Union
to step up its part in reconstruction and stabilization in the
region and co-ordinate its activities there better.
</P>
<P>
Italy announced Wednesday that it would be sending a further
360 troops to the ethnically divided town of Mitrovica.
</P>

MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Union of Right Forces(
SPS) has decided to support acting Russian President Vladimir
Putin in the upcoming presidential elections on March 26, said the
SPS leader, former Russian Premier Sergei Kiriyenko, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the Union of Right Forces Coordination Council
and the Union's parliamentary faction on Tuesday voted to back
Putin's bid, said Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
A minority of the Council of the Union of Right Forces and its
Duma (the lower house of the parliament) faction decided to
support another presidential candidate, Samara Governor Konstantin
Titov.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko said that "we do not like everyone who is backing
Putin" but "today's decision is of crucial importance."
</P>
<P>
He said that Putin's remarks in latest weeks gave answers to
most of the questions in the SPS program and most of SPS members
have confidence in Putin's triumph in the first round of the
voting.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Putin will win in the first round.
Otherwise, "an artificial boost" will be given to his main rival,
presidential candidate and Communist Party of Russia leader
Gennady Zyuganov, he said.
</P>
<P>
Samara Governor Titov confirmed this decision. "It smells of a
split" in the Union, he said, but shows no intention of
withdrawing from the Union of Right Forces Coordination Council.
