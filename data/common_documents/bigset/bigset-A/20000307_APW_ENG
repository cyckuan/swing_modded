<HEADLINE> Prozac's Reign as Top Drug Ending  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prozac, one of the most widely known
prescription drugs of all time, is losing some of its lift.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the antidepressant has declined as newer drugs
promise greater effectiveness, fewer side effects and the ability
to treat additional ailments.
</P>
<P>
   In January, for the first time in years, doctors wrote more new
prescriptions for a competing drug, Zoloft. While Prozac remained
slightly ahead in total prescriptions, the statistics illustrate
its peak is past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prozac has had its day, or more accurately, had its decade,''
said Christine Hollidge, an analyst with Datamonitor in London.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in 1988, Prozac quickly became a metaphor for
society's obsession for quick fixes to problems. The pills not only
helped the depressed, but became known for simply making people
feel good.
</P>
<P>
   They also helped ease the stigma surrounding mental illness,
proving to many that depression is a biological problem, not one
caused by a weak character or poor parenting
</P>
<P>
   ''It changed my whole life,'' said Elizabeth Wurtzel, 32, author
of ''Prozac Nation,'' which described her struggle with depression
and experience with Prozac and other drugs -- and exposed the
collective bad mood of Generation X'ers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realized it was possible to not be depressed. It was like
putting glasses on and seeing the world in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Miller, spokeswoman for Prozac maker Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.,
said: ''Prozac showed people there is a safe and effective
treatment for depression, allowing more people to seek help.''
</P>
<P>
   Prozac was the first of a new generation of anti-depression
drugs called SSRI's (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) that
were as effective as older depression drugs, but did not have many
of the nasty side effects such as constipation, memory loss or high
blood pressure. SSRI's work by correcting the imbalance of
serotonin in the body, a natural chemical that's believed to effect
one's mood.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of overdosing on Prozac was significantly less than
older medications, a key benefit in treating depression.
</P>
<P>
   These advantages led more patients to continue their medication
and more doctors to order it.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, Prozac had become the fastest selling new mental
illness drug ever -- a sort of Viagra of its time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prozac seemed to give social confidence to the habitually
timid, to make the sensitive brash, to lend the introvert the
social skills of a salesman,'' Dr. Peter D. Kramer wrote in his
1993 book ''Listening to Prozac,'' one of several best sellers on
the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In all about 17 million Americans have taken Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Like a Hollywood celebrity, however, Prozac has been attacked by
critics and faced intense scrutiny from the media.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors said Prozac caused patients to become more
self-destructive, and other critics blamed it for the suicide of
1960s pop music star Del Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Its falling market share is seen as a natural part of the
product's life cycle. Few prescription drugs stay at the top of
their class for more than five or six years because of the intense
competition from other brands and generics.
</P>
<P>
   New drugs such as Zoloft, Paxil and Celexa have been launched
with strong marketing pitches that promised less of the weariness
and reduced libido that some patients felt from Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   About 840,000 new Prozac prescriptions were written in January --
7,000 fewer than Zoloft, according to market data firm IMS Health.
In all, nearly 2 million total prescriptions were written for each
drug that month.
</P>
<P>
   Prozac sales are expected to decline steadily in the next three
years, as its patent expires and cheaper generics become available.

<HEADLINE> Casino Magnate Wynn Weighs Options  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MACY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- As a 10-year-old boy, Steve Wynn stood on the
fledgling Strip, mesmerized by the neon lights and the excitement
of the meager collection of hotels that was Las Vegas in the early
'50s.
</P>
<P>
   He returned in 1967 to become the city's casino king, parlaying
a land deal with Howard Hughes into a gambling bonanza that changed
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Now his company has been gobbled up in a $4.4 billion merger
with MGM Grand, Inc., and Wynn is said to be looking for new
mountains to climb with the $483 million he made on the deal. It
was just the latest of many over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn cut a deal with the late billionaire Hughes for a piece of
land on the Strip in 1972, buying it for $1 million and later
selling it to Caesars Palace at double the price. He then bought
stock in downtown's Golden Nugget hotel before taking control of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn opened his flagship Mirage hotel-casino in 1989, sparking
an unprecedented building boom on and off the Strip. Megaresorts
became the destination of choice and Las Vegas became the nation's
fastest-growing city.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn opened the pirate-themed Treasure Island in 1993. His
showplace, the $1.6 billion Bellagio with a $300 million art
collection, opened in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mirage Resorts, Inc. stock peaked at $26.38 in May 1999. But
after the pricey Beau Rivage casino in Biloxi, Miss., failed to
meet expectations, the stock fell to $10.88 on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   MGM Grand swooped in the next day and made a $3.5 billion buyout
offer -- $17 a share. Though Wynn and his board rejected the offer,
the door was open.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the negotiations said Wynn called billionaire
Kirk Kerkorian, MGM's majority stockholder, to tell him the deal
was too low. The two gaming titans met once briefly and talked
twice in the next few days, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   MGM Chairman J. Terrence Lanni said Wynn would not be a part of
the new company.
</P>
<P>
   ''He neither asked for a position in the combined company, nor
did we offer him a position,'' Lanni told The Associated Press. ''I
think whatever Steve decides to do, he's going to be staggeringly
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ader, a casino analyst with Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co., said,
''Steve's at the point in his life when he's considering pursuing
other options.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll always be the chairman of Las Vegas and the casino
industry,'' Ader said.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn's not talking about his plans. But his 23 million shares of
Mirage stock, 12 percent of the company, provide many options.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Roffman, a casino analyst with Roffman Miller Associates,
said the stock deal means Wynn, 58, can pursue his two passions --
collecting art and playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   ''And he won't have to put up with the insanity of Wall Street,
with their short-term thinking,'' Roffman said. ''For a guy with
vision, he was out of favor with Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wall Street considers anything longer than two months is like
an eternity,'' Roffman said. ''They want instant performance. When
Mirage stock was in the tank, it was off with his head. Steve is
the kind of guy who builds enduring kinds of properties. To do
that, you have to go through some hiccups.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynn addressed that issue in a 1989 AP interview shortly before
he opened Mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his long-running feud with businessman Donald Trump,
Wynn said he wanted to be known as ''a hotel operator, not the
star.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I want people to say that Steve Wynn built the best hotel in
the world. I don't want to say I own it. I want to be the guy that
designed it. That's my edge.''

<HEADLINE> Court administrators: 'pay to play' is wrong and cannot go on  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York lawyers are prohibited from
engaging in ''pay to play,'' the practice of making political
contributions with the expectation of getting government contracts
in return, state court administrators have determined.
</P>
<P>
   A review of state rules, in light of controversial situations in
New York and nationally where ''pay-to-play'' situations have been
alleged, showed that the practice is already banned, said Chief
Judge Judith Kaye of the Court of Appeals and the heads of the four
regional appeals court divisions.
</P>
<P>
   '''Pay to play' is wrong,'' the top judges said Monday in a
joint statement. ''The practice should not go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges said the state's Code of Professional Responsibility,
plus ethical canons established earlier this year by the state Bar
Association, ban the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (judges') statement puts everyone on notice that 'pay to
play' is prohibited in New York and it really is the first time any
state has taken this position,'' said Jonathan Lippman, chief state
administrative judge.
</P>
<P>
   Lippman refused to say whether the judges' statement also
represents an implicit acknowledgment that ''pay to play'' is
occurring and is a problem in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not taking a position either way,'' he said. ''They are
saying it's wrong. If it is going on, it shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of ''pay-to-play'' arrangements have long contended that
government officials show preference to law firms or lawyers who
contribute to their campaigns or their political parties when it
comes time to award often lucrative government legal work, like
bond counsel assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Another form of the alleged bias surfaced in December, when two
top officials in the Brooklyn Democratic organization contended
that judges in that borough were handing out fiduciary assignments
based on lawyers' ties to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The two, Arnold Ludwig and Thomas Garry, said they felt they
were on the outs with the leadership and had been shut out of
consideration for appointment as guardians, receivers, referees and
other legal posts.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye appointed a special inspector general to investigate
alleged bias in the making of fiduciary assignments and also picked
a commission to study whether further rules were needed in that
area to combat ''pay-to-play'' arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Lippman said Monday's pronouncement by the top state judges is
''much broader'' than the recent focus on only fiduciary
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Levin, a Mineola lawyer who chaired the Bar Association's
Task Force to Study Pay to Play Concerns, said the prohibitions
against ''pay-to-play'' activities in New York need to be more
widely known in both legal and governmental circles.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that such arrangements are often hard to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any rule you design for this is going to be necessarily
difficult to enforce because to some extent you are going to have
to go inside someone's head into what they were thinking when they
were making political contributions,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   More sweeping responses are beyond the power of ethics panels or
even of the state's top judges, he said, and can only be
established by legislative bodies as part of wide-ranging campaign
financing reforms. They include banning political contributions
altogether by lawyers or firms doing government work -- ''it's sort
of like using an elephant gun to kill a gnat,'' Levin said -- which
in turn gets into constitutional issues of fairness and the right
to engage in political activity.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Levin said it might take whistle-blowers coming
forward to expose ''pay-to-play'' arrangements for the practice to
undergo wider condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers' professional responsibility codes say that a ''lawyer
shall not compensate or give anything of value to a person or
organization to ... obtain employment by a client.'' The Bar
Association's latest rules spell out in detail specific situations
where lawyers could run afoul of the ethical rules.

<HEADLINE> McCain's New York chief looking for surprise  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Polls opened early today in parts of New
York where even some of George W. Bush's backers say John McCain
could do well, a situation that could give the senator from Arizona
a little more help in a state his backers consider crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of New York's primary elections, the polls
opened this morning at 6 a.m. in New York City, on Long Island, in
three suburban counties just north of the city -- Westchester,
Orange and Rockland -- and in the Buffalo area.
</P>
<P>
   Polls open in the rest of the state open at noon and all of them
close at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain camp believes New York City and its suburbs are
particularly fertile ground for their insurgent-style campaign.
Some Bush backers in New York agree with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the primary, McCain's New York campaign chief,
Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, predicted victory for
the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we may surprise a lot of people with the results
tomorrow night,'' Molinari said Monday, adding that New York is a
must-win for the senator in his battle against the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's New York campaign chief, Gov. George Pataki, refused to
make a prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hopeful that Governor Bush will win tomorrow,'' Pataki
said Monday. ''I have no greater information than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of a host of states, including most of New
England, California and Ohio, holding primaries Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown Bush and McCain locked in a tough battle
for the 93 GOP delegates at stake in New York's primary. Another
eight unpledged delegates will be selected later by state party
leaders. Almost all will likely be in the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, polls have all shown Vice President Al
Gore with almost 2-1 leads over former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, a one-time Hall of Fame player with the New York Knicks
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bradley's top New York backer, Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, spoke Monday as if that race was already over.
</P>
<P>
   ''He fought handsomely, gallantly and right to the end,''
Moynihan said. ''And that is how you measure a person's quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic voters in New York will be electing 158 pledged
delegates today with another 85 pledged delegates chosen later by
party leaders based on the primary's popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   New York has a closed primary where only party members can vote
in the respective primaries.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, New York voters get to cast ballots
directly for the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, things are more complicated. Voters only
cast ballots for prospective national convention delegates in each
of the state's 31 congressional districts. In effect, there are 31
separate GOP mini-primaries with three delegates at stake in each
congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   There is another wrinkle that McCain backers believe will help
them. While each congressional district elects three delegates,
each contains a different number of enrolled Republicans, and
Democrats. For instance, in Long Island's 3rd Congressional
District represented by Republican Peter King, who recently
switched his allegiance from Bush to McCain, there are 182,651
enrolled Republicans. But in Brooklyn's 11th Congressional
District, represented by Democrat Major Owens, there are just
15,872 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the minority districts where you don't have a lot of
Republicans, you also don't have a lot of Republican
organization,'' Molinari said. ''We do have key people who live in
those neighborhoods and a delegate there counts as much as in the
most populous Republican areas in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Pataki and virtually the entire state GOP hierarchy are
backing Bush, most of his delegate slates in big Republican areas
are populated with well-known GOP figures. McCain slates generally
contain names little known to most voters. That is also the case,
however, for Bush slates in areas of the state where there are few
Republicans, including parts of heavily Democratic New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, I feel comfortable that we're going to win a
majority of the districts,'' Molinari said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Pataki praises cable executives for Diallo telecasts  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A bill restoring cameras in courtrooms
throughout New York state should not give defendants the right to
unilaterally banish cameras, Gov. George Pataki says.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki on Monday renewed his call for restoring camera coverage
of most trials in New York based on what he said was the successful
experience with television and still cameras at the Albany trial of
four police officers accused of murdering immigrant Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The example of the Diallo trial shows that they can be done in
a nonintrusive way, in a way that doesn't affect the fairness of
the proceedings and, in fact, enhances public awareness of the
proceedings,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the governor, a bill introduced by some
Democrats in the state Assembly in recent years is not the answer.
It would ban camera coverage of trials if defendants or witnesses
object.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of camera coverage say judges should decide whether
trials are open or closed based on the nature of the trial, with
the presumption being that cameras should generally be allowed in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certain witnesses should be protected, particularly in the
case of child abuse or sexual assault or rape,'' Pataki said. ''The
witnesses, nonparty witnesses, should be protected but I don't
think defendants should have a blanket right to be exempt from
appearing and I would hope that we could work out these matters and
get the legislation to pass this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Mark Weprin, a Queens Democrat, said he has
introduced a cameras-in-the-courtroom bill in the Assembly which
would in most cases leave the question of televising trials up to
trial judges. He said there is ''a lot of support'' for that bill
among the Democrats who dominate the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pataki and state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno have
promised to propose legislation restoring cameras to courtrooms for
the first time since 1997. Aides to the Democratic leader in the
state Assembly, Speaker Sheldon Silver, have said Silver will
review camera legislation in light of the Diallo trial.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, judges in the state could open trials to
camera coverage based on the finding by the Diallo judge, Joseph
Teresi, that the state's law banning such coverage is
unconstitutional. But Teresi's ruling is not binding on other
judges, and many have continued to keep cameras out.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the state Legislature should clear up what could
become a confusing situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would rather have a law that doesn't require that a
particular judge open up the courtroom but that provides in general
public access so they can see the proceedings in the courtroom,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki made his comments following an appearance Monday before
the state Cable Television and Telecommunications Association in
Albany. He praised the cable executives, especially those from
Court TV, for pushing to open the Diallo courtroom to video
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also said Monday he favored televising sessions of
the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders have promised to study instituting a system
on a statewide level based on the model of C-SPAN, which provides
coverage of Congress on cable systems throughout the country. But
plans for state legislative coverage have never gone beyond the
study stage.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said television coverage of the Legislature would be
''beneficial to the public to see some of the public debate here in
Albany.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I watch C-SPAN,'' the governor said. ''I watch all these
different events. I actually watch some of the debate after
Congress is closed sometimes when I can't sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's most recent experiment with allowing cameras into
courtrooms expired in 1997. State Assembly Democrats in particular
said they wanted to rethink the law in light of the media frenzy
and courtroom excesses accompanying telecasts of the O.J. Simpson
trial in California.

<HEADLINE> Prison guard union declares impasse in contract negotiations  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The union representing more than 24,000
state prison guards says contract negotiations with the Pataki
administration are at an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reached a point in the process where no progress is
being made,'' said Brian Shanagher, president of New York State
Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association (NYSCOPBA).
</P>
<P>
   The association becomes the first of several unions the state
has been trying to reach new contracts with since last spring to
declare an impasse. Like the other workers, the guards have been
without a contract since April 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Impasse is the second of a four-step process outlined under the
state's Public Employees Fair Employment Act, also known as the
Taylor Law. The next step is fact-finding, in which a mediator
holds a hearing and then makes a recommendation for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The last step is conciliation, mediation assistance offered by
the Public Employment Relations Board at its discretion if an
impasse continues.
</P>
<P>
   Police unions have an extra step of binding arbitration, which
NYSCOPBA leaders say they are fighting for.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1967 statute, public employees are prohibited from
striking.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed at the impasse declaration,'' said Mary
Hines, spokeswoman for the Office of Employee Relations.
</P>
<P>
   NYSCOPBA won the right last year to serve as bargaining agent
for the prison guards from Council 82.
</P>
<P>
   Horns between the union and Pataki administration are locked on
several issues, Shanagher said.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefly, the union wants to be have certain concessions for
guards routinely granted to police bargaining units in New York,
such as 30-day limits on suspensions resulting from inmate or other
allegations along with continued health care and other benefits to
family members. An accused prison guard can currently be suspended
for up to two years following an accusation, NYSCOPBA spokesman
Dennis Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We work 365 days a year, seven days a week, probably 90
percent of all holidays,'' NYSCOPBA Spokesman Dennis Fitzpatrick
said. ''We're not looking for them to give up the cookie jar, but
we're certainly looking for consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   NYSCOPBA is not the only public union wrangling with the state
for more money and benefits. Both the Public Employees Federation
and the Civil Service Employees Association, the two largest state
worker unions, are likewise without a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still talking,'' CSEA spokesman Stephen Madarasz said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   PEF turned down a four-year contract offering 3 percent raises
each year, saying higher out-of-pocket medical costs would erase
the pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   A counteroffer presented late last month sought a three-year
contract with 5 percent, 3 percent, and 4 percent raises, PEF
spokeswoman Denyce Duncan Lacy said.

<HEADLINE> Wife admits to role in husband's murder plot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Showing little emotion, a woman told a judge
she convinced a co-worker with a crush on her to kill her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Montstream of Clarkson faces 20 to 41 years in prison
after she pleaded guilty Monday to first-degree manslaughter,
second-degree criminal facilitation and second-degree possession of
a weapon in the case.
</P>
<P>
   She will be sentenced June 9 in the murder of her husband, a
local choir director.
</P>
<P>
   Several relatives of 37-year-old John Montstream were in court
Monday to hear the plea.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were in agreement with the plea and understand the
parameters set forth,'' said Niagara County First Assistant
District Attorney Tim Lundquist.
</P>
<P>
   He said there were issues in her case that would have made it
difficult to determine her exact role. He said the woman who cooly
went on television to plea for help in finding her husband's killer
showed no emotion or remorse in court.
</P>
<P>
   John Montstream's decomposing body was found June 30, 1998, in
his minivan in a Niagara Falls parking garage. The father of two
had been shot once in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the woman talked Michael Northrup, 28, of Caledonia
into killing her husband. He was charged with second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Monstream's plea came after county Judge Peter Broderick
admitted her six-page police statement into evidence. Jurors were
to be selected for her trial next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said she asked Michael Northrup to kill her husband and
she took part in transporting a vehicle to Niagara Falls so Michael
Northrup could use it as a getaway vehicle,'' Lundquist said.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons charge was for being an accomplice in the possession
of a weapon, he said. Montstream had also faced a conspiracy
charge, which was dropped in the plea agreement, Lundquist said.
</P>
<P>
   Montstream also must testify against Northrup, a co-worker who
she said had a crush on her. He's free on bail until his trial May
1.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, John Parrinello, said he was unsure how Montstream's
plea might affect his case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how much it will matter to my client,''
Parrinello said. ''Her credibility was always suspect. And her
admitted culpability in exchange for benefits always causes one to
wonder what part of it is truthful and what isn't.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of second-degree murder, Montstream would have
faced a maximum 25 years to life in prison on that charge alone.
The promised sentence means she will be sentenced consecutively for
her three convictions.
</P>
<P>
   She had told police that her husband of 15 years wouldn't grant
her a divorce.

<HEADLINE> Rash of fires hit neighborhood over weekend, worry residents  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) -- Workers continued boarding up vacant
buildings today in an attempt to put an end to a rash of arson
fires in the Cornhill section of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the seven fires that erupted over the weekend were ruled
arsons by investigators, and an eighth blaze broke out around 6
p.m. Monday. No injuries were reported in any of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do run into rashes (of fires), even during normal times,''
Chief Fire Marshal Douglas Sardina said Monday. ''But this
particular weekend was extreme -- to have this many and so
intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Jackson knows what people who live in Cornhill are feeling as
they contemplate the fury of the latest flurry of fires to hit
their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a community activist, said one woman told him she was
leaving her home because of the seven blazes that broke out over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's in her 80s. She's alone. She's afraid,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and Utica's Arson Strike Force have been working
around the clock since Friday afternoon extinguishing the flames
and trying to track down causes. All of the fires began in
abandoned buildings in Cornhill.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said one blaze spread into an adjacent home that had
occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Sirens are becoming a familiar sound again in the dark hours in
Cornhill, and the noise came almost too close for Mary Brown before
dawn Sunday, when three fires erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sirens woke me up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she was jolted awake shortly after 4 a.m., the windows on
one side of her home reflected flames leaping from the roof of a
vacant building only a few yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she didn't know it at the time, but the front of her
home was lit at the same moment by a fire that ate through the
heart of an abandoned building three doors away.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke from the fires hovered above the city's central and
eastern sections for much of Sunday. Utica Public Safety
Commissioner Cornell Maye called a meeting of city departments that
afternoon at the central firehouse to address what residents were
describing as a crisis situation.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called the fires a threat to the stability of the
neighborhood, and it's not the first time this has happened. In the
mid-90s, the same area was plagued by a similar rash of fires, many
of them arsons.
</P>
<P>
   The city demolished nearly 100 dilapidated buildings in the
summer of 1997, hoping to bring a stop to the fires. And Mayor
Edward Hanna has renewed the city's effort to board up and watch
vacant buildings to try to halt the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Roxann Jackson said that in spite of it all, she doesn't want to
leave the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm comfortable here,'' she said. ''This block is like our
family. We all look out for each other. I hope I don't have to
leave because of these conditions but only by my choice.''

FAA: More Planes To Crowd Skies
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More commercial jets, cargo planes and private aircraft
will crowd the skies in the next several years to meet rising demand in the
aviation industry, which already is fighting congestion in the air and on the
ground, the FAA reports. In its annual 12-year forecast being released Tuesday,
the Federal Aviation Administration says commercial air travel will continue
expanding through 2011. The number of international passengers is expected to
exceed those traveling domestically, the agency says, continuing to push down
fares if fuel prices don't become ruinous.

Allergy Remedies May Impair Driving
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Over-the-counter medicines used by millions of hay fever
sufferers may affect a person's driving ability more than alcohol, a study
indicates. University of Iowa researchers who tested 40 allergy sufferers in a
driving simulator found that the standard dose of antihistamine contained in
Benadryl and many similar medicines had a greater effect than a few drinks on
driving ''coherence,'' or the ability to match the speed of the vehicle ahead.
The antihistamine, diphenhydramine, also had an effect similar to alcohol on
steering stability and the likelihood of crossing into the oncoming lane,
according to the study in Tuesday's issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.

commanding, although he led McCain in the polls in several key states, including
Ohio, Maryland, Georgia, Missouri and in the winner-take-all competition for 162
California delegates.

the attack on a Haitian immigrant brutalized with a broken broomstick in a

Wiese, 36, and Thomas Bruder, 33, were found guilty of lying to investigators to
conceal Schwarz's role in the 1997 attack on Abner Louima. Schwarz also could
get life in prison when he is sentenced for his 1999 conviction on charges of

Oil Boost May Not Help Gas Prices
</SUBHEAD>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although gas prices are already almost $1.50 a gallon or
more, the government said Monday prices are likely to jump another 20 cents by
May or even higher as the summer driving season takes hold. The oil exporting
countries may boost production soon to ease the acute shortage that has seen
crude prices climb to nearly $32 a barrel, but the additional oil, even if
pumped immediately, ''would undoubtedly be too late'' to keep gasoline prices
from rising, according to a report released by the Energy Department.

68-year-old Republican plans to announce Wednesday that he will not seek an
eleventh term, according to two sources within the GOP who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Bliley has been chairman of the House Commerce Committee since 1995,
personally overseeing much of the legislation that affects the nation's tobacco
companies. Many of his constituents work at Philip Morris' Richmond cigarette

<HEADLINE> Clapton, Taylor, Raitt and Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire inducted into rockhall  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Eric Clapton, whose solo career has veered
between pop hits and blues explorations, joined the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame for the third time Monday with fellow honorees James
Taylor and Bonnie Raitt.
</P>
<P>
   The Lovin' Spoonful's sunny series of 1960s hits, and Earth,
Wind &AMP; Fire's inspirational soul also ushered them into the hall
during a ceremony at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Following a night of long speeches, both Clapton and Taylor were
humbled by the honor and seemed eager to play, instead of talk.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, it's about the music,'' said Clapton, inducted before
as a member of the Yardbirds and Cream. ''I'm just the messenger,
and I hope to do it as long as I live.''
</P>
<P>
   Clapton was honored for a solo career that began in 1970 and, on
acoustic guitar, played the mournful tribute to his late son,
''Tears in Heaven.'' He dueted on electric guitar with the Band's
Robbie Robertson on ''Further On Up the Road.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul McCartney inducted ''Sweet Baby James'' Taylor, the
quintessential 1970s singer-songwriter. It was the Beatles who gave
Taylor his first break, signing them to their Apple label, and
launching a career that included the hits ''Fire and Rain'' and
''How Sweet It Is.''
</P>
<P>
   McCartney recalled first hearing Taylor. ''It was this haunting
guy who could really play the guitar ... We were just lucky to run
into him and he was lucky to run into us, I suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   John Mellencamp's rambling, profane and funny induction speech
for the Lovin' Spoonful recalled his summer as a 14-year-old
driving a motorcycle illegally in Indiana, being arrested for
public obnoxiousness and listening to ''Summer in the City.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd never been to New York City, but here I was in a town of
4,000 people and I related to every word that singer was singing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A ragged, reformed Spoonful played their first hit, ''Do You
Believe in Magic?''
</P>
<P>
   Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire's Maurice White, who last week revealed his
battle with Parkinson's disease, made a rare appearance performing
with the band he founded.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a long road, but it's been a beautiful road,'' said
White, who made no mention of his affliction.
</P>
<P>
   The band performed its hits ''Shining Star'' and ''That's the
Way of the World,'' bringing together its original members for the
first time in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire is enjoying renewed popularity because of
radio formats devoted to 1970s soul. White continues to record with
the band but hasn't toured since 1995 because of Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   Raitt sang ''Thing Called Love,'' in a scorching duet with
Melissa Etheridge, who paid tribute to Raitt's ''sex on a plate''
voice in a lengthy induction speech. Raitt was so tough and secure,
''she hasn't felt the need to change her hairstyle in 30 years,''
Etheridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Blues-rocker Raitt was largely a cult favorite until her 10th
album, ''Nick of Time,'' won four Grammy Awards in 1989 and made
''Thing Called Love'' a hit. She started the Rhythm &AMP; Blues
Foundation to help older artists who didn't reap financial rewards
from their work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody gets up here without being obsessed, who didn't worry
their parents, didn't mess up their relationships, or if they did
it right, probably messed up their health as well,'' Raitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Doo-wop pioneers The Moonglows and embattled music executive
Clive Davis were also inducted. Paul Simon inducted The Moonglows,
calling their signature hit, ''Sincerely,'' perfect.
</P>
<P>
   For Davis, who founded Arista Records and is now involved in a
public battle with Arista's owners to keep his job, the induction
is another well-timed salute. He guided the comeback of Carlos
Santana, who won eight Grammy Awards less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Patti Smith inducted Davis, breaking into tears as she
said, ''I did not comprehend and I often wonder what he ever saw in
me, and it has taken me all these years to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the hall paid tribute to noted side men and
session players including drummer Al Blaine, saxophonist King
Curtis, bassist James Jamerson, guitarist Scotty Moore and drummer
Earl Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   They had some of the night's most poignant speeches, chiding the
Hall of Fame for waiting 15 years to honor the people outside of
the spotlight. Annie Jamerson, widow of the Motown bassist, knew
something was wrong with her husband one day when she caught him
listening to the old Motown songs, tears streaming down his face.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'I did it, I did it,''' she said. ''That really
touched me. I had a feeling at that time that he felt he'd been
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday were honored as
early influences on rock music. Ray Charles misspoke several times
in his induction of Cole, saying it was for the Rhythm 'n' Blues
Hall of Fame, and it became a running joke.
</P>
<P>
   The names of Hall of Fame honorees are on exhibit at the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> Jury deadlocks on charges against fertility doctor  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge said a retrial of a prominent Park
Avenue fertility doctor could occur as early as next month after a
jury concluded a seven-week trial by announcing it was unable to
reach a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think this matter should continue to loom over the
defendants unresolved,'' U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley said
after disbanding the jury in Manhattan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Niels Lauersen shook the hand of his defense lawyer and
appeared relieved after the jury concluded that further
deliberations would be futile.
</P>
<P>
   The judge declared a mistrial. On Friday, he had urged the
jurors to continue deliberating after they said they were
deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Christine Chung told the judge that the
government would seek a speedy retrial. The judge said another
trial might occur as early as next month or in May.
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen, an obstetrician and gynecologist, was on trial along
with Dr. Magda Binion, an anesthesiologist. Binion smiled as the
judge declared the mistrial, thanked the jurors and sent them home.
</P>
<P>
   The jury had sent numerous notes requesting to review evidence
during its deliberations but finally late Monday stated it could
not reach a verdict on any charges, which include conspiracy,
health care fraud and mail fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had alleged Lauersen stole more than $2 million from
insurance companies over a 10-year period by falsely billing
fertility surgeries that were not covered by insurance as
gynecological surgeries that were.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore D. Wells, Lauersen's lawyer, said his 63-year-old
client was a target for prosecutors and the insurance companies
because he spoke out against the failure of most companies to pay
for fertility procedures.
</P>
<P>
   After the mistrial was declared, Lauersen declined to comment.
Lauersen, the author of ''It's Your Body,'' has appeared frequently
on television and in publications as an expert on fertility
matters, which make up about 10 percent of his practice.
</P>
<P>
   Wells said he was disappointed that his client was not acquitted
but was grateful that the doctor had not been convicted. He said he
would file legal arguments within two weeks to try to persuade the
judge that a second trial should not occur, in part to spare
several patients of Lauersen who had testified from having to take
the witness stand again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the real losers in this case from the very beginning
have been the female patients who were forced by the government to
come into a public trial and reveal the most private and intimate
details of their lives,'' Wells said.

   ''He said, 'I did it, I did it,''' she said. ''That really
touched me. I had a feeling at that time that he felt he'd been
forgotten.''

<P>
   Also Monday, Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday were honored as
early influences on rock music. Ray Charles misspoke several times
in his induction of Cole, saying it was for the Rhythm 'n' Blues
Hall of Fame, and it became a running joke.

<P>
   The names of Hall of Fame honorees are on exhibit at the Rock

<HEADLINE> NH Asks Court To Settle Me. Dispute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire has asked the U.S. Supreme
Court to settle a decades-long dispute by deciding whether the
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is in New Hampshire or Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeanne Shaheen said New Hampshire has centuries of history
on its side.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Hampshire should not cede its claim on Portsmouth Harbor
to the state of Maine,'' she said Monday. ''We expect the Supreme
Court will find our evidence compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   The shipyard is located on Seavey Island in the Piscataqua
River, which separates the two states. The entrance is by bridge
from Kittery, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Shipyard workers who live in New Hampshire have been the driving
force behind efforts to settle the dispute. They argue they should
not have to pay Maine's progressive income tax, which took effect
in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Maine Gov. Angus King said officials there have assumed the
island was part of Maine since it became a state in 1820.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not terribly worried about the suit,'' King said. But he
added, ''we have to take it seriously'' and ''it's not a frivolous
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen said documents dating to Colonial times prove the border
lies along the Maine side of the river. That would put the island
in New Hampshire. Maine contends the border is in the middle of the
river, which would make the island Maine's.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-page motion filed with the court Monday cites everything
from a 1680 New Hampshire law banning ships from dumping ballast
into the river to a 1994 law in which New Hampshire lawmakers asked
the attorney general to pursue the dispute in court.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Mozambique Floods Up  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- An overpowering stench hung over parts
of Chokwe, where aid workers collected the bodies of 38 flood
victims and prepared them for burial in a mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the town, residents whose homes were still intact
were mopping up and collecting what remained of their possessions
after the worst floods on record in this impoverished southeast
African country.
</P>
<P>
   The government Monday raised its official flood death toll to
400, and expected it to grow as data came in from outlying areas
and more bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   About 11,000 people who evacuated the area around Chokwe on Feb.
27, when floodwaters engulfed Chokwe, have returned home, said
Lindsey Davies of the U.N. World Food Program, which delivered
rice, high protein biscuits and other food to the area under armed
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Aid did not arrive sooner to the town, 125 miles northeast of
the capital, Maputo, because of fears it would be stolen by armed
gangs. And there were still shortages of fresh water in the town,
Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents who could afford to pay for transportation were
spending the night in the town of Macia to escape the smell of
bodies and rotting animal carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   Further south, 58 children separated from their parents in the
floods were assembled in the town of Chaquelane. Hundreds more
children were also being kept at camps around the country, the fate
of their parents unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100 tons of food must be moved every day to feed an
estimated 250,000 people housed in 72 aid camps, said Georgia
Shaver, regional manager of the U.N. World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more have returned home, but have nothing and will
also need food.
</P>
<P>
   Revised figures released by the Mozambican national disaster
center on Monday put the number of people affected by the floods at
950,000 out of a total population of 19.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Altogether, some 473,000 people will require food aid. The
remainder will require other forms of assistance,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   President Joaquim Chissano said flood victims would need to be
fed for at least 10 months -- until they could grow new crops. He
also said a minimum of $250 million would be needed for
reconstruction and pleaded with Mozambique's creditors to forgive
the country's foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   South African, French, German, Belgium and British aircraft
began operations Monday to deliver food and other aid to the
flooded Limpopo River valley, 125 miles north of Maputo. Their
efforts were reinforced by boat crews from Holland and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   German planes and British boats conducted relief operations in
the Save River valley, another 500 miles farther north of Maputo.
U.S. and Spanish aircraft were expected to pitch in today.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclone Gloria, which together with a steady, three-week
downpour caused the deluge, was downgraded to a tropical storm
Friday, and on Monday, still further to a tropical low.
</P>
<P>
   Remnants of the storm hovered over the Indian Ocean off the
coast of Mozambique and were expected to bring more rain inland,
posing what South African forecasters said was a ''slight
possibility of flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   The flooding has destroyed one of Africa's fastest-growing
economies. After abandoning socialism in 1989, Chissano won praise
from international institutions and donors for loosening foreign
investment regulations and privatizing more than 900 state
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economic progress, Mozambique remained one of the
continent's poorest countries, with a per capita income of $670 a
year. It depends on foreign assistance to balance the budget and to
pay for a trade imbalance in which imports outnumber exports by
three to one.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations on Monday, the Security Council expressed
concern about the long-term impact of the floods on the country's
recovery from civil war -- especially the future of efforts to rid
Mozambique of 2 million land mines from more than a decade of
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Flood waters have washed away land, complicating mapping
projects that have located land mines, the council president said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a total uncertainty about how the demining process
will be revived and how this will continue,'' Ambassador Anwarul
Chowdhury of Bangladesh told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique plunged into a civil war after winning independence
from Portugal in 1975. The ruling party, known by its Portuguese
acronym FRELIMO, and the Mozambique National Resistance rebels
fighting to overthrow it declared a truce in 1992, and multiparty
elections were held in 1994.

<HEADLINE> GOP Urges Protest Vs. TV Anchors  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Republican National Committee has given out
the telephone numbers of Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather,
urging Republicans to call the network anchors to protest coverage
of a Democratic fund-raising trial.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson was miffed that the evening
news programs didn't devote more time to last Thursday's conviction
of Vice President Gore's former fund-raiser for arranging illegal
contributions to Democrats during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Hsia was convicted of five felony counts for arranging
more than $100,000 in illegal contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's neglect,'' Nicholson said Monday. ''If she had
been a Republican operative who had brought money to a Republican
candidate, there would have been an absolute uproar in the media
and there should have been in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Network representatives say such organized protests are common.
What made Nicholson's directive unusual was that it included the
office phone numbers of the anchors and their bosses and, in some
cases, their e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   His call to arms was sent out via e-mail to about 10,000 GOP
activists and radio talk show hosts across the country.
</P>
<P>
   By late Monday afternoon, CBS reported ''a handful'' of phone
calls and ABC said it had received a few dozen. NBC received less
than 15 calls, spokeswoman Barbara Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's politics,'' said ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said that the ''CBS Evening News'' devoted 23 seconds
to the story Thursday evening, while ABC's ''World News Tonight''
logged 19 seconds. NBC's ''Nightly News'' did not mention the
story, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has reported extensively on the fundraising scandal since it
was first uncovered, Murphy said. To measure its commitment by the
number of seconds broadcast on Thursday is silly, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't feel like we have anything to apologize for,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The phone calls may have taken Brokaw by surprise; he was on
vacation last Thursday and Brian Williams filled in on NBC's
nightly news.
</P>
<P>
   ''As any independent news organization has found, organized
campaigns like this do occur periodically and we understand that,''
Levin said. ''We make editorial decisions in our newsroom every day
and we stand by them.''

<HEADLINE> MDs To Start Violence Counseling  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Pediatricians should watch for warning signs of
violence as they talk to children about guns and anger during
routine checkups, according to new guidelines from the American
Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something that we need to try and start to deal with
at very young ages,'' said Dr. Edward Cox, a member of the
academy's Committee on Practice and Ambulatory Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors should start even before a child is born, discussing
with parents-to-be issues like guns in the home, family stress and
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should be the main focus until children reach school age
and are old enough to communicate with their doctors, and the
practice should continue through adolescence, according to updated
guidelines in the March issue of the academy journal Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   ''What led to it is our horrible problem in the United States
and with children. All you have to do is look in my home state,''
said Cox, a Grand Rapids, Mich., pediatrician. He was referring to
last week's shooting near Flint in which a 6-year-old girl was
allegedly killed by a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians were urged to talk about issues such as gun
safety, anger management and gangs, and look for signs of poor
self-esteem or depression that could make a child prone to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The new recommendation is ''not going to prevent every tragedy
but it will prevent some,'' said Naomi Paiss of the Center to
Prevent Handgun Violence, a lobbying group that worked with the
academy in developing violence-prevention guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taking the public education approach through health care
professionals on what has become a threatening plague for America's
children is certainly the appropriate thing to do,'' Paiss said.
</P>
<P>
   In a policy statement in the January 1999 issue of Pediatrics,
pediatricians were urged to take an active role in preventing youth
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The statement notes that the United States has the highest youth
homicide and suicide rates of the 26 wealthiest nations. ''Homicide
and suicide have become the second and third leading causes of
death of teen-agers'' and the leading cause of death among black
youngsters, the statement says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because many pediatricians encounter children and youth who
are experiencing or are at risk for violence, pediatricians are
well-situated to intervene,'' the statement says.

<HEADLINE> Police officials meet with Justice Department over Diallo case  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police union officials urged the Justice
Department to make a quick decision on whether to seek civil rights
charges against four New York City police officers acquitted of
slaying Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   And they said they worried that New York Senate race politics
would influence the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is involved in politics, and he's concerned
about the Senate race that his wife is running in New York City,''
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association president Patrick Lynch said
Monday after a half-hour meeting with Deputy Attorney General Eric
Holder.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said he was especially concerned because of President
Clinton's remarks over the weekend that the race of the unarmed
West African immigrant may have been a factor in his slaying. It
was the first time the president had spoken out about the Diallo
case since the verdict Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton is running against New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani for the Senate in New York, and she has been
critical of his leadership of the city's police department.
</P>
<P>
   The only lawyer for the officers to attend Monday's meeting was
Stephen Worth, who represented Edward McMellon.
</P>
<P>
   Worth said he lobbied for a rapid review of the case so the
officers could get on with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to know what their futures are, if they're going to
have to fight this battle again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Holder had promised a decision in ''a matter of weeks
not a matter of months.''
</P>
<P>
   All four lawyers for the police officers were initially expected
to attend Monday's meeting. But Worth said Justice Department
officials balked at that citing ethical concerns -- meeting with
defendants' attorneys while a review was pending. Worth attended in
his capacity as general counsel to the PBA. Tom Scotto, president
of the National Association of Police Organizations, also attended.
</P>
<P>
   Worth added there was no legal basis for a federal trial. He
filed a thick legal brief with Holder laying out the arguments
against pursuing charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that didn't come up (at the trial) in Albany
was racial profiling, and we stressed that this was not a racial
profiling case,'' Worth said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had no official comment on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Diallo's parents, the Rev. Al Sharpton and other
black activists met for nearly two hours with Holder to press for
federal prosecution of the four officers.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, some 2,000 people protested outside the Justice
Department, in one of the largest demonstrations the federal agency
had seen in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Holder has said the Justice Department was investigating the
Diallo case, but he made no guarantee that federal charges would be
filed. Prosecutors must be able to prove that the officers
intentionally violated Diallo's civil rights to pursue charges.
</P>
<P>
   The officers fired 41 shots at Diallo as he stood in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment building Feb. 4, 1999. He was
struck 19 times. The officers testified that they feared for their
lives when Diallo, 22, reached in his pocket for a black object
they thought was a gun. It turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy were
acquitted of charges ranging from second-degree murder to reckless
endangerment by a racially mixed jury in Albany, N.Y. The trial was
moved upstate because of the intense pre-trial publicity the case
received in New York City. Thousands of people were arrested in
daily protests outside police headquarters in the weeks following
the shooting.

<HEADLINE> Summer Bummer -- soaring Gas Prices  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE ARRILLAGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   James McKenna isn't too worried that gas prices could go as high
as $1.80 per gallon this summer.
</P>
<P>
   That might sound odd coming from the top tourism official in
Lake Placid, N.Y., a vacation spot that even he calls a
''rubber-tire destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet McKenna estimates that tourists driving up from New York
City would pay about $8 more in gas each way should prices
increase. In today's booming economy, he said, that's still a
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't even get a glass of wine for eight bucks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department on Monday predicted that gasoline prices,
already averaging about $1.50 for a gallon for unleaded, would
spike at $1.75 to $1.80 this summer because production isn't
keeping pace with demand.
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't be worse. The period between Memorial Day
and Labor Day is typically the busiest driving season of the year,
with an estimated 270 million people hitting the road for vacation,
according to the American Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   AAA spokesman Geoff Sundstrom said that while many travelers
won't change their plans because of a few additional bucks a tank,
some could decide to stay closer to home and skip trips to more
remote destinations such as national parks out West.
</P>
<P>
   ''If prices continue to move up and begin to reach the $2 a
gallon level, psychologically Americans may not be prepared to deal
with that and continue business as usual with the family budget,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation that worries Keela Mangum. The owner of Grand
Canyon Trail Rides fears that if gas prices continue to skyrocket,
the booming summer travel season she was counting on might turn out
to be a bust.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is kind of bleak looking for us,'' said Mangum, whose
family run business provides mule rides along the Grand Canyon's
North Rim, 270 miles from the nearest major airport in Las Vegas.
''We're at the end of the world as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, there are similar concerns for Bob Ferguson, owner
of Zephyr Whitewater Expeditions in Columbia, Calif., just north of
Yosemite National Park. Ferguson said he'll have to hike ticket
prices should gas prices continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ''If things got way out of hand we could add a little for the
cost of gas,'' he said. ''There's not a whole lot you can do. You
just have to bite the bullet, and hope the prices will go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials in the Lake Tahoe area said they don't believe
higher gas prices will keep that many people away.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a great Presidents Day weekend and gas prices were
already on the rise then,'' said Carol Tanis, spokeswoman for the
Reno-Sparks Convention &AMP; Visitors Authority. ''While gas prices are
up, the economy seems to be doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Tahoe-area ski resorts have followed the holiday weekend with
two more big weekends, thanks primarily to a pair of large snow
storms in the Sierra Nevada mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good snow may help outweigh the higher gas prices,'' Tanis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials in towns along the East Coast also were
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Donny Beaver, the proprietor of Paradise Outfitters, which
offers getaway weekends at fly fishing resorts in Pennsylvania,
said his business could actually benefit from higher gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of folks try to use us as a surrogate for a
10-day trip to Yellowstone,'' said Beaver, adding that his resorts
typically draw customers from an area that stretches to Cleveland,
New York and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Florida, where AAA's Sundstrom said more vacationers
travel by car than in any other state, tourism officials weren't
concerned. Gerard Hoeppner, spokesman for Busch Gardens in Tampa,
said the price surge might even persuade Floridians to vacation --
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people choose not to go out of state,'' he said, ''that's
good for us.''

<HEADLINE> Small Quake Rattles Orange County  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSTIN, Calif. (AP) -- A magnitude-3.9 earthquake was strong
enough to shake residents throughout Orange County but caused no
damage or injuries, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The temblor, which struck at 4:20 p.m. Monday, was felt from Los
Angeles to Riverside, according to residents who flooded television
and radio stations with calls. Many left their office buildings
when the shaking started.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shook the windows,'' said Marleen Madge, who works at a
Tustin real estate office. ''That kind of made me a little leery.''
</P>

   The quake struck about six miles northeast of Tustin, said
Robert Tindol, a spokesman at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena. It was not an aftershock.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ga. Farmers Ponder Weighty Issues  </HEADLINE>
By ELLIOTT MINOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- Georgia farmers, already plagued by drought
and low prices, have to plow through more problems before they
begin spring planting this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime you have all the commodities as cheap as they are,
it's hard to know where to go,'' said Mike Newberry, an Arlington
peanut and cotton farmer whose top concerns are commodity prices
and the availability of water to irrigate his crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went into '99 and my idea was the only thing we could do
was tie a knot in the rope and hang on,'' he said. ''In the year
2000, I hope there's a little more rope and room for another
knot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Givan, an agricultural economist with the University of
Georgia, said there is more frustration in the agricultural
community than he's seen in nearly 30 years as a farm management
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ground is dry and the weather service keeps saying it may
run into summer,'' he said. ''I have heard ... that some farmers
are looking at soybeans, rather than cotton, because they cost less
to plant.''
</P>
<P>
   But Southeastern farmers can only grow corn and soybeans
profitably under ideal conditions, Givan said. ''Unless we have
irrigation, we just can't compete with the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   High on the list of farmers' concerns is the extended drought
that has caused the driest conditions in nearly a half century in
south Georgia, where most of the state's crops are grown.
</P>
<P>
   The water situation is so critical in parts of southwestern
Georgia that members of the state House have voted to pay farmers
who stop irrigating during severe droughts.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would provide up to $30 million to those who turn
off the taps on 100,000 acres in the Flint River Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the states of Alabama, Florida and Georgia on
sharing water from the Flint, Chattahoochee and Appalachicola
rivers is another issue that could affect farmers. The talks have
stalled, and if no agreement is reached, the matter could be
decided by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Commodity prices began dropping in 1998 because of strong
worldwide production and the Asian financial crisis. They continued
to plummet last year as surpluses developed for grain and other
commodities. Economists don't expect prices to rise until next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA predicts net farm income will drop $7.6 billion this
year to $40.4 billion, making it likely that Congress will have to
approve more farm aid in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   This year, even two of Georgia's most reliable crops -- peanuts
and tobacco -- have problems.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA has cut Georgia's tobacco quota -- the amount farmers
are allowed to grow -- in half over the past three years because of
reduced demand. That will cost Georgia growers millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And peanuts, usually among the state's most profitable row
crops, will probably sell for lower prices because of a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Hudson, a Dooly County cotton and peanut grower, said
low prices are his chief concern. In years past, Hudson knew by
November which crops he would plant. This year, he may not decide
until the third week of March.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had crystal balls like some people think we do, we'd
have all sat out the '99 crop and gone and bought oil futures,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Paez May Be Headed for Confirmation  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After being left hanging longer than any other
judicial nominee in modern history, Richard A. Paez is likely to be
confirmed this week to a seat on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton first nominated Paez, 52, a federal judge in
Los Angeles, in January 1996. He was re-nominated in the next two
sessions of Congress, and approved twice by the Senate Judiciary
Committee, but has been blocked by conservatives from getting a
vote on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   That vote could come as early as Wednesday, along with a
confirmation vote on Marsha Berzon, a San Francisco lawyer who has
nominated two years ago to the Ninth Circuit but also ran into
opposition from senators who found her too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Paez's supporters say the vote will be very close, but it now
appears they have enough Republicans to carry the day. The Berzon
vote also could go down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, backed Paez in
both votes in his panel, and is expected to support him again.
Fellow Utah Republican Bob Bennett has indicated he will go along
with Hatch's decision, and Sen. Lincoln Chafee, R-R.I., says that
absent evidence that Paez is unqualified, he will respect the
president's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Sens. Gordon Smith, R-Ore. and James Jeffords, R-Vt.,
say they'll back the nominee, and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., voted for
him in committee. With all 45 Democrats behind the nomination, that
would give Paez a majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to be close votes ... but I think we can win
both of those votes,'' said Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The Paez nomination has been particularly sensitive for
Republicans. His opponents say he is too liberal, pointing to
statements he has made about California propositions to deny
benefits to illegal immigrants and end affirmative action programs.
There's also a perception among conservatives that the Ninth
Circuit, which covers an immense area of California and other
western states, is already too activist in its decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats have hit hard on claims that the holdup on Paez,
who is Hispanic, reflects a Republican tendency to be tougher on
minority nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people don't want these folks on the court,'' Clinton
told an audience of Hispanic leaders recently at the White House,
referring to his appointments of Paez and other Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wait has been humiliating and unnecessary'' for a judge
strongly endorsed by attorney and law enforcement groups, said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee
and a leader in criticizing Republicans for what Democrats say is
the GOP's slow pace in taking up judicial nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statistics are that minorities and women take longer with
the Senate since the Republicans took over. Maybe it's a
coincidence but he's had to wait longer than anybody in history,''
Leahy said of Paez.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have vehemently denied charges of bias, but need to
show their good faith in a year in which Hispanic votes are crucial
to their goal of regaining the White House. In addition to Paez,
the Senate will vote this week on the less controversial nomination
of New Jersey Superior Court Judge Julio Fuentes to the Third
Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said he will
vote against Paez because of some of his rulings and political
activities while on the bench. But last fall he bowed to Democratic
pressure and defied opposition from within his own party to promise
a vote on Paez and Berzon by March 15.

<HEADLINE> Smarter Baby Milk Formula Sought  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The mental development of babies improves
significantly when infant formula is enriched with two essential
fatty acids that are found in mother's milk, a study says.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Retina Foundation of the Southwest in Dallas
said Monday that intellectual capacity increased by about seven
points among 18-month-olds who had been fed the enriched formula
for four months.
</P>
<P>
   The study appears in the March issue of the journal
Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the study is important because it is the first to
compare formula supplemented with the fatty acids with
unsupplemented formula.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen E. Birch, first author of the study, said the research
shows that adding the fatty acids can closely mimic the effect of
mother's milk on brain development.
</P>
<P>
   The study adds to growing international support for adding to
commercial baby formula two fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
and arachidonic acid (AA), that are in breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 countries have approved supplementing formula with
DHA and AA. Officials at the Food and Drug Administration said the
issue is under review and new regulations for U.S. formula makers
may be issued within eight months.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, Birch and her colleagues divided 56 newborns into
three groups and fed them different formula for four months.
</P>
<P>
   A control group received a commercial formula with no addition.
One test group got formula supplemented with DHA, while the third
group got both DHA and AA. At the end of four months, all three
groups began receiving only commercial formula.
</P>
<P>
   At age 18 months, the children were tested on the Bayley Scales
of Infant Development, a standard test used to gauge physical and
mental progress of infants. A score of 100 is considered the
national average for mental development.
</P>
<P>
   Birch said infants receiving the double supplement, both DHA and
AA, scored 105.6 on the mental development index of the Bayley
Scales. She said this is virtually identical to the 106 score of a
separate group of babies, in another study, who were breast fed
only.
</P>
<P>
   For the control group of infants, who received commercial
formula, the average score was 98. This is within the statistical
range of normal, but seven points below the average for the test
group.
</P>
<P>
   For the group that received formula supplemented only with DHA,
said Birch, the score was about 102, a statistically insignificant
difference from normal.
</P>
<P>
   Birch said that although the infants on supplemented formula
scored significantly higher than the control group, the study does
not prove that there will be a similar IQ difference when the
children are older.
</P>
<P>
   ''The test is not a perfect predictor of school age
intelligence,'' said Birch. ''It does provide a good profile of
mental development at the early stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Children in the study will be tested again at age 4 and 9 to
determine if the enhanced early brain development translates into
higher IQs among school-age children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karen K. Winer of the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development said the research was ''a well-designed study,''
but that the number of children is too small to draw final answers
about supplementing baby formula.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is showing a trend, but we would need to do further studies
to draw a definitive conclusion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Birch agreed that more research is needed before the FDA
approves DHA and AA supplements for baby formula.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still some important questions to be answered''
regarding the long-term effects, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is always caution when you are adding something to baby
formula,'' said Christine Lewis, director of the FDA's office of
nutritional products. ''We are reviewing it actively, but this is a
serious issue'' that may take months to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Levine, a nutritional researcher at Rockefeller
University in New York, said the Birch study ''is a great, giant
step'' because it was a direct comparison of supplemented and
straight formula and that the use of DHA and AA in formula ''is
very, very promising.''

<HEADLINE> Defense Chief Cohen To Tour Vietnam  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost 27 years after the last American troops
left South Vietnam, Defense Secretary William Cohen is preparing to
visit unified communist Vietnam next week to discuss closer
military relations.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who did not serve in the military, will be the first
American defense chief to visit Vietnam since the war, which cost
the lives of more than 58,000 U.S. servicemen and killed an
estimated 3 million Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the trip Monday, the Pentagon released no details.
Cohen is expected go to Hanoi, the capital, and Ho Chi Minh City,
known as Saigon before it fell to the North Vietnamese in April
1975.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States and Vietnam normalized relations in
June 1995, there has been almost no military-to-military
relationship other than cooperation in recovering remains of
American servicemen. About 1,500 U.S. servicemen are unaccounted
for in Vietnam, another 500 in Laos and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   During his two-day stay, Cohen is expected to visit a site in
northern Vietnam where U.S. and Vietnamese forensics specialists
are attempting to recover remains. The U.S. portion of the recovery
operation is run by Joint Task Force-Full Accounting, an arm of the
U.S. Pacific Command based in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. veterans groups have generally been supportive of the
Pentagon's efforts to maintain Vietnamese cooperation on the
recovery of war remains and to work with Hanoi on other war-related
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think this is just great,'' Scott Campbell, spokesman for
Vietnam Veterans of America, said when told of Cohen's planned
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League
of POW/MIA Families, called it a ''positive step'' that can serve
to reinforce the seriousness of resolving the remaining cases of
missing servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   The last visit by an American defense secretary was in the early
1970s by Melvin Laird, who was in Saigon before the last American
troops were withdrawn and U.S. prisoners of war released in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Military-to-military cooperation between communist Vietnam and
the United States began in 1988 when the first joint field
investigations on American MIAs were held. In 1991 the United
States opened a military compound in Hanoi, known as ''The Ranch,''
to house U.S. officials involved in remains recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's visit will coincide with a period of national
celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the communist victory
over the U.S.-backed South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goals for this trip are to try to make our
military-to-military relations with Vietnam more regular and
routine,'' a senior official said Monday. He discussed the trip on
condition that he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has been pushing for the United States to help resolve
the legacy of Agent Orange, the herbicide sprayed by U.S. Air Force
planes in a defoliation operation from 1962 to 1970. Vice President
Nguyen Thi Binh said last week an estimated 1 million Vietnamese
suffer effects of Agent Orange's highly toxic component dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   During his talks in Vietnam, Cohen is expected to say the
Clinton administration is prepared to conduct joint research on
Agent Orange, the U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is to visit Hong Kong this weekend before flying to
Vietnam. He also will visit Tokyo and Seoul.

<HEADLINE> After verdicts, minority leaders mull action plan  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- New Yorkers should turn their anger over the
acquittal of four white police officers in the shooting death of
the black Amadou Diallo into votes against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
in this year's U.S. Senate race, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York's challenge at this moment is to turn pain into
power!'' Jackson exclaimed Monday during a breakfast rally at the
Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network headquarters in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Other suggestions being mulled by minority leaders: Hold a
''week of outrage'' in April, and lobby state lawmakers to pass a
bill making police more accountable when a Diallo-type incident
occurs.
</P>
<P>
   But the theme that garnered the most audience response was the
one calling for Giuliani's defeat in his bid for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Moses had his pharaoh. Mandela had his Robben Island,''
Jackson told the crowd of 300, referring to the biblical figure's
nemesis and the island where Mandela was imprisoned. ''You have
your Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson made reference to the slim voting margins that have
decided key elections, such as the presidential race between
Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy. But he did not directly mention
Giuliani's opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Several recent polls
put their race at a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ''In New York, if on Nov. 7, we put another 400,000 voters in
the books, we will see the victor in one hotel and we will see
Giuliani on his way back to private life,'' he said, although
Giuliani's term as mayor doesn't expire until Jan. 1, 2002. ''New
York, you are about 400,000 votes from emancipation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson urged several elected leaders at the rally -- from U.S.
Reps. Major Owens and Gregory Meeks to City Councilman Bill Perkins
-- to get high school seniors to register in time to vote in
November. Later Monday, Jackson and Sharpton kicked off a voter
registration drive at Hostos College in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was killed in a hail of bullets on Feb. 4, 1999, as he
stood in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building. The four
officers were acquitted last month of murder and other charges in a
trial that had been moved to Albany because of pre-trial publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the rally, state Assemblyman Keith Wright said lawmakers
need the public's help to persuade the state Senate to pass several
measures, such as a law requiring police officers to live within
the limits of the city they serve, giving the attorney general
direct jurisdiction in police misconduct cases and eliminating the
rule that allows an officer involved in a shooting to delay talking
with supervisors for 48 hours. These measures have been passed in
the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Wright named the package of measures Amadou's Law.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks said he and other congressmen are trying to pass similar
bills in Washington, D.C. The Law Enforcement Integrity Act of 2000
also deals with issues of racial profiling and ''driving while
black,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Owens suggested that in April, the minority community should
stage a ''week of outrage,'' which would consist of 15 to 25
demonstrations taking place simultaneously every day of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would bring the city to its knees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton continued his appeal for peaceful, nonviolent civil
disobedience protests.

<HEADLINE> Single Japanese Depend on Parents  </HEADLINE>
By CHISAKI WATANABE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Eriko Komatsu knows she has a good thing going.
</P>
<P>
   Her paycheck may be humble, but it all goes straight into
dinners at trendy restaurants, cooking and flower arrangement
classes, golf on weekends, and vacations abroad.
</P>
<P>
   She drives a BMW, pays no rent, does no laundry and hardly any
cleaning. And whenever she isn't dining out, her meals are free.
</P>
<P>
   Komatsu, 35, lives with her parents, and that puts her into a
slice of the population that Japanese lifestyle watchers have
dubbed the ''single parasites.'' And though that designation may be
a tad harsh, she and millions of others like her wouldn't have it
any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never thought about leaving home,'' said Komatsu, who
works as a temporary employee for a company that provides
correspondence courses. ''Why should I?''
</P>
<P>
   That's a question many in Japan are asking.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10 million Japanese between the ages of 20 and 34 --
including 60 percent of the unmarried men and 80 percent of the
unmarried women -- live with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Masahiro Yamada, an associate professor of sociology at Tokyo
Gakugei University, put the stay-at-home singles in the national
spotlight with his recent best seller, ''The Age of Parasite
Singles.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamada says the number of singles living with their parents has
probably more than doubled over the last 10 years, and he sees this
trend as boding ill for the future of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are people who still depend on their parents for the
basics of their life even after they reach an adult age,'' he said.
''They are not aware that they are leading a kind of life that is
more than their salary alone can afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon isn't unique to Japan, of course. Italy, Spain
and South Korea also have a high percentage of stay-at-homes,
Yamada said.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea has a logic that hits a particularly sympathetic
chord with the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, there's the housing situation.
</P>
<P>
   In central Tokyo, rent for a cramped, studio apartment is
typically around $730 a month. A recent college graduate earns an
average of $1,782 monthly, according to the Labor Ministry. That
compares with the average salary in Japan -- $3,200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   This is a considerable burden on a young person. And though some
larger companies offer dormitories for unmarried employees, Japan's
slow economy is forcing smaller companies to cut back or freeze
housing allowances -- making the stay-at-home option all the more
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, however, striking out on one's own isn't seen
as a necessary rite of passage in Japan, and there is also little
or no stigma attached to living with one's parents.
</P>
<P>
   For single women, in fact, living at home was until recently
almost a social requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Until last spring, companies often said in want ads that only
those women able to commute from their parents' homes would be
hired. A gender equality law banned that in April.
</P>
<P>
   For men, meanwhile, Japanese tradition holds that eldest sons
should remain in their parents' home after marriage to assume the
role as head of the household and, later, support their mother and
father in old age.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are also not all convinced the stay-at-home
philosophy is such a negative factor for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Yuji Fukuda, senior research director at the Dentsu Institute
for Human Studies, said that even if stay-at-homes were to move out
there would be no significant benefit for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only change would be what they spend their money on,'' he
said, adding that they are now an important market for luxury items
such as DVDs and other new, high-price products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yamada said that it is the responsibility of adults to
live on their own, and their parents' responsibility to kick them
out of the nest when the appropriate time comes.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents choose not to, he said, because they survived the
hard times Japan suffered after World War II and don't want their
children to go through the same kind of hardships they had to.
</P>
<P>
   Shigeko Ohashi, a 50-year-old Tokyo housewife, agreed that her
live-at-home daughter may not be particularly independent-minded,
but defended her choice of lifestyles just the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are things like housing and commuting that need to be
taken into consideration,'' she said. ''She can get to work in 30
minutes from our house.''
</P>
<P>
   And besides, Ohashi said, she likes her daughter's company.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can have chats,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Silverman employee says Kimeses tried to persuade her to quit job  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former employee of a millionaire widow who is
presumed killed testified that the mother-and-son team accused of
the murder tried to get her to quit so they could isolate their
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Valrie McLeod testified Monday that defendant Sante Kimes, 65,
called her on June 20, 1998, and said she was in Mexico. McLeod
said her caller identification box showed that the call came from a
Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes and her son, Kenneth Kimes, 24, using the names Eva
Guerrin and Manny Guerrero, had rented a small apartment in Irene
Silverman's elegant six-story mansion six days earlier for $6,000 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in Mexico,'' McLeod quoted Sante Kimes, calling herself
Eva, as saying. ''That lady is saying mean things about you. Don't
go back there.''
</P>
<P>
   McLeod said she asked what Silverman had said and Kimes replied,
''She said that you were very thin (when she first went to work
there) and that you were stealing food to eat. My boss will tell
you more.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the Kimeses were trying to isolate Silverman so
they could kill her and steal her home with as little interference
as possible. Silverman vanished July 5, 1998, and her body has
never been found.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses are on trial in Manhattan state Supreme Court,
charged with murder and other crimes related to Silverman's
disappearance and the attempted theft of her multimillion-dollar
home.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kimeses were arrested on a Utah stolen-car warrant on
July 5, 1998, they had a bogus deed with Silverman's forged
signature purporting to sell them the mansion for a fraction of its
value.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod, who was home on vacation when she got calls from the
Kimeses, testified that she later met Kenneth Kimes at a restaurant
and asked what he had to add to the information that his secretary,
Eva, had already told her.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Kimes said he didn't want to upset her by repeating what
Silverman had said. Then he asked for Silverman's Social Security
number, McLeod said.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed that Silverman had been stealing documents from his
apartment and wanted her Social Security number to check up on her,
McLeod said. He also asked for the telephone number of Silverman's
accountant.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod said she told him flatly that she didn't believe him and
said, ''If she's stealing your documents, why don't you just move
out?''
</P>
<P>
   After about five minutes, McLeod said, she left without telling
him anything more.

<HEADLINE> Super Tuesday Begins in 16 States  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John McCain claimed momentum but still
wondered whether there was ''enough time'' as presidential
front-runners George W. Bush and Al Gore sounded themes suited for
the battle beyond today's primaries. Bill Bradley summarized his
campaign, arguing it has reshaped the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democratic Party has moved in the direction that I've
pushed it over the year,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the busiest day yet of the primary season. With
virtually every region of the nation in play, the four candidates
spent Monday racing from state to state in a blinding whirl of
rallies as they sought to close the sale on their White House bids.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed Vice President Gore with a broad lead over Bradley
in each of the 15 states with Democratic contests, but the former
New Jersey senator made his case Monday in New York, where he
became famous as a professional basketball star, and offered some
hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think in the end people are going to listen to the
pollsters and the pundits,'' said Bradley, who was rising early
again today to greet New Yorkers on their way to work and the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican race between McCain and Bush was tighter, though
surveys in the 13 states with GOP contests showed Bush with an
advantage in some large and important states.

   Both races for the White House could look different after today.
There are 613 Republican delegates and 1,315 Democratic delegates
at stake -- more than half the number needed to claim the nomination
in either party. Some states also predicted record voter turnouts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain continued their acrimonious battle with a final
round of complaints from McCain about commercials by Bush
supporters criticizing McCain's environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   McCain filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission,
and staffers also sought to have the Federal Communication
Commission force the commercials off the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then at least we can have a level playing field,'' said McCain
campaign manager Rick Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   ''My attitude is that this is a long march to victory,'' said
Bush, the Texas governor, who was tending to state business today
in Austin before settling in to await the returns.
</P>
<P>
   McCain claimed some momentum, but still wondered whether it was
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is, is there going to be enough time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP contest has been quirky, and McCain has shown an ability
to recover when things look grim. ''The only thing I'm certain of
is it's uncertain,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush both focused Monday on the biggest prize of all
by campaigning in California for its 162 delegates. Bush courted
Jewish voters and took another stab at comedy on ''The Tonight Show
With Jay Leno'' while McCain spent the day rallying supporters.
McCain overnighted in the state and planned to watch the returns
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Polling showed him running well in the five New England states
that vote today, while Bush had a clear edge in California, Georgia
and Ohio. New York was a competitive battleground that McCain in
particular badly needs to win.
</P>
<P>
   McCain strategists conceded their challenge is to expand their
base beyond appealing to Northeastern moderates in the face of
Bush's strength among the GOP faithful.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was heading home to Arizona on Wednesday to take stock,
but aides said it would be a brief respite.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush sweep of the three top prizes of California, Ohio and New
York would deal a body blow to McCain's insurgent campaign. Gore
was positioned to deal a similar blow to Bradley, and there were
signs that both front-runners were beginning to think in general
election terms.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, addressing a rally Monday at the University of Missouri
near Bradley's Crystal City, Mo., hometown, ignored his rival to
target Bush and remind voters of the budget deficits that
accumulated under Presidents Reagan and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the GOP is again ''headed in the wrong direction, big
time,'' said Gore, who was returning to his own home state,
Tennessee, to quietly await the returns in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Gore strategists were crafting a new message shifting
the focus to Bush, labeling his tax cut proposals as ''reckless''
and taking credit for a continued strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that McCain's surprisingly strong challenge forced
Bush to the right, leaving him vulnerable among the independents
and moderates who are crucial in a general election. Issues they
want to exploit include abortion rights, gun control and the
environment, as well as racial and religious tolerance -- an issue
that has dogged Bush since his visit to a South Carolina school
whose leaders have been linked to anti-Catholic sentiment.

<HEADLINE> Bush Appears on the 'Tonight Show'  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- George W. Bush was a comedic target for
Jay Leno as the Republican presidential candidate tried to rebound
from a lackluster appearance with Leno's rival David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, appearing Monday night on NBC's ''The Tonight Show,'' at
first faced gentle questioning about his famous family and his
courtship of his wife. But the laughs picked up when the comedian
made light of Bush's admitted partying past.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you were out at a frat party, having a good time at Yale
(University) partying with the boys, were you ever thinking, 'You
know, I don't want to have that beer. I might be running for
president.' Did that ever cross your mind?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush deadpanned: ''No.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor gave as good as he got, though, turning
around Leno's persistent questions about whether he is a
cheapskate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I'm thrifty. I'm going to be tight with your money -- all
that money you make, I'm going to be tight with,'' Bush said,
hinting at Leno's multimillion-dollar salary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, you're very good at this,'' Leno replied. ''I still didn't
get an answer to the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance last Wednesday on CBS' ''The Late Show With
David Letterman'' was hampered by a delay in the satellite
connection between Letterman's studio in New York and St. Louis,
where Bush taped the segment. Several of the governor's jokes fell
flat.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning all day in California, the appearance with Leno was
negotiated by top aides and sandwiched between stops in Los Angeles
and Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Tonight Show'' opened with a skit making fun of the Bush's
poor performance on a pop quiz earlier in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Leno was filmed walking through the hallways of the NBC studios
outside Los Angeles, anxiously looking for Bush, who was in his
dressing room reviewing the names of foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who is Tony Blair,'' said Bush. ''Who is Boris Yeltsin.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno, acting surprised, appeared incredulous as the governor
appeared not to know the names of the British prime minister and
Russia's former president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, feigning indignation himself, said he was conducting a
daily briefing with one of his advisers. At that point, the camera
panned back to show Bush speaking with ''Jeopardy'' host Alex
Trebek.
</P>
<P>
   ''All right governor, once again the category is foreign
leaders. Who was the prime minister of Israel from 1996 to 1999?''
Trebek said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied: ''Who is Benjamin Netanyahu?''
</P>
<P>
   Thrilled with the correct answer, Leno pumped a fist and said,
''Yes!''

<HEADLINE> Super Tuesday Begins for 16 States  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John McCain claimed momentum but still
wondered whether there was ''enough time'' as presidential
front-runners George W. Bush and Al Gore sounded themes suited for
the battle beyond today's primaries. Bill Bradley summarized his
campaign, arguing it has reshaped the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democratic Party has moved in the direction that I've
pushed it over the year,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the busiest day yet of the primary season. With
virtually every region of the nation in play, the four candidates
spent Monday racing from state to state in a blinding whirl of
rallies as they sought to close the sale on their White House bids.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed Vice President Gore with a broad lead over Bradley
in each of the 15 states with Democratic contests, but the former
New Jersey senator made his case Monday in New York, where he
became famous as a professional basketball star, and offered some
hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think in the end people are going to listen to the
pollsters and the pundits,'' said Bradley, who was rising early
again today to greet New Yorkers on their way to work and the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican race between McCain and Bush was tighter, though
surveys in the 13 states with GOP contests showed Bush with an
advantage in some large and important states.

<HEADLINE> Ailing cardinal presented with Congressional Gold Medalproclamation  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor's poor health likely will
prevent him from celebrating Mass on Ash Wednesday, and it's
unclear whether he will be on the church steps overlooking Fifth
Avenue on St. Patrick's Day, as is his custom.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor, 80, was able to muster enough strength to accept
the Congressional Gold Medal on Monday during a presentation at his
archdiocese residence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just one of those nice, almost magical moments that we
are lucky enough to take part in ... it was so good to see him
vigorous,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who with Congressman
Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., presented the framed proclamation to
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   The medal, yet to be minted, will be presented to the cardinal
in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   The medal is the highest civilian honor awarded by Congress, and
both houses rushed to approve it for O'Connor, mindful of his
precarious health. The medal has been awarded to 250 people,
including George Washington, the Wright Brothers and Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   ''It meant a great deal to him. He was very, very happy, very
pleased about the whole thing,'' the cardinal's spokesman, Joe
Zwilling, said after presentation of the document.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor still is recuperating from brain tumor surgery last
year. He has been feeling better the last few days but still is
weak and is unable to resume a regular schedule, his spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fossella, on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral, said the
cardinal ''represents the finest that America has had to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton signed the proclamation on Sunday and in a
statement said, ''For more than 50 years, Cardinal O'Connor has
served the Catholic Church and our nation with constancy and
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recalled O'Connor's early days performing parish work in
his native Philadelphia, his service as a military chaplain in
Korea and Vietnam and his 16 years leading the New York
Archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether it was the soldier on the battlefield or the patient
dying of AIDS, Cardinal O'Connor has ministered with a gentle
spirit and a loving heart,'' Clinton said. ''Through it all, he has
stood strong as an advocate for the poor, a champion for workers
and an inspiration for millions.''

Death Toll in Mozambique Floods Up
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- An overpowering stench hung over parts of Chokwe,
where aid workers collected the bodies of 38 flood victims and prepared them for
burial in a mass grave. Elsewhere in the town, residents whose homes were still
intact were mopping up and collecting what remained of their possessions after
the worst floods on record in this impoverished southeast African country. The
government Monday raised its official flood death toll to 400, and expected it
to grow as data came in from outlying areas and more bodies were found.

MDs To Start Violence Counseling
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Pediatricians should talk to children about guns and anger
during routine check-ups and look for the warning signs of violence, the
American Academy of Pediatrics says in new guidelines prompted by bloodshed
among youngsters. Along with performing routine procedures like measuring height
and weight, pediatricians should talk about issues such as gun safety, anger
management and gangs, and look for signs of poor self-esteem or depression that
could make a child prone to violence, the academy says. Doctors should start
even before a child is born, discussing with parents-to-be issues like guns in
the home, family stress and discipline.

Many Elderly Don't Get Cancer Test

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Few elderly Americans are getting screenings for early

''Medicare beneficiaries' use of colorectal cancer services falls far short of
recommended levels,'' says new study by the General Accounting Office, released
at a hearing of the Senate Aging Committee Monday. The new report said many
people may not be getting the screenings because they don't know Medicare covers
them, they are embarrassed to ask their doctor or they believe the tests would
be too uncomfortable.

already is used by adults and older children. But the FDA approved a slightly

first asthma prevention therapy for children so young. Singulair does not treat

FAA: More Planes To Crowd Skies

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More commercial jets, cargo planes and private aircraft

ground, the FAA reports. In its annual 12-year forecast being released Tuesday,
the Federal Aviation Administration says commercial air travel will continue

fares if fuel prices don't become ruinous.

<HEADLINE> Candidate reads, sings, buys cookies at library  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- She came in wearing a golden brooch. She
left wearing a red-and-green sticker that said, ''I got my library
card today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton joined the book crowd Monday during an
event-filled hour at the Chappaqua Library, now her local branch.
She also read a story to preschoolers, sang with them, checked out
a few books for home decorating ideas and ordered three boxes of
cookies from an enterprising Girl Scout.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, has a new
house about a mile and a half from the library. Director Mark
Hasscarl said he invited her to join -- ''though the story hour was
her idea'' -- and her campaign invited the press to watch.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton picked up her library card and sticker, she
perched on a tiny chair in the reading room and read Eric Carle's
''The Very Hungry Caterpillar'' to 18 kids, all under 6, and their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the book open for all to see, the first lady added
occasional commentary to the tale of a caterpillar that chomps its
way through one apple, two pears, three plums and more to get ready
for its transformation into a butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's as small as my finger!'' Clinton said. ''Look at what
he's eating!''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, she joined in on songs including ''The Itsy-Bitsy
Spider'' -- complete with hand gestures -- and ''Old MacDonald.''
</P>
<P>
   After signing a copy of ''Goodnight Moon'' for a young fan,
Clinton repaired to the library's home decorating section and
leafed through several books before settling on five to check out,
including ''Know Your Collectibles,'' ''The Country House'' and
''Sculpture of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   It was while she was browsing that she was approached by Girl
Scout Katharine Bierce, of Mount Kisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''I checked with the Secret Service man and first he said wait,
and then he said it would be OK,'' the 11-year-old said afterward.
''And then when I asked Mrs. Clinton, she said, 'Oh, sure.'''
</P>
<P>
   One box each of Thin Mints, Do-Si-Dos and Trefoils, costing a
total of $9, will be delivered next month to the Westchester White
House. And Miss Bierce has now sold 135 boxes.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton left the library, she assured the staff, ''I'll be
back without so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton appeared on ''Lifetime Live'' on the Lifetime
cable network and spoke again of how much she enjoys grocery
shopping in Chappaqua after seven years in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel a little like Rip Van Winkle,'' she said. ''There are
things I haven't seen before on the shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she would recommend a career in politics for her
20-year-old daughter, Chelsea Clinton, she said: ''Well, I think
that will be up to her. I hope she makes the best decision she
can.''
</P>
<P>
   And while she repeated her support for gun control measures
including child-safety locks, she said she would not impinge on
hunters and others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody wants to take guns away from law-abiding hunters and
sport-shooters,'' she said. ''But there are just too many guns in
this country that fall into the wrong hands.''

<HEADLINE> 2 more officers face charges in Louima case  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Not content with convictions in two cases,
federal prosecutors plan to put two more police officers on trial
for allegedly lying about the torture of a Haitian immigrant in the
bathroom of a Brooklyn stationhouse.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, white ex-patrolman Charles Schwarz, 34, and officers
Thomas Wiese, 36, and Thomas Bruder, 33, were convicted of trying
to conceal Schwarz's role in the notorious attack on the black
Abner Louima in the summer of 1997. A jury had already found
Schwarz guilty last year of holding down the handcuffed Louima
while another officer, Justin Volpe, sodomized him with a broken
broom stick in a fit of rage.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants face up to five years in prison for
obstruction of justice. Schwarz also is awaiting a possible life
sentence in the assault case. No sentencing date was set.
</P>
<P>
   Two more officers, Rolando Aleman and Francisco Rosario, are
scheduled to go on trial later this month as part of federal
prosecutors' ongoing offensive against the so-called blue wall of
silence, an unspoken code among rank-and-file officers to never
inform on each other.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's verdict ''should send a message within the police
department that there is no greater betrayal of the badge than to
ensnare a fellow officer in a web of lies and deceit,'' U.S.
Attorney Loretta Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman and Rosario, both members of a plainclothes unit, were in
the stationhouse when Louima was assaulted. Court papers say that
when first confronted by federal agents, they denied seeing
anything suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman cut off questioning by saying he was not a snitch, but he
later admitted seeing an officer leading Louima -- his pants at his
ankles -- to a holding cell, court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest conviction came in the wake of an Albany jury's
acquittal of four white officers who killed Amadou Diallo, who was
black, in a hail of 41 bullets, and it triggered an emotional
outburst by the defendants and their supporters. Attorneys for the
three men said they would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder's lawyer, Stuart London, suggested the outcome of the
Diallo case and the flood of protests and public debate that
followed may have put pressure on the anonymous jury in the
Brooklyn case, which was composed of six blacks, five whites and
one Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to ignore the post-Diallo, anti-police climate that
resides in this city,'' London said.
</P>
<P>
   As he was led out of the courtroom, Schwarz could be heard
loudly cursing. Wiese and Bruder, who are still free on $100,000
bail, both wept.
</P>
<P>
   ''You tell the truth, and this is what happens,'' Bruder ranted.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad accused the trio
of lying to investigators by claiming Schwarz was never in the
bathroom. He offered phone records as evidence that the cops, who
rarely spoke prior to the incident, had scores of conversations to
''get their stories straight.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense sought, in effect, to retry the first case and prove
Schwarz couldn't have participated in the assault -- a claim
supported by the dramatic testimony of both Volpe and Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, serving 30 years after pleading guilty to attacking
Louima, testified that Wiese was present but made no move to join
the assault or try to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never saw Schwarz in the bathroom at any time,'' Volpe told
the jury, adding that he could not serve his time ''with a clear
conscience ... knowing that another man is paying for the crime
that I committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz said he had only accompanied Louima from the patrol car
to the front desk of the precinct. At the time of the assault, he
claimed to be outside conducting a routine search of his patrol
car.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson had instructed jurors that
by law they ''need not determine the extent of any role the
defendant Schwarz may have played in the sexual assault.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the judge said, ''You need only determine whether one
or more of the defendants conspired to obstruct a federal grand
jury investigation by providing false or misleading information in
an effort to exculpate'' Schwarz.

<HEADLINE> DA's office makes a deal with last BCCI defendant  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An agreement between the Manhattan district
attorney's office and a British lawyer likely concludes a lengthy
swindling case involving the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for David Sandy, a solicitor in the London
firm of Simmons &AMP; Simmons, to refrain from practicing law or
receiving any income from any law firm through Sept. 2, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office said Monday it has made a deal
with Sandy, whose two trials in the BCCI case ended in deadlocked
juries. Sandy had been charged in April 1995 with tampering with
evidence for allegedly hiding the computer disk diaries of Zafar
Iqbal, BCCI's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, which once had branches in more than 70 countries, in
effect ran a giant Ponzi scheme, in which money was moved from one
place to another as needed while its operators extracted as much as
they could.
</P>
<P>
   When BCCI was forced to close in 1991, depositors lost some $10
billion in what prosecutors called the biggest bank swindle in
history. Before its collapse, the bank was run by a ruling family
of the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's last trial ended Dec. 14, when the jury, after four days
of deliberations, failed to reach a verdict. The agreement with the
district attorney's office means there will not be a third trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's lawyer, John Wing, denied that his client committed the
crimes charged but said he ''decided that this resolution was the
best way to conclude the matter in order to avoid the substantial
additional expenses of yet a third two-month trial far from home.''
</P>
<P>
   Wing said the diary notes were so inconsequential that
prosecutors held them for five years without using them in any
prosecution except Sandy's.
</P>
<P>
   Wing said Sandy is the only lawyer ever prosecuted in Manhattan
for withholding evidence. He added that the Justice Department,
viewing the same evidence, had declined to prosecute his client.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy, 44, also agreed that after the ban on his legal work
lapses, he will, from Sept. 3 through Dec. 31, 2001, limit his
client contact and legal work and restrict his activities at any
law firm.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement's terms, approved by State Supreme Court Justice
John Cataldo, also require Sandy and his law firm to provide
written confirmations of his compliance with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   If Sandy complies with the agreement's terms, the district
attorney's office will move next March 3 to dismiss the indictment.
The court will retain jurisdiction over Sandy until March 3, 2002,
the agreement says.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 123, Clippers 103  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal gave himself a mighty big
28th birthday present, scoring a career-high 61 points Monday night
as the Los Angeles Lakers extended their winning streak to 16 games
by beating the Clippers 123-103.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 52nd time in NBA history that a player scored 60 or
more points. O'Neal was the first to do it since San Antonio's
David Robinson scored 71 against the Clippers on April 24, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who also grabbed 23 rebounds, shot 24-for-35 from the
field and 13-for-22 from the line in 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd went wild cheering and waving white giveaway
T-shirts every time O'Neal made a basket or a free throw in the
fourth quarter. They chanted ''MVP, MVP'' when he completed a
three-point play with 4:12 remaining to reach 59 points and put the
Lakers ahead 111-94.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal ran off 15 straight points, capped by a dunk off a feed
from Kobe Bryant, before leaving with three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   It was the highest scoring game in the NBA this season,
surpassing Vince Carter's 51 for Toronto against Phoenix on Feb.
27.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's previous career-high was 53 points on April 20, 1994,
for Orlando against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' 16-game winning streak matches their longest of the
season. They will go for 17 straight Thursday night at Golden
State.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers had their second sellout crowd of the season with
20,385 at Staples Center. The first was against the Lakers on Jan.
4, when O'Neal had 38 points and 15 rebounds. In his next game the
following night, O'Neal had 40 points and 19 rebounds against the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won the season series 4-0 for their third consecutive
sweep of the Clippers. The Clippers have lost 13 straight to the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant added 22 points as the Lakers shot 61 percent from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Taylor led the Clippers with 25 points and 10 rebounds
and Derek Anderson added 21 points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the Lakers' show from beginning to end, however. All
but 6.9 seconds of the first half belonged to the Clippers, who
despite being the league's worst team led by as many as nine
points.
</P>
<P>
   Not until Bryant hit a five-foot running jumper with 6.9 seconds
left in the half did the Lakers take their first lead, 56-55.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wilt Chamberlain scored 60 or more points 32 times in
regular-season games. Michael Jordan did it four times, the last on
Jan. 16, 1993, vs. Orlando. ... The Lakers also won 16 straight
from Dec. 11 until Jan. 12. Their last loss was a 105-81 defeat at
San Antonio on Feb. 1. ... Clippers guard Troy Hudson didn't dress
because of a stomach virus, while center Keith Closs sat out with
back spasms.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Mike Ricci scored both San Jose goals,
including the game-winner with just 45 seconds left in the game,
lifting the Sharks to a 2-1 victory over the New York Rangers on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game appeared headed for overtime, despite a huge shots
advantage for San Jose, before the Sharks struck suddenly in the
final minute. Stephane Matteau made a cross-ice pass from the
right, and Niklas Sundstrom deflected it to Ricci, whose wrist shot
from about 10 feet beat Mike Richter. The goal was Ricci's 18th of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose first scored just 50 seconds into the game. Ricci's
close-in shot from the right corner of the net was deflected by
Richter, but Ricci collected the rebound and put the puck into the
net.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci now has 16 two-goal games in his career.
</P>
<P>
   New York tied the game at 7:21 of the second period when Mathieu
Schneider scored on a slap shot from 25 feet. San Jose goalie Steve
Shields partially deflected the shot, but the puck trickled between
his legs and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks had a 30-7 advantage in shots through the first two
periods and finished with a 36-14 edge. That is the most the
Rangers have been outshot in a game this season. Twice before, they
had been outshot by 21.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was San Jose's first in nine games over the Rangers
on the Sharks' home ice. Since entering the league in 1991, the
Sharks are just 2-13-2 against the Rangers.

<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Mats Sundin scored with 1:47
left in overtime as the Toronto Maple Leafs recovered from blowing
a four-goal lead in the third period to beat the Vancouver Canucks
6-5 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Markus Naslund capped the Canucks outburst with his first goal
in five games as Vancouver rallied from a 5-1 deficit. The
short-handed goal was scored with 41 seconds left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Jovanovski, Alexander Mogilny and Harold Druken all scored in
the third period. Mogilny also had two assists and has 10 points in
three games.
</P>
<P>
   Darcy Tucker scored two short-handed goals and Igor Korolev had
three points for Toronto, which won for the fifth time in six
games.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker gave Toronto a 4-1 lead when he scored two goals less
than three minutes apart.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver was on its second straight power play when Tucker
broke in alone on Garth Snow with 46 seconds left in the second and
beat him with a quick move. Snow had just replaced Felix Potvin in
an apparent attempt to rest the Canucks' top power-play unit.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker added his second with a slap shot 2:08 into the third
that beat Potvin high on the stick side.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto stayed three points ahead of Ottawa in the race for the
top spot in the Northeast Division.
</P>
<P>
   Korolev's goal, 9:50 into the game, extended his point streak to
six games. Korolev, who assisted on both of Tucker's goals, has
three goals and four assists during that span.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto left wing Sergei Berezin had a goal and an assist in his
first game after missing 14 contests with a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cassels opened the scoring for Vancouver at 4:08 of the
first. Yanic Perreault and Korolev responded for the Leafs as the
Canucks held a 14-12 shots advantage in a first period filled with
scoring chances for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Leafs captain Mats Sundin was helped off the ice with nine left
in the first after a knee-on-knee collision with Vancouver forward
Matt Cooke. Sundin skated off favoring his left knee and Cooke
received a major penalty and a game misconduct for kneeing.
</P>
<P>
   Sundin returned in the second period to take part in the ensuing
Toronto power play.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Healy got a rare start in place of Curtis Joseph and
stopped 33 shots improve to 7-7-0.
</P>
<P>
   Snow came back at 3:02 of the third and took the loss.

<HEADLINE> Raptors 109, Trail Blazers 90  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Vince Carter scored 35 points and Doug
Christie added 26 as the Toronto Raptors hit a season-high 13
3-pointers to easily beat Portland 109-90 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors won their sixth in a row and fourth straight on the
road, a franchise record. Toronto moved a half-game ahead of
Philadelphia for the No. 4 spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace scored a season-high 27 and Arvydas Sabonis had
16 points and 11 rebounds to lead the Blazers, who have lost two of
their last three home games after winning 16 straight.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who began the night as the NBA's fourth-leading scorer
at 25.5 points per game, is averaging 30.6 points over his last 15
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers weathered a 15-0 run in the second quarter, but
folded after Toronto reeled off 13 straight points in the third. A
21-foot baseline jumper by Antonio Davis put the Raptors ahead
62-54, and Portland couldn't get closer than four after that.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was playing his first game ever at the Rose Garden, and
he treated the crowd to an exhibition of long-distance shooting
along with a flashy dunk. Carter shot 4-of-5 from 3-point range.
Christie was 5-of-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers had a nine-point lead in the second quarter, but it
quickly vanished when the second unit came in.
</P>
<P>
   After a jumper by Stacey Augmon, the Raptors went on their 15-0
run, highlighted by one of Carter's poster-worthy dunks on a lob
from Muggsy Bogues. A reverse layup by Kevin Willis gave Toronto a
40-34 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Portland responded, and Wallace one-upped Carter with a powerful
one-handed slam over Antonio Davis to put the Blazers ahead 45-44.
Greg Anthony converted a three-point play after a goaltending
violation on Carter to give Portland a 52-47 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Blazers' point guard Damon Stoudamire missed his second straight
game after injuring his left knee in last week's home loss to the
Los Angeles Lakers. With a bigger, less quick lineup, the Blazers
didn't run the open court well and turned the ball over 17 times.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors scored 62 points in the second half, and Carter and
Christie combined to shoot 7-of-11 from 3-point range in the final
two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers pulled to 65-61 on a turnaround shot off the glass
by Rasheed Wallace with 5:26 left in the third. But Charles Oakley
hit a 23-foot jumper, and Carter tipped home his own miss to make
it 71-63. Dell Curry's 3-pointer with 6.5 seconds left in the
period made it an 81-70 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With Stoudamire out, Scottie Pippen played the point and
Detlef Schrempf started at small forward, his sixth start of the
season and first since Jan. 14. Schrempf scored seven points. ...
Portland activated backup point guard Gary Grant and put reserve
center Joe Kleine on the injured list with tendinitis in his left
knee. ... Toronto tied the franchise record for consecutive wins,
set last season. ... Augmon scored a season-high 11 points.

<HEADLINE> UConn Women Still No. 1 in AP Poll  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   This could turn out to be quite a week for Oregon women's
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   It started Monday with the Ducks returning to The Associated
Press poll at No. 24. It could end with Oregon winning its second
straight Pac-10 championship.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon and No. 23 George Washington both were voted back into
the poll after being ranked earlier in the season, though a few
hours later, George Washington lost to Xavier in the final of the
Atlantic 10 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut remained an overwhelming choice for No. 1 and is
just one week from a season-long run at the top. The final poll of
the season will be released next Monday, the day after the NCAA
tournament pairings are announced.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon (22-7) was ranked the first 10 weeks of the season,
reaching as high as 10th, before falling out after a 78-62 loss at
Stanford on Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks have won eight of their last nine and would clinch
at least a tie for the Pac-10 title if they beat Oregon State at
home in their regular-season finale on Friday night. Oregon shared
the championship -- its first -- with UCLA last season.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington was in the poll twice before this season for
one week -- No. 24 on Jan. 17 and 25th on Feb. 14. The Colonials
rode a five-game winning streak back in, then had it broken in
Monday night's 80-66 loss to Xavier.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut received 40 of a possible 43 first-place votes from
a media panel and had 1,072 points. That was 44 more than
Tennessee, now alone at No. 2 after being tied with Georgia last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia lost to Mississippi State in the semifinals of the
Southeastern Conference tournament and dropped to fourth. Louisiana
Tech, which has won 15 straight since a 90-63 loss to Connecticut,
climbed one spot to third.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut routed Providence in the season finale and began the
Big East tournament with a 44-point win over St. John's before
knocking off No. 17 Boston College in Monday night's semifinals.
Tennessee won the SEC tournament for the fourth time in five years,
beating Mississippi State 70-67 in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame moved up one spot to fifth and was followed by Texas
Tech, Penn State, Rutgers, UC Santa Barbara and Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech and Iowa State, which shared the Big 12
regular-season title with Oklahoma, each moved up one spot. Penn
State fell two places after losing to Purdue in the Big Ten finals.
</P>
<P>
   Duke went from 12th to 11th and Mississippi State's strong
showing in the SEC tourney sent the Lady Bulldogs from 17th to
12th. Then it was Purdue, Old Dominion and LSU, followed by Auburn,
Boston College, Oklahoma, Virginia and North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane, Arizona, George Washington, Oregon and Michigan
completed the Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (19-7), which has been in and out of the poll all
season, fell out again from No. 25 after splitting on a trip to Los
Angeles, losing to UCLA and beating Southern Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Marquette (22-6), 24th last week, dropped out after losing to
Alabama-Birmingham in the quarterfinals of the Conference USA
tournament. The Golden Eagles made the Top 25 for the first time
ever this season and had been ranked for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue matched Mississippi State for the biggest jump in the
poll with its move from 18th to 13th.
</P>
<P>
   LSU and North Carolina State both fell five places after losing
in the quarterfinals of their conference tournaments.

<HEADLINE> Court Says Martin Can Keep Riding  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Deciding in favor of Casey Martin, an
appeals court created precedent in nine Western states by ruling
that the PGA Tour is covered by federal disability law and must
provide carts to disabled golfers.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Monday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
entitles Martin, who suffers from a painful leg condition, to
continue using a cart during PGA Tour-sanctioned events.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first appellate level ruling in the country that
takes up the issue of whether walking is a fundamental part of the
PGA Tour's competition. It is binding within the area covered by
the 9th Circuit, but not elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling upheld a magistrate's 1998 ruling that
allowed Martin to become the first golfer to use a cart in PGA Tour
events. The court rejected the tour's argument that requiring
competitors to walk was an essential part of professional golf.
</P>
<P>
   ''The central competition in shot-making would be unaffected by
Martin's accommodation,'' Judge William Canby said in the 3-0
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''All that the cart does is permit Martin access to a type of
competition in which he otherwise could not engage because of his
disability. That is precisely the purpose of the ADA (Americans
with Disabilities Act).''
</P>
<P>
   He also cited a federal magistrate's findings that Martin has to
walk to about 25 percent of each course, which is not accessible by
cart, and that he suffers more fatigue during a cart-assisted round
than his competitors endure while walking.
</P>
<P>
   Roy L. Reardon, a lawyer for Martin, called the ruling ''a great
result for the millions of other disabled in the United States who
are simply looking, through the Americans with Disabilities Act,
for an opportunity to just participate.''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour said it was studying the ruling, and declined
further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome, a condition he has
had since birth, which restricts circulation in the lower part of
his right leg. Amputation is a possibility one day.
</P>
<P>
   He sued in 1997 after the PGA Tour refused to let him use a cart
in the final stage of its qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Thomas Coffin issued an injunction under the
ADA, which prohibits discrimination against the disabled in jobs
and public accommodations. Martin first used a cart on the PGA
Tour's satellite tour in 1998. He qualified for the regular tour
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruled that golf tournaments were covered by
the ADA and that Martin's cart was a reasonable accommodation that
would not change the ''fundamental nature'' of a tournament.
Accommodations that would change the fundamental nature of goods or
services are not required by the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   Canby noted that the general rules of golf do not require
players to walk, and that the PGA Tour allows players to use carts
on its senior tour and the early stages of its qualifying school.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was ample evidence to support Coffin's finding
that fatigue -- the reason for the PGA Tour's ban on carts during
tournaments -- was not a significant factor in golf, compared to
factors like stress and motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Because such questions are ''intensively fact-based,'' Canby
said, Monday's ruling is not a precedent for allowing a disabled
golfer to play a shorter course than PGA Tour competitors, or
giving a disabled runner or swimmer a head start.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Martin vs. PGA Tour, 98-35309.

<HEADLINE> Vikings to Marino: Let's Talk  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The thought of Dan Marino in purple is making
Miami Dolphins fans blue and must have Jeff George seeing red.
</P>
<P>
   The league's career passing leader is contemplating an offer to
join the Vikings next season after spending his entire 17-year
career in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Marino is expected to decide this week whether to accept the
one-year offer, according to two sources close to the quarterback
who spoke on condition of anonymity Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Marino would supplant George, who hasn't been offered a contract
despite going 9-3 in place of Randall Cunningham last season.
Marino would serve as a one-year mentor to Daunte Culpepper, the
Vikings' first-round draft pick last year.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dennis Green said the Vikings' quarterback-friendly system
would give Marino an opportunity ''to take one more crack at
winning a world championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Green also said the Vikings staff would travel to Florida, where
Cris Carter and Randy Moss live, to help prepare Marino for their
offensive system.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said Marino, who turns 39 this year, called him to say
he's considering the Vikings' offer.
</P>
<P>
   But Marino also is contemplating retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Marino became a free agent last month after voiding his contract
with Miami. The Dolphins then signed free-agent quarterback Jay
Fiedler to a three-year, $3.8 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Dolphins president Eddie Jones said for the first time
Monday that if Marino plays next season, the Dolphins want him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Danny has been told he can come back,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   George's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said he assumed all along the
Vikings would make a push for his client's return once they freed
up enough cap room. Steinberg said he was flabbergasted by the
Vikings' pursuit of Marino.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do I understand what's going on in Minnesota? No,'' Steinberg
said. ''Usually, when a guy goes 9-3 and takes his team to the
playoffs, the team tries to extend his contract very quickly. It
seemed like a marriage made in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's one on the rocks, at best. And Marino could make it a
nasty divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, meanwhile, has refused a big pay cut and probably
will be jettisoned June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who has not attracted much interest from other teams,
threw 12 touchdown passes and 17 interceptions in 1999, by far the
worst ratio of his career. He also missed five games and most of a
sixth because of a neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   In the playoffs, Marino led the Dolphins to a 20-17 victory over
Seattle in the first round. But the team was embarrassed 62-7 the
next week against Jacksonville, when the Dolphins trailed 38-0
before Marino even completed a pass in the most lopsided loss in
Dolphins history and the most miserable afternoon of his stellar
career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe Dan Marino deserves one more chance'' to go out on
top, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   But Minnesota isn't the quality destination it was just a short
time ago. Pro Bowl offensive linemen Jeff Christy and Randall
McDaniel recently joined rival Tampa Bay, and Green purged half his
coaching staff following a season of failed expectations and
spoiled team chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Marino is the most prolific passer in NFL history, having
completed 4,967 passes for 61,361 yards and 420 touchdowns, all NFL
records. But injuries have taken a toll, and Marino's quarterback
rating of 67.4 ranked 30th in the league last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way we would want Dan Marino unless we thought he
could really do a great job for us,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings haven't had the money to do much in the free agent
market. But Marino's agent, Marvin Demoff, had discussions with the
team on a contract that would fit within their tight salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg has been saying for months that George, who is younger
than Marino and already knows the offense, is willing to structure
a similarly cap-friendly contract.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said he turned down overtures from four other teams
because George said he wanted to return to Minnesota and they
thought a deal was just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a fabulous year and we just assumed they hadn't offered
anything because they had cap problems,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg isn't the only one miffed over Minnesota's flirtation
with Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Marino is perhaps the most popular athlete ever in South
Florida, and the possibility that he might soon be wearing a purple
jersey upset many Miami fans.
</P>
<P>
   The angry fans included Frank LaBosco, 68, who said the Dolphins
shouldn't let Marino get away.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've treated him like a dog,'' LaBosco said. ''Even if he
doesn't play this year, they should keep him around and teach the
kids coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   George Zucker, 75, said Marino should just retire.
</P>
<P>
   ''He should rest on his laurels,'' Zucker said. ''He's not going
to add to his stature any, and he's just going to get hurt. He
doesn't need it.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers Play Political Hardball  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER, AP Baseball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- Rafael Palmeiro and Kenny Rogers
remember the days when a Bush leaguer used to roam their locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they were recently talking about that guy.
</P>
<P>
   ''A couple of days ago, I asked Raffy who he was going to vote
for,'' the pitcher said. ''I said, 'You're going to vote for the
man, aren't you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the most popular subject at spring training is the NCAA
basketball tournament pool. But this year, a lot of Rangers have
good reason to take a keen interest in the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   The team's former owner, George W. Bush, is running for
president. The Texas governor is hoping a strong showing in the
Super Tuesday primaries will boost his bid for the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-dozen players remain from the days when Bush used
to regularly roam the same Gulf Coast locker room. They all said
they'd vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think it would be cool to know the dude in the White
House,'' pitcher Darren Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Rick Helling recalled Bush's easy manner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a rookie when he was here, and probably a majority of
owners wouldn't know who I was,'' Helling said this weekend. ''But
he was real personable and sociable. He still comes around once in
a while, and it's always like, 'Hey, Rick, how are you doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Said eight-time All-Star catcher Ivan Rodriguez: ''He's a great
guy. He'd make a good president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was part of the group that bought the Rangers in 1989. He
was active in the team's affairs, often watching from a front-row
seat at Arlington Stadium until he ran for governor.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush was elected in 1994, his interest in the club was
placed into a blind trust, and Tom Schieffer succeeded him as a
general partner. The team was sold to Tom Hicks in June 1998, and
Bush made about $15 million in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez won two AL home run titles in Texas when Bush's
main interest was baseball. Traded to Detroit in the offseason, the
slugging outfielder was talking to a friend over breakfast Sunday
about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looks you in the eyes when he's saying something,''
Gonzalez said at the Tigers' camp in Lakeland, Fla. ''That's
important to me. I know I can trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bush owned the Rangers, Gonzalez contributed $100 per RBI
to a Texas literacy program the future governor founded. The two
still visit a few times every year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a warrior. In my opinion, he's the best presidential
candidate, for the Republicans,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and Rodriguez both said they prefer Bush over
Republican rival John McCain and Democratic contenders Al Gore and
Bill Bradley. As residents of Puerto Rico, however, they cannot
vote in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, meanwhile, is talking up Bush to anyone who will listen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really hope he gets elected. You just get a good feeling
when you meet him,'' Rogers said. ''You see the other guys you have
to vote for and there's not even a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who joined Rogers on the Rangers in 1989, also prefers
the son of former President George Bush. The prospect of lower
taxes, especially in his bracket, pleases the All-Star first
baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see the things he's done in Texas and think he can
incorporate some of those things for our country,'' Palmeiro said.
''Plus, he's got good bloodlines. I've watched a little of the
debates, and I like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one problem for Palmeiro, who was born in Cuba but is now
an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not registered to vote,'' he said. ''I have to do it.''

<HEADLINE> MLB Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   While the rain wiped out all five exhibition games in
Arizona,
Kerry Wood threw curveballs on the sideline for the first time
since undergoing reconstructive elbow surgery last April.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wood, 22, threw to catcher Jose Molina from 55 feet Monday at
Mesa, Ariz., and was pleased with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went great,'' Wood said. ''I had no pain. I was surprised.
They were breaking pretty good, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood, the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year, missed last season with a
torn ligament in his right elbow. Until Monday, he threw only
fastballs and changeups.
</P>
<P>
   At Port Charlotte, Fla., Pedro Martinez pitched his first game
of the spring and looked nothing like the unhittable pitcher of
last September and October.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything went fine. Those are not the results I would
like,'' he said Monday after allowing three runs and three hits in
two innings as the Boston Red Sox lost to the Texas Rangers 13-6
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Using mostly fastballs, Martinez gave up a double, triple and
homer -- to Luis Alicea -- while throwing 32 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Martinez faced Ivan Rodriguez with one out
and a runner on third. The Rangers catcher edged Martinez for AL
Most Valuable Player last season when two writers left Martinez off
their ballots because they didn't think pitchers should get the
award.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez won this much less important matchup, getting Rodriguez
on a called strike on the outside corner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like challenges,'' Martinez said. ''Pudge is one of the
players I like to face, and he's going to be one of the players
that I want to face most of the time in spring training so I know
how to get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   At Winter Haven, Fla., Richie Sexson drove in four runs with a
home run and a double as Cleveland routed the Yankees 15-1,
dropping New York to 0-5 this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series champions have been outscored 49-16 and have
not held a lead in any game this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson's second spring-training homer came in the fourth off
reliever Mike Buddie. He added a two-run double during an eight-run
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Jaret Wright pitched two hitless innings in his spring debut.
Wright, trying to hang on to the fifth spot in the Indians starting
rotation, needed just 18 pitches to retire his six batters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though it's spring training, you like facing good teams,
and it's still the Yankees,'' Wright said. ''It's always good to
skate by that first one and get it out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perez, who struggled last year, was pounded for six runs
and five hits in two innings as the Los Angeles Dodgers were routed
by the Baltimore Orioles 17-3 in Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   After signing a $15.6 million, three-year contract, Perez went
2-10 with a 7.43 ERA last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first game,'' Perez said. ''I'm still working.
It's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Expos 11, Mets 6:
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Hideki Irabu pitched three innings in his
first start of the spring and had an RBI single in a seven-run
first. New York starter Bobby J. Jones failed to retire a batter,
allowing seven runs, six hits and three walks. Rondell White had a
two-run double and Chris Widger a two-run single before Irabu's
hit.
Braves 12, Blue Jays 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Dunedin, Fla., Tom Glavine pitched two hitless innings in his
first outing of the spring, and Brian Jordan homered off Gary
Glover. Toronto reliever John Bale was tagged for five runs,
including a three-run homer by Marcus Giles. Jeff Horn hit a
two-run homer for Atlanta in a three-run ninth off Lance Painter.
Astros 8, Cardinals 7:
</P>
<P>
   At Kissimmee, Fla., Daryle Ward, who has bounced between the
major leagues and the minors, hit his second home run in two days.
Ward, the son of former big leaguer Gary Ward, hit a solo home run
off reliever Mike Matthews in the seventh to put the Astros ahead
7-6. He homered Sunday off five-time Cy Young Award winner Roger
Clemens.
Pirates 11, Reds 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Bradenton, Fla., Aramis Ramirez, trying to win Pittsburgh's
job at third base, went 3-for-4 with a grand slam off Dennys Reyes
that capped a six-run seventh. Ramirez is 6-for-10 (.600) with
seven RBIs in his first three games this spring.
Phillies 5, Tigers 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Clearwater, Fla., shortstop Kevin Polcovich botched a
potential game-ending double play for Detroit's sixth error,
allowing two runs to score. Detroit made three errors in the ninth
inning.
Marlins 6, Royals 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Haines City, Fla., Josh Beckett, Florida's top draft pick
last year, pitched two hitless innings and Mendy Lopez hit a
three-run homer. Carlos Beltran singled twice and drove in two runs
for the Royals. Beltran has five RBIs in Kansas City's four games,
all losses.
Twins 4, Devil Rays 1:
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Brad Radke, the subject of trade rumors all
spring, allowed one run and three hits in three innings. Radke,
unable to get a multiyear contract by his Feb. 20 deadline, was
making his second outing of the spring. Tampa Bay's lineup was
missing Jose Canseco, Vinny Castilla and Greg Vaughn, who did not
make the trip from St. Petersburg.

<HEADLINE> Allergy Remedies May Impair Driving  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BERGSTROM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A drug common to over-the-counter allergy
medicines used by millions might affect drivers more than liquor,
suggests a study published today.
</P>
<P>
   University of Iowa researchers who tested 40 allergy sufferers
in a driving simulator found the standard dose of antihistamine
contained in Benadryl and similar medicines had a greater effect
than a few drinks on driving ''coherence,'' or the ability to match
the speed of the vehicle ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The antihistamine, diphenhydramine, also had an effect similar
to alcohol on steering stability and the likelihood of crossing
into the oncoming lane, according to the study in today's Annals of
Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were quite surprised to find that diphenhydramine may have
an even greater impact on the complex task of operating an
automobile than does alcohol,'' said Dr. John Weiler, a University
of Iowa medical professor. ''That sends a chilling message. You
would not want to be on the road when someone is driving at you who
is taking these.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also looked at a newer antihistamine, fexofenadine,
used in the prescription drug Allegra. The researchers said that
when it came to driving ability, fexofenadine was indistinguishable
from a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of Benadryl, Warner-Lambert Co., attacked the new
study as ''seriously flawed'' because it was partially funded by
Aventis, the maker of Allegra. Weiler strongly defended his work,
saying, ''I am not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in no way recommending that these medications be taken
off the market. Benadryl is an extremely effective antihistamine,
it is the side-effect profile that is disturbing,'' Weiler said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said more than 39 million Americans suffer from
hay fever and allergies and 4.8 million take prescription drugs.
Most go without treatment or take over-the-counter medications.
</P>
<P>
   These medicines often come with warnings that they can cause
drowsiness and should not be used while operating heavy machinery.
</P>
<P>
   National Highway Traffic Safety Administration researcher
Richard Compton said that there had been too little research on the
effects of allergy medications on driving safety and that people
often ignore warnings about mixing them with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   However, Compton said a study of blood tests on victims of fatal
crashes in the early 1990s suggested that antihistamine impairment
was far less prevalent than alcohol impairment.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa researchers had the allergy sufferers, ages 25 to 45,
report once a week over a four-week period to the driving
simulator.
</P>
<P>
   Each was tested once after being given the usual dose of
diphenhydramine; once with the usual dose of fexofenadine; once
with enough alcohol to produce a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.1
percent, the legal limit in some states; and once with a placebo
containing no medication or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Over a simulated 45-mile course on a two-lane rural road, the
machine measured participants' ability to match speeds as a lead
vehicle speeded and slowed, their ability to stay in their lane,
and their ability to avoid a crash when a vehicle pulled out from a
driveway in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Test drivers' following ability was significantly better after
they took alcohol or fexofenadine than after diphenhydramine.
Steering instability was greater with diphenhydramine or alcohol
than fexofenadine or placebo. The number of times they crossed into
the oncoming lane was twice as great after taking diphenhydramine
as after fexofenadine or placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler also pointed out that the participants' assessments of
how drowsy they were did not correlate with their performance,
suggesting that people who take antihistamines may not be able to
judge when they are impaired.
</P>
<P>
   The results did not surprise people who have taken over-the
counter allergy medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just zonk me out,'' Debbie Newton, a Mercerville, N.J.,
educational testing company employee. ''For each pill you have a
cup of coffee or a cup of cappuccino.''
</P>
<P>
   After a Greyhound bus crash killed seven people and injured 18
on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1998, the National Transportation
Safety Board blamed the sleepy driver's irregular work hours and
also said he was impaired by antihistamine.

<HEADLINE> FAA: More Planes To Crowd Skies  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of passengers boarding domestic
flights is expected to increase almost 53 percent by 2011,
according to a Federal Aviation Administration report that
forecasts future skies filled with more commercial jets, cargo
planes and private aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's annual forecast of trends in the aviation industry
during the next 12 years comes at a time when pilots and passengers
already are fighting congestion in the air and on the ground. The
report says commercial air travel will continue to expand through
2011 and fares will continue to fall if fuel price increases are
checked.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the nation's fleet of large passenger jets should
rise from 4,312 aircraft last year to 6,400 in 2011, the FAA
projected. The number of planes flying freight, express packages
and mail is to expand from about 1,000 now to 1,630, and the
general aviation fleet is to expand from 206,500 aircraft to
231,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something will have to be done. You can't simply expand
operations the way you have been expanding without encountering a
congestion problem,'' John Rodgers, director of the FAA office of
aviation policy and plans, said Monday at a prerelease briefing on
the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to have to add capacity (to handle more planes)
or the airlines are going to have to change their operations so
that the congested hubs will not play as big a part in their
expansion. I know the FAA hopes that it will be able to make some
changes to the air traffic control system.''
</P>
<P>
   Domestic boardings rose 3.8 percent last year to 576 million,
and annual increases in passenger growth are expected to average
almost 4 percent, reaching 880 million in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   International boardings are expected to rise even faster.
Boardings on U.S. air carrier flights abroad rose only slightly
last year to 53.3 million but are projected to climb by more than 5
percent a year through 2011.

   ''International passenger growth will exceed that of domestic
growth,'' Rodgers said. ''The Atlantic market will run about 4.3
percent per year. The Latin American market, which is going to be
very, very strong, will run about 6.1 percent. We expect the Asian
markets to recoup and again be in a growth mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Air fares, which have declined during the past decade, are
expected to continue to fall as new airplanes become slightly
larger and more fuel-efficient and carriers move to better manage
ticket sales and seating, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is that we still expect real prices -- the
fares that are going to be charged to passengers -- to decline by
about 1.3 percent per year during the forecast period,'' Rodgers
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the forecast, he said, does not factor in exorbitant fuel
prices, which in December 1999 were 43 percent higher than the
corresponding month the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Strong economies worldwide provided the aviation industry with
healthy revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits for U.S. commercial air carriers fell off last
year but are up for the decade of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Industry profits in 1999 totaled $8.5 billion, down from $9.3
billion in 1998. But during the decade, the air carriers posted $35
billion in operating profits. That's nearly double the total of
operating profits posted in the decade of the 1970s and the decade
of the 1980s, the FAA said.

<HEADLINE> No Gun Ri Compensation Talks Sought  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Korean survivors of an alleged mass killing by
American soldiers have hired a Holocaust compensation expert to
help press their demands for payment and an apology from the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   In a Washington news conference Monday, survivors and their
newly hired American lawyers said they believed the U.S. Army probe
into the 1950 killings in the Korean village of No Gun Ri is going
too slowly -- and that they fear it may whitewash the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Robert Swift, who has helped negotiate compensation for
victims of the Nazi Holocaust called on President Clinton to
appoint someone to begin negotiating with survivors and their
lawyers to confirm the facts of the case and negotiate compensation
and an apology.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a complicated situation,'' said Swift.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know who did the shooting, and we known who was killed ...
and we also know that these were unarmed civilians,'' he said,
arguing the alleged massacre is as clear-cut a human rights case as
Holocaust-era wrongs that the United States has been urging
Germany, Switzerland, Austria and others to own up to.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's one thing for the United States to lecture
Europeans on how to resolve Holocaust issues and another for it to
step up and say it wants to resolve its own problems,'' said Swift.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported in September that a dozen U.S.
veterans said their regiment's 2nd Battalion killed a large number
of civilians at No Gun Ri in July 1950, during the early days of
the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors say 400 were killed, including many cowering under a
railroad bridge.
</P>
<P>
   They had been telling their story for years, but their accounts
had been dismissed by officials in Washington and in Seoul. After
the AP report, however, both the U.S. and South Korean governments
began investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The Army said last fall that its investigation could take a
year, but officials have said since that they are hoping it might
be completed by June, when Seoul and Washington plan special
ceremonies to mark the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean
War on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're moving as fast as we can but don't know if we can be
done by June,'' Army spokesman Maj. Thomas Collins said Monday,
adding that the integrity of the investigation ''is paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army was ordered by Secretary of Defense William Cohen to do
a ''full and comprehensive determination of what happened,'' Collin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an extremely complex issue and one that is going to
take time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors said they feel that five months after the
investigators started, investigators still haven't spent much time
collecting their side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''American soldiers committed a cruel massacre in South Korea,''
Chung Eun-yong said through a translator, recounting how he lost
five family members, including a 2-year-old daughter and 5-year-old
son.
</P>
<P>
   He said investigators so far have only spent about 2 hours in
two separate meetings with survivors, never giving them
''sufficient time to explain all the things we wanted to.''

<HEADLINE> US Expanding Mozambique Debt Relief  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mozambique, devastated by catastrophic floods,
will receive expanded debt relief under a proposal being put
forward by the Clinton administration, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers was to announce today
details of the additional debt relief for the southeast African
nation, government officials said Monday, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Under various international and U.S. initiatives, officials
said, the country is already eligible for some debt relief.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the State Department, chafing under criticism of U.S.
relief efforts in Mozambique, rejected allegations that the United
States responded too slowly to the humanitarian crisis caused by
the widespread flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman James Foley said Monday that the critics should take
into account that many of the assets had to be redeployed from
Europe to southern Africa -- ''a major undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've deployed them as quickly as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics believe the response should have been faster,
noting that assets are still being deployed more than two weeks
after the flooding reached crisis stage.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique's former first lady, Graca Machel, spoke bitterly of
what many in southern Africa say were failures by the United States
and other Western powers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems the world has no conscience when it comes to human
life,'' said Machel, the wife of former South African President
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial round of flooding in early February, the U.S.
government concluded that regional search-and-rescue efforts would
be sufficient, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until February 25 that a second surge of water caused
rivers to overflow, a much greater disaster than had been initially
anticipated, he added.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Foley said, the U.S. Agency for International
Development activated a 24-hour operations center and begin
mobilizing the disaster assistance response team. He estimated AID
assistance to date at $12.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Congress' Budget Work Lags  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disputes among Republicans have slowed
Congress' budget work, despite promises by GOP leaders that
lawmakers would complete the task early this election year so they
could return home for re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders still want legislators to complete by
April 15 a budget for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1. But a full
month after President Clinton introduced his own $1.84 trillion
proposal for next year, neither chamber's budget committee has
produced a spending plan -- increasing the chance for yet another
October spending battle with Clinton, this one just weeks before
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for them to ante up, kick in,'' Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The slow pace on the budget tracks Congress' leisurely start
this year, in which recesses have been frequent and lawmakers have
seemed distracted by the two parties' presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The two budget committees might write initial spending plans as
early as this week. The budget is a tax and spending blueprint for
future, binding bills and does not require Clinton's signature.
</P>
<P>
   But first, House and Senate leaders will have to resolve
disputes between conservatives, who want to hold overall spending
for many programs to this year's level, and other Republicans, who
say more is needed to bolster defense, education and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over spending has symbolic importance for
conservatives eager to signal that the GOP remains fiscally austere
in this era of budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   But it has other implications as well. The more money Congress
spends now the smaller projected federal surpluses will be, and
smaller surpluses would leave less room for the tax cuts many
Republicans want -- including Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a leading
GOP presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   When it is finally written, the House's budget is likely to
propose a five-year tax cut of about $200 billion, about double
Clinton's proposal and half what Bush wants. It also will seek
about what the president proposed for education, defense and
biomedical research, say Republican aides speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's budget will be similar but is likely to offer a
slightly smaller tax cut than the House's.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the internal GOP fight is discretionary spending,
the one-third of the budget that Congress and the president
apportion every year. It covers all federal spending, from troops'
uniforms to cancer research, with the exception of Social Security,
interest on the national debt and other payments the government
makes automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives would like to hold discretionary spending to about
$586 billion, roughly what is being spent in the fiscal year that
runs through Sept. 30. That is about $35 billion less than Clinton
proposed.
</P>
<P>
   If spending is allowed to keep growing, said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, people in the future will look back and ask, ''Where are
the skid marks? Where did somebody try to put on the brakes?''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., argue that with a rough consensus for higher
spending for the Pentagon, education, biomedical research,
prescription drugs and other programs, neither Congress nor Clinton
would ever agree to limit next year's spending to this year's
total.
</P>
<P>
   They say the only realistic way for lawmakers to complete their
budget work quickly so they can go home for their re-election
campaigns is to push next year's discretionary spending closer to
$600 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some Republicans that I work with don't seem to know that
yet,'' Domenici said recently of the need to compromise on
spending. ''They think we ought to get our way.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, is among those trying to
hold spending down. He has even urged Lott to do so in the Senate
so that the eventual House-Senate compromise is not too high, Lott
said.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Rip Bush on Census  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats accused George W. Bush of
believing minority groups ''don't count'' because he is against the
use of statistical methods in the upcoming census.
</P>
<P>
   With voting booths opening today for key Super Tuesday
primaries, including states with high concentrations of minority
populations like California and New York, Bush's critics cited a
news conference Sunday in California in which a reporter asked his
position on sampling, a statistical method the GOP is generally
against.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, so am I. I think we need to count, an actual count. I
think we need to spend the money, make the effort and work hard to
get an actual count,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ''George W. Bush told American minorities, and millions of
American children, that in his eyes, they don't count,'' said Rep.
Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., ranking member of the House Government
Reform Committee's census panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''By stating that he is against using modern scientific methods,
Bush is clearly letting Americans know that, if elected president,
he would prevent the Census Bureau from releasing population data
that include more accurate information about America's minorities
and poor communities,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush has ''always said he
supports an actual count, and that the Census Bureau should do
whatever it takes, including providing the necessary funding, to
make sure every person in America is located and counted.''
McClellan declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, minorities comprise about 20 percent of the 32.7
million people in California, as well as 24 percent of the 18.8
million in New York, and 10 percent of the 6.1 million in
Massachusetts, another Super Tuesday state.
</P>
<P>
   About 2.9 million of the 19.8 million people in Bush's home
state of Texas are minorities. He has proved fairly popular with
minority groups there, winning just under half of the Hispanic vote
in his successful gubernatorial re-election campaign in 1998. That
was far better than his party did nationally in either 1996 or
1992, when Clinton racked up Hispanic majorities of 60 percent or
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also speaks fluent Spanish and has ran campaign commercials
targeting Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement with members from Hispanic, black, and
Asian-Pacific American census task forces in the House, Maloney
said Bush ''is now the only major candidate with an anti-minority
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Another GOP presidential candidate, Arizona Sen. John McCain, as
well as both Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore and
former Sen. Bill Bradley, have said they would release sampled
census data. Republican Alan Keyes is opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats contend sampling would do a better job of accounting
for the 1.4 percent of the population undercounted in the 1990
census. The Census Bureau estimates most of the undercounted were
minorities and inner-city residents -- populations that tend to vote
Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   States have the option of using either sampled, or raw,
non-sampled Census data to redraw congressional and state
legislative district boundaries. In general, the GOP opposes
sampling, fearing it could redraw political lines to their
disadvantage.

<HEADLINE> Religious Pledge To Promote Census  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Father Francisco Gonzalez knows the lengths
some illegal immigrants will go to hide their identities, so he
says it may be up to the familiar face of a parish priest to sway
the wary to put their names and addresses on a census form and mail
it back to the government.
</P>
<P>
   While it won't guarantee that the Census Bureau will get a more
accurate count in this year's enumeration, Gonzalez and another
religious leaders pledged Monday to do what they can to help, in
and out of the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Their involvement is part of the Census Bureau's aggressive
campaign to boost responses for the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   For Gonzalez, who is Episcopal Vicar for Hispanics for the
Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., that means assuring illegal
immigrants that census information is not shared with any other
federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will not come forward unless they really trust that their
names will not be given to some other government organization,''
Gonzalez said Monday at a news conference. ''We are working to
insure their confidentiality.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar messages will be spread in services at churches,
mosques, temples and synagogues around the country, said Rabbi
David Saperstein, director of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations.
</P>
<P>
   Mail response rates have declined from 78 percent in 1970, to 75
percent in 1980, to 65 percent in 1990, and census officials
estimate it will fall to 61 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Census data are used to redraw congressional and legislative
districts and to apportion billions of dollars in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Churches know that the census results could help people in their
congregations by getting money for local needs, such as a new
community center or more police, said Wade Henderson, executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stakes for our communities could not be higher,''
Henderson said. ''Religious leaders are the trusted gatekeepers in
many of these communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Census officials said 1.4 percent of the population was missed
in 1990, mostly children, minorities and inner-city residents.
Census Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt hopes enlisting the help of
religious leaders attaches a familiar face to the government's
message.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can make speeches, but it won't catch on unless I have the
help of those in the religious community,'' Prewitt said. ''Church
leaders are going to be up front with that task with passing along
the messages of tolerance and understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the country's 115 million households should have a
census form by the end of the month. They currently are being
delivered to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next month, religious leaders ''will encourage members
to fill out forms, will address the concerns and allay fears that
prevent some from responding,'' Saperstein said.

<HEADLINE> New Whitewater Prosecutors Hired  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert W. Ray, in the
final stages of the Whitewater investigation, has hired two new
prosecutors, including an attorney from a House committee that is
investigating the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ray announced Monday the hiring of Jennifer M. Safavian and John
S. Bowler.
</P>
<P>
   Safavian formerly was deputy staff director of the House
Government Reform census subcommittee. The full government reform
panel has spent years investigating the administration. Bowler
worked for the criminal division of the U.S. attorney's office in
Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's staff is in the process of closing out its investigation
and compiling final reports on various aspects of the six-year
probe of Whitewater-related land deals in Arkansas, the purge of
the White House travel office and the White House's improper
gathering of FBI background files on hundreds of employees and
presidential appointees from Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Headed by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., the committee has
investigated most of those matters and still is conducting hearings
into fund-raising improprieties during the 1996 Clinton-Gore
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Safavian worked for the committee since 1997, and conducted
inquiries into the Commerce Department's census operations. She
participated in negotiations with the administration to resolve a
dispute on the use of a technique known statistical sampling in the
2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Since October 1989, Bowler has been assigned to the general
crimes section of the U.S. attorney's office for the eastern
district of North Carolina. His responsibilities included organized
crime and drug enforcement, computer fraud and child pornography.

<HEADLINE> CIA Prepares Castro Psych Profile  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department is wondering about the
psychological toll on Cuban President Fidel Castro of his 41 years
as the uncontested ruler of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Monday the department asked the CIA last fall to
undertake a psychological evaluation of the Cuban leader. The
analysis has yet to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, asking not to be identified, said it is normal
for profiles of foreign leaders to be prepared from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   They also said there is curiosity among U.S. policy-makers about
how the aging process affects a leader who is 73 and who has spent
well over half his life in charge of his island.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has been asked from time to time about the possibility of
surrendering power. He once replied that revolutionaries don't
resign.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald, which first reported the State Department
request, said Saturday that it came to light after veteran CIA
analyst Brian Lately, now retired, said in Miami last month that he
was worried Castro seemed to be becoming more aggressive with age
instead of mellowing.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Lately contended that other communist leaders
have become more impulsive and adventuresome in their old age as a
means of reuniting themselves with their ''revolutionary roots.''
He called this phenomenon ''geriatric hyperactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   As examples, he noted that former Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung
launched the Cultural Revolution at age 73, former Soviet leader
Nikita Khrushchev deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba at age 68, and
his successor, Leonid Brezhnev, ordered the invasion of Afghanistan
in 1979 at age 72.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials declined to be specific about Castro's
behavior, several incidents last year are believed to have
contributed to the decision to update his psychological profile.
</P>
<P>
   One was a six-hour speech Castro gave on Cuba's national day,
July 26, that was devoted almost entirely to counternarcotics
issues. He followed that up days later with a seven-hour address on
migration issues involving the United States.

<HEADLINE> Japan Riveted by Mom's Murder Trial  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT STODDARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- With husbands working until late and rarely any
jobs of their own, Japanese women have long centered their social
lives on the tight, competitive circle of mothers at their
children's schools.
</P>
<P>
   That lifestyle, however, is under increasing scrutiny after a
Tokyo woman was accused of using her scarf to strangle a 2-year-old
girl in a public restroom late last year after an intense dispute
with the victim's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsuko Yamada pleaded guilty Monday on the first day of her
trial. The crime carries a maximum penalty of death. Despite the
guilty plea, the three-judge panel will continue to hear testimony
to help them decide a penalty. There are no jury trials in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Yamada's defense attorney said she confessed to killing Haruna
Wakayama last November after taking the little girl from a nursery
school playground in central Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I apologize for killing Haruna, who was totally innocent, and
causing sorrow for her family members,'' Yamada, a former nurse,
was quoted as saying by Kyodo News agency. ''I should not be
allowed to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has been closely watched in Japan, where it has raised
questions about the isolated lives of Japanese housewives. More
than 800 people waited in line to draw lots for 58 spectator's
seats in the Tokyo District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Yamada, 36, told the court she hated Haruna's mother because the
woman seemed to intentionally avoid her and to ostracize Yamada's
5-year-old son, media reports said. Both women had 2-year-old
daughters and 5-year-old sons who attended the same kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports speculated that Yamada planned the killing
because Haruna had been accepted by a prestigious kindergarten
while her own daughter was turned down. Yamada later denied that
was the motive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yamada's testimony had many searching for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe someone would kill a child. I don't know what
mothers are thinking these days,'' said Isao Sasaki, a 62-year-old
chef who lives in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   With Japanese husbands working long hours, many wives lead
cloistered lives at home, focusing on their kids and measuring
their own worth by the children's success in competitive entrance
exams.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deranged mental state that led to the murder was created
in the daily relationships among housewives living through their
children,'' the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper said in an analysis on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenge for the trial is to penetrate the deeply
troubled society of mothers that even produced the motive to
kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the slaying underlines how isolated women's lives
become when their husbands are workaholics. Although some married
women work, their careers are almost always subordinate to those of
their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors reportedly told the court Monday that Yamada said
she had tried to talk about her frustrations with her husband but

   They quoted Yamada as telling police she grew increasingly upset
over ''psychological clashes'' with Haruna's mother and believed
that by killing Haruna she no longer would have to socialize with
the woman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to murder, Yamada was charged with abandoning a
body, punishable by up to three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Yamada is suspected of stuffing Haruna's body in a bag, then
boarding a train to Shizuoka prefecture, or state, 95 miles west of
Tokyo, where her parents live.
</P>
<P>
   She allegedly dug a hole in the backyard of her parents' home
and buried the body. Three days later, she turned herself into the
police.

<HEADLINE> Senators 5, Bruins 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- In a game overshadowed by Boston's trade of Ray
Bourque, Shawn McEachern scored a pair of goals 45 seconds apart
early in the third period as the Ottawa Senators beat the Bruins
5-1 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, who was not uniform and not seen in the building, was
traded following the game to the Colorado Avalanche. In his nearly
21 years with the Bruins, Bourque -- an 18-time All-Star -- has never
been on a Stanley Cup winner.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa extended its unbeaten streak to six games (4-0-2).
</P>
<P>
   Vaclav Prospal had a third-period goal, the first of three
Senators scores in a 1:40 span. Sami Salo and Patrick Traverse had
the other two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Thornton scored for Boston, which took 26 shots at Ottawa
goalie Ron Tugnutt.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators, 4-0-1 against the Bruins this season, made it 1-0
when Salo's wrist shot from the left point broke through the pads
of goalie Robbie Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   Prospal scored off his own rebound when he pushed a one-handed
shot under Tallas' right pad at 3:38. McEachern then scored his two
goals, the first on a slap shot inside the left post. His second
came on a shot from the right circle that deflected off Tallas'
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Tugnutt has had past success against the Bruins, stopping 70
shots in a 3-3 tie at the Boston Garden on March 21, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque was saluted by a few fans carrying signs, and after the
Senators first goal some behind the Bruins goal chanted ''We want
Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the Senators' fourth goal, a water bottle came flying
towards the Bruins bench as a large number of the 15,836 fans
chanted ''We want Ray.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose Tuesday, reversing a decline,
when investors snapped up bargains. The U.S. dollar edged higher
against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues rose 147.89 points, or
0.75 percent, to close at 19,944.24. On Monday, the average closed
down 131.19 points, or 0.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was trading at 107.86 yen at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT)
Tuesday, up 0.28 yen from late Monday and also above its late New
York level of 107.53 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei stock average was down most of the day, falling as
much as 88 points in afternoon trading, on selling of high-priced
technology and telecommunications issues, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   However, investors started buying late in the afternoon on
sentiment that the three-day decline had gone too far, traders
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Selling pressure turned softer from the midafternoon,'' said
Shinichi Akazaki, senior trader at Kokusai Securities.
</P>
<P>
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section, 684 issues rose,
while 596 fell and 118 issues finished unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 697.06 million
shares, up from 673.76 million shares Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average slid 196.70 to
10,170.50 at Monday's close, wiping out nearly all of Friday's
202-point jump.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 15.70 points, or 0.95 percent, to close at
1,665.53. The TOPIX closed down 36.66 points, or 2.17 percent, the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot in the market was Mitsubishi Motors, whose
buyers outnumbered sellers at 413 yen (dlrs 3.8) per share in the
morning session, compared with Monday's finish of 333 yen (dlrs
3.1).
</P>
<P>
   The Nihon Keizai financial newspaper said Tuesday that
Mitsubishi is negotiating to sell DaimlerChrysler AG of Germany
about a 30 percent stake. A Mitsubishi spokesman refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar gained against the yen after
Taichi Sakaiya, chief of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, said
that any recovery in consumer spending in the January-March period
might be weaker than expected.
</P>
<P>
   There have been signs lately that the economy is improving, but
many officials remain cautious.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was trading at 103.30 yen, up from
103.26 yen late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7800 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7650 percent. Its price
fell 0.13 point to 100.16.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Gun Restrictions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking to break a stalemate over gun control
legislation, President Clinton is publicizing some troubling
statistics about youths and firearms at a meeting with lawmakers
today.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was citing Justice Department statistics showing that
the number of juveniles killed with a firearm increased sharply
between 1987 and 1993, while other types of homicide remained
constant.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton last week, lamenting that 13 children are killed by guns
every day in America, said he would meet with congressional leaders
to ''break the logjam'' on legislation to require gun safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is seeking legislation that would require safety locks
on guns, ban the import of large-capacity ammunition clips and
require background checks before buying a weapon at gun shows. The
House and Senate have passed separate versions of the bill but have
not come together on a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The president also is proposing a system of photo IDs for gun
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ''The single most important step we can take to reduce the
juvenile crime rate is to keep guns out of the hands of
juveniles,'' Bruce Reed, Clinton's domestic policy adviser, said on
the eve of today's White House meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics, culled from the Juvenile Offenders and Victims
1999 national Report, showed that the proportion of juveniles
killed with a firearm peaked at 61 percent in 1993. Since then, the
proportion has declined to 56 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that since 1980, one in four murders of
juveniles involved a juvenile offender. Nearly 38,000 juveniles
were murdered between 1980 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Columbine High School massacre, the House and
Senate passed differing bills designed to keep guns out of the
hands of juveniles and criminals. But lawmakers have been unable to
reach a compromise. Conferees last met in August.
</P>
<P>
   A key stumbling block has been changing an existing law that
allows people who purchase firearms at gun shows to bypass a system
of background checks.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version calls for a three-day waiting period, equal
to the waiting period imposed on people who purchase firearms at
stores. The House would require checks be completed in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said the administration supported the Senate version and
would be unwilling to compromise on that point. He said most checks
are completed within hours and that the extra time was needed in
cases where closer scrutiny was required.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-year-old was shot to death by a fellow first grader
in Michigan last week, Clinton asked the top Democrats and
Republicans on the House and Senate Judiciary committees to discuss
the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, their committees' ranking Democrats, sent a
letter to the judiciary committee chairmen, Sen. Orrin Hatch of
Utah and Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, urging action.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are baffled that the Senate-passed gun safety measures,
measures that represent an important first step in stopping this
gun violence epidemic, continue to lay dormant in a juvenile
justice conference that has not met since early August,'' they
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have accused Democrats of thwarting compromise for
political gain.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Bar in Seoul Provokes Anger  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Nazi flags emblazoned with swastikas
hang from the ceiling and photographs of Adolf Hitler adorn the
walls, along with Nazi propaganda posters and military insignia.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of the theme of a bar named ''Jae3JaeGuk,''
(pronounced J-sahm-J-cook), or The Third Reich, located in
Shinchon, a busy commercial district in downtown Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   There, young South Koreans frolic in dim light, sipping a rum
cocktail named ''Adolf Hitler'' that is served by waiters and
waitresses wearing mock black Nazi uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing political about the bar. I only want to
attract people's attention for business,'' said Hyun sae-woog, who
opened the place a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview late Monday, Hyun said he does not support
Hitler. His knowledge of the Nazi leader is limited to the
''killing of some Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   But the presence of the bar -- which has provoked angry protests
from Israeli officials and a Jewish group -- appears to be another
indication of how little some Asians know about the scale of the
atrocities the Nazis committed against Jews during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Taiwan, the owners of a restaurant that had
decorated its walls with pictures of Nazi death camps removed them
in January, shortly after The Associated Press reported that Jewish
and German residents considered the decor offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of ''The Jail'' restaurant in Taipei said they did
not realize the images might offend some customers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a trading company selling German-made electric
heaters designed a cartoon caricature of Hitler for ads in buses,
store windows and subway stations throughout Taipei. The posters
were immediately taken down last year after Jewish and German
residents complained.
</P>
<P>
   Like Taiwan, most South Koreans can describe in great detail the
massacres and other atrocities committed by Japanese troops who
controlled Taiwan, parts of China and the Korean peninsula during
World War II. But many understand little about what happened in
Europe during the war, including the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Only 1,500 Germans and fewer than 100 Israelis live in South
Korea, and that might be one reason why The Third Reich bar has
attracted little media attention.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul also is filled with many bars, and the Third Reich isn't
the first one to arrange its decor according to a controversial
theme.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, a bar called ''Gestapo'' near a U.S. Army base in
downtown Seoul changed its name after complaints by the German
Embassy and pressure by the Seoul government.
</P>
<P>
   But the Third Reich didn't draw attention until last month, when
the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a prominent Jewish human rights
organization based in Los Angeles, said that it wanted the bar
closed, calling it a ''virtual shrine to Adolf Hitler and Nazism.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The open existence of such an establishment mocks the memory
of millions of victims of Nazism,'' the center said in a Feb. 28
letter to Lee Hong-koo, South Korea's ambassador to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Embassy in Seoul also sent a protest letter to the
South Korean government in February. ''We are very disturbed. We
would prefer if the bar used a better example of history as its
theme,'' said First Secretary Ariel Shafransky at the Israeli
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the German Embassy in Seoul agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to highlight how intolerable it is, not only for
the German government but also for all the others, especially
Israelis,'' said Oliver Schramm, a German Embassy counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at South Korea's Foreign Ministry declined to comment.
However, Hyun said government officials visited him twice to try to
persuade him to change the bar's name and decorations.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is considering ''making some changes,'' but does not
understand why his bar is causing so much controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Local government officials said there is no legal ground for
them to crack down on the bar. The use of Nazi symbols is illegal
in Germany, but not in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went there twice and appealed to the owner to remove the
Nazi flags and photos, saying it could cause a diplomatic problem.
We got a positive response,'' said Yoo Myong-yeol, a local
government official.
</P>
<P>
   Customers' reactions vary.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a well-designed bar. The colors match, and the music
is good. That's all I care about,'' said Yo Sung-kwan, 25, a design
student who was at the bar Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyun admitted that some customers, especially Western
students from nearby universities, occasionally come to protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've sometimes made scenes. So, I decided not to take
foreign customers anymore,'' he said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John McCain claimed momentum but still wondered whether
there was ''enough time'' as presidential front-runners George W. Bush and Al

Bradley summarized his campaign, arguing it has reshaped the debate. Tuesday is
the busiest day yet of the primary season. With virtually every region of the

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After being left hanging longer than any other judicial

to a seat on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. President Clinton first
nominated Paez, 52, a federal judge in Los Angeles, in January 1996. He was
re-nominated in the next two sessions of Congress, and approved twice by the
Senate Judiciary Committee, but has been blocked by conservatives from getting a
vote on the Senate floor. That vote could come as early as Wednesday.

among youngsters. Along with performing routine procedures like measuring height
and weight, pediatricians should talk about issues such as gun safety, anger
management and gangs, and look for signs of poor self-esteem or depression that
could make a child prone to violence, the academy says. Doctors should start
even before a child is born, discussing with parents-to-be issues like guns in
the home, family stress and discipline.

Many Elderly Don't Get Cancer Test

''Medicare beneficiaries' use of colorectal cancer services falls far short of
recommended levels,'' says new study by the General Accounting Office, released

people may not be getting the screenings because they don't know Medicare covers

<HEADLINE> Judge Moves To Try Pinoche  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Three days after Gen. Augusto Pinochet
returned home after his house arrest in Britain, a judge asked a
Chilean court to strip the former dictator of his congressional
immunity so he could stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's request by Judge Juan Guzman was a step toward putting
Pinochet on trial for the killing and disappearance of 72
dissidents in the days following his 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the beginning of justice, which we have sought for so
long,'' said lawyer Hugo Gutierrez, who is marshaling several of
the lawsuits pending in Chile against Pinochet. The number of those
suits climbed to 66 Monday as lawyers filed five more complaints
alleging the wrongful death of a dozen people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The action by Judge Guzman means that he believes there is
enough evidence to have Pinochet tried'' in that case, Gutierrez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman has already indicted several other military officers,
including two generals, in the same case.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-member Santiago Court of Appeals would be the first to
rule on Pinochet's immunity, after which either side can appeal to
the Supreme Court. The process may take weeks, even months.
</P>
<P>
   Some have expressed concern that the military -- which still
strongly supports their former leader -- may apply pressure to abort
any trial.
</P>
<P>
   The military warmly welcomed Pinochet on Friday, and an army
statement vowed ''permanent support and solidarity'' for the
general. The actions were seen by many as a warning against
prosecuting the former commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Ricardo Lagos, a socialist who takes office on
Saturday, has vowed to resist any attempt by the military to
interfere.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Fernando Barros, a close associate of the former ruler,
warned that trying Pinochet would be tantamount to trying the armed
forces for their role in the coup and Pinochet's 1973-90 military
regime.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trying Gen. Pinochet will bring instability to the country,''
said Barros, a spokesman for Pinochet during most of his
confinement in London. ''The time has come to turn the page on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, meanwhile, rested at his heavily guarded Santiago
residence. He returned Friday from his 16-month detention in
Britain, escaping attempts by a Spanish judge who wanted to bring
him to trial for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman's request involves Chile's most prominent human rights
case: the so-called ''caravan of death'' of October 1973, when
military officers toured the country, dragging scores of dissidents
from jail, executing them or causing their disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official report, 19 of the dissidents lost to
the ''caravan of death'' remain unaccounted for while 53 were
executed. Gutierrez said the suit was filed against Pinochet
because ''it is clear that the caravan was sent by him and acted on
his direct orders.''
</P>
<P>
   An official Chilean report says 3,197 people died or disappeared
during Pinochet's 17-year regime, which started when he ousted
elected Marxist President Salvador Allende in a military coup.

<HEADLINE> Rock and Roll Hall Inductions  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was as rock and roll should be, as rock and
roll by definition must be: an evening of mongrel music.
</P>
<P>
   Motown, folk, jazz, rockabilly, gospel, rap, even ragtime -- all
claimed berths both overt and subtle at the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame inductions Monday night. And when Ray Charles dubbed it the
''Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame,'' you could argue that it wasn't a
mistake at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't really call it one thing. 'Rock and roll' is too
slim for what's going on tonight,'' Paul McCartney said as he
honored James Taylor, one of 14 musicians and groups tapped for the
hall's 15th annual inductions, a paean to memories and changing
times.
</P>
<P>
   The hall is about genealogy more than anything else -- isolating
a diaspora of sounds and inspirations and innovations, tracing them
to their sources, then stitching them together into a feel-good
tapestry of the age.
</P>
<P>
   It keeps track of a far-flung, sometimes rebellious family of
different hues and persuasions and prejudices -- and brings its
generations together.
</P>
<P>
   It is the family of the Moonglows, whose silky harmonizing was
pushed from R&AMP;B into the mainstream by rock pioneer Alan Freed and
whose song, ''Sincerely,'' inspired a young Paul Simon in 1955. ''I
want to know why it took so long,'' lead singer Harvey Fuqua said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the family of Bonnie Raitt, who traces 30 years of
blues-cum-rock to a desire to be the ''female Muddy Waters'' and
early emulation of Junior Wells and Mississippi Fred McDowell,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud,'' she said, ''to be a bridge between blues and
rock.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the family of Earth, Wind and Fire, the preeminent 1970s
R&AMP;B band that made, in the words of rapper Lil' Kim, ''music that
everybody needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We experienced pure magic together,'' original member Philip
Bailey said, flanked by band leader Maurice White, who recently
revealed he is suffering from Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   It is the family of Eric Clapton, already inducted as a member
of the Yardbirds and Cream, now entering on solo merits. ''Eric's
always been faithful to the blues,'' said guitarist Robbie
Robertson of The Band.
</P>
<P>
   Said Clapton: ''For me, it's about the music. I'm just the
messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the family of Lovin' Spoonful, whose 1966 hit ''Summer in
the City'' offered a 14-year-old boy named John Mellencamp an
anthem. ''The footnote to my heart and my brain and my soul was
that song,'' Mellencamp said before the group performed the
ragtime-influenced ''Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?''
</P>
<P>
   It is also the family of Billie Holiday and Nat King Cole, who
inspired countless singers who followed -- like Diana Ross, who
inducted Holiday, and Charles, who inducted Cole. ''He was my
beginning,'' Charles said. ''You study mathematics, I studied Nat
Cole.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is the family of five side men inducted for
behind-the-headliner contributions.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard these ''session men,'' though you may not know it:
Scotty Moore, whose guitar riffs shaped Elvis Presley's
''Heartbreak Hotel'' and ''Hound Dog.'' King Curtis, whose sax
brought punch and life to The Coasters' ''Yakety Yak!'' Hal Blaine,
who drummed on numerous doo-wop tracks and Beach Boys hits. James
Jamerson, the first and last word in Motown bass guitar. Earl
Palmer, whose drums ignited Little Richard's ''Lucille.''
</P>
<P>
   Inducted, too, was embattled record executive Clive Davis, who
founded Arista Records, helped Carlos Santana win eight Grammy
Awards last month and is now fighting to keep his job. Davis
credited the musicians he's encouraged with ''inflaming a passion
that I never knew existed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's strange to do what they did Monday night: take a form of
music that has always defined the moment and reflect upon it as
part of yesterday. To see the sinewy members of Lovin' Spoonful
matured into respectable middle-aged men, to see a clean-shaven
Eric Clapton suited up like a stockbroker at a formal dinner, is
jarring. It just seems too well-mannered.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't for young people,'' Taylor quipped after his
induction.
</P>
<P>
   ''What makes us feel old,'' said Earth, Wind and Fire member
Andrew Woolfolk, ''is when somebody comes up to us and says, 'My
Mama got all your records.'''
</P>
<P>
   But times change. Fuqua, of the Moonglows, knew that when he
offered, half-kidding, a bit of information far removed from the
era when the group was struggling against a world reluctant to
embrace its music.
</P>
<P>
   ''My Web site,'' he announced, ''is harveyfuqua.com.''

<HEADLINE> Protests Start Over DiCaprio Film  </HEADLINE>
By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A demonstrator wearing a Leonardo
DiCaprio mask faked ritual suicide Tuesday to protest what
activists call environmental crimes committed in making the
Hollywood star's latest movie, ''The Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest was performed before several hundred onlookers
outside the cinema where ''The Beach'' was to screen Tuesday night
for the first time in Thailand, where it was shot on location last
year.
</P>
<P>
   A flier said the mock suicide symbolized the sense of shame
DiCaprio should feel for taking part in a film opponents say
despoiled a pristine beach at Maya Bay on Phi Phi Leh island, part
of a Thai national park.
</P>
<P>
   Atsara Pithaksorayuth, a public relations officer for 20th
Century Fox, said the studio was expecting a full house of 600
viewers for the screening, each paying $5.40, double the usual
ticket price, to help raise funds for the blind.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is ironic that Fox is attempting to create a new image for
this movie by making a donation to charity,'' said Ing
Kanjanavanit, a foe of the film. ''We want the public to boycott
this movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie will be released to the public Friday on 92 screens
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a civil trial resumed against Fox and senior Thai
officials stemming from a lawsuit over damage allegedly wrought to
the beach by filmmakers' efforts to make the location more
cinematically beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Alex Garland's best-selling novel, ''The Beach'' tells
the story of a backpacking tourist who discovers a secret island
paradise inhabited by a few dozen other travelers. But their utopia
collapses into violence.

<HEADLINE> Sound Bites: Audio Reviews  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   ''Million Dollar Secret'' (Bullseye) -- The Johnny
Nocturne Band
with Kim Nalley
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the difference between the real thing and posers? Soul,
of course. The Johnny Nocturne Band has always had that, long
before the Gap started playing swing music in its ads and a host of
cigar-chomping, martini-swilling hepcats started copping moves
their grandparents invented.
</P>
<P>
   John Firmin's hard-swinging little big band has always been a
pleasure to hear, with its sizzling horn charts and killer
syncopation. But it just jumped up a notch or two to greatness with
the addition of Kim Nalley on vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Nalley sounds like she was born to sing with this band, and
together they make music so compelling that ''Million Dollar
Secret'' is a must have for any fan of jump blues, swing or vocal
jazz. Nalley sounds a little like Billie Holiday and a little like
Dinah Washington, but ultimately she sounds like no one but
herself, and she is spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Although this music is rooted in the legacy of Duke Ellington,
Count Basie and the honkers and shouters of the 1950s, there is
nothing nostalgic about it. It stands on its own, timeless and
evocative, bowing to the past but not enslaved by it.

   ''Infinite Possibilities'' (Epic/550) -- Amel Larrieux
</P>
<P>
   As part of rhythm-n-blues duo Groove Theory, Amel Larrieux
finessed listeners with her airy vocals and earth-daughter
presence. In her solo debut, she emerges as a smooth jazz princess.
</P>
<P>
   ''Infinite Possibilities'' is a dreamy trip, laid-back and cool.
It's not quite a jazz album, but it has the jazzy attitude of a jam
session. Solid lyrics underscore titillating instrumentals and
Amel's lovely voice. Lead single ''Get Up'' is a funky pick-me-up,
with a catchy melody and hopeful verses. ''i n i'' is an eclectic
mix of introspection and sentiment. Tunes like ''Down,'' ''Sweet
Misery'' and ''Searchin' for my Soul'' are mid-tempo delights,
perfect canvases for the amateur scat-artist.
</P>
<P>
   Title track ''Infinite Possibilities'' blows in like a
comfortable spring breeze, and mellow ballads like ''Make Me
Whole'' and ''Even If'' are liquid and quiet. Amel's light voice
holds a steady range, and she seems more at home with this
material. She also lends her considerable talents as producer and
musician on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''Infinite Possibilities'' is a soothing portrait of sweet love
and spiritual awakening. Amel Larrieux is a growing talent, and
well worth a spot in any CD player.
</P>
<P>
   --By Candice Y. Rigdon, Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
   ''Retarder'' (TVT) -- The Unband
</P>
<P>
   ''Too Much is Never Enough'' typifies The Unband's excessive
attitude on their TVT Records debut, ''Retarder,'' which is
boorish, sloppy but tightly played rock 'n' roll that manages to
maintain a groove and stay on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   How did The Unband become obstreporous louts whose fight for the
right to party results in such songs as the snakey retrogressive
''Rock Hard'' or the audacious strut of ''Get With You''? Perhaps
it's partly in reaction to the politically correct environs of
their hometown of Northampton, Mass., and nearby Amherst. But it's
probably just because The Unband can't say no to a good (bad) time,
as evidenced in ''Geez Louise,'' ''Ski Hat'' and ''The Jilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, ''Drink and Rock'' could be the next ''Once Bitten
Twice Shy,'' and The Unband's rumbling cover version of Billy
Squier's ''Everybody Wants You'' (complete with fingersnaps)
explains all.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices are higher in early trading,
propelled by interest in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is flirting with its first move above
the 5,000 level. That index was just over the 4,000 level as the

   The Dow Jones industrial average is up 16 points. Advancing and

<HEADLINE> Candidate Clinton casts first vote as New Yorker  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- Looking a tad sleepy, her hair unstyled,
Hillary Rodham Clinton got out of the house early today and cast
her first vote as a New Yorker. Her choice was no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I voted for Al Gore,'' said Clinton, the Democratic candidate
for U.S. Senate. ''I think he'd be the best president we could have
to begin this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived at 7 a.m. at Douglas Grafflin Elementary School,
where she greeted poll workers. Principal Michael Kirsch told her,
''We appreciate your coming early.'' She went to the poll before
school opened and was the 11th voter. The school is about 1{ miles
from her new home in Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
   After casting her vote, which only took 33 seconds, she told
reporters, ''It was great.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton had another New York first. She joined a
group of preschoolers and got her local library card at the
Chappaqua Library, complete with a special red and green sticker
that said: ''I got my library card today.''
</P>
<P>
   She also read a story to the youngsters, sang with them, checked
out a few home decorating books and ordered three boxes of cookies
from an enterprising Girl Scout.
</P>
<P>
   Library Director Mark Hasscarl said he invited her to join --
''though the story hour was her idea'' -- and her campaign invited
the press to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, perched on a tiny chair in the reading room, read Eric
Carle's ''The Very Hungry Caterpillar'' to 18 kids, all under 6,
and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the book open for all to see, the first lady added
occasional commentary to the tale of a caterpillar that chomps its
way through one apple, two pears, three plums and more to get ready
for its transformation into a butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's as small as my finger!'' Clinton said. ''Look at what
he's eating!''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, she joined the youngsters in song, including ''The
Itsy-Bitsy Spider'' -- complete with hand gestures -- and ''Old
MacDonald.''
</P>
<P>
   After signing a copy of ''Goodnight Moon'' for a young fan,
Clinton repaired to the library's home decorating section and
leafed through several books before settling on five to check out,
including ''Know Your Collectibles,'' ''The Country House'' and
''Sculpture of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   It was while she was browsing that she was approached by Girl
Scout Katharine Bierce, of Mount Kisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''I checked with the Secret Service man and first he said wait,
and then he said it would be OK,'' the 11-year-old said afterward.
''And then when I asked Mrs. Clinton, she said, 'Oh, sure.'''
</P>
<P>
   One box each of Thin Mints, Do-Si-Dos and Trefoils, costing a
total of $9, will be delivered next month to the Westchester White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Bierce has now sold 135 boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton appeared on ''Lifetime Live'' on the Lifetime
cable network and spoke again of how much she enjoys grocery
shopping in Chappaqua after seven years in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel a little like Rip Van Winkle,'' she said. ''There are
things I haven't seen before on the shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she would recommend a career in politics for her
20-year-old daughter, Chelsea Clinton, she said: ''Well, I think
that will be up to her. I hope she makes the best decision she
can.''
</P>
<P>
   And while she repeated her support for gun control measures
including child-safety locks, she said she would not impinge on
hunters and others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody wants to take guns away from law-abiding hunters and
sport-shooters,'' she said. ''But there are just too many guns in
this country that fall into the wrong hands.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Hits 5,000; Dow Off 250.99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index barreled past 5,000
for the first time today as investors once again snapped up shares
of technology stocks. The Dow Jones industrials fell sharply due to
a steep drop in Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq moved as
high as 5,006.78 before slipping back below its new milestone. It
was trading up 87.96 at 4,992.81.
</P>
<P>
   The index, which has soared in recent months as investors
embraced the technology stocks that dominate its ranks, was making
its first trip past 5,000 just over two months after its first
close above 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were down sharply. The Dow was down
250.99 at 9,919.51, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down
down 17.81 at 1,373.47.
</P>
<P>
   Some familiar names helped propel the Nasdaq to its new heights
today. Microsoft rose 6 to 96|. JDS Uniphase was up 5 15/16 at 299,
and Oracle was up 3 3/16 at 78 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   In a bet that technology stocks are best prepared to thrive even
if the Federal Reserve continues raising interest rates this year,
investors have flocked to those shares at the expense of nearly
every other corner of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the year, the Nasdaq has risen nearly 23
percent, while the blue-chip Dow has tumbled nearly 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Dow was dragged down by Procter &AMP; Gamble, which
tumbled 29 to 58 7/16 after issuing a disappointing earnings
forecast. Interest rate-sensitive American Express, down 4 3/16 at
125 1/16, contributed to the Dow's drop, as did retailer Wal-Mart,
down 2 to 47{.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 161.18 million
shares, ahead of Monday's early pace. Breadth was much better on
the Nasdaq, with eight stocks rising for every five that fell.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.94 to 605.58.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.8 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was up 1.8 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.04 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
up 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> McCain's New York chief looking for surprise  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Polls opened early today in parts of New
York where even some of George W. Bush's backers say John McCain
could do well, a situation that could give the senator from Arizona
a little more help in a state his backers consider crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of New York's primary elections, the polls
opened this morning at 6 a.m. in New York City, on Long Island, in
three suburban counties just north of the city -- Westchester,
Orange and Rockland -- and in the Buffalo area.
</P>
<P>
   Polls open in the rest of the state open at noon and all of them
close at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain camp believes New York City and its suburbs are
particularly fertile ground for their insurgent-style campaign.
Some Bush backers in New York agree with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the primary, McCain's New York campaign chief,
Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, predicted victory for
the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we may surprise a lot of people with the results
tomorrow night,'' Molinari said Monday, adding that New York is a
must-win for the senator in his battle against the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's New York campaign chief, Gov. George Pataki, refused to
make a prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hopeful that Governor Bush will win tomorrow,'' Pataki
said Monday. ''I have no greater information than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of a host of states, including most of New
England, California and Ohio, holding primaries Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A Marist College Institute for Public Opinion poll conducted
Sunday and Monday showed Bush with 49 percent and McCain with 44
percent among registered Republicans who expected to vote today -- a
statistical dead heat. It mirrored other recent polls showing the
two men locked in a tough battle.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-three GOP delegates are at stake in New York's primary.
Another eight unpledged delegates will be selected later by state
party leaders. Almost all will likely be in the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, polls have all shown Vice President Al
Gore with almost 2-1 leads over former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, a one-time Hall of Fame player with the New York Knicks
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Marist pollsters found Gore with a 53 percent to 40 percent lead
over Bradley among registered New York Democrats who said they
expected to vote today.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bradley's top New York backer, Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, spoke Monday as if that race was already over.
</P>
<P>
   ''He fought handsomely, gallantly and right to the end,''
Moynihan said. ''And that is how you measure a person's quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic voters in New York will be electing 158 pledged
delegates today with another 85 pledged delegates chosen later by
party leaders based on the primary's popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   New York has a closed primary where only party members can vote
in the respective primaries.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, New York voters get to cast ballots
directly for the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, things are more complicated. Voters only
cast ballots for prospective national convention delegates in each
of the state's 31 congressional districts. In effect, there are 31
separate GOP mini-primaries with three delegates at stake in each
congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   There is another wrinkle that McCain backers believe will help
them. While each congressional district elects three delegates,
each contains a different number of enrolled Republicans, and
Democrats. For instance, in Long Island's 3rd Congressional
District represented by Republican Peter King, who recently
switched his allegiance from Bush to McCain, there are 182,651
enrolled Republicans. But in Brooklyn's 11th Congressional
District, represented by Democrat Major Owens, there are just
15,872 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the minority districts where you don't have a lot of
Republicans, you also don't have a lot of Republican
organization,'' Molinari said. ''We do have key people who live in
those neighborhoods and a delegate there counts as much as in the
most populous Republican areas in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Pataki and virtually the entire state GOP hierarchy are
backing Bush, most of his delegate slates in big Republican areas
are populated with well-known GOP figures. McCain slates generally
contain names little known to most voters. That is also the case,
however, for Bush slates in areas of the state where there are few
Republicans, including parts of heavily Democratic New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, I feel comfortable that we're going to win a
majority of the districts,'' Molinari said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Marist College telephone poll quizzed 184 registered
Republicans and 136 Democrats who said they would vote today in New
York's presidential primary. The margin of error was 7.5 percentage
points for the Republicans and 8.5 percentage points for the
Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Rock Hall induction -- music, nostalgia and far-flung family  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was as rock 'n' roll should be, as rock 'n'
roll by definition must be: an evening of mongrel music.
</P>
<P>
   Motown, folk, jazz, rockabilly, gospel, rap, even ragtime -- all
claimed berths both overt and subtle at the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame inductions Monday night. And when Ray Charles dubbed it the
''Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame,'' you could argue that it wasn't a
mistake at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't really call it one thing. 'Rock 'n' roll' is too
slim for what's going on tonight,'' Paul McCartney said as he
honored James Taylor, one of 14 musicians and groups tapped for the
hall's 15th annual inductions, a paean to memories and changing
times.
</P>
<P>
   The hall is about genealogy more than anything else -- isolating
a profusion of sounds and inspirations and innovations, tracing
them to their sources, then stitching them together into a
feel-good tapestry of the age.
</P>
<P>
   It keeps track of a far-flung, sometimes rebellious family of
different hues and persuasions and prejudices -- and brings its
generations together.
</P>
<P>
   It is the family of the Moonglows, whose silky harmonizing was
pushed from R&AMP;B into the mainstream by rock pioneer Alan Freed and
whose song, ''Sincerely,'' inspired a young Paul Simon in 1955. ''I
want to know why it took so long,'' lead singer Harvey Fuqua said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the family of Bonnie Raitt, who traces 30 years of
blues-cum-rock to a desire to be the ''female Muddy Waters'' and
early emulation of Junior Wells and Mississippi Fred McDowell,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud,'' she said, ''to be a bridge between blues and
rock.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the family of Earth, Wind and Fire, the pre-eminent 1970s
R&AMP;B band that made, in the words of rapper Lil' Kim, ''music that
everybody needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We experienced pure magic together,'' original member Philip
Bailey said, flanked by band leader Maurice White, who recently
revealed he is suffering from Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   It is the family of Eric Clapton, already inducted as a member
of the Yardbirds and Cream, now entering on solo merits. ''Eric's
always been faithful to the blues,'' said guitarist Robbie
Robertson of The Band.
</P>
<P>
   Said Clapton: ''For me, it's about the music. I'm just the
messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the family of Lovin' Spoonful, whose 1966 hit ''Summer in
the City'' offered a 14-year-old boy named John Mellencamp an
anthem. ''The footnote to my heart and my brain and my soul was
that song,'' Mellencamp said before the group performed the
ragtime-influenced ''Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?''
</P>
<P>
   It is also the family of Billie Holiday and Nat King Cole, who
inspired countless singers, including Diana Ross, who inducted
Holiday, and Charles, who inducted Cole. ''He was my beginning,''
Charles said. ''You study mathematics, I studied Nat Cole.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is the family of five side men inducted for
behind-the-headliner contributions.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard these ''session men,'' though you may not know it:
Scotty Moore, whose guitar riffs shaped Elvis Presley's
''Heartbreak Hotel'' and ''Hound Dog.'' King Curtis, whose sax
brought punch and life to The Coasters' ''Yakety Yak!'' Hal Blaine,
who drummed on numerous doo-wop tracks and Beach Boys hits. James
Jamerson, the first and last word in Motown bass guitar. Earl
Palmer, whose drums ignited Little Richard's ''Lucille.''
</P>
<P>
   Inducted, too, was embattled record executive Clive Davis, who
founded Arista Records, helped Carlos Santana win eight Grammy
Awards last month and is now fighting to keep his job. Davis
credited the musicians he's encouraged with ''inflaming a passion
that I never knew existed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's strange to do what they did Monday night: take a form of
music that has always defined the moment and reflect upon it as
part of yesterday. To see the sinewy members of Lovin' Spoonful
matured into respectable middle-aged men, to see a clean-shaven
Clapton suited up like a stockbroker at a formal dinner, is
jarring. It just seems too well-mannered.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't for young people,'' Taylor quipped after his
induction.
</P>
<P>
   ''What makes us feel old,'' said Earth, Wind and Fire's Andrew
Woolfolk, ''is when somebody comes up to us and says, 'My Mama got
all your records.'''
</P>
<P>
   But times change. Fuqua, of the Moonglows, knew that when he
offered, half-kidding, a bit of information far removed from the
era when the group was struggling against a world reluctant to
embrace its music.
</P>
<P>
   ''My Web site,'' he announced, ''is harveyfuqua.com.''

<HEADLINE> Wife admits to role in husband's murder plot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) -- Showing no emotion, a woman told a judge
she convinced a co-worker with a crush on her to kill her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Montstream of Clarkson, west of Rochester, could get 20
to 41 years in prison after pleading guilty Monday to first-degree
manslaughter, second-degree criminal facilitation and second-degree
possession of a weapon in the case.
</P>
<P>
   She will be sentenced June 9 in the murder of her husband, John
Montstream, 37, a choir director. Several of his relatives were in
court Monday to hear the plea.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara County prosecutor Tim Lundquist said Mrs. Montstream's
exact role in the killing remained unclear. The woman who coolly
went on television to plea for help in finding her husband's killer
showed no emotion or remorse in court.
</P>
<P>
   She had told police that her husband of 15 years wouldn't grant
her a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband's decomposing body was found June 30, 1998, in his
minivan in a Niagara Falls parking garage. The father of two had
been shot once in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Mrs. Montstream talked Michael Northrup, 28, of
Caledonia into killing her husband. He was charged with
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Montstream's plea came after county Judge Peter Broderick
admitted her six-page police statement into evidence. Jurors were
to be selected for her trial next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said she asked Michael Northrup to kill her husband and
she took part in transporting a vehicle to Niagara Falls so Michael
Northrup could use it as a getaway vehicle,'' Lundquist said.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons charge was for being an accomplice in the possession
of a weapon, he said. Montstream had also faced a conspiracy
charge, which was dropped in the plea agreement, Lundquist said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Montstream also must testify against Northrup, a co-worker
who she said had a crush on her. He was free on bail until his
trial May 1.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, John Parrinello, said he was unsure how Montstream's
plea might affect his case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her credibility was always suspect,'' he said. ''And her
admitted culpability in exchange for benefits always causes one to
wonder what part of it is truthful and what isn't.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of second-degree murder, Montstream would have
faced a maximum 25 years to life in prison. The promised sentence
means she will be sentenced consecutively for her three
convictions.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls From 5000; Dow Off 235  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks wavered in volatile trading today,
sending the Nasdaq composite index past 5,000 for the first time
and the Dow Jones industrials plunging on a steep drop in Procter &AMP;
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was up 22.73
at 4,992.81. Shortly after the session began, the index soared more
than 100 points to 5,006.78 before pulling back on profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was down 235.47 at 9,935.03, having regained some ground
from an earlier 351-point drop, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was off 13.91 at 1,377.37.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble plunged 25 11/16 to 61}, accounting for much of
the Dow's drop. The consumer goods company said earnings in the
second half of its fiscal year will miss expectations, citing
higher costs of pulp and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rate-sensitive American Express, down 3 11/16 at 125
9/16, also contributed to the Dow's drop, as did retailer Wal-Mart,
down 1 11/16 to 47 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which has surged in recent months as investors
embraced the technology stocks that dominate its ranks, made its
first trip past 5,000 just over two months after its first close
above 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Nasdaq's incredible gains have left it
vulnerable to investors eager to collect some profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq has a history of having trouble pentrating major
new barriers,'' said Robert Stovall, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ''There's a strong impulse to take profits, because it
seems unbelievable that this thing can keep running.''
</P>
<P>
   Some familiar names helped propel the Nasdaq to its new heights
today. Microsoft rose 4| to 95\ following a positive report from a
Goldman Sachs analyst. JDS Uniphase was up 3 15/16 at 297, and
Oracle was up 2 7/16 at 78 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   In a bet that technology stocks are best prepared to thrive even
if the Federal Reserve continues raising interest rates this year,
investors have flocked to those shares at the expense of nearly
every other corner of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone is crowding into technology, and money continues to
flow out of the rest of the market,'' said Stovall.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the year, the Nasdaq has risen nearly 23
percent, while the blue-chip Dow has tumbled nearly 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 421.11 million
shares, ahead of Monday's pace. Breadth was much better on the
Nasdaq, with four stocks rising for every three that fell.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.42 to 600.22.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices were mixed at midday.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond was down \ point,
or $2.50 per $1,000 in face value, around midday, while its yield
rose to 6.16 percent from 6.14 percent late Monday. Prices and
yields move in opposite directions.

One-year yields remained unchanged at 6.19 percent as the discount
held at 5.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Move Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices slipped marginally in
early dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans were pressured by the gradual approach of storm systems
expected to bring rain to the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The downside was limited, however, by expected harvest delays
this week in central Brazil. Soybeans also found some support from
a rise in soyoil futures that was prompted by a surge in buying by
commodity funds.
</P>
<P>
   Corn was little changed in choppy trading.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices edged lower amid improved crop conditions in Kansas
and Oklahoma, the heart of the winter wheat belt which accounts for
70 percent of U.S. wheat production.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell \ cent to $2.60\ a bushel; May corn
fell \ cent to $2.28{ a bushel; May oats fell \ cent to $1.18{ a

</P>
<P>
   Beef futures were lower in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, while pork futures were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle fell .28 cent to 72.57 cents a pound; April
feeder cattle fell .25 cent to 84.70 cents a pound; April lean hogs

<HEADLINE> Boeing Slows Deliveries of Jets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co.'s manufacture and delivery of
jetliners, already slowed due to labor strife, will be further
delayed as the company replaces substandard fasteners on a number
of planes.
</P>
<P>
   The fasteners, made from an aluminum alloy that makes them prone
to cracking, were installed on wings, engine housings and parts of
the fuselage in planes that entered Boeing's Seattle-area
production lines since December, company spokesman Yvonne Leach
said today.
</P>
<P>
   The company also determined that 20 aircraft currently in
service may also have defective fasteners. The fasteners on all 20
planes -- which are 737, 757 and 777 jets -- have been tracked down
and are all located in the planes' engine housings.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials would not identify the airlines involved.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reports of fastener failures. Boeing met
Monday with the Federal Aviation Administration, which determined
that the problem will not pose a safety threat, Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There would have to be at least four different things that
would have to go wrong to even have a slight failure,'' Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   On the production lines, all Boeing models are affected except
the 100-seat 717 jetliner, produced in Long Beach, Calif., Leach
said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 330,000 of the fasteners were delivered to Boeing in
November and December by a unit of Cordant Technologies Inc. of
Salt Lake City. A cracking problem has occurred in ''collars'' used
to help secure bolts to the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Sides, a spokeswoman for Cordant, said the company
received the wrong alloy from one of its suppliers. The difference
in metals only became apparent through heat testing, she said. The
company is working with its suppliers and its customers to track
the defective parts.
</P>
<P>
   Sides said Cordant sent defective fasteners to other
manufacturing customers, but she would not identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a preliminary assessment, Leach said, Boeing officials
expect to be able to complete repairs and meet contractual
commitments for delivery of the planes involved. She said the
entire process of tracking down and removing the defective
fasteners could take ''a couple weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Deliveries have been curtailed by a strike of 17,000 union
engineers and technical workers that began Feb. 9. Talks broke down
Feb. 27 in the dispute over wages and benefits. Boeing declared an
impasse last week and imposed terms of its latest offer Monday,
calling on strikers to return, but few did so.

<HEADLINE> Web Fans Rally for TV's 'Get Real'  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Clear across cyberspace, a message resounds:
''The eight will be great!''
</P>
<P>
   As catch phrases go, this may not pack the punch of ''Fifty-four
forty, or fight!'' or even ''Lose 30 pounds in 45 days!''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Fox family drama ''Get Real'' returns Wednesday at
9 p.m. EST for its eight-week, do-or-die run, a Web-rallied brigade
called the Get Realists will be beating the drums as never before
to save the struggling series.
</P>
<P>
   Hear them? ''The eight will be great!''
</P>
<P>
   The Get Realists are the latest example of how viewers can tap
the Internet to share their passion for a TV show -- and forge a
connection with that show beyond just watching it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has brought us together,'' says Bob Grippo, a data
processor in Elmont, N.Y., who coined the group's current battle
cry.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign began right after the show's Sept. 8 premiere, when
a handful of ''Get Real'' initiates logged onto its Fox-run
''official'' Web site. Their enthusiastic posts declared them
charter fans of this multigenerational drama about the lively,
often troubled Green household.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled? The wonderful ''Get Real'' was quickly in trouble,
too. Crushing competition such as ''The West Wing'' and ''Drew
Carey'' meant most Nielsen families were tuned elsewhere at that
hour. It had dismal ratings and little prospect for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Or did it?
</P>
<P>
   ''A small group of us, maybe five, were going, 'C'mon, this show
just cannot be canceled','' Grippo remembers. ''We became friends
very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Internet is a great place,'' observes another ''Get Real''
fan, Becky Thursam. ''It gets people together who ordinarily
wouldn't meet in person.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursam had checked out ''Get Real'' only because of its star,
Debrah Farentino, but she immediately liked it. ''The show struck a
chord in me,'' she says by phone from East Lansing, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   A nursing major at Michigan State University and the self-taught
designer of a Debrah Farentino Web site, Thursam volunteered to
build a ''Get Real'' fan site. In days it was up and running
(http://members.aol.com/getrealfanclub/).
</P>
<P>
   As with scores of other sites devoted to TV series,
''getrealfanclub'' features cast photos, an episode guide, a
200-plus membership roll.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also this site-specific call to arms: ''Keep telling
your family and friends, tell your next-door neighbor, have your
mom discuss the show at the PTA meeting, put up fliers in the
community center -- anything that will get the show recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: Reach out to Fox execs with e-mail and petitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something we monitor and definitely pay attention to,''
vows Fox network boss Doug Herzog, who has stuck with ''Get Real,''
bringing it back from February Sweeps exile in part because of its
Web faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a small but dedicated group,'' he says of the Get
Realists. ''They let us know there is something going on out there.
They helped keep hope alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really cool,'' says cast member Jesse Eisenberg, who
occasionally visits the Web site and gets a kick from reading the
enthusiastic posts. With that sort of affirmation, ''you can really
save money on psychiatrists,'' he quips.
</P>
<P>
   Playing nerdy Kenny Green, the 16-year-old actor will be
showcased this week when his character contracts a life-threatening
illness. By the end of the hour, he can expect to find kudos on the
''Get Real'' message board.
</P>
<P>
   ''I come from a theater background in New York,'' Eisenberg
says. ''There, if the reviews are good, you stay open. On TV,
reviews matter less; it's more about ratings. But if you build a
fan base you can build ratings. The Web site really helps.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''Get Real'' stars not only track the efforts of the Get
Realists, but also cheer them on.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Hathaway (who plays Meghan, Kenny's big sister) has typed
in her thank yous, and Grippo reports that Eric Christian Olsen
(who plays Kenny's freewheeling older brother Cameron) posted a
message that likened the Get Realists' devotion to the unrelenting
spirit of the Maccabees two thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A little more recently, CBS' Western melodrama ''The Magnificent
Seven'' spurred some 100 faithful to wage an e-mail campaign and
even pony up $1,000 for an ad in Daily Variety (''Return Winning
Show to Viewers!'').
</P>
<P>
   CBS heard this plea of two years ago and, indeed, the series was
back on the air the following winter. Unfortunately, after those
few weeks' reprieve, ''Magnificent'' was done in for good by
continued low ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, boosted by its e-support, can ''Get Real'' finally catch on
with viewers and win a second-season pickup?
</P>
<P>
   ''The next eight weeks are critical,'' says Thursam. But as any
Get Realistic will tell you, if enough watch those eight, well,
that would be great!

<HEADLINE> German Banks Discuss Cooperation  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Deutsche Bank AG, the world's largest
banking company, said it is in talks about closer cooperation with
Germany's third biggest bank, Dresdner Bank AG, amid speculation
they were discussing a merger.
</P>
<P>
   The banks declined to elaborate but their confirmation today of
the talks fueled speculation that they were working on a merger
that would create a banking company with more than $1.2 trillion in
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank alone is now the largest banking company in the
world with $840 billion in assets. Three Japanese banking giants
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan
agreed in August to merge by 2005, creating a bank with just over
$1 trillion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Manager magazine reported in an advance copy of this
month's edition that the Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank will
merge.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both banks continued talks on the potential
deal today and were planning special simultaneous, but separate,
supervisory board meetings Wednesday. The banks scheduled a joint
news conference Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can be the case that a merger announcement could come this
week, but it is still unclear where they stand in the negotiations,
although it's obviously advanced,'' said Volker von Kruechten, an
analyst with BHF Bank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Kruechten said the deal has its roots in both banks' ambitions
to join the top echelon of global investment banks and asset
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are both already major world players in asset management
and investment banking. But a merger would put them into the top 5
league,'' he said, noting that the two banks control only 10
percent of Germany's retail banking market.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union Commission -- which regulates business in the
15-member EU -- confirmed the banks had approached its merger unit
today.
</P>
<P>
   While spokesman Jonathan Faull said it isn't yet clear whether a
merger would come under EU scrutiny, it would depend on the size of
the combined companies' income.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, they are two large German banks and also banks with
large activity outside Germany,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank in particular has been aggressive about expanding
overseas and is rumored to be interested in Portugal's Banco Pinto
e Sotto Mayor and South Korea's KorAm Bank. It has also battling
for control of Poland's fifth largest bank, BIG Bank Gdanski. Just
last year, it acquired the U.S. banking company Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of merger talks with Dresdner came just as Deutsche Bank
signed an agreement today to bankroll the industrial holdings of
Moscow-based AFK Sistema.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank is one of the major western creditor banks in
Russia, and presided over the restructuring of $32 billion of
private loans extended to the former Soviet Union by private
Western creditors.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, labor unions raised concern today that the merger
would result in branch offices being closed and slash nearly a
third of the combined banks' 80,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the plan as reported in Manager is to possibly spin off
the banks' retail services. Deutsche Bank chief executive Rolf E.
Breuer and his counterpart from Dresdner Bank, Bernhard Walter,
would both stay on as chief executives of the combined company
during the merger period, the magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Dresdner Bank rose 22 percent at the start of trading
in Frankfurt, before falling back somewhat, while Deutsche Bank
shares were up 8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank and Dresdner broke off talks last autumn on a
linkup of their retail-banking activities. At that time, Dresdner's
Walter reportedly wasn't willing to settle for less than a 50-50
linkup.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Dresdner Bank was also rumored to be in talks with
Germany's second biggest bank, Hypo Vereinsbank, about a potential
merger but it never materialized.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets With Slain Girl's Mom  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GALVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking to break a stalemate over gun control
legislation, President Clinton invited members of Congress and the
mother of a slain 6-year-old to the White House today. ''How many
people have to get killed before we do something?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton chided lawmakers for failing to meet to work out the
differences between the House and Senate versions of a juvenile
justice bill since last summer, saying that ''the American people
have waited long enough'' for new protections.
</P>
<P>
   He challenged Congress to produce final legislation for his
signature by April 20, the anniversary of the massacre at Columbine
High School in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the gun lobby is cranking up pressure on Congress
again,'' Clinton said. ''But when first-graders shoot first
graders, it's time for Congress to do what's right for America's
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Later today, Clinton was meeting with Veronica McQueen in a
private. McQueen's daughter, Kayla Rolland, was shot to death in
her first-grade classroom last week, allegedly by another
6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a parent, my heart goes out to her,'' Clinton said. ''And
as president, I'm going to do all that I can do to see that this
doesn't happen to other children.''
</P>
<P>
   Key lawmakers left an Oval Office meeting with Clinton without
an agreement to restart negotiations over a juvenile justice bill
that contains new measures designed to keep guns out of the hands
of children and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, expressed frustration and suggested he was considering
removing the gun provisions from the bill in order to win passage
of its other components.
</P>
<P>
   The key hang-up was a provision in the Senate bill that would
require people purchasing firearms at gun shows to wait three days
for a background check. The House version would require only a
24-hour waiting period. Clinton supports the tougher version.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House
Judiciary Committee, decried Hatch's reluctance to call a new
conference committee session and said inaction would carry a
political cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's going to cost the Republicans votes at the polls in
November, not us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding questions in the White House briefing room, Clinton
declined to confirm that he would visit Pakistan during a visit
later this month to India and Bangladesh. ''We're about to finalize
the arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also defended a $1.6 billion aid package to help
Colombia fight drug traffickers and a long-standing insurgency
against criticism that it would ally the United States with a
military that has a questionable human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not like Vietnam,'' he said. ''The units that will be
involved in this will have to be particularly vetted to make sure
they don't have the pattern of abuse that you've referred to.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about rising gas prices, Clinton also cautioned
oil-producing nations to guard against wide fluctuations in prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need stable prices at a lower level,'' Clinton said. ''I
hope that's what producing countries will see ... is in their best
interest, because it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House called McQueen Monday to invite her to a meeting
with Clinton after learning she was in town.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this morning on the NBC ''Today'' show, McQueen
recalled what happened when she learned Kayla had died.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told me she was shot by another baby, another child her
age,'' McQueen said. ''I sort of lost it. I got very upset. I was
screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also noted some troubling statistics about youths and
firearms at the meeting with lawmakers. The White House cites
Justice Department statistics showing that the number of juveniles
killed with a firearm increased sharply between 1987 and 1993,
while other types of homicide remained constant.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, lamenting last week that 13 children are killed by guns
every day in America, sought the meeting with congressional leaders
to ''break the logjam'' on legislation to require gun safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to require safety locks on guns, ban the import of
large-capacity ammunition clips and require background checks
before buying a weapon at gun shows. The House and Senate have
passed separate versions of the bill but have not come together on
a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The president also is proposing a system of photo IDs for gun
owners.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics, culled from the Juvenile Offenders and Victims
1999 national report, found that since 1980, one in four murders of
juveniles involved a juvenile offender. Nearly 38,000 juveniles
were murdered between 1980 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Sinks From 5000; Dow Off 300  </HEADLINE>
By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index, soaring on
investors' continuing enthusiasm for high-tech and Internet stocks,
briefly passed 5,000 today for the first time in its 29-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrials, meanwhile, tumbled more than 350
points after Procter &AMP; Gamble issued a disappointing earnings
forecast. The blue chips later regained some of their lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq index spurted 95.28 higher to 5,000.13 within the
first half-hour of trading on Wall Street and edged up to 5,006.78
before retreating. In early afternoon it was up about 53 points, or
more than 1 percent, at 4,958.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were taking profits after the Nasdaq's
latest climb, following their pattern when market averages reach
new milestones. Just two months ago, the Nasdaq passed 4,000, and
four months ago it crossed 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow fell as much as 351 points to 9,846.61, regained some
ground but resumed its fall in early afternoon, when it was trading
down about 317 points, or 3 percent, at 9,852. Much of the Dow's
plunge was due to a steep drop in the consumer products maker
Procter &AMP; Gamble. But interest rate sensitive stocks also
contributed to the Dow's slide.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Nasdaq has risen more than 21 percent,
while the blue-chip Dow has tumbled 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street today was following what is now a familiar trading
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq has surpassed the Dow and other stock market
indicators since late last year as investors have enthusiastically
bought high-tech, Internet and biotechnology stocks seen as having
the greatest potential for profit growth in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors worried about interest rates in recent months have
favored Nasdaq companies whose profits aren't threatened by higher
borrowing costs. They've been selling financial, industrial and
retailing companies that are more vulnerable to interest rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' migration toward Internet stocks surge in the Nasdaq
has reflected the economy's increasing shift toward service
companies and away from manufacturing businesses. While this trend
has been in place since the 1980s, the growth of the Internet and
related industries in recent years has intensified the creation of
jobs in the service sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite began trading at 100 on Feb. 8, 1971, when
most of the stocks on the Nasdaq market were of smaller companies
not large enough or glamorous enough to be listed on the New York
Stock Exchange. The Nasdaq market has grown in stature in recent
years, in part because prominent high-tech companies including
Microsoft and Intel have chosen to stay rather than switch to the
NYSE.

<HEADLINE> USDA Has New Organic Food Standards  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government today released new national
standards for growing and processing organic food that will bar the
use of genetic engineering or irradiation.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the standards, which are
expected to go into effect later this year, will be the ''most
comprehensive, strictest organic rules in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules will allow products that meet the standards to carry a
seal of approval that says, ''USDA Certified Organic.''
</P>
<P>
   USDA first proposed a set of national organic standards in 1997
but withdrew them after farmers and others in the organic industry
strongly objected to provisions that could have allowed the use of
sewage sludge as fertilizer, as well as genetically engineered and
irradiated ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, which will replace a hodgepodge of state and
private standards, also would prohibit the use of antibiotics in
livestock production and require the use of organic feed.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement of the standards will be left up to states and
private certifying agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 10,000 farms nationwide that claim to be organic,
only 6,600 are certified by a state or private agency.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states have no regulations for organic farming. Eleven
others, including California, have production standards but no
certification process for ensuring that farmers comply with them.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Gets Meditation Paths  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress accustomed to navigating
the mazes of lawmaking will have one or more labyrinths -- curved
paths intended to help walkers reach inner peace -- laid out for
Lent on the Capitol's East Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday, members and visitor to the Capitol will be
able to walk through the labyrinths and meditate. Sandra
Wasko-Flood, an artist from nearby Alexandria, Va., won approval
for the project through her congressman, Democrat Rep. James Moran.
</P>
<P>
   She belongs to the Labyrinth Society of New Canaan, Conn., which
promotes building them throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''A labyrinth is a simple path ... tool for personal,
psychological and spiritual transformation,'' the society says.
''They are right-brain activity enhancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasko-Flood said in an interview she will start work on
''Labyrinths for Peace: 2000'' on March 12, the first Sunday in
Lent.
</P>
<P>
   ''For Christians,'' she said, ''the connection is with Christ's
redemption of mankind, which is a kind of transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Christian doctrine, redemption is symbolized by Christ's
crucifixion and resurrection celebrated at Easter, the end of Lent.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday and through March 25, Wasko-Flood and her
friends will lay out curved paths, enclosed in circles, each
morning on the East Lawn of the Capitol. Each circle may be 12 to
48 feet across. She would like to have the curved paths wide enough
for wheel chairs and marked with little surveyor's flags about a
foot high.
</P>
<P>
   On any particular day, there may be one or more labyrinths, she
said. She is looking for musicians, especially flute-players, she
said, to station themselves near the labyrinths to provide
accompaniment. Details have not been worked out, but the labyrinths
will be dismantled every day at 5 p.m. and retraced next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Wasko-Flood and the Labyrinth Society draw a distinction between
a maze and a labyrinth. A labyrinth, they say, consists of only one
clear path, though it may curve several times around a circle,
while a maze offers many choices and wrong turnings. She noted that
standard dictionaries do not make this distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Wasko-Flood said the idea for a labyrinth on the Capitol grounds
originated in Chaco Canyon, N.M, amid the ruins of structures built
by American Indians about 900 years ago. She was sitting in a kiva,
she said, a spiritual center of the builders.
</P>
<P>
   Wasko-Flood, 57, said she would like to see two permanent
labyrinths built someday, one in the Washington area and one in New
Mexico, where she and her husband plan to retire in four or five
years.
</P>
<P>
   She said the labyrinth has appealed to many cultures. The
ancient Egyptians had one that may have been built as many as 6,000
years ago. The Greek historian Herodotus reported that it had 1,500
chambers above ground and another 1,500 underneath.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices May Affect Summer Trips  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE ARRILLAGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   James McKenna isn't too worried that gas prices could go as high
as $1.80 per gallon this summer.
</P>
<P>
   That might sound odd coming from the top tourism official in
Lake Placid, N.Y., a vacation spot that even he calls a
''rubber-tire destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet McKenna estimates that tourists driving up from New York
City would pay about $8 more in gas each way should prices
increase. In today's booming economy, he said, that's still a
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't even get a glass of wine for eight bucks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department on Monday predicted that gasoline prices,
already averaging about $1.50 for a gallon for unleaded, would
spike at $1.75 to $1.80 this summer because production isn't
keeping pace with demand.
</P>
<P>
   But Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said prices of $1.75 or
more are not a certainty this summer. It likely depends on how much
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will allow oil
production to increase, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, we are going to avoid'' such a spike in prices,
Richardson said on NBC's ''Today.'' ''Our strategy is to work with
OPEC, to get them to increase production sizably so that doesn't
occur, along with a number of other domestic initiatives the
president has already taken.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''We are going to do more to intensify our energy
diplomacy with OPEC and non-OPEC members. ... We're going to try to
get more gasoline out in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Traders, however, were betting that any production increase will
have little short-term effect on the market. Prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange hit another nine-year high, rising to $33.94 a
barrel by early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't be worse. The period between Memorial Day
and Labor Day is typically the busiest driving season of the year,
with an estimated 270 million people hitting the road for vacation,
according to AAA.
</P>
<P>
   AAA spokesman Geoff Sundstrom said that while many travelers
won't change their plans because of a few additional bucks a tank,
some could decide to stay closer to home and skip trips to more
remote destinations such as national parks out West.
</P>
<P>
   ''If prices continue to move up and begin to reach the $2 a
gallon level, psychologically Americans may not be prepared to deal
with that and continue business as usual with the family budget,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation that worries Keela Mangum. The owner of Grand
Canyon Trail Rides fears that if gas prices continue to skyrocket,
the booming summer travel season she was counting on might turn out
to be a bust.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is kind of bleak looking for us,'' said Mangum, whose
family run business provides mule rides along the Grand Canyon's
North Rim, 270 miles from the nearest major airport in Las Vegas.
''We're at the end of the world as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, there are similar concerns for Bob Ferguson, owner
of Zephyr Whitewater Expeditions in Columbia, Calif., just north of
Yosemite National Park. Ferguson said he'll have to hike ticket
prices should gas prices continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ''If things got way out of hand we could add a little for the
cost of gas,'' he said. ''There's not a whole lot you can do. You
just have to bite the bullet, and hope the prices will go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials in the Lake Tahoe area said they don't believe
higher gas prices will keep that many people away.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a great Presidents Day weekend and gas prices were
already on the rise then,'' said Carol Tanis, spokeswoman for the
Reno-Sparks Convention &AMP; Visitors Authority. ''While gas prices are
up, the economy seems to be doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Tahoe-area ski resorts have followed the holiday weekend with
two more big weekends, thanks primarily to a pair of large snow
storms in the Sierra Nevada mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good snow may help outweigh the higher gas prices,'' Tanis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials in towns along the East Coast also were
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Donny Beaver, the proprietor of Paradise Outfitters, which
offers getaway weekends at fly fishing resorts in Pennsylvania,
said his business could actually benefit from higher gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of folks try to use us as a surrogate for a
10-day trip to Yellowstone,'' said Beaver, adding that his resorts
typically draw customers from an area that stretches to Cleveland,
New York and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Florida, where AAA's Sundstrom said more vacationers
travel by car than in any other state, tourism officials weren't
concerned. Gerard Hoeppner, spokesman for Busch Gardens in Tampa,
said the price surge might even persuade Floridians to vacation --
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people choose not to go out of state,'' he said, ''that's
good for us.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Hits 5,000 Then Pulls Back  </HEADLINE>
By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more
than 300 points today, overshadowing the Nasdaq composite index's
first foray past 5,000, after Procter &AMP; Gamble warned its
third-quarter earnings will fall short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was down nearly 307 points, or 3 percent, at the 9,863
level in midafternoon after being down as much as 351 points in
earlier trading.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Dow's plunge was due to a steep drop in Procter &AMP;
Gamble, which lost nearly a third of its value after warning
investors that higher raw materials and manufacturing costs would
cause its fiscal third-quarter earnings to fall 10 percent to 11
percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The warning from the consumer products maker made an already
nervous market even more anxious about industrial and financial
stocks that have suffered lately while high-tech stocks have
flourished.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq succumbed to the market's uneasiness after having
soared more than 100 points in early trading and passing 5,000 for
the first time in its 29-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The index spurted 95.28 higher to 5,000.13 within the first
half-hour of trading on Wall Street and edged up to a high of
5,006.78 before retreating. In midafternoon it was up about 2
points at the 4,907 level.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors took some profits after the Nasdaq's
latest climb, following their pattern when market averages reach
new milestones. It was just two months ago that the Nasdaq passed
4,000, and four months ago that it crossed 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street today was following what is now a familiar trading
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq has outperformed the Dow and other stock market
indicators since late last year as investors have enthusiastically
bought high-tech, Internet and biotechnology stocks seen as having
the greatest potential for profit growth in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors worried about interest rates in recent months have
favored Nasdaq companies whose profits aren't threatened by higher
borrowing costs. They've been selling financial, industrial and
retailing companies that are more vulnerable to interest rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Nasdaq has risen nearly 21 percent, while
the blue-chip Dow has tumbled more than 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' migration toward Internet stocks surge in the Nasdaq
has reflected the economy's increasing shift toward service
companies and away from manufacturing businesses. While this trend
has been in place since the 1980s, the growth of the Internet and
related industries in recent years has intensified the creation of
jobs in the service sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite began trading at 100 on Feb. 8, 1971, when
most of the stocks on the Nasdaq market were smaller companies not
large enough or glamorous enough to be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange. The Nasdaq market has grown in stature in recent years,
in part because prominent high-tech companies including Microsoft
and Intel has chosen to remain with Nasdaq rather than switch to
the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Sinks From 5000; Dow Off 327  </HEADLINE>
By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials tumbled more than 300
points today, overshadowing the Nasdaq composite index's first
foray past 5,000, after an earnings warning from Procter &AMP; Gamble
rattled the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow was down 327.31 at
9,843.19.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which had soared more than 100 points to 5,006.78 in
early trading, was up 2.63 at 4,907.48. Analysts said profit-taking
and computer-driven trading that kicked in at the 5,000 mark was
largely responsible for the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was off 25.71 at 1,365.57.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble plunged 27 to 60 7/16, accounting for much of
the Dow's drop. The consumer goods company said earnings in the
second half of its fiscal year will miss expectations because of
higher costs of pulp and raw materials, sparking some fears that
other blue-chip companies may report similar troubles in the weeks
before companies begin reporting their first-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rate-sensitive American Express, down 3[ at 126[, also
contributed to the Dow's weakness, as did Coca-Cola, down 3~ to
45[.
</P>
<P>
   A single-dollar movement by a Dow component translates to a
five-point movement in the Dow average. Today, the damage would
have been much worse without Microsoft, which was up 3[ to 93}
following a positive report from a Goldman Sachs analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which has surged in recent months as investors
embraced the technology stocks that dominate its ranks, made its
first trip past 5,000 just over two months after its first close
above 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Nasdaq's incredible gains have left it
vulnerable to investors eager to collect some profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq has a history of having trouble penetrating major
new barriers,'' said Robert Stovall, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ''There's a strong impulse to take profits, because it
seems unbelievable that this thing can keep running.''
</P>
<P>
   A $21 billion merger stimulated the technology sector. VeriSign
Inc., a leading provider of Internet encryption technology, is
buying Network Solutions Inc., best known as a registry for domain
names on the Internet. Network Solutions soared 59| to 420\, while
VeriSign fell 41 7/16 to 206.
</P>
<P>
   In a bet that technology stocks are best prepared to thrive even
if the Federal Reserve continues raising interest rates this year,
investors have flocked to those shares at the expense of nearly
every other corner of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone is crowding into technology, and money continues to
flow out of the rest of the market,'' said Stovall.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Nasdaq has risen nearly 21 percent, while
the Dow has tumbled more than 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The oil sector provided an exception to the weakness in old-line
industrial stocks. The recent rise in oil prices, while frustrating
consumers and stimulating some worries about inflation, has bumped
up shares of many oil companies. Chevron rose 5\ to 79\ and Texaco
gained 2 11/16 to 49 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   The market's weakness surprised some analysts who had expected
stocks to rally on news of improved productivity by American
workers. Economists consider healthy productivity gains the key to
sustaining economic growth without giving rise to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 892.27 million
shares, ahead of Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.31 to 601.95.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Wants To Curb Bell Atlantic  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Upping the ante in the war between the two
phone giants, AT&AMP;T's chief said Tuesday his company will ask
federal regulators to suspend Bell Atlantic's authority to offer
long-distance service in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a meeting of state regulators, AT&AMP;T Chairman C.
Michael Armstrong accused the Bell company of mishandling tens of
thousands of orders from customers who wanted to switch to a
competitor, such as AT&AMP;T or MCI WorldCom, that offer local phone
service in the state.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest attempt by the nation's No.1 long-distance
company to undo a landmark decision late last year by the Federal
Communications Commission, allowing Bell Atlantic to offer
long-distance service to its local customers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 telecommunications law requires that before a Bell
company can gain entry into long-distance within its region, it has
to show that its local phone market is open to competition. That
includes making sure its operating systems can handle requests from
other local companies when Bell customers choose to switch to
another service.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said that Bell Atlantic has not been able to
successfully process these orders, sometimes causing consumers to
wait months to have their service changed. The Bell company also
has a backlog of thousands of orders it has not been able to clear,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thousands of our customers whose orders are lost are being
denied the local and long-distance carrier of their choice,''
Armstrong said. He cited one case of a woman who ordered local AT&AMP;T
service in September, and was still waiting to get switched when
she canceled her order in February.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our brand is damaged each and every time they fail to provide
our customers with services of features in a timely manner,''
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong sent a letter to Bell Atlantic Chairman Ivan
Seidenberg Tuesday urging him to voluntarily suspend marketing
long-distance services until the company addresses the issues
raised by AT&AMP;T. If AT&AMP;T doesn't get a response in two days, it will
file a formal complaint with the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic said it has no intention of voluntarily stopping
its long-distance service and strongly disputed AT&AMP;T's claims.
Company officials said they are now handling more than 10,000
orders a day from rivals seeking to lease pieces of the company's
network to offer competing local service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other carriers are taking advantage of these system
improvements,'' said Tom Tauke, senior vice president for
government relations at Bell Atlantic. ''It's time for AT&AMP;T to stop
complaining and do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic officials admitted that they don't have records of
receiving about 9,500 orders from rivals in the past two months.
But they added that these were just a fraction of the 400,000 total
orders they received during that time and that they have since
upgraded their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also fielded questions after his speech about the
company's pending merger with MediaOne, a deal that would make AT&AMP;T
the nation's largest cable TV company and provider of high-speed
cable Internet services. Armstrong said review of the deal -- at the
Justice Department and FCC -- was moving along.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I know, it's going well,'' Armstrong said. ''I know
of no major issues at this time.''

<HEADLINE> Sidemen Join Rock Hall for 1st Time  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After 15 years, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
honored musicians who stood to the side of the stage, just out of
the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   One year after creating some controversy by inducting Bruce
Springsteen without his legendary backups, the E Street Band, the
Hall of Fame started a category for sidemen with an initial five
inductees.
</P>
<P>
   The salute, which some considered overdue, was responsible for
some of the most touching moments of Monday night's ceremony at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   A smiling Scotty Moore, guitarist on early Elvis Presley
records, said the hall might have to expand because of the many
deserving musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were the essential glue that held rock 'n' roll records
together,'' said composer Mike Stoller, who inducted the sidemen.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Moore, the five initial honorees included Earl Palmer,
who drummed on ''Blueberry Hill'' and ''You've Lost That Lovin'
Feelin'''; Hal Blaine, the most recorded drummer on the West Coast,
who was a fixture at Phil Spector sessions; saxophonist King
Curtis, heard on the Coasters' ''Yakety Yak''; and the late bassist
James Jamerson, considered Motown's secret weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Jamerson died, his widow, Annie, walked in on him
listening to many of the old Motown records. She knew something was
wrong because he didn't usually do that.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'I did it, I did it.' I had a feeling he was
thinking, 'That really was me playing bass on all those hits.' I
had a feeling he thought he would be forgotten,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking up from the podium, she said, ''The entire music
community remembers what you did.''
</P>
<P>
   None of Curtis' family members could be located, so Atlantic
Records co-founder Ahmet Ertegun accepted the award in the
saxophonist's name.
</P>
<P>
   ''King Curtis was like an angel descended upon us at Atlantic
and we would not have been the same without him,'' Ertegun said.
''He was a man I truly loved. All the people I knew who were close
to him are also gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer thanked the Hall of Fame for recognizing that no singer
was complete without a band. He accepted the award ''for the other
guys who are worthy but didn't live long enough to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The night's six main inductees were Eric Clapton, James Taylor,
Bonnie Raitt, Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire, the Lovin' Spoonful and the
Moonglows.
</P>
<P>
   Clapton, who was much more anxious to play his guitar than talk,
dominated the post-midnight jam session that traditionally brings
the induction ceremony to a close.
</P>
<P>
   He accompanied Natalie Cole on ''Route 66,'' Taylor on ''How
Sweet It Is'' and Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire on ''Love and Happiness,'' and
he traded guitar licks with Raitt on ''Sweet Home Chicago.'' The
Lovin' Spoonful's John Sebastian played harmonica.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like stepping outside in a blizzard,'' Taylor said
after the jam session. ''It swept you away. The sound onstage is
massive. It's not very precise, everybody flailing away at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Cole, whose late father Nat ''King'' Cole was inducted
with Billie Holiday as early influences on rock 'n' roll, was asked
by reporters how her father would have felt about the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would die,'' she said. ''I think he'd be slightly
mortified. He used to say, 'Mr. Cole will never rock and roll.' He
was laidback, cool, jazz-pop oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, she reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he would think it was a big deal. I think he'd be very
pleased,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Four Justices Attend Law Conference  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a rare appearance before a single audience
outside the Supreme Court, four members of the nation's highest
court joined legal experts from around the world at an
international law conference at the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''American judges and lawyers attend these conferences with the
idea that we have something to learn as well as something to
contribute,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said at the
conference's opening dinner.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that in future years ''we'll see the courts of the
United States looking more to the decisions of other nations'
constitutional courts to aid our own deliberative processes.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, co-sponsored by the Library of Congress and the New
York University School of Law, was to run from Monday night through
Thursday, with another session planned for Friday in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor spoke on international
remedies for genocide and war crimes, and Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg led a discussion about women's roles in international law.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was moderating a panel discussion of
democracy and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, the main chance to see a Supreme Court justice
is to come to Washington and watch the nation's highest court in
action on the bench. The justices give speeches to groups in
Washington and around the country, but not often do four attend the
same event.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor spoke of efforts in nations where war crimes and other
atrocities have occurred to seek ''an acknowledgment of past crimes
combined with reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This century has seen terrible action against citizens'' such
as the Holocaust, killings in Cambodia and more recently in Bosnia
and Rwanda, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg opened her panel's discussion by saying it would prove
''how very wrong Voltaire was when he said, 'Ideas are like beards
-- women and young men have none.'''

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- European share prices fell Tuesday, led by telecom
and automobile stocks, following a sharp drop in Dow Jones
industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies fell
2.88 points, or 0.7 percent, to 402.62, and the Dow Jones Stoxx 50
Index fell 45.63 points to 5,111.09.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies in
countries that joined the single currency, was down 4.27 points to
461.97. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index was down 38.07 points to
5,426.36 points.
</P>
<P>
   London's FTSE-100 Share Index fell 1.5 percent to 6,466.5,
Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index rose 1.1 percent to 8,064.97, the Paris
CAC-40 Index was down 1.6 percent to 6,441.85, Milan's MIBtel Index
was down 2.3 percent to 34,030, and Amsterdam's AEX Index ended
down 0.4 percent to 677.21
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index dropped more than 220
points in early U.S. trading on ongoing interest-rate fears and a
profit warning by Procter &AMP; Gamble caused by an increase in raw
material costs. In late afternoon trading, it was down about 2.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This contributed to the decline in European equity markets late
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Stoxx telecom index was 3 percent lower and the
Dow Jones Stoxx technology fell 1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T wants to stop Bell Atlantic long-distance service  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Upping the ante in the war between the two
phone giants, AT&AMP;T's chief said Tuesday his company will ask
federal regulators to suspend Bell Atlantic's authority to offer
long-distance service in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a meeting of state regulators, AT&AMP;T Chairman C.
Michael Armstrong accused the Bell company of mishandling tens of
thousands of orders from customers who wanted to switch to a
competitor, such as AT&AMP;T or MCI WorldCom, that offer local phone
service in the state.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest attempt by the nation's No.1 long-distance
company to undo a landmark decision late last year by the Federal
Communications Commission, allowing Bell Atlantic to offer
long-distance service to its local customers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The company is seeking permission to offer such service to its
customers in New Jersey, where it is the dominant provider of local
service.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 telecommunications law requires that before a Bell
company can gain entry into long-distance within its region, it has
to show that its local phone market is open to competition. That
includes making sure its operating systems can handle requests from
other local companies when Bell customers choose to switch to
another service.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said that Bell Atlantic has not been able to
successfully process these orders, sometimes causing consumers to
wait months to have their service changed. The Bell company also
has a backlog of thousands of orders it has not been able to clear,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thousands of our customers whose orders are lost are being
denied the local and long-distance carrier of their choice,''
Armstrong said. He cited one case of a woman who ordered local AT&AMP;T
service in September, and was still waiting to get switched when
she canceled her order in February.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our brand is damaged each and every time they fail to provide
our customers with services of features in a timely manner,''
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong sent a letter to Bell Atlantic Chairman Ivan
Seidenberg Tuesday urging him to voluntarily suspend marketing
long-distance services until the company addresses the issues
raised by AT&AMP;T. If AT&AMP;T doesn't get a response in two days, it will
file a formal complaint with the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic said it has no intention of voluntarily stopping
its long-distance service and strongly disputed AT&AMP;T's claims.
Company officials said they are now handling more than 10,000
orders a day from rivals seeking to lease pieces of the company's
network to offer competing local service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other carriers are taking advantage of these system
improvements,'' said Tom Tauke, senior vice president for
government relations at Bell Atlantic. ''It's time for AT&AMP;T to stop
complaining and do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic officials admitted that they don't have records of
receiving about 9,500 orders from rivals in the past two months.
But they added that these were just a fraction of the 400,000 total
orders they received during that time and that they have since
upgraded their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also fielded questions after his speech about the
company's pending merger with MediaOne, a deal that would make AT&AMP;T
the nation's largest cable TV company and provider of high-speed
cable Internet services. Armstrong said review of the deal -- at the
Justice Department and FCC -- was moving along.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I know, it's going well,'' Armstrong said. ''I know
of no major issues at this time.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls From 5000; Dow Off 266  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials tumbled more than 300
points today, overshadowing the Nasdaq composite index's first
foray past 5,000, after an earnings warning from Procter &AMP; Gamble
rattled the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
was down 266.19 at 9,904.31 after having fallen 351 points in
earlier trading..
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which had soared more than 100 points to 5,006.78 in
early trading, was up 26.51 at 4,931.36. Analysts said
profit-taking and computer-driven trading that kicked in at the
5,000 mark were largely responsible for the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was off 18.97 at 1,372.31.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble plunged 27 5/16 to 60[, accounting for much of
the Dow's drop. The consumer goods company said earnings in the
second half of its fiscal year will miss expectations because of
higher costs of pulp and raw materials, sparking fears that other
blue-chip and industrial companies might warn of similar troubles
in the coming weeks. Companies are scheduled to report their
first-quarter earnings next month.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch downgraded the entire consumer products sector,
depressing stocks including Colgate Palmolive, down 5 11/16 to 47[,
and Kimberly Clark, down 5 9/16 to 45 1/16. Those companies have
not issued any warnings about earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble wasn't the only drag on the Dow. Interest
rate-sensitive American Express fell 2 15/16 to 126 5/16 and
Coca-Cola fell 2 7/16 to 46 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   A single-dollar movement by a Dow component translates to a
five-point movement in the Dow average. Today, the damage would
have been much worse without Microsoft, which was up 4 to 94|
following a positive report from a Goldman Sachs analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which has surged in recent months as investors
embraced the technology stocks that dominate its ranks, made its
first trip past 5,000 just over two months after its first close
above 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Nasdaq's incredible gains have left it
vulnerable to investors eager to collect some profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq has a history of having trouble penetrating major
new barriers,'' said Robert Stovall, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ''There's a strong impulse to take profits, because it
seems unbelievable that this thing can keep running.''
</P>
<P>
   A $21 billion merger stimulated the technology sector. VeriSign
Inc., a leading provider of Internet encryption technology, is
buying Network Solutions Inc., best known as a registry for domain
names on the Internet. Network Solutions soared 48} to 409], while
VeriSign fell 46 3/64 to 201 25/64.
</P>
<P>
   In a bet that technology stocks are best prepared to thrive even
if the Federal Reserve continues raising interest rates this year,
investors have flocked to those shares at the expense of nearly
every other corner of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone is crowding into technology, and money continues to
flow out of the rest of the market,'' said Stovall.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Nasdaq has risen nearly 21 percent, while
the Dow has tumbled more than 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The oil sector provided an exception to the weakness in old-line
industrial stocks. The recent rise in oil prices, while frustrating
consumers and stimulating some worries about inflation, has bumped
up shares of many oil companies. Chevron rose 6| to 80| and Texaco
gained 3~ to 50{.
</P>
<P>
   The market's weakness surprised some analysts who had expected
stocks to rally on news of improved productivity by American
workers. Economists consider healthy productivity gains the key to
sustaining economic growth without giving rise to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Higher productivity is an unmitigated good for the economy,''
said Stan Shipley, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, noting that
the rise in productivity came along with a drop in labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Inflation just does not emerge from that mix,'' Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.04 billion shares,
well ahead of Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.85 to 602.49.

<HEADLINE> Germany Supports New IMF Candidate  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany pushed a new candidate Tuesday to head the
International Monetary Fund after backing down from a diplomatic
spat with the United States, which declared the first nominee unfit
for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Horst Koehler, 57, head of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development in London, was expected to be the new European
Union candidate. German Deputy Finance Minister Caio Koch-Weser
said Tuesday he was pulling out ''so as not to stand in the way of
better understanding with the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany had argued the debate over who would succeed Michel
Camdessus of France, who resigned last month, was really about a
disagreement over IMF reforms. A 25-year World Bank veteran,
Koch-Weser had been considered by some as unlikely to streamline
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   That's something that supporters and analysts said Koehler -- an
unconventional thinker who worked in the German Finance Ministry
from 1982-93 -- would be able to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Once referred to by former Chancellor Helmut Kohl as a
''treasure,'' Koehler became a deputy finance minister in 1990 and
served as Kohl's envoy at meetings of the Group of Seven
industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF candidate had done critical work in reunifying Germany
and preparing the nation's entry into the EU, said former German
Finance Minister Theo Waigel. Koehler ''has all the requirements to
be qualified for such a post,'' Waigel told Hessischer Rundfunk
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler said Tuesday that he told Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
that he enjoys his present job. ''However, if a broad majority of
shareholders is of the view that I am needed at the helm of the
IMF, then I would not decline such a request,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Koch-Weser won the most support of three candidates
in an IMF straw poll with 43 percent, but more than a third of the
IMF board abstained, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the current EU president, Portuguese Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres, said the new European candidate would
''certainly'' be Koehler. EU spokesman Norbert Schwaiger said in
Brussels, Belgium, that the European countries would formally
decide by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Schroeder, a Social Democrat, would push a
candidate allied to his main opposition party demonstrates how
badly he wants to get a German in a key international post. Germany
has traditionally deferred to its neighbors in Europe in seeking
such positions, not wanting to raise historical fears of an
aggressive country.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler had been the first German to head a significant
international financial institution when he took over the EBRD in
October 1998. The bank was set up in 1991 to promote the transition
towards market-oriented economies in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler moved in 1993 to the German Association of German
Savings Banks, where he presided over reforms to help privatize
Germany's traditionally state-connected banks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Horst Koehler is one of the very few internationally known
personalities from Germany that is suited'' for heading the IMF,
said Friedrich Merz, leader of the conservatives in parliament.
''After the disaster over Caio Koch-Weser's nomination, the
government can't stand a second rejection.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers reiterated
that Europe should nominate a candidate who will attract broad
support from the 182 IMF members.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan senior economist Hans Redeker in London said he
thought Koehler was market-oriented enough to satisfy U.S. demands
and would surely continue Camdessus' reform effort at IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would not be somebody who would conquer the IMF,'' Redeker
said. ''He would try to change the IMF in an evolutionary way.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Skierbiezow, Poland, in 1943 to farmer parents from
Romania, Koehler was the second youngest of eight children. The
small town near the southeastern city of Zamosc is in an area where
Nazis deported the Polish residents of nearly 300 villages to make
room for Germans resettled from the Balkans and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler's family moved to Leipzig in East Germany after World
War II and fled to the west in 1954.

<HEADLINE> Troop Suit Flaw Awareness Unknown  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN M. DONNELLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although a Pentagon agency warned the Army and
Air Force in early February not to use potentially flawed chemical
suits, the services didn't pass the message on to the field until
weeks later -- the day after the problem was made public, military
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Even now it is unclear how widely the message has spread among
U.S. forces deployed worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, the Defense Logistics Agency, or DLA, told all the
military services' logistics offices not to use suits from two
suspect lots in any real emergency. But it was not until Feb. 28,
the day after The Associated Press reported that many of the suits
contained holes and tears and the contractor had been charged with
fraud, that the message went beyond the logistics offices.
</P>
<P>
   Unaware of the problem's scope were troops at Army and Air Force
bases who, the Pentagon inspector general says, could have been
killed wearing faulty suits during a gas or germ attack.
</P>
<P>
   Only last Friday did the DLA send a memo to four-star generals
and admirals on every continent, the Army and Air Force chiefs and
others -- as opposed to logistics offices. The latest memo provides
more detailed information on what items to set aside and who to
call with questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 3 warning said 1989 and 1992 lots of ''battle dress
overgarments'' made by Isratex, Inc., of New York City should be
removed from the active inventory. An alert last December to the
same logistics offices had mentioned only the 1992 lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force didn't tell air bases around the world that either
lot was defective until the day after the story broke, said Maj.
Donna Nicholas, an Air Force spokeswoman. The Army had told its
soldiers about the 1992 lot but not about the 1989 lot, because
Army headquarters didn't get the Feb. 3 memo and they first learned
about it in the press, said Army spokeswoman Nancy Ray. A Navy
spokesman, Lt. Matt O'Neal,said sailors and Marines have their own
protective suits and none are made by Isratex.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1989 lot has not been proven defective, it was
pulled with the 1992 lot and is considered suspect because of the
company that made it, DLA and inspector general officials have
said. All told, the company provided 780,000 suits to the military
at a cost of $49 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas said officials at Air Force headquarters never got the
December message. And she said the Feb. 3 warning was sent to the
wrong Air Force location and wasn't received by headquarters until
Feb. 15. Nearly two more weeks then passed before the Air Force
issued a warning memo Feb. 28, the day after the AP story.
</P>
<P>
   The belated Feb. 28 memo was sent not to field units such as air
bases in Korea or the Middle East but to the supply offices of
major commands and to Air Force centers that store such equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The service telephoned ''high-threat'' places such as Korea to
notify them of the problem suits, Nicholas said, though she could
not document such contacts nor say precisely when they occurred.
She called it ''coincidence'' that the service's warning came soon
after the press report.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Army warned the field about 1992 lots, headquarters
never got the Feb. 3 memo on the 1989 lot, Ray said. She and others
said the news stories alerted officials to the 1989 lot and that on
Feb. 28, numerous phone calls were made to warn units from Georgia
to Germany about both lots.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Larry Barker, responsible for chemical gear for the 85,000
troops in the 18th Airborne Corps, said the first time he heard
about the 1989 lot being a potential problem was Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as 1994, Pentagon officials have conceded they knew
that Isratex was being investigated for allegedly selling inferior
products with the intent to defraud the military. Eventually, five
different Isratex contracts were included in an indictment against
the firm. Last September, company officials pleaded guilty to
various charges in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
New York. Sentencing is set for April.
</P>
<P>
   After tests last September showed flaws on suits from the 1992
lot were more serious than previously believed, the Defense
Logistics Agency issued the Dec. 2 warning to 18 logistics offices.
The December warning cites only the 1992 deal but says all suits
''that are connected with/manufactured by subject contractor be
used for TRAINING ONLY!''
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 3 memo went out to the same recipients. This time it
said both the 1989 and 1992 lots ''have been tested and identified
as being unsuitable as chemical protective suits.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no deadline for action in either memo, but both
requested ''widest possible dissemination of this document.''

<HEADLINE> Two men receive probation for having sex with teen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Two men who had sex with a teen-ager
whose mother arranged the liaisons over the Internet will spend no
time in jail, and the mother's lawyer says that's unfair because
she is going to prison for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's lawyer, Jim Gronquist, said it's unfair that the
mother, whose name was withheld to protect her daughter's identity,
got a prison term of 15 to 27 months, plus 60 months' probation,
while the men will not go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''It raises the question of whether men who are Internet sex
predators get treated differently'' than women who offer them sex,
Gronquist said.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant District Attorney Barry Cook said the mother was
the driving force behind the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm comfortable with the sentences that were worked out,''
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Mark Stier, 42, a San Francisco-based epidemiologist
and Yale-trained pediatrician, was sentenced to 24 months'
probation Monday. He pleaded guilty in Mecklenburg County Superior
Court to one count of taking indecent liberties with a minor.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Jay DeRochi, 31, owner of a Princeton, N.J., fertilizer
sales firm called Terra Biotics, pleaded guilty to the same charge
and received 12 months' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Both men also were fined and ordered to perform 72 hours of
community service.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they must submit to a DNA sample and have no
contact with the victim. North Carolina, like all states, routinely
takes blood samples and tracks the DNA of convicted sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   A third man, Todd Hucko, 29, of Westminster, Colo., will have a
court date early next month.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the three men had sex with the girl, then about
14, after her mother, who lived in Charlotte, met them in Internet
chat rooms starting in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the mother, a Charlotte homemaker, posed as ''Jill
Armstrong,'' a 17-year-old high school senior. She arranged to meet
the men at local hotels, but instead sent her daughter. Police say
her daughter supplied her with details of the encounters.
</P>
<P>
   The woman pleaded guilty to three counts of felony child abuse
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Stier and DeRochi said their clients didn't know the
girl was a minor and were deceived by her mother.
</P>
<P>
   DeRochi's lawyer, James Wyatt, said DeRochi ''was obviously
shocked'' when he learned the girl's true age. He said the mother's
action ''goes beyond rational comprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   With his client standing beside him, Wyatt said, ''He is
obviously very sorry for what has occurred. This is obviously a
very bizarre case.''
</P>
<P>
   Stier's lawyer, Tony Scheer, said his client had no idea the
girl was so young.
</P>
<P>
   Gronquist said he found that claim ''incredible, especially for
a pediatrician.''

<HEADLINE> Border Patrol Hire Shortfall Chided  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators chided the Immigration and
Naturalization Service chief Tuesday for falling short of a goal of
hiring 1,000 new Border Patrol agents last year and only seeking
money for 430 more next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''What gives? Why can't we get some people employed?'' Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., asked INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, who
oversees the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The patrol added 369 agents during the year ended Sept. 30,
despite a congressional directive to hire 1,000 per year. All new
agents were assigned to the Southwest border with Mexico, where 92
percent of all border agents work.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have expressed heightened concern about border
security since the Dec. 14 arrest of an Algerian man in Port
Angeles, Wash., who allegedly was carrying bomb-making materials in
his rental car.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., the chairman of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee responsible for the INS budget, warned
that he might seek cuts in the Border Patrol's administrative
budget if the agency fails to meet congressional hiring goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do have the final say in this exercise,'' Gregg said. ''The
fact is that this administration has flouted the Congress' efforts
to beef up the Border Patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said hiring more agents is a ''major effort of very
high priority'' that faltered last year because of a tight job
market. Meissner said the Border Patrol has broadened its pool of
applicants by recruiting heavily along the border with Mexico and
making it easier for Spanish-speaking applicants to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Tex., suggested that the Border
Patrol give bonuses to new agents who are fluent in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't let up. Four hundred and thirty new agents is not
enough. It's not sufficient,'' said Hutchison, one of the prime
backers of the 1,000-agent-a-year hiring goal. ''We are giving you
the resources to do it and we are asking you to please go forward
with the mandates we are giving you to hire 1,000 new border
agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said her agency would do its best to meet the
congressional requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did fall behind last year, and we need to make it up,'' she
said.

   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met late Tuesday to try to settle
their differences over stalled peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The two met in Savyon, an affluent suburb of Tel Aviv, a senior
Palestinian official said. Separately, an Israeli official
confirmed that the meeting had taken place but gave no further

</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's top Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, arrived in
Israel earlier in the day on his second visit to the region since
talks collapsed last month over a disagreement on an interim troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' return prompted speculation that he was carrying new
proposals for both sides. The Palestinian official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Ross was to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the meeting was spurred by the peacemaking
efforts of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who called Arafat and
Barak on Monday to discuss a new package of Egyptian and American
ideas. The proposals include some minor Israeli concessions.
</P>
<P>
   In the land dispute, Palestinians wanted the interim troop
withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank to include populous
suburbs of Jerusalem. Israel refused, saying discussion of the
suburbs should be undertaken during final-status negotiations on
the city, claimed by both sides as a capital.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat suspended final-status talks last month over the issue,
saying that if he could not trust Israel on relatively minor
issues, there was no point in negotiating the major issues.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Arafat told his legislature that he would
declare Palestinian statehood this year, with or without Israel's
consent. He said Israel must stop procrastinating if it wants to
meet a September deadline for a peace treaty giving it a say on the
terms of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the moment of truth. The government of Israel must
stop dictating and wasting time,'' Arafat said. ''We will only
accept the implementation of the agreements and will settle for
nothing less than our full rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader's speech was interrupted by hearty
applause, especially when he said 2000 was the year of Palestinian
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians prefer to win statehood as a result of a peace
agreement with Israel. A unilateral declaration by Arafat would
leave his administration with control over only 40 percent of the
West Bank, and could possibly trigger a military confrontation with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat already agreed once, in May 1999, to postpone a statehood
declaration, and thus would find it difficult to do so again if a
peace treaty is not reached by September.
</P>
<P>
   Israel radio reported that Israel would propose gestures on
other issues in hopes that Arafat would give in on the West Bank
suburbs. The radio reported that those other issues would include
the release of prisoners, the establishment of a second ''safe
passage'' route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza,
and the approval of a Gaza port.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down on Weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures tumbled Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade in a late-session selloff prompted by the
approach of weather systems bringing rain to the parched Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Prices had risen sharply Monday and continued their climb
Tuesday morning as record-high temperatures in the Midwest
heightened concerns about soil dryness as spring planting
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   But new forecasts showing that much of the region will be doused
by rains of as much as one inch sent prices plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   Corn prices wound up giving back virtually all the gains they
registered on Monday, with the rain expected to have a significant
effect on soil as planting season begins in earnest next month.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans followed corn sharply lower, although soybean planting
season doesn't get fully under way until May.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat also edged lower but avoided a significant decline. While
rains forecast to begin Wednesday may miss much of the winter wheat
belt, falling farther north, investors responded to improving crop
conditions in Kansas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell } cent to $2.59} a bushel; May corn
fell 3{ cents to $2.25\ a bushel; May oats fell 1} cent to $1.17 a
bushel; May soybeans fell 5} cents to $5.11{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while
pork futures were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle fell .40 cent to 72.45 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle fell .25 cent to 84.97 cents a pound; April lean hogs
rose .25 cent to 59.60 cents a pound; May pork bellies fell 1.55
cent to 92.45 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Senate proposes easing pension rules for older teachers  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Keeping older teachers in the classroom or
luring them out of retirement could be part of the solution to New
York's looming shortage of teachers, state Senate Republicans said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among a series of bills the lawmakers proposed is a measure to
allow teachers who have reached retirement age of 55 to defer
receiving their pensions so they can stay on the job longer without
suffering a pension penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also said retired teachers should be encouraged
to return to the classroom by eliminating the current
$17,000-a-year cap on what pensioners can earn before their
benefits are reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are designed to ease what education officials have
recognized in recent years as an impending shortage of teachers. It
is projected that over the next five years, one quarter of New
York's teachers will retire.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators say the problem will be especially acute in New
York City and other urban districts which typically have trouble
attracting teachers, or often lose them to higher-paying suburban
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Other Senate proposals include:
</P>
<P>
   --Paying ''teacher shortage grants'' of $3,400 to those who
commit to working for four years in districts with teacher
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   --Paying $10,000 salary bonuses to experienced teachers who agree
to teach for three years in poorly performing districts.
</P>
<P>
   --Reimbursing teachers up to $2,500 for the cost of qualifying
for national certification through the National Board for
Professional Teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno conceded that teacher
shortages are inextricably linked to how much educators are paid.
New York City, with 54,000 teachers retiring over the next five
years and an average teacher salary about 20 percent below that of
nearby suburban districts, is especially vulnerable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said teachers ''have to be compensated competitively'' to
''keep them motivated, to keep them interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans estimated that the proposals they advanced
Tuesday would cost about $36 million. They said their plan
parallels, and in some cases improves upon, a $25 million plan
proposed by Republican Gov. George Pataki in his 2000-01 state
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Their ''teacher shortage grant'' is very similar to Pataki's
''Teachers of Tomorrow'' program, for instance. But where Pataki
favored reimbursing eligible teachers for only student loan
repayment, Senate Republicans said the money should be used for any
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno foresees teachers enticed to come out of retirement as
supplementing existing numbers of teachers, not supplanting them.
State Sen. Frank Padavan, R-Queens, said formerly retired teachers
could be especially valuable at instructing the growing numbers of
students who are being required to attend summer school.
</P>
<P>
   The state's largest teacher union, New York State United
Teachers, praised the Republicans' proposals to give grants to
teachers willing to go into poorly performing schools and the
elimination of pension penalties as ''smart recruiting tools.''
</P>
<P>
   State Education Commissioner Richard Mills likewise applauded
many of the initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like what the Senate is doing,'' he said Tuesday. ''At least
I like the proposal. I'll have to see what comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills declined to endorse Bruno's statement that New York City
teachers should be paid more, calling it a collective bargaining
issue between the city and its teacher union. But he said salaries
are a key part of finding and retaining good teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to put together a package that will recruit
teachers,'' he said. ''New York City has to recruit a lot of
teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Martin Connor, Democratic leader in the Senate, called the
Bruno plan ''a big empty box with a little giveaway novelty
rattling around inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor said the Republican plan would do little to address the
fundamental problem behind teacher shortages -- low pay. Republicans
should attack the problem by providing more money to lower class
size and increase school aid so districts can pay teachers better,
Connor said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Tumbles 408 Points  </HEADLINE>
By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more
than 400 points today, overshadowing the Nasdaq composite index's
first foray past 5,000, after Procter &AMP; Gamble warned its
third-quarter earnings will fall short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was down 408 points, or nearly 4 percent, at the 9,761
level in late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Dow's plunge was due to a steep drop in Procter &AMP;
Gamble, which lost nearly a third of its value after warning
investors that higher raw materials and manufacturing costs would
cause its fiscal third-quarter earnings to fall 10 percent to 11
percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The warning from the consumer products maker made an already
nervous market even more anxious about industrial and financial
stocks that have suffered lately while high-tech stocks have
flourished.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq succumbed to the market's uneasiness after having
soared more than 100 points in early trading and passing 5,000 for
the first time in its 29-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The index spurted 95.28 higher to 5,000.13 within the first
half-hour of trading on Wall Street and edged up to a high of
5,006.78 before retreating. In late afternoon it was down 74 points
at the 4,830 level.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors took some profits after the Nasdaq's
latest climb, following their pattern when market averages reach
new milestones. It was just two months ago that the Nasdaq passed
4,000, and four months ago that it crossed 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street today was following what is now a familiar trading
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq has outperformed the Dow and other stock market
indicators since late last year as investors have enthusiastically
bought high-tech, Internet and biotechnology stocks seen as having
the greatest potential for profit growth in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors worried about interest rates in recent months have
favored Nasdaq companies whose profits aren't threatened by higher
borrowing costs. They've been selling financial, industrial and
retailing companies that are more vulnerable to interest rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   But as worries about profits spread throughout the market today,
even the high-tech sector wasn't immune.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' migration toward Internet stocks surge in the Nasdaq
has reflected the economy's increasing shift toward service
companies and away from manufacturing businesses. While this trend
has been in place since the 1980s, the growth of the Internet and
related industries in recent years has intensified the creation of
jobs in the service sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite began trading at 100 on Feb. 8, 1971, when
most of the stocks on the Nasdaq market were smaller companies not
large enough or glamorous enough to be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange. The Nasdaq market has grown in stature in recent years,
in part because prominent high-tech companies including Microsoft
and Intel has chosen to remain with Nasdaq rather than switch to
the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Police ID Body of Portugal Consul  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The body of a man found over the
weekend was that of a Portuguese consul who had been missing for
several days, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Miguel Jose Fawor was found on Sunday hidden in the
bushes off a freeway outside the city of Curitiba, 215 miles
southwest of Sao Paulo in the southern state of Parana.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old Fawor was the Portuguese consul for Parana and
the neighboring state of Santa Catarina.
</P>
<P>
   Police inspector Fauze Salmem said Fawor's dental records were
used to identify his body, which was also recognized by consulate
staff members. His hands were tied behind his back and it looked as
if he had suffered a hard blow to the head.
</P>
<P>
   A maid reported Miguel Jose Fawor missing after she found his
home empty with the door open when she arrived for work Friday.
Inside, police found a bloody trail leading from an upstairs room
to the garage. Fawor lived alone and had been stationed in Curitiba
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Fawor's Mercedes had been found abandoned in a nearby
neighborhood, a bloody towel and hood in the trunk, Salmem said.

<HEADLINE> Families Broken by Mozambique Flood  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAQUALANE, Mozambique (AP) -- Stelio Mabunda and his brother
Mahelane linger pensively under a tree, waiting for their mother.
She may never come.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Stelio and his 6-year-old brother last saw their
mother nine days ago, when rising floodwaters forced them to flee
their home in Chokwe. Now they are among hundreds of Mozambican
children wondering if they will ever see their parents again.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers say an unusually high number of children -- as many
as half of those arriving in camps -- were separated from their
parents during the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   The Mabunda brothers are among 58 children being cared for by
six Roman Catholic nuns in Chaqualane, a village 87 miles north of
the capital Maputo that is now temporary home to 40,000 weary flood
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   A month of floods in this southeast African nation have left
hundreds confirmed dead and an estimated 1 million people homeless.
The floods have ebbed, but aid agency officials expect the death
toll to soar into the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. airplanes flew over flood-stricken areas of Mozambique on
Tuesday, beaming back video images of marooned people and
demolished terrain. The information gathered by a Hercules C-130
was to be passed to aid agencies in Maputo, Air Force Col. Gary
Sadler said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mabunda brothers became separated from their mother after a
torrent of water slammed Chokwe, about 125 miles northeast of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our mother told us to run away when the water came,'' Stelio
said. ''She was trying to gather our things together.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushing through the deepening tide, the boys finally reached
higher ground. There was no sign of their mother, and a truck
brought them to Chaqualane, 40 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the ground with his hands folded behind his back,
Stelio said Tuesday: ''We think she is still in Chokwe.''
</P>
<P>
   Stelio said his father works in South Africa, but he did not
know where.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Macleod of UNICEF said the floods that engulfed central and
southern Mozambique tore apart tens of thousands of families. Many
were reunited as the floodwaters receded and survivors streamed
into 72 makeshift camps.
</P>
<P>
   Save the Children estimated up to 60 percent of the children
arriving in some camps were unaccompanied. However, the number has
dropped as children locate their parents, spokesman Roy Trivedy
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos besetting Mozambique, no one really knows how many
children have been orphaned. Save the Children estimates 1,000
children are still separated from their families; UNICEF put the
number closer to 500.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Alda Macualua, who looks after the children in
Chaqualane's makeshift camp, said 62 children had found their
parents in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, reunited with her two children Monday after more than
a week apart, told of lifting one child into a tree and balancing
the other on her head while she clung for two days to a tree trunk
in chest-high water.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter rescued the children, but according to Macualua,
the mother turned aside help. She remained in the tree for a week
until the waters receded, the nun said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman then started to walk, later finding her children in
Chaqualane.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mother was crying and the children were crying,'' Macualua
said. ''The little one was holding the mother tight -- she did not
want to leave her.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows if Stelio and Mahelane Mabunda will be as
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation has started to stabilize. Most of the children
who will find their parents have already done so,'' Save the
Children's Christine Knudsen said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Mine Said Collapses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- About 150 former rebel fighters
were buried alive when the clandestine diamond mine they were
working in collapsed, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report could not be immediately confirmed. The rebel
Revolutionary United Front denied any such accident had occurred,
and insisted that none of its fighters were involved in diamond
mining.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fought against exploitation of our mineral resources so we
would not be involved in any mining activities in Sierra Leone,''
RUF spokesman Eldred Collins said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The accident allegedly occurred late Sunday night at a sandy,
open-pit mine near the eastern Sierra Leone mining town of Koidu,
about 220 miles northeast of the capital of Freetown, according to
the daily Concorde Times.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. and Sierra Leone government officials declined to comment
on the report Tuesday. The rebels consistently block U.N.
peacekeepers and West African intervention troops from entering
their strongholds, including Koidu, where hundreds of open-pit
mines can be seen from the air.
</P>
<P>
   A rescue attempt was launched early the next morning but only a
few people were saved, according to report. The paper did not give
details on the number of survivors or their condition.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels won control of most of Sierra Leone's lucrative
diamond-producing eastern region during an eight-year civil war.
Many human rights groups say the rebels continue to profit from the
sale of smuggled gems to European and Middle Eastern buyers.

<HEADLINE> Diabetes Drug May Spur Heart Failure  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer advocates contended Tuesday the
diabetes drug Rezulin, already notorious for destroying some
patients' livers, also may be linked to 56 cases of heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Also, diabetics need warning that two similar medicines touted
as better alternatives to Rezulin are not proven safer, the
consumer group Public Citizen concluded after analyzing hundreds of
pages of government documents about the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen urged that the Food and Drug Administration ban
Rezulin, and put stronger warning labels on the competing drugs
Avandia and Actos.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do not use Rezulin at all. It is too dangerous,'' said Dr.
Sidney Wolfe, head of Public Citizen's Health Research Group. ''The
other two we believe should stay on the market, but ... they should
not be first-choice drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   All three drugs are chemically similar. If Rezulin isn't banned,
all three drugs should bear similar warnings that liver toxicity,
heart failure and significant weight gain are among the risks,
Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin was widely cheered when it hit the market in 1997 as the
first medicine that promised to resensitize the body to insulin.
But Rezulin's liver toxicity quickly surfaced. Britain banned it in
1998, and several FDA physicians now are pushing to ban Rezulin
here, too.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA knows of 85 cases of liver failure linked to Rezulin,
including 58 diabetics who died taking the drug and another seven
who needed liver transplants to survive.
</P>
<P>
   But FDA officials say Rezulin has proven very valuable to some
diabetics whose disease doesn't respond to other treatments, and
thus they haven't decided further action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   However, Public Citizen's petition will ''undergo very careful
consideration,'' said Dr. David Orloff, FDA's deputy metabolic
disease chief.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Goodrich, spokeswoman for manufacturer Warner-Lambert Co.
said FDA officials, in a private meeting last week, ''reaffirmed
the benefits (of Rezulin) outweigh its risks,'' and said its
competitors have risks, too.
</P>
<P>
   Avandia and Actos have been touted as potentially safer. But the
FDA says neither has sold long enough to prove if patients
ultimately will experience fewer liver problems.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen said it uncovered four reports of liver failure
among Avandia users in its first four months of sales; the FDA
previously has disclosed one case. There are no liver failures yet
linked to Actos, which hit the market last August.
</P>
<P>
   ''SmithKline Beecham stands behind the safety and efficacy of
Avandia and continues to work closely with the FDA,'' said company
spokesman Brian Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Added Actos manufacturer Takeda Pharmaceuticals: ''We have not
defined any evidence of a link between patient use of Actos and
liver failure, or of cardiac injury,'' said medical director Dr.
Wayman Wendell Cheatham.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe cited FDA records showing 56 reports of heart failure
among Rezulin users during its first 18 months of sales, and five
reports of heart failure during Avandia's first four months of
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Animal studies on all three drugs signaled heart failure might
be a risk, one an FDA reviewer concluded could increase the longer
the drugs are used, Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease is very common among diabetics, cautioned FDA's
Orloff.
</P>
<P>
   But, ''patients who have symptomatic heart failure ... should
stay away from these drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three drugs causes users to gain weight because of
fluid retention, and fluid retention can cause symptoms of heart
failure -- although there is no evidence the drugs directly damage
the heart, he said.

<HEADLINE> Biography Paints Geffen As Ruthless  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WHITE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Publicly, David Geffen isn't talking about a
new biography that paints the billionaire entertainment mogul as an
occasionally generous but often ruthless figure who bullied his way
to the top in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, Geffen has complained to executives and
editors at the publishing house Bertelsmann and its Random House
subsidiary that the book is inaccurate in its portrayal of his
business dealings and private life, the author said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys and Sells the New
Hollywood'' chronicles Geffen's life from his childhood as the son
of over-indulgent immigrants to his founding of the DreamWorks
studio with Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The book, by Wall Street Journal entertainment columnist Tom
King, appeared in bookstores Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The book provides an often unflattering portrait of a man
willing to betray friends and sacrifice personal relationships in
order to get his way. Yet it also details Geffen's extraordinary
generosity to friends and charitable causes, including millions of
dollars he personally donated to support AIDS research and help
those who have the disease. Geffen is openly gay, and the book
identifies some of the men with whom he has had relationships --
none of them stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a character assassination,'' King said. ''Far from
it. This book gives Geffen all he is due for his many extraordinary
and towering achievements. It also shows the man behind that mask.
He wasn't always a Boy Scout in his business dealings.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokeswoman, Geffen declined to comment on the book.
</P>
<P>
   In one anecdote, King writes of how Geffen deliberately
destroyed his friendship with Warner Bros. records chief Mo Ostin
in order to gain a negotiating advantage. Geffen, who was
renegotiating a contract with Ostin's company, feared he would be a
tough opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I don't have a fight with Mo, I will fail. The company will
fail. And I'd rather die than fail,'' the book quotes Geffen as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen, the book says, invited Ostin's wife, Evelyn, to lunch,
where he relentlessly bullied and insulted her. He insisted her
34-year marriage was a sham and made critical remarks about her
children.
</P>
<P>
   The ploy worked. Mo Ostin was so incensed that he refused to
speak with Geffen for more than a year. Geffen conducted
negotiations with Ostin's less adroit associate.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen eventually mended fences with the couple and named Ostin
to oversee DreamWorks Records.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Random House said Geffen has complained
vigorously to the company and Bertelsmann about unspecified
inaccuracies, but declined an opportunity to suggest corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We keep hearing that the book is filled with inaccuracies,''
said Random House spokesman Stuart Applebaum. ''But we're still
waiting for a single citation to that effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The 594-page work promises to be of keen interest in Hollywood,
where Geffen ranks among the most powerful of power brokers. As the
book documents in detail, few individuals have wielded so much
influence over the films Americans watch and the music they hear.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen was a key force behind such performers as Crosby, Stills,
Nash &AMP; Young, the Eagles and Jackson Browne. He has worked with Bob
Dylan and Joni Mitchell. As producer of the movie ''Risky
Business,'' he cast Tom Cruise in the role that made the young
actor a star. Geffen's financial backing helped launch ''Cats'' on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my mind no one has had a greater impact or influence on the
movies we watch and the music we listen to than David Geffen,''
King said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Geffen cooperated with King and even urged friends
and associates to speak candidly with the author. Geffen broke
contact after becoming alarmed about the book's direction and tone,
King said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Geffen apparently never tried to prevent friends and
relatives from talking to King, the author said.
</P>
<P>
   King believes that despite the concerns, Geffen wanted his story
to be told.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wanted to send a message that he was confident and secure
enough that he was willing to take a chance and allow his life
story to be researched and written in a very real way,'' King said.
''Maybe though now, in the end, he really wasn't prepared for that
after all.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Lawyer Pleads 5th in Probe  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Central Intelligence Agency's former
general counsel invoked his right not to incriminate himself and
refused to answer questions Tuesday from Senate Intelligence
Committee members about computer security lapses by former CIA
Director John Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Neil, who left the agency in 1997, appeared briefly
with his lawyer at a closed hearing of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, the lawyer, Roger Spaeder, said he had
advised O'Neil not to testify while Attorney General Janet Reno
reviews an earlier decision not to prosecute Deutch or others.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the conclusion of the attorney general's review, Mr. O'Neil
expects to speak about this matter,'' the statement said. ''We
emphatically deny that Mr. O'Neil, or anyone else, acted to delay
the agency's investigation of the Deutch matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is looking into Deutch's processing of classified
material on unsecured home computers and why it took the CIA so
long to do anything about it. The security lapse was found in
December 1996, as Deutch was leaving the agency, but the CIA
submitted no report to the Justice Department until March 1998 and
did not notify congressional oversight panels until June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the committee chairman, said the
panel will continue with its inquiry despite O'Neil's decision to
invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to extend immunity to O'Neil in exchange for his
testimony did not arise at the hearing, Shelby said. In a letter to
the committee last week, Spaeder suggested that O'Neil would be
willing to talk in exchange for immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said he is mindful that the Justice Department is taking
a new look at the matter, and ''we want to work with them,'' but he
said the committee would also continue to pursue a separate
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch, CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996, processed
classified documents on unprotected home computers that he and
family members also used to connect the Internet, according to the
CIA inspector general's report. Deutch has apologized for his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Deutch was stripped of most of his security clearances by CIA
Director George Tenet last August. As a former deputy defense
secretary, Deutch also had Pentagon clearances, but he voluntarily
gave them up last month.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil declined at first to turn over computer storage cards
from Deutch's computers and delayed notifying the Justice
Department of the matter, according to an unclassified version of
the inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet has called Deutch's computer behavior inexcusable and has
apologized for his own delay in forwarding the information to the
Justice Department and Congress. He said the delay was not
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   Neither O'Neil nor his lawyer would answer questions by
reporters as they emerged from the committee session. Spaeder
passed out copies of his written statement.

<HEADLINE> Putin Blames Downturn on Taxes  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   IVANOVO, Russia (AP) -- Three weeks before Russia's presidential
election, acting President Vladimir Putin told workers Tuesday in
one of Russia's declining industrial cities that high taxes were
smothering business, which needs more leeway to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Though there has been little campaigning in the run-up to the
March 26 vote, Putin's trip to Ivanovo, a textile center 150 miles
northeast of Moscow, appeared aimed at garnering votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The higher the degree of economic freedom of economic
entities, the higher the level of the development of the state,''
Putin told a meeting of textile workers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides high taxes -- the national tax burden on industries is
nearly 70 percent -- Putin said Russia's textile industry also was
suffering from inefficient production, incompetent directors and
poor state policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our common guilt that our industry has found itself in
such a difficult situation,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   But he provided few suggestions for how to revive the textile
industry, saying only that the government needs to draft a program
to stimulate enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents have accused Putin of having no concrete program
for addressing Russia's complex problems. But the criticism has
apparently had little effect on voters; polls show Putin with about
60 percent support, with his nearest opponent, Communist Gennady
Zyuganov, registering around 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Russia's top election body registered flamboyant
lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky as a presidential candidate after the
Supreme Court overturned a ban on his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky displayed his usual swagger after being registered
as a candidate, predicting he would place at least third and could
possibly win. But he has little time to prepare and is seen as
having no chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am heading to victory on my own,'' Zhirinovsky said. ''Who
knows what can happen in this country in 19 days? Who knew that on
Dec. 31 at midnight a political regime would be replaced?''
</P>
<P>
   All candidates get free campaign time on state television
channels.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's opponents say the president has an unfair advantage
because of the massive daily media coverage he gets, especially
from state channels.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to the criticism, Putin said Tuesday he did not intend
to take advantage of the free TV time.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in the executive should prove their worth by concrete
deeds and not advertising,'' he said. ''Advertising is all about
what is best, Tampax or Snickers. I'm not going to occupy myself
with that.''

<HEADLINE> US Seeks Mozambique Debt Relief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration joined a
congressional effort Tuesday to give flood-ravaged Mozambique and
other poor countries relief from staggering debt to foreign
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Debt relief is a good economic investment for the United
States,'' said Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already forgiven nearly all the debt owed
by Mozambique, but legislation is necessary to coordinate that debt
relief with other nations and to bestow U.S. approval for
international lending agencies like the International Monetary Fund
to engage in debt relief.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique owes $87 million to creditors this year, of which $58
million is owed to countries and $30 million to international
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Summers announced at a news conference that the administration
was forgiving the remainder of Mozambique's debt to the United
States, which he said amounted to less than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   He supported a congressional drive for passage of a
debt-forgiveness package for poor countries as part of spending
legislation to be considered later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress earmarked $110 million to forgive the debts
of poor nations which use the savings to reduce poverty, part of a
promised $920 million U.S. contribution to an international debt
relief initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The administration requested an additional $210 million in a
recent spending request so far ignored by the House Appropriations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Summers joined with those seeking to restore the funds.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Puts Lid on Movie Costs  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The average cost of a major Hollywood movie
declined in 1999 to $76 million, suggesting that top studios'
efforts to control bloated budgets are paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Average production costs fell 2.3 percent to $51.5 million last
year for the second straight decline, according to industry figures
released Tuesday. Marketing and film printing costs dropped
$780,000 in 1999 to $24.5 million a film -- the first decline in two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   That put the combined cost to release a major Hollywood movie at
an average of $76 million, down $2 million from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1998, costs had climbed every year since the early 1970s
as Hollywood turned out more and more blockbusters laden with
special effects and star salaries swelled to $20 million or more a
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cost control is a major, major objective in every studio,''
said Jack Valenti, who as president of the Motion Picture
Association of America released the figures at ShoWest, an annual
convention for theater owners. ''They wake up every morning trying
to figure out how they can make a movie for less money.''
</P>
<P>
   The association's members include such top studios as Warner
Bros., Paramount and 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, moviegoers paid higher ticket prices in 1999.
According to the National Association of Theatre Owners, the
average cost of seeing a film was $5.08 last year, up 38 cents.
Theater companies are rapidly building movie houses with improved
seating, sound and other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think patrons are willing to pay a lot more for our new
theaters,'' said John Fithian, president of the theater owners
group. ''There is no other bargain like the movie-going
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher prices resulted in a second straight record box office
year, in terms of receipts unadjusted for inflation. Ticket sales
totaled $7.5 billion in 1999, up from $6.95 billion the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance, however, fell slightly to 1.465 billion tickets
sold. Valenti said that was because the blockbuster ''Titanic''
inflated movie admissions during the normally slow winter season in
early 1998.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Fight Hurts Dozens  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A fight between an ethnic
Albanian and a Serb escalated into a street battle Tuesday in which
16 French peacekeepers and 24 civilians were wounded, a further
sign of the deep ethnic hatred dividing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The violence broke out on the northern side of Kosovska
Mitrovica, forcing U.N. officials to suspend attempts to register
Serbs wanting to return to their homes on the southern, ethnic
Albanian side of town. Later, they moved up the divided city's
curfew by two hours to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, an ethnic Albanian identified as Luan
Miftari attacked an unidentified Serb man with a crowbar in an
Albanian neighborhood on the Serb-controlled side of Kosovska
Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press reporter saw several Serbs rush to help the
injured man, while others went after Miftari. In the crush, an
ethnic Albanian opened fire from the backyard of a nearby house,
seriously wounding one Serb.
</P>
<P>
   ''That created panic,'' said Lt. Matthieu Mabin, a spokesman for
the French peacekeepers, who arrived after the shooting started.
The French troops and police were running down a narrow side
street, toward the shots, when someone threw grenades at them.
</P>
<P>
   Medics scrambled to stabilize one soldier's leg wound, as
another lay on the ground moaning. Those who were not hurt in the
blasts dragged injured comrades toward waiting ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hand grenades were thrown, we don't know from whom or from
where ... but it created very many injured, especially French
soldiers,'' Mabin confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty Serbs, 16 French peacekeepers and four ethnic Albanians
were injured, according to Lt. Col. Patrick Chanliau, another
spokesman for the French peacekeepers. A seventeenth peacekeeper
was injured in a separate incident, he said, but provided no
details.
</P>
<P>
   Four ethnic Albanians were arrested in the shootings, said
Chanliau.
</P>
<P>
   The number of wounded Tuesday was the most since Oct. 12, when
33 people were wounded near the bridge that connects the ethnically
divided neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Three miles away from the fighting, peacekeepers escorted 13
ethnic Albanians to a high-rise apartment complex in the northern
part of the city, where dozens of others were repatriated last
week, French peacekeepers said. Serbs have consistently protested
the return of ethnic Albanians to the northern half of Kosovska
Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, a rocket hit one of the buildings, slamming
into the structure's seventh floor. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in Kosovska Mitrovica, located 20 miles northwest
of Kosovo's provincial capital Pristina, underlines the
difficulties NATO faces in attempting to return the town to its
prewar, multiethnic status.
</P>
<P>
   The northern neighborhood was inhabited by about 3,000 ethnic
Albanians and several hundred Serbs until unrest early last month
caused everyone to flee the area.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a group of about 50 ethnic Albanians, who said they
fled to the southern side Tuesday, claimed Serbs had thrown
grenades at their homes, moving from one Albanian house to the next
to drive out residents.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-led peacekeepers moved into Kosovo last June after a 78-day
bombing campaign that ended a yearlong Serb crackdown on ethnic
Albanians. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander in Europe, visited
the NATO peacekeepers on the southern side of Kosovska Mitrovica,
NATO said. The independent, Belgrade-based Beta new agency reported
Clark met with local Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic while on the
military base.
</P>
<P>
   According to Beta, Clark promised Ivanovic he would not let
''extremists'' expel Serbs from the northern part of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Japan Activists To Stay in Prison  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Five Japanese Red Army members sought by
Tokyo for trial will remain in a Lebanese prison when their
sentences end Wednesday until the government decides whether to
grant them asylum or expel them, security officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The government ruled last week against extraditing the five to
Japan to stand trial on terrorism charges, and set up a committee
to rule on their asylum request.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Army is a shadowy ultra-leftist group that was active in
the 1970s. The five members, who were serving three-year sentences
for entering Lebanon on false passports, are considered heroes by
many in the Arab world for championing the Palestinian cause and
opposing Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The best known of the five is Kozo Okamoto, 51, who took part in
a 1972 attack on Israel's Ben Gurion airport that left 24 people
dead. He was freed by Israel in a 1985 prisoner swap with
Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The five had been mostly inactive in Lebanon, living under the
protection of Palestinian and leftist groups until their capture.
</P>
<P>
   Japan wants the five to stand trial on charges of staging bloody
attacks around the world. Lebanon refused, citing lack of evidence.
The two countries have no extradition treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Tuesday that it was not clear whether the five would be moved to
another detention center Wednesday, when the sentences end. The
judge who originally sentenced them ordered them expelled once
their prison terms ended.
</P>
<P>
   The other four Red Army members were Masao Adachi, 59, Kazuo
Tohira, 46, Haruwo Wako, 50, and 58-year-old Mariko Yamamoto, a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   In what has been seen as an attempt to avoid being sent home,
Adachi married a Lebanese woman after converting to Greek Orthodox
Christianity. The four others converted to Islam in February.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese press reports said the five began a hunger strike
Tuesday in a bid to persuade Lebanon to grant them political
asylum. But a judicial official said he was not aware of such an
action.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese leftist parties and some legislators have demanded the
prisoners be granted asylum, and supporters have staged
demonstrations in the past few months to press their case.
</P>
<P>
   About two-dozen leftists staged a sit-in for the second straight
day outside the Interior Ministry in Beirut on Tuesday, demanding
that the group be granted asylum.

<HEADLINE> Working parents using at-home care, instead of centers  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- More New Jersey children of working parents
are being cared for in private homes, as opposed to daycare
centers, a trend that some say is bad for kids.
</P>
<P>
   An Urban Institute study released Tuesday shows that 25 percent
of children of working parents in New Jersey attend daycare
centers, compared to a national average of 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Children under age 3 are least likely to be in centers -- 13
percent in New Jersey compared to 22 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Most New Jersey children -- 56 percent -- are cared for either by
relatives or parents who work at home or do shift work so one
parent is home with the children, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   The study uses data from the 1997 National Survey of American
Families, also conducted by the Urban Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Zimmer, executive director of the Community Day Nursery
in East Orange, said the shift is due to a federally-mandated
policy that gives low-income parents vouchers to pay for any type
of daycare they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to 1988, parents could only use the vouchers at licensed
daycare centers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children should be in an educational center,'' Zimmer said.
''They should not be sitting in somebody's house watching
television all day. That's the sad part.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wendy Patella, spokeswoman for the state Department of Human
Services, said most families that get subsidized child care use
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 69,000 children who receive child-care
subsidies, 86 percent are in centers, Patella said, while nearly 76
percent of children of welfare mothers use daycare centers.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Adams, the Urban Institute's lead researcher on the study,
said New Jersey's propensity for family daycare is not necessarily
bad. But, since so many parents are using family daycare homes, the
state ought to monitor their caliber, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real question is; What's the quality of care?'' she said.
''There's nothing saying a center is better than a home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ciro Scalera, executive director of the Association for Children
of New Jersey, said ''persistent rumors'' have called into question
the quality of some daycare homes, especially those that welfare
mothers are using.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst rumors are that these kids are plopped in front of
TV sets,'' Scalera said.
</P>
<P>
   Scalera also said the state is trying to improve the quality of
care in centers to meet a state Supreme Court order to provide
public preschool to children in poor towns.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time when we're increasing the demands on child care
centers to improve their quality, it seems ironic that more and
more of our children are going into a less regulated type of
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalera said the state needs to adopt stricter standards for
these homes and provide training.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should certainly increase the monitoring and evaluation of
what's happening to the kids in these homes,'' Scalera said. ''It's
meeting the parents needs, but is it meeting the child's needs?''
</P>
<P>
   The state's highest court ruled Tuesday that the state Education
Department, by forcing school districts to use daycare centers that
lack certified teachers and small classes, is failing to implement
preschool programs that will help children succeed later in school.
</P>
<P>
   Patella said the state inspects the homes for health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''In New Jersey, anyone who is issued payment through the
subsidized child care program has to be visited by an inspector,''
Patella said.
</P>
<P>
   Those inspections, however, do not include an examination of how
a child is spending the day, Patella acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   She added, though, that parents should be allowed to choose the
best daycare for their child.
</P>
<P>
   ''People receiving subsidized child care have a right to make
that choice, the same as any parent,'' Patella said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey families that do not get subsidies because they have
higher incomes also rely more heavily on relatives to care for
their children than families in other parts of the nation. Only 25
percent use daycare centers, compared to a national average of 35
percent, the study found.

<HEADLINE> Drug Pricing Probe Underway  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Drugmaker Schering-Plough Corp. and the nation's
two largest pharmacy benefit managers-- PCS Health Systems Inc. and
Merck-Medco Managed Care -- said Tuesday they received subpoenas
last year as part of a federal drug pricing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas were issued by the Department of Health and Human
Services' Inspector General's Office, the companies said. The
companies said government was seeking information on their
operations and did not include any allegations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacy benefit managers are hired by large employers and
managed care plans to control the costs of providing prescription
drugs. One way they save money is by negotiating price discounts
from drugmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The probe is focusing on whether drugmakers provided government
health plans, particularly Medicaid programs for the poor, the same
discounts as given to the pharmacy benefit managers. Federal law
requires pharmaceutical firms to give government health programs
the lowest available market price.

<HEADLINE> Gore seeks knockout punch; McCain hopes New York can keep himalive  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore sought to use the New
York primary Tuesday to slam dunk Bill Bradley on his home court, a
state where the former senator from neighboring New Jersey once
earned Basketball Hall of Fame honors playing for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Sen. John McCain looked to once again
flummox the party establishment and keep his battle against Texas
Gov. George W. Bush alive for at least another week.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Bush's campaign was run by Gov. George Pataki and
state GOP Chairman William Powers while McCain's troops were a
generally rag-tag bunch led by Staten Island Borough President Guy
Molinari.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Super Tuesday'' voting in New York came as a host of other
states, including California, Ohio and most of New England also
held primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Democrats were electing 158 pledged delegates to
the Democratic National Convention with another 85 pledged
delegates to be selected later by party leaders based on the
primary's popular vote outcome.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republicans were electing 93 GOP delegates Tuesday, but
couldn't vote directly for the candidates, only for their
prospective delegates. Another eight delegates were to be selected
later by state party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials said some independents and unregistered New
Yorkers were showing up at the polls hoping to vote. In New York,
each party's primary is open only to its enrolled members and there
is no same-day registration.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bush and McCain, Alan Keyes and Steve Forbes had
delegate slates on the New York GOP primary ballot. Forbes withdrew
-- but too late to have his name removed from the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Perennial candidate Lyndon LaRouche was also on the Democratic
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Going into the primary, polls had shown the vice president
leading Bradley by margins of up to 2-1 in New York just two months
after the former senator looked like he would give Gore a real run
there. By the eve of the primary, even Bradley's biggest New York
supporters were all but conceding defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''He fought handsomely, gallantly and right to the end,'' Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said that after Gore went on the attack, ''frankly,
Bill was just too philosophical about it. As Mister Dooley said,
'Politics ain't bean bag.'''
</P>
<P>
   The pre-primary polls had shown Bush and McCain running almost
even in New York even though most of the state's Republican
luminaries, including Pataki and New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, had lined up behind the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain effort gained some steam after the Bush forces
attempted to use New York's arcane election laws to keep McCain's
delegate slates off the primary ballot. In the face of mounting
criticism, Pataki called off the effort and a federal judge ordered
McCain's slates on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   And, in New York, as is often the case, local politics
threatened to overshadow the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the week before the primary, with Pataki launching harsh
attacks against McCain, Giuliani publicly refused to join in and
repeatedly said nice things about the senator from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sunday before the primary, Giuliani marched at Molinari's
side during a Staten Island parade as the former congressman handed
out McCain campaign promotions. The mayor, who is running for the
U.S. Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, later joined Pataki at
an event promoting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki loyalists suggested Giuliani was more interested in
boosting his own electoral chances than in helping Bush, the mayor
denied that. He said after voting Tuesday that he cast his ballot
for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   As the primary loomed in New York, where 46 percent of
Republicans are Roman Catholic, Bush sought to overcome criticism
of his earlier visit to Bob Jones University, where some school
officials have expressed anti-Catholic views. Bush wrote an
apologetic letter to Cardinal John O'Connor and Pataki stressed his
own Catholic roots, something he rarely does, as he defended the
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a longtime contributor to Bush spent $2 million on
television ads that ran in New York, California and Ohio, attacking
McCain's environmental record and praising Bush's. While McCain
complained to the Federal Election Commission, the Bush camp
insisted it had nothing to do with the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did run ads in New York attacking McCain for supposedly
being opposed to funding for breast cancer programs. McCain, whose
sister has been diagnosed with breast cancer, demanded an apology
and said he was not opposed to such funding, only the manner in
which it was being authorized by Congress. Bush refused to withdraw
the ads.
</P>
<P>
   One McCain supporter, Rep. Peter King of Long Island, called the
attacks ''the sleaziest political ads I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki conceded ''it's been a tough race,'' but maintained
''it's probably a good thing for the Republican Party.''

<HEADLINE> Identity Theft Cases Said on Rise  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the millions of Americans now wedded to
their computers for household purchases, banking and entertainment,
Maureen Mitchell seemed an unlikely target to have her identity
stolen through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the registered nurse from Ohio nor her husband bank on
the Net. They don't make cyber-purchases and both carefully protect
their credit information by getting all receipts when using a
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't enough. And only now, after an identity theft ring
purchased two vehicles, obtained bank loans and opened numerous
credit accounts at stores using her and her husband's identity,
Mitchell said the full extent of the damage to her financial
well-being isn't known.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if other accounts are still outstanding. This
has a huge impact on your life,'' Mitchell told members of the
Senate Judiciary subcommittee on technology, terrorism and
government information Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was held to discuss the effectiveness of the
Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence law passed in 1998 to help
officials combat the growing problem of pilfered identities.
</P>
<P>
   Identity theft occurs when someone hijacks a consumer's personal
identifying information such as a name, address, credit card or
Social Security number and uses the information to open new charge
accounts or purchase merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   A recent General Accounting Office report said the number of
consumer inquiries to the fraud victimization department of Trans
Union, the credit bureau, increased from 35,235 in 1992 to 522,922
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Social Security Administration conducted 1153 social
security number misuse investigations in 1997 compared to just 305
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increase in inquiries, there is no comprehensive way
to tally the incidence of so-called identity fraud because it
encompasses a wide variety of illegal activities that can be part
of larger financial crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, a conviction for identity theft carries a
maximum 15 years jail sentence, a fine and forfeiture of any
personal property used to commit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The law also mandates that the Federal Trade Commission assist
people have had their identities stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Az, who sponsored the bill, said the law seems
to be working and that in 1999, 1,350 people were charged under the
law and 644 people were sentenced. Of those sentenced, 407 entered
guilty pleas.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are few clearer violations of personal privacy than
actually having your identity stolen and used to commit a crime,''
Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell knows the pain firsthand. She said she has spent more
than 400 hours trying to clear her name and restore her credit.
</P>
<P>
   Though a suspect was arrested, Mitchell said neither she nor
authorities know exactly how her personal information was
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to know how it was accomplished,'' Mitchell said.

<HEADLINE> US: Time Ripe for Cyprus Settlement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) -- Leaders in Cyprus now have the
opportunity to reunify their island after 25 years of
military-enforced partition, a U.S. envoy to the island said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Moses, who arrived Tuesday at Larnaca airport, said
President Clinton had encouraged him to talk to both Greek and
Turkish Cypriots about steps toward a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best time for the parties to reach a comprehensive
settlement,'' Moses said. ''All the factors are there to make this
possible. All we need is the political will and commitment on the
island.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded in July 1974
following a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece. A
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only recognized by
Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
</P>
<P>
   Moses' visit is part of a new international effort to promote a
new round of reconciliation talks between the rival Greek and
Turkish Cypriot leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The special U.N. envoy for Cyprus, Alvaro de Soto, also was in
Cyprus for his first visit to the island.
</P>
<P>
   De Soto conducted two rounds of indirect talks between President
Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader, and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash in New York in December and in Geneva in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Sir David Hannay, the British special envoy, is due to arrive in
Cyprus next week.
</P>
<P>
   The envoys hope to prepare the ground for a third round of talks
due to begin in New York on May 23.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Security Council resolutions call for reunification under a
two-state confederation, the withdrawal of foreign troops and the
return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   However, Turkey has rejected the resolutions and demanded
recognition of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.

<HEADLINE> 4,000 Oscar Ballots Are Missing  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Ten mailbags with all 4,000 Oscar
ballots were missing Tuesday in a real Hollywood whodunit for
Academy Awards executives, a distinguished accounting firm and the
Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the mystery was solved in the early afternoon when
postal workers found two of the missing sacks, Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences spokesman John Pavlik said. They had been
hauled from the 90210 post office to a bulk mail warehouse in South
Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have tracked them in the third-class system and found
some of the sacks in the general mail facility,'' post office
spokeswoman Terri Bouffiou said. ''We anticipate finding them all
there.
</P>
<P>
   A week after mailing the ballots, tucked in business envelopes
with 33-cent, first-class postage, the Academy learned members
still hadn't received them.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for returning ballots is March 21. The Oscars are
March 26.
</P>
<P>
   ''We mailed the ballots, 4,000 of them, to Academy members last
Wednesday and Price Waterhouse Coopers took the 10 mailbags to the
Beverly Hills Post Office and left them there as would anybody,''
Pavlik said.
</P>
<P>
   The mailing had been treated with considerable fanfare by the
Oscar people, who invite the news media to witness the annual
ritual at the Academy's offices.
</P>
<P>
   If all of the ballots aren't found, the numbers on them will be
invalidated and new ones will be printed and mailed as early as
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots have been lost by the post office before. In 1982,
nominating ballots were mistakenly stuck into a bin marked for
nonpriority bulk mail. They were found in time.

<HEADLINE> Rail Merger Hearing Opens  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two railroad executives on Tuesday defended
their plan to create the biggest railroad in North America through
a merger, but rail customers pleaded with government regulators to
slow the trend toward consolidation in the rail industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the industry think it's time to take a ''breather,''
Linda Morgan, chairman of the Surface Transportation Board, said in
opening a hearing where 170 shippers, railroad executives,
government officials, labor leaders and Wall Street analysts are to
testify over four days.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 people attended the hearing, which was prompted by
the proposed $6 billion merger of Burlington Northern Santa Fe and
Canadian National Railway, creating a network of 50,000 miles of
track from Nova Scotia to Los Angeles and the Gulf of Mexico to
Vancouver, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   A string of mergers during the 1990s caused rail car shortages,
shipping delays and pushed down stock prices, and more
consolidation now might lead to more instability, Morgan said.
Recent consolidation has left two major railroads in the East; two
in the West; and two in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''If our dilemma sounds a bit like a vicious cycle -- service
problems undermine confidence, which undermines investment, which
in turn undermines improved service -- it is,'' Morgan said. ''And
to me, the best way to break the cycle is to restore some stability
to the rail sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said that if the board approves the Burlington-Canadian
merger, other railroads may also want to combine to better position
themselves in the marketplace. North America could wind up with
just two or three large railroads, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Krebs, chairman of Burlington Northern, said the proposal
should not be judged on problems of past consolidations. A
moratorium would further destabilize the industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers in the 1990s -- CSX and Norfolk Southern's takeover of
Conrail, the Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger and the coupling
of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe -- caused serious service
problems, testified Paul Tellier, chief executive officer of
Canadian National. Now, they're seeking protection from the board.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just want to delay change until they can recover from
their own service difficulties and strengthen their position as to
any further mergers,'' Tellier said.
</P>
<P>
   CSX Chairman John Snow acknowledged the problems of past
mergers, but says even the prospect of another merger is causing
concern among investors as well as CSX employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They worry about their future,'' Snow said. ''Will there be
another round of mergers? Who will be my next boss? What is
happening to the value of my stock that I was planning to use for
my kids' education?''
</P>
<P>
   Railroad customers who depend on trains to get their products to
market also are staunch opponents of more consolidation right now.
</P>
<P>
   ''The next merger approved -- regardless of the merger partners --
will inevitable cause a domino effect, the outcome, in all
likelihood, being a two-railroad system throughout North America,''
said Diane Duff, who directs the Alliance for Rail Competition, a
coalition of rail customers pushing for laws and regulations that
promote more competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some regions, such as Buffalo, service has been so bad that
customers have been forced to shift production to other regions,''
she said, adding that some rail customers have started using trucks
instead of trains.

   Dow Ends Off 374; Nasdaq Under 5000
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials plummeted nearly 375
points today after an earnings warning from Procter &AMP; Gamble
unnerved investors already worried about profits at blue-chip and
industrial companies. The Dow's plunge dragged the broader market
lower and overshadowed the Nasdaq composite index's first foray
past 5,000. The Dow fell 374.47 to close at 9,796.03, its
fourth-biggest one-day point drop. The Dow was off than 400 points
in late trading before edging higher just before the close. The
Nasdaq, which had soared more than 100 points to 5,006.78 in early
trading, finished lower as profit-taking and computer-driven
trading that kicked in at the 5,000 mark sapped its strength. The
Nasdaq composite index fell 57.05 to 4,847.80.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Products Stocks Are Hit
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble's announcement of lower
expectations fed investor fears that other blue-chip and industrial
companies might warn of similar troubles in the coming weeks.
Companies are scheduled to report their first-quarter earnings next
month. And Merrill Lynch downgraded the entire consumer products
sector, depressing stocks including Colgate Palmolive and Kimberly
Clark. Those companies have not issued any warnings about earnings.
Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch, said P&AMP;G's
struggles with rising costs of materials may have sparked worries
that inflation is rearing up at the most basic levels of the
economy.

   P&AMP;G Issues Disappointing Forecast
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.'s management said today
it expects third-quarter earnings per share to be 10 percent to 11
percent below a year ago to 64 or 65 cents a share, compared with
the company's previous estimate of an increase of 7 percent to 9
percent. Analysts had been expecting earnings of about 78 cents per
share. Earnings per share for the fiscal year are now expected to
be up about 7 percent versus the 13 percent increase that P&AMP;G had
anticipated, management said. The company's fiscal year ends June
30. P&AMP;G shares fell 26 15/16 to close at 60{.

   Productivity Surges in 4th Quarter
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A key to economic prosperity that helps keep
inflation in check took its biggest leap in seven years, rising at
a 6.4 percent rate at the end of 1999. But the surge in U.S.
workers' productivity didn't change economists' predictions of
higher interest rates in the coming months. Productivity -- output
per hour worked -- was even stronger than the government previously
estimated for the fourth quarter and exceeded the stellar 5 percent
annual rate of growth posted in the third quarter, the Labor
Department said today.

   Boeing Slows Deliveries of Jets
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co.'s manufacture and delivery of
jetliners, already slowed by labor strife, is now up against
another delaying factor: replacing substandard fasteners on a
number of planes. The fasteners, made from an aluminum alloy that
makes them prone to cracking, were installed on wings, engine
housings and parts of the fuselage in planes that entered Boeing's
Seattle-area production lines since December, a company spokesman
said. The company also determined that 20 aircraft currently in
service may also have defective fasteners. The fasteners on all 20
planes -- which are 737, 757 and 777 jets -- have been tracked down
and are all located in the planes' engine housings. Boeing
officials would not identify the airlines involved. There have been
no reports of fastener failures.

   EBay Fuels Used-Car Auction Site

   ATLANTA (AP) -- EBay Inc. and Autotrader.com have created a new

trucks online. Chip Perry, president and chief executive of
Atlanta-based Autotrader.com, said today that the companies hope to
attract both sellers and dealers, offering them a cheaper way to
advertise used cars than traditional newspaper classifieds.
Autotrader.com already offers 1.5 million used-car listings,
connecting customers to 40,000 auto dealers and 250,000 private
sellers. EBay, the world's largest online trading site, claims a
community of 10 million buyers and sellers.

   VeriSign Buying Network Solutions
</P>

   NEW YORK (AP) -- VeriSign Inc., a leading provider of Internet
encryption technology, is buying Network Solutions Inc. in a $21
billion deal. The idea is to offer businesses a range of Web
services, from setting up Internet sites to securing transactions.
Network Solutions once was the sole registry for domain names on
the Internet. But since the registration market was opened last
year to competition, the company has been selling additional
services, such as helping companies start Web sites and security
services. VeriSign, for its part, has attracted growing demand for
its range of sophisticated encryption products and consulting
services, which help businesses encode e-mail, Web site
transactions and sensitive Internet information.

   USDA Plans Organic Food Standards
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New rules proposed today for organic food will
provide the first uniform, national standards for its production
and bar the use of genetically engineered crops, irradiation or
industrial sludge as a fertilizer. The standards, which are
expected to go into effect later this year, will be the ''most
comprehensive, strictest organic rules in the world'' and will
smooth the way for U.S. farmers to sell organic food in Europe and
other foreign markets, said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.

   German Banks Discuss Cooperation
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Deutsche Bank AG, the world's biggest
bank, said it is holding talks with rival Dresdner Bank AG amid
reports it seeks a merger to create a banking colossus with more
than $1.2 trillion in assets. A deal between the two banks would
create an institution even larger than the planned merger involving
Japanese giants Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and the Industrial
Bank of Japan. Those companies agreed in August to combine by 2005
to create a bank with just over $1 trillion in assets. Analysts
said a merger of the German institutions would help them join the
top echelon of worldwide investment banks, an ambition of both.

   EU Picks New IMF Candidate
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A spokesman for the current EU president,
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, says the new European
candidate to head the International Monetary Fund will be Horst
Koehler, who now heads the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development in London. He made the statement after Germany's
candidate to head the IMF announced his withdrawal from the running
because of U.S. opposition to his candidacy. Caio Koch-Weser,
Germany's deputy finance minister, had come under harsh criticism
from the United States as being unqualified for the post. The
15-nation European Union had given him its unanimous support after
months of debate and personal lobbying by Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder.

   Iraq: OPEC Won't Bow to Pressure
</P>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq expects OPEC to resist any U.S.
pressure to boost oil output in March to ease world prices,
according to Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid. Rashid predicted
that when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets
March 27 in Vienna it will not raise production levels before July,
when the third quarter begins. ''We are determined and prepared to
resist American pressure on OPEC states,'' the minister said in an
interview to appear Wednesday in the state-run newspaper
al-Jumhouriya. ''We expect that the decision to increase output
will be deferred until after the next summer.''

<HEADLINE> Cell Calls Bill Set For Senate  </HEADLINE>
By LIBBY QUAID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate supporters of a bill that seeks to
eliminate confusion over how cellular telephone calls are taxed
said Tuesday they are confident Congress will pass the measure this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless industry has joined forces with city and state
officials to lobby for the legislation, which would set taxes based
on a caller's billing address rather than where the call is placed
or relayed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce Committee heard no opposition during a
hearing. Sen. Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican who sponsored the
bill with Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and chaired the hearing, said
he expects the committee to approve the legislation quickly and
foresees no problems on the House or Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The current tax system is a patchwork of factors involving the
spot where a call is placed, the location of the relay tower that
picks up the signal and the site where a call is switched to its
recipient. That means the same call could be taxed several times as
a caller moves through localities and makes it difficult for
customers to decipher bills.
</P>
<P>
   Problems were exacerbated as the cellular telephone business
grew from an estimated $15 billion five years ago to $40 billion
today, said Tom Wheeler, head of the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers want to know: 'What's it going to cost me? Can I
expect some stability? And does it make sense?''' Wheeler told the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would have calls taxed by the state and local
governments with jurisdiction over a caller's billing address.
Supporters say the move streamlines the system for all involved --
cellular phone companies, state and local governments and cell
phone users.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think consumers like simplification and they like
consistency,'' said Irene French, the mayor of Merriam, Kan., who
testified on for the National League of Cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Committee has not scheduled a vote. Brownback noted
the panel chairman, Republican presidential candidate John McCain,
''obviously is out doing some other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation has been introduced in the House.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Peace in N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Peace in Northern Ireland
remains a top priority of President Clinton, one of his advisers
said Tuesday, and Britain announced a series of meetings designed
to revitalize the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland's new power-sharing government was suspended
Feb. 11 when the Ulster Unionists, the main Protestant party,
threatened to resign their Cabinet posts over the Irish Republican
Army's failure to begin disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. National Security Adviser Jim Steinberg, in Northern
Ireland for two days, appealed to the province's political parties
to work together to resolve the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am here mostly to listen and understand the perspective of
all the parties involved,'' he said after meeting the IRA-allied
Sinn Fein party and the mainline Social Democratic and Labor Party
and the Alliance party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is very important that we all remain involved,''
said Steinberg, who acts as Clinton's adviser on Northern Ireland
affairs. ''It is a high priority for the president and all the
parties and we are going to continue to work very hard at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg was also meeting with Britain's Northern Ireland
secretary Peter Mandelson, who announced a series of meetings in
Belfast starting Wednesday, including a roundtable discussion
involving the Irish and British governments and Northern Ireland
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said the meetings over the next few weeks are aimed at
reactivating the power-sharing administration ''at the earliest
possible moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration was formed as part of the 1998 Good Friday
peace accord. The administration was only 2 months old when
Mandelson decided the only way to save it was to lift its powers
and reimpose ''direct rule'' from London after the Ulster Unionists
threatened to resign their Cabinet posts.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Buy Back Some Public Debt  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Welcome to the brave new world of bulging
government surpluses. For the first time in 70 years, the U.S.
Treasury is buying back a part of the national debt -- $1 billion on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While the buyback will represent just a tiny drop of the $5.7
trillion national debt, the repurchases -- limited to 30-year bonds
sold between 1985 and 1990 -- will let the U.S. Treasury Department
do a test run of its new procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Thursday of the initial $1 billion buyback
effort was expected to be followed later this month with another $1
billion repurchase.
</P>
<P>
   Any investors who own 30-year bonds, which are to mature between
2015 and 2020, can offer to unload them through a process known as
a ''reverse auction,'' in which the government will select offers
on a competitive basis based on the lowest prices.
</P>
<P>
   The government is hoping to save in financing costs by redeeming
the bonds, which carry coupon interest rates as high as 11.25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers announced in January that
the government hoped to buy back up to $30 billion of the $5.7
trillion national debt this year. The administration's budget
projects that the entire $3.6 trillion of the national debt held by
the public could be wiped out by 2013 under current projections for
budget surpluses. The rest of the national debt is held by the
government's large trust funds, primarily Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the debt buybacks, Treasury has already reduced
the debt held by the public by $140 billion over the past two years
just by offering fewer new issues of the government securities
during its quarterly auctions.
</P>
<P>
   While Treasury officials initially said the government had not
repurchased any debt for at least a century, they said Tuesday that
further research indicated there were limited debt buybacks in the
1920s, the last ones occurring in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   The 1920s were the last decade in which the federal government
enjoyed consistent surpluses. Then the Great Depression and World
War II sent the government's ledgers into the red.
</P>
<P>
   The first budget surplus in 29 years -- $69.2 billion -- occurred
in 1998, followed by last year's $124.4 billion surplus, the first
back-to-back surpluses since 1956 and 1957, when Dwight Eisenhower
was president.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which counts elimination of soaring
budget deficits as one of its greatest achievements, has argued
that the most responsible thing to do with the excess cash is to
reduce the national debt, putting the government on a sounder
footing to deal with rising costs when the baby boom generation
begins retiring in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration and Republicans in Congress agree the
surpluses generated by Social Security payroll taxes should be
dedicated to paying down the debt, they are split on how to use the
non-Social Security surpluses, estimated to total $800 billion or
more over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would like to see more money returned to taxpayers
through tax cuts while the administration is proposing more modest
tax cuts and greater government spending.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,
said Tuesday that the surpluses resulted from Republican efforts to
restrain Clinton's spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the White House remembers debt relief in the fall if it
is tempted to complain that Congress isn't spending enough,''
Archer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials said anyone who wants to participate in this
week's buyback must do so through brokers, known as primary
dealers, who handle the initial sales of Treasury securities. And
the offers must be submitted by 11 a.m. EST Thursday to the New
York Federal Reserve. The winning offers will be announced around
midday Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Peru Board Won't Nullify Candidacy  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's election board refused to derail
President Alberto Fujimori's bid for a third term Tuesday, despite
allegations that about 1 million forged signatures were used to
register his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The National Elections Board, dominated by Fujimori appointees,
said Tuesday that the allotted period for verifying signatures had
passed when the alleged fraud was revealed last week.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's ombudsman, Jorge Santistevan, called for an investigation
after witnesses said they took part in the systematic forgery of
qualifying signatures for Fujimori's political party, Peru 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's leading newspaper, El Comercio, brought the witnesses to
Santistevan before publishing an exhaustive report about the
alleged election fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Santistevan and El Comercio have been the focus of
often critical reports by pro-government media.
</P>
<P>
   Television station Canal 2 has repeatedly led its morning news
segment with an ominously flashing word ''Conspiracy,'' intermixed
with interviews with citizens and analysts who accuse Santistevan
and local election observers of trying to undermine Peru's image in
the eyes of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   Bold headlines in tabloids accuse Santistevan and the owners of
El Comercio, an editorially conservative broadsheet, of being
communists.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Levitt, a senior political analyst who is in Peru
monitoring the elections for the Carter Center, said the attacks
appear to be a coordinated effort to discredit Santistevan's
organization. Santistevan has led the independent ombudsman office
since its inception in 1996. It ranks along with the Catholic
Church as Peru's most trusted institution.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged forgeries are the latest in a long list of
irregularities that has prompted international observers to deem
Peru unprepared for a clean and free elections on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, 61, has denied any personal involvement and said he
welcomes an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori was first elected as a political outsider in 1990 and
re-elected in 1995 by Peruvians grateful to him for capturing top
leftist rebel leaders and reversing the economic chaos of the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say his bid for a third consecutive term violates the
constitution.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Six suspected Islamic militants were
killed Tuesday in a clash with soldiers in western Algeria, the
security services said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Algerian soldiers were wounded in the clash, which occurred
in a high-rise building in Oran, 280 miles west of Algiers, the
services said in a statement carried by the official APS news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a peace drive by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika,
militants continue to operate in this North African nation, which
has been crippled by a bloody 8-year Islamic insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   A key element of Bouteflika's peace plan was the Jan. 13
deadline for Muslim rebels to surrender in exchange for a partial
amnesty. Bouteflika has said that more than 6,000 insurgents
accepted his amnesty offer and surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have refused to say how many insurgents remain active
but Bouteflika has promised ''a fight without mercy'' for those who
refuse to give up their arms.
</P>
<P>
   The militants have been fighting since 1992, when the army
canceled legislative elections that the now-outlawed Islamic
Salvation Front was poised to win. More than 100,000 people have
been killed since then.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Defends Missile-Defense  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN M. DONNELLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon defended its missile-defense
program against accusations that TRW, a top contractor in
developing the system, faked results of important tests and
overstated a vital component's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe we have overstated the results of this
program,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Schwartz, a former TRW engineer, has alleged that the
company doctored results from computer and flight tests of its
anti-missile sensor in order to make it look better to the
government, The New York Times reported Tuesday. The allegations
are contained in a false-claims suit filed by Schwartz against TRW.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is to decide this summer whether to begin
deploying a multibillion-dollar national missile defense system.
Its cost and impact on arms-control agreements have come under
increasing scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   TRW built the sensor for a Boeing kill vehicle, or warhead, to
be sent on a rocket into space. There it is supposed to intercept
enemy missiles, distinguish them from decoys with which an
adversary might surround its intercontinental missile, and then
destroy the missile. Schwartz alleges computer tests showed the
sensor doesn't work nearly as well as advertised. Moreover, she
says, a June 1997 flight test of how well the sensor detected a
missile in space did not fare nearly so well as TRW contended.
</P>
<P>
   TRW spokeswoman Marynoele Benson defended the company's record.
</P>
<P>
   ''As was the case with respect to other aspects of TRW's
performance under its contract with Boeing, TRW's results were
reviewed by two independent panels on behalf of the government,
each of which reached conclusions directly contrary to the
allegations Ms. Schwartz made in the litigation she filed,'' Benson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said a Raytheon kill vehicle, not the Boeing one used in
TRW's sensor, has been chosen for the system now undergoing tests,
although the Boeing and TRW kill vehicle remains a backup. In any
event, the sensor technology at issue in the earlier tests has
since been replaced on the TRW sensor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story is largely about a civil suit between a former
employee and her former employer,'' Bacon said. He noted that the
Justice Department saw insufficient merit in Schwartz's claims to
join her suit.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz told the Times the Pentagon originally planned to use
up to nine decoys in interception tests and reduced it to one once
it discovered how hard the job is.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Canaff, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon's Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization, said the program initially planned to
use nine decoys but that was later cut to one, not because of
performance questions but because the threat had changed. Tests in
October and January used one decoy and one mock enemy warhead, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of decoys for the next test, currently set for May,
has not been determined, she said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Comes Under Pressure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar came under late-day selling pressure
Tuesday after U.S. stocks tumbled for a second straight day.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 95.76 cents,
down from 95.90 cents late Monday. The dollar was quoted at 106.16
Japanese yen, down from 107.53 yen.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stocks declined after an earnings warning from consumer
products giant Procter &AMP; Gamble raised concerns among investors
about profits at blue-chip and industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrials plummeted nearly 375 points, on top of
a 197-point drop on Monday. The Nasdaq composite index, which lost
about 10 points on Monday, fell 57 points.
</P>
<P>
   The slump on Wall Street trickled over into the foreign-exchange
market. After overseas investors sold their stocks, they then sold
their dollars and repatriated the money in their local currencies,
said David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the selloff on Wall Street, the dollar was under
pressure as Japanese companies converted their overseas earnings
into yen ahead of the end of Japan's fiscal year on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Late in New York, the dollar also was quoted at 1.6791 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6772, and 1.4543 Canadian dollars, up slightly
from 1.4525. The British pound rose to $1.5793 from $1.5741.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0420 German
marks, up from 2.0399; 6.8486 French francs, up from 6.8414; and

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 374; Nasdaq Under 5000  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices plunged on Wall Street Tuesday, sending
the Dow Jones industrials down nearly 375 points, after Procter &AMP;
Gamble shocked investors with a warning that its profits will drop
far below expectations. The selling spilled over to usually buoyant
high-tech stocks and cut short the Nasdaq composite's first foray
past 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow fell 374.47 to close at 9,796.03, its fourth-biggest
one-day point drop and its lowest close since March 31, 1999. The
blue chips were off more than 400 points in late trading before
edging higher just before the close.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which soared more than 100 points to 5,006.78 in
early trading, turned lower amid profit-taking and
computer-programmed selling that kicked in at the 5,000 mark. The
Nasdaq finished down 57.01 at 4,847.84.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell sharply. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 fell 35.66 to 1,355.62, and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 6.17 to 595.47.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks sank after consumer products maker Procter &AMP;
Gamble issued a dramatic warning, saying it expects fiscal
third-quarter earnings of 64 or 65 cents per share, well below the
78 cents per share that Wall Street analysts were expecting. The
company, whose products include Pamper diapers and Tide detergent,
also said profits would be off for the entire second half of its
year.
</P>
<P>
   The company blamed higher costs for oil and pulp, raw materials
critical in the manufacture of many of its products. Procter &AMP;
Gamble's stock tumbled 25 7/16 to 62, accounting for nearly 130
points of the Dow's decline.
</P>
<P>
   The news unnerved investors already anxious about profits at
blue-chip and industrial companies, especially with most big
corporations scheduled to report first-quarter earnings next month.
The rest of March is likely to be particularly nerve-wracking for
Wall Street, because it is during the last few weeks of a quarter
that companies issue warnings about disappointing profits.
</P>
<P>
   Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch, said
P&AMP;G's struggles with rising costs of materials might have sparked
worries that inflation is beginning to accelerate at the most basic
levels of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need their soap and shampoo no matter what the economy is
doing,'' McCabe said. Yet those companies will be unable to
maintain or increase profits if the cost of oil and other materials
continues to escalate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch downgraded its ratings on the entire consumer
products sector, depressing stocks including Colgate Palmolive and
Kimberly Clark. Those companies have not issued any warnings about
earnings, but Colgate Palmolive fell 6 1/16 to 46} and Kimberly
Clark fell 5\ to 45].
</P>
<P>
   Other losers in the Dow included American Express, down 2~ to
126] and Coca-Cola, off 1 7/16 at 47 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Only Microsoft and Exxon Mobil contained the Dow's losses.
Microsoft rose 2\ to 92~ following a positive report from a Goldman
Sachs analyst, while Exxon Mobil rose 8 1/16 to 81, a beneficiary
of the latest rise in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Other oil stocks also closed sharply higher; Chevron rose 7 to
81 and Texaco gained 3| to 50\.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dow spiraling lower, investors paid little note to the
Nasdaq's first trip past 5,000. The technology-dominated index
crossed 5,000 just over two months after its first close above
4,000.
</P>
<P>
   In a bet that technology stocks are best prepared to thrive even
if the Federal Reserve continues raising interest rates this year,
investors have been buying those shares at the expense of nearly
every other corner of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq stocks first withstood the selling in the rest of the
market Tuesday, but then succumbed during the afternoon. Still, the
Nasdaq is still up about 19 percent in the year to date, compared
with a loss of about 15 percent for the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Nasdaq's incredible gains have left it
vulnerable to investors eager to collect some profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq has a history of having trouble penetrating major
new barriers,'' said Robert Stovall, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ''There's a strong impulse to take profits, because it
seems unbelievable that this thing can keep running.''
</P>
<P>
   A $21 billion merger stimulated the technology sector. VeriSign
Inc., a leading provider of Internet encryption technology, is
buying Network Solutions Inc., best known as a registry for domain
names on the Internet. Network Solutions soared 46 49/64 to 407
25/64, while VeriSign fell 47 7/16 to 200.
</P>
<P>
   The market's weakness surprised some analysts who had expected
stocks to rally on news Tuesday of improved productivity by
American workers. Economists consider healthy productivity gains
the key to sustaining economic growth without giving rise to
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Higher productivity is an unmitigated good for the economy,''
said Stan Shipley, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, noting that
the rise in productivity came along with a drop in labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Inflation just does not emerge from that mix,'' Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 1.61 billion shares,
compared with 1.28 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.8 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 1.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
fell 1.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> AM-CT--Arrest Shooting, 1st Ld-Writethru, 730  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- New Milford police Officer Scott Smith
testified Tuesday he thought his life was about to end seconds
before he fatally shot a suspect he was trying to arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Smith spent more than three hours on the witness stand at his
murder trial, recounting the foot chase and struggle on Dec. 29,
1998, that ended when he fired a single shot into Franklyn Reid's
back. Smith is the first police officer in Connecticut to be
charged with murder for an act in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   He maintains he was acting in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he yelled ''show me your hands'' over and over again
as he pursued Reid down Route 202, but Reid failed to respond.
Smith said he tried to force Reid to his knees on an embankment,
but Reid pushed his way back up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here I am, a police officer, holding a firearm at this guy and
he's not showing me his hands,'' said Smith, 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm getting more and more scared. I don't know what he's
thinking. ... I just couldn't make any sense out of it, and he was
scaring the crap out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   On a second attempt to force him down, Reid, on his knees and
with his back to Smith, moved very suddenly and seemed to be
groping in his mid-section. Smith said he believed Reid was
reaching for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that when Reid, with his back still to him, twisted
his left arm toward him, he fired. Reid was unarmed, but a folding
knife with a 2-inch serrated blade was found in a jacket near his
body.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he made that classic move, I thought 'Oh (expletive), I'm
dead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought of my mother, my father ... I thought of my sister,
and how much I was going to miss them and just how much I loved
them,'' Smith said, his voice quivering.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fired my gun one time.''
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Waterbury State's Attorney John
Connelly -- the case's special prosecutor -- suggested that Smith had
other motives.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly asked Smith repeatedly if it would be good for his
career as a police officer to apprehend Reid, who had been
well-known to the town's police department. Reid, 27, had been
wanted on several warrants including threatening, breach of peace
and failure to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who had been on the force two years at the time of the
shooting and had been given a temporary assignment in the detective
bureau, denied he thought about his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was never a consideration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly pressed him, asking, ''Wouldn't it be nice and look
good on Officer Smith's record if he could say that he was the one
police officer who single-handedly captured Franklyn Reid?''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, Smith acknowledged the arrest would likely look
good.
</P>
<P>
   Smith remained composed throughout most of his testimony,
speaking in a clear voice and looking at the jury. The only time he
showed emotion was when he told the jury that he thought of his
family when he believed he was about to be killed by Reid.
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination, Connelly pounced on Smith's detached
testimony, suggesting that Smith did not care what happened to Reid
because when asked about shooting Reid, he repeatedly said, ''I
couldn't believe what had just happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Did you ever say once, 'I couldn't believe what just happened
to Franklyn Reid?'' Connelly asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I did not,'' Smith answered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because you didn't care what happened to Franklyn Reid,''
Connelly said, raising his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Smith answered: ''Of course I cared what happened to Franklyn
Reid.''
</P>
<P>
   Connelly was so vociferous in his cross-examination that Judge
Charles Gill admonished him to lower his voice.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Connelly suddenly sat down on the courtroom floor,
making a loud thumping sound, to illustrate how he claimed Reid
complied with Smith's commands to get on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Connelly, you weren't there -- I was. That's not the way it
happened,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly also pressed Smith on why he made the decision to get
out of his unmarked car and chase Smith alone, instead of waiting
for his partner or for backup.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things happened so fast,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ''...And the decisions you make in life you have to live with,
don't you, Officer Smith?''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's correct,'' Smith replied.

<HEADLINE> Colombian TV Host Flees Country  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A popular Colombian television
personality says he is fleeing the country after receiving death
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Gonzalez, 66, better known by his screen name
''Pacheco,'' declined to offer details on the threats he has
received just weeks after the kidnapping of one of his cousins,
journalist Guillermo Cortes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last thing I want to do is play the martyr,'' Gonzalez
told The Associated Press on Tuesday. ''I know there are a lot of
people going through much worse moments than myself ... but I am
leaving because it's no longer possible to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has been one of the country's most popular
personalities since his first television show debuted in 1956. He
has hosted variety shows, specials and interviews with figures from
the worlds of politics, sports and show business.
</P>
<P>
   ''To leave here is to leave behind everything I have in life,''
said Gonzalez, who was born in Spain but came in live here as a
boy. ''My heart is here.'' Gonzalez did not say where he was going
or when he would leave.
</P>
<P>
   Cortes, 74, a television news executive, was kidnapped Jan. 22
from his farm on the outskirts of Bogota. The military and
Colombian news media have blamed the leftist rebels of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group, known by its Spanish initials FARC, promised to
investigate whether one of its units was holding Cortes, but has
not made any public statement since.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, ''the only thing I know is that we're going from
bad to worse, we're killing each other off,'' Gonzalez said of the
war that has raged in the country during the last four decades.
''The best thing about this country is its people, but just look at
what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Personalities can put their lives at risk by publicly
criticizing the brutal and intolerant actors in Colombia's civil
conflict. The country's most beloved satirist, 39-year-old Jaime
Garzon, was assassinated on Aug. 13 as he drove to his morning job
at a Bogota radio station.

<HEADLINE> Peso Soars After Confidence Vote  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A top credit-rating firm gave Mexico a strong
vote of confidence on Tuesday in a move that will likely increase
foreign investment and make it cheaper for Mexican companies to
borrow money. The peso soared, interest rates fell and stocks rose.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service upgraded Mexico's credit rating from
junk to investment grade, essentially saying it was confident
Mexico could pay back its foreign debt. Chile had been the only
Latin American country with such a grade since Colombia's credit
rating was cut last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mexico now is part of the big leagues,'' said Renato
Grandmont, a Latin American equities strategist for Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole exercise is about confidence,'' said Treasury
Secretary Jose Angel Gurria. ''It is an injection of confidence
about what we can do with our own future.''
</P>
<P>
   The rating makes it cheaper for Mexican companies and the
government to borrow money, and makes it possible for many
investment funds whose rules allow them to invest only in
investment-grade countries to put money into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not a sea change, since Standard &AMP; Poor's, another key
rating firm, still places Mexico two notches below investment
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ''This puts Mexico, at least for Moody's, into the company of
really good debtors,'' said Lawrence Krohn, chief economist for
Latin America at DLJ Securities in New York. ''It will be perceived
as a step toward being a developed country, and it should be
perceived as such.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City's stock market reacted quickly, jumping as much as
4.2 percent to 8,296.71 points, a record high. A dramatic fall in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, dragged it down in the
afternoon to close at 8,005.95 points, leaving it with half-percent
gain for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The peso also strengthened against the dollar, closing at its
strongest level in nearly a year: 9.270, compared to its open of
9.312. And interest rates dropped, with the bellwether 28-day
Treasury bill rate falling 1.01 percentage points, from 14.96
percent to 13.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Moody's said the upgrade reflects ''a lower
relative foreign currency debt burden underpinned by a dynamic
export sector well integrated into the North American economy and
increasingly integrated with the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The higher credit rating also was a vote of confidence in
Mexico's political system. Mexico has been wracked by economic
crises during each of the last four presidential transitions, which
occur every six years. Presidential elections are scheduled for
July.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is surprising that this happened before the elections,''
said Sergio Sarmiento, a newspaper columnist and television
commentator. ''It means they don't expect a transitional crisis. It
means they don't expect the elections to derail the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody's noted improvements in the political system in its
statement. ''The widespread consensus on the importance of sound
financial policies combined with a vibrant multiparty democracy
provides additional support to continued fiscal discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poors ranks Mexico two notches below investment
grade, citing weakness in the banking sector, the need for
privatization of the electricity sector and government dependence
on oil revenue. It says Mexico has a ''positive outlook,'' however,
meaning the rating could go up over the next year.

<HEADLINE> Voters turn out for Connecticut's Super Tuesday primary  </HEADLINE>
sdstfmiscrh
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Voting was expected to be slightly
heavier than usual as Connecticut voters went to the polls for the
Super Tuesday primary. At stake were 67 delegates to the Democratic
national convention and 25 to the Republican national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz said that while primary
turnout is often low, this election was expected to be an
exception.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because there's been a very lively debate both on the
Republican side and the Democratic side, I think that generated a
lot of interest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we'll see a turnout in excess of 30 percent, maybe
even close to 40 percent,'' she said, rather than the usual 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In West Hartford, election officials said the early turnout
showed about 25 percent of registered Republicans and 20 percent of
registered Democrats casting ballots. But officials from both
parties said they expected an after-work rush.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidates were Vice President Al Gore and former
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. Both visited the state in the weeks
preceding the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidates were Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
Arizona Sen. John McCain and former ambassador Alan Keyes. McCain
spoke in Fairfield on Friday, while Bush had an airport rally in
Windsor Locks on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   None of the candidates was in the state Tuesday, where the polls
opened at 6 a.m. and closed at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Only voters affiliated with one of the major parties could vote
Tuesday. Democrats and Republicans who went to the polls seemed
more influenced by emotion than by issues raised by the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Taylor, of Hartford, cast his ballot at the West End Fire
Station. He said he was voting for Gore mainly because he likes
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has more experience than Bradley and he's helped President
Clinton get the country in great shape,'' said the 51-year-old
sanitation worker.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Parker, 71, of Hartford, a retired church secretary who
also voted at the fire station, said she chose for Gore ''because
he's straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bradley's OK, but I like the way Gore backed up the president
during all that trouble,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Helen Kaminsky, 76, a retired waitress who voted at the
Whiting Lane School in West Hartford, said she was voting for
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could say it's sort of a vote against Gore. Also, I'm
Catholic, but I'm pro-choice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Joe Pizzella, 36, a marketing manager who cast his
ballot at the school in the affluent neighborhood, said he simply
liked Bush better than McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush just seems presidential in appearance and the way he
speaks,'' Pizzella said. ''I think he would be a refreshing
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Norton, 69, a Republican who worked as an insurance manager
before retiring, said she thinks Bush will make a dependable
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I voted for him even though even though I disagree with him on
abortion,'' she said. ''I'm not sure McCain is stable; I always get
the feeling he's about to blow, even when he's smiling.''

<HEADLINE> Tuesday's Commodities Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crude oil futures rocketed 6 percent higher Tuesday, crashing
through the $33- and $34-a-barrel price barriers for the first time
since late 1990 as nervousness about shrinking world supplies
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Most other energy commodities also rose.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, corn and copper tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   No dramatic developments were responsible for oil's latest rise,
even though the near-term contract, for April delivery, jumped
$1.95 to settle at $34.13 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after reaching as high as $34.20.
</P>
<P>
   In a tight market, confirmation that Nigeria had halted crude
loadings because of an oil workers' strike and more evidence of a
rift within OPEC between Iran and Saudi Arabia were enough to
ignite prices.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that data released by the American Petroleum Institute
after the market closed would show stockpiles falling further --
unsupported, as it turned out -- also contributed to the increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every drop of oil is precious right now, so if you lose a drop
it causes concern,'' said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst for
Alaron Trading Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With no evidence that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is near a decision on raising production as its March 27
meeting approaches, the bull market has taken on a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who were short were just throwing in the towel,''
said Bill O'Grady, senior energy analyst for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons.
''You can get your brains handed to you if you're short'' -- holding
contracts that bet on lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   The closing price was the highest since it hit $35.53 on Nov. 8,
1990, when thousands of U.S. troops were in the Middle East,
preparing for the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's surge, prices have now more than tripled since
hitting a 12-year low of less than $11 a barrel in December 1998,
before OPEC slashed production to force prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   Even the all-time high of $40.42, reached Oct. 11, 1990, no
longer seems unthinkable.

   ''I'm not predicting $40 a barrel, but would it shock me? Not
really,'' said O'Grady. ''When you get markets like this, it's very
difficult. Everybody knows it's going to go down, but they don't
know where from.''
</P>
<P>
   The API data may slow the bull run. They showed that U.S.
gasoline inventories, instead of declining as expected, rose 4.016
million barrels last week. Crude stocks increased by 7.624 million
barrels, also far exceeding analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. distillate stocks, which includes heating oil,
were down 356,000 barrels, according to the data.
</P>
<P>
   Among other energy commodities, April heating oil rose 2.93
cents to 82.38 cents a gallon, April unleaded gasoline rose 3.66

   Corn fell on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late-session
selloff prompted by the approach of weather systems bringing rain

</P>
<P>
   Prices had risen sharply Monday and continued their climb
Tuesday morning as record-high temperatures in the mid-70s across
the Midwest heightened concern about soil dryness as spring
planting approaches. But new forecasts showing that much of the

plummeting.

uneasiness about the future of copper demand in the face of the
huge U.S. stock market decline. The Dow Jones industrials plummeted
nearly 375 points Tuesday, its lowest close since March 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> UN Makes Israeli Withdrawl Plans  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan confirmed
Tuesday that the United Nations has quietly been making contingency
plans for its peacekeeping force in south Lebanon to deal with the
possible unilateral withdrawal of Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has gained prominence following the Israeli Cabinet's
decision on Sunday to withdraw from south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
   Annan stressed that the ''ideal'' solution would be a withdrawal
that was part of a peace agreement between Israel, Syria and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But with Israel-Syria peace talks suspended, he said the United
Nations was considering contingency plans for its peacekeeping
forces in case of a unilateral Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Interim Force in south Lebanon was deployed in 1978 to
confirm the withdrawal of invading Israeli troops. It remained,
even after Israel again invaded in 1982 and set up a border enclave
to protect its northern territory from cross-border attacks by
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials have been discussing among themselves how an
Israeli withdrawal would affect the force and what arrangements
should be made to keep the peace in the region if Israel does
leave, diplomats and U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan told a news conference that the United Nations wasn't at
the stage yet of discussing its plans over an Israeli withdrawal
publicly -- or even privately with the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, in all these situations, where you have military
presence, you do contingency planning and look at different
scenarios,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Beilin, Israel's justice minister and the leading dove in
the government, has said repeatedly he wants ''international
guarantees'' that Israel's northern border would be safe from
attack after a pullout if there is no agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   That could conceivably include a revamped and expanded U.N.
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, however, said the United Nations hadn't approached any
potential troop contributors to beef up the existing force.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and U.N. officials have mentioned the idea of a
multinational force that could replace the existing U.N. mission --
whose mandate would essentially be fulfilled with an Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Israel last month, French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin suggested a possible French force be deployed to
south Lebanon, an arrangement that could increase pressure on Syria
to rein in Hezbollah even absent an agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's firm deadline for a withdrawal presses Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon, either to return to suspended peace talks
or to continue hostilities with its leverage impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Israel says Syria uses the low-level war in Lebanon as a means
of pressuring Israel to give back the Golan Heights, captured from
Syria in 1967.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Prepares $9B Kosovo Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans plan to push a $9 billion bill
through a House committee this week to pay for drug fighting in
Colombia, military operations in Kosovo and other programs, nearly
doubling the amount President Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the legislation, obtained Tuesday by The Associated
Press, shows that lawmakers would boost Clinton's $5.2 billion
proposal with money for the military's troubled health insurance
system, rising Pentagon fuel costs, and road repair and housing
loan costs attributed to damage from last fall's Hurricane Floyd
and other emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see some emergency items that were not included'' in
Clinton's request, said House Appropriations Committee Chairman
Bill Young, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, for the current fiscal year, is likely to pass the
House Appropriations Committee on Thursday. But from there, its
fate is uncertain in what will be this election year's first test
of what legislators want to do with the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say conservatives are unhappy over the bill's price tag,
which is only likely to grow as it moves through Congress with
added money for the Pentagon and farmers. They are also upset that
nearly all of the bill would be paid for from this year's projected
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many Democrats are unhappy with the $1.6 billion
Clinton wants -- and the bill provides -- for combatting drug
traffickers in Colombia and other Andean nations. They say the
proposal risks U.S. involvement in what has been a bloody Colombian
civil war, and that more attention should be paid to preventing
drug use at home.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
said he planned to push his version of the bill through his panel
in two weeks. He said Tuesday that Clinton's request for military
construction in Colombia ''bothers us'' and that much of that
spending would probably be left for later this year, when Congress
considers spending bills for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill changes Clinton's drug-fighting request slightly
by adding money for Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The House package provides all $2 billion Clinton requested for
American troops in Kosovo. But it provides just $12 million of the
$93 million he sought for aid to Kosovo, and limited that to U.S.
participation in international police activities there.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also ignores Clinton's request for $210 million for
debt relief for poor countries, an effort the administration and
Congress joined in last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also repeal gimmicks enacted last fall that
had pushed roughly $10 billion in spending into fiscal 2001, in
effect rolling them back into this year. This will help lawmakers
working on next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   The gimmicks included military and civilian pay days,
contractual payments, and grants for medical research and some
social services that last fall were delayed until next Oct. 1 -- the
start of fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also:
</P>
<P>
   --Provides $1.5 billion for the military's growing fuel bill,
caused by soaring oil prices, and $855 million for Defense
Department medical insurance program -- neither of which Clinton
requested.
</P>
<P>
   --Has $600 million Clinton sought to help poor families pay
utility bills.
</P>
<P>
   --Adds more than $1 billion to Clinton's $1.1 billion request for
natural disasters and other emergencies, including funds for NASA,
highway repairs, rural housing loans, and combatting crop diseases.
</P>
<P>
   --Provides $15 million to correct fire safety hazards identified
in the U.S. Capitol.

<HEADLINE> Regents: More students taking, passing Regents Exams  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- High school students across the state are
proving the naysayers wrong, with more passing the Regents exams
than ventured to take them three years ago, top state education
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A powerful message of success brought to you by the young men
and women of the state of New York state,'' Regents Chancellor Carl
Hayden said of the latest school report cards. This is the fourth
year the state has compiled report cards on every public school
throughout New York.
</P>
<P>
   The state is phasing in a plan to require that students pass
Regents tests in five subjects by 2003 in order to get a high
school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Students who entered high school in 1997 must pass both the
Regents English and mathematics exams before they graduate
beginning in 2001; exams in global studies, U.S. history and
government and science are being phased in at a rate of one each
year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest report card data show that students and teachers are
rising to the challenge, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of students who took the English exam scored at
least 55 in June, compared to 63 percent in 1997 and 65 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Results of other tests were not as impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Though the number of students scoring at least 55 on mathematics
I, global studies, U.S. history and government, and biology is
climbing, at close to a third of those who took the test failed.
</P>
<P>
   State Education Commissioner Richard Mills said he was worried
about the performance of New York City students on the mathematics
I exam. Of the 87 percent of Education Department-tracked students
who took the exam, only 47 percent scored 55 or higher. The failure
rate may point to deficiencies in the curriculum, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of tracked students taking the biology exam has risen
five percentage points, and the number of these students scoring 55
or above rose four percentage points, to 55 percent. That means 45
percent of the 123,000 students tested failed.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said he was not that worried, based on the way schools
rose to meet the English standard.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we have reason to be cautious with the early returns on
mathematics, the ramp-up in the other subject matter is really very
closely paralleling the way it looked with respect to English,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, success rates on the tests varied by district type.
Among affluent or ''low need'' districts, passage rates on each of
the tests ranged from 85 percent to 90 percent. That's opposed to
52 percent to 68 percent of ''big four'' districts -- Buffalo,
Syracuse, Rochester, and Yonkers -- and 71 percent to 87 percent of
students in ''average need,'' districts passing.
</P>
<P>
   Mills and Hayden said students in poor, or ''high need,'' rural
districts performed much better than their counterparts in urban
and suburban districts. The passage rate among students taking math
in urban and suburban high-need districts was 69 percent compared
to 87 percent in the rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Couric Hosts Week On Colon Cancer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Today'' show host Katie Couric on Tuesday
allowed NBC to broadcast footage of the inside of her own intestine
to spread awareness of colon cancer and urge people to get screened
for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Couric, who lost her husband to colon cancer two years ago, is
the host of a weeklong series on the disease on ''Today,'' starting
with Tuesday's airing of her colonoscopy. The procedure involves a
doctor using a flexible tube to look into the colon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Katie's point is that if I am going to go out and tell people
to get screened, I should go out and get screened myself,'' said
''Today'' show spokeswoman Allison Gollust. ''She feel's that
people have a bit of trepidation when it comes to the procedure
itself, so this was an attempt to demystify it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gollust said there was ''an overwhelming reaction'' from viewers
-- all positive.
</P>
<P>
   Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths
in the United States, with an estimated 129,400 cases and 56,600
fatalities reported in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Because the disease is slow to develop, early detection and
treatment can significantly reduce the chance of death.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Couric's husband, TV legal analyst Jay Monahan,
the malignancy wasn't discovered until it had spread.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Firm Buying U.S. Foodservice  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DISHNEAU, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- International grocer Royal Ahold N.V. plans to
broaden its scope by buying U.S. Foodservice, the nation's
second-largest supplier of food to restaurants, hotels and
cafeterias, for $2.7 billion in cash, the companies said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, if approved by antitrust regulators, would give
Netherlands-based Royal Ahold more muscle in negotiations with food
manufacturers and a foothold in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ''This new acquisition makes Royal Ahold a multichannel food
provider. We're excited, and see a very positive future ahead,''
Royal Ahold president Cees van der Hoeven said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, U.S.
Foodservice shares jumped $6.12{ or 34 percent, to $24.37{. U.S.
shares of Royal Ahold rose 6\ cents to $22.93}
</P>
<P>
   Rajan A. Chaudhry, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston,
lauded the deal, saying it would give the combined companies more
leverage in negotiating purchases of bulk supplies for U.S.
Foodservice customers -- including the Perkins, Subway and Pizzeria
Uno restaurant chains -- as well as for Royal Ahold's U.S. grocery
stores -- BI-LO, Finast, Giant, Stop &AMP; Shop and Tops.
</P>
<P>
   One result could be steady or lower prices at restaurants that
buy ingredients from U.S. Foodservice, according to Burt Flickinger
III, of Reach Marketing, a retailing and marketing consulting firm
in Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Restaurants typically mark up food to three times their cost.
If Ahold provides lower costs, consumers will share in the savings,
and ultimately will pay lower prices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Foodservice chairman Jim Miller said the deal was in the
best interests of the Columbia-based company's shareholders. He
said U.S. Foodservice expects no layoffs in its branch offices
''and very minimal impact in its corporate office.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In fact, U.S. Foodservice expects to add jobs in the long run,
based on expected future growth and Royal Ahold's past acquisition
experience,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Foodservice has about 13,250 employees. Its stock has
fallen sharply recently, reaching a 52-week low of $11.31\ last
month, amid concerns over slowing growth and rising costs. Its net
income for the fiscal year ending June 30 was $83.2 million on
sales of $6.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Cigna To Settle Whistleblower Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Insurer Cigna Corp. agreed Tuesday to pay the
federal government nearly $9 million to settle allegations it
overbilled the Health Care Financing Administration by
approximately that amount in a case initiated by a Cigna employee.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia-based Cigna denied any wrongdoing or liability in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Whistleblower Peter Scott, a 40-year Cigna employee, will
receive $840,000 of the $8,988,500 settlement for his part in the
prosecution, according to his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's complaint alleged that Connecticut General Life
Insurance Co., a Cigna subsidiary, knowingly double-counted paper
costs for documents it printed and sent to Medicare recipients from
1990 through 1997. Each document was printed on both sides but the
insurer billed the government for two sheets of paper, the
complaint alleged.
</P>
<P>
   ''We count on Medicare contractors to be the first line of
defense against fraud, waste and abuse. When they don't play by the
rules, it threatens the integrity of the entire program,'' U.S.
Attorney Lynne Battaglia said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, a Cigna manager in Easton, Pa., discovered the
double-billing and reported it to his supervisors, according to his
attorney, Steve Simms.
</P>
<P>
   Cigna then passed Scott over for a promotion and isolated him
within the company, prompting him to file a complaint in U.S.
District Court in Baltimore under the False Claims Act, Simms said.

<HEADLINE> Lucent To Up Fiber-optic Business  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Lucent Technologies Inc. plans to
invest more than $650 million over the next two years to expand its
fiber-optic cable business.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent said it is adding 300 jobs and manufacturing capacity to
its optical and fiber factories in the United States, Denmark,
Germany, China, Thailand, Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The plan by Lucent, based in Murray Hill, comes amid an
aggressive spending spree throughout the industry, including
similar announcements by Corning Inc. and Nortel Networks. Those
companies and other network equipment makers such as Cisco Systems
and JDS Uniphase have also invested billions of dollars for
acquisitions to increase capacity and bolster their products lines.
</P>
<P>
   While Lucent's earlier expansion centered on the company's main
fiber plant in Atlanta, the company now plans to add capacity to
its factories in Sturbridge, Mass., and Avon, Conn., as well as
Denmark, Germany, China, Thailand, Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ''The global market for fiber cable is currently experiencing
unprecedented growth to accommodate the increasing reliance
worldwide on the Internet as a business and communications tool,''
Lucent said in a statement, noting forecasts that the market for
fiber-optic cable will grow between 23 percent and 25 percent in
2000.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Offers $120B Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite opposition from President Clinton,
House Republicans are forging ahead with legislation to slash
inheritance taxes and cut other taxes for businesses to offset the
cost of raising the minimum wage by $1 over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders generally oppose raising the $5.15-an-hour
minimum wage, but are willing to put the issue to a floor vote
Thursday to appease GOP moderates who have strong labor
constituencies and to give conservatives another election-year
opportunity to vote for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Using a chunk of the projected budget surplus estimated at
$122.7 billion over 10 years, the tax package would sharply reduce
the estate tax, boost contribution limits for 401(k) plans, make
health insurance fully tax-deductible for the self-employed and
enact several tax changes favorable to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,
said raising the minimum wage alone would ''saw off the bottom rung
of the economic ladder'' by reducing the number of jobs smaller
employers could afford to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This modest tax relief for those who create jobs will provide
an effective antidote to the job-threatening potential of a higher
minimum wage,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the hourly minimum wage would rise to $5.48 this
year, $5.81 in April 2001 and $6.15 in April 2002. Backed by
organized labor, Clinton and congressional Democrats favor a $1
increase over two years and oppose the tax cuts as unnecessary and
tilted toward the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned a rally Wednesday with Democrats at the White
House. ''Working families across this country deserve an
increase,'' he said in a letter to selected lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some are using this minimum wage increase to pass
irresponsible tax cuts that would threaten our fiscal discipline
and jeopardize our ability to extend the life of Medicare and
Social Security and pay down the debt,'' Clinton told the leaders
of both parties in the House and Senate. ''Let me be clear, this is
the wrong approach. I will veto any legislation that holds this
minimum wage increase hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by the labor-funded Citizens for Tax Justice found
that 73 percent of the tax breaks -- mainly due to estate tax cuts --
would benefit the top 1 percent income group, those earning over
$319,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But reducing or eliminating the estate tax is a cornerstone of
the GOP political agenda and is part of this year's congressional
strategy of passing smaller, bite-sized tax cuts instead of one
massive bill like last year's vetoed $792 billion tax relief
package.
</P>
<P>
   The House business tax package would:
</P>
<P>
   --Reduce the top estate tax rate from 55 percent to 50 percent by
2002, reduce all estate tax rates by 1 percentage point in 2003 and
2004 and repeal a surcharge that applies only to estates worth over
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Gradually raise the annual contribution limits for 401(k) plans
from $10,000 to $14,000 by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   --Make health insurance premiums paid by the self-employed fully
tax deductible in 2001, sooner than under current law.
</P>
<P>
   --Give small business a tax writeoff on $30,000 of equipment, up
from $19,000; raise the business meal deduction from 50 percent to
60 percent; and restore a law allowing the seller of a business to
pay taxes as installment payments are received, instead of in an
immediate lump sum.

<HEADLINE> Lucent To Boost Fiber-optic Business  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Lucent Technologies Inc. plans to
invest more than $650 million over the next two years to expand its
fiber-optic cable business.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent said it is adding 300 jobs and manufacturing capacity to
its optical and fiber factories in the United States, Denmark,
Germany, China, Thailand, Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The plan by Lucent, based in Murray Hill, comes amid an
aggressive spending spree throughout the industry, including
similar announcements by Corning Inc. and Nortel Networks. Those
companies and other network equipment makers such as Cisco Systems
and JDS Uniphase have also invested billions of dollars for
acquisitions to increase capacity and bolster their products lines.
</P>
<P>
   While Lucent's earlier expansion centered on the company's main
fiber plant in Atlanta, the company now plans to add capacity to
its factories in Sturbridge, Mass., and Avon, Conn., as well as
Denmark, Germany, China, Thailand, Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ''The global market for fiber cable is currently experiencing
unprecedented growth to accommodate the increasing reliance
worldwide on the Internet as a business and communications tool,''
Lucent said in a statement, noting forecasts that the market for
fiber-optic cable will grow between 23 percent and 25 percent in
2000.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Nominate De Leon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will nominate a longtime
senior civilian defense official to the No. 2 spot at the Pentagon,
the White House said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's nomination of Rudy de Leon has been expected since
January, when John Hamre announced his resignation as deputy
secretary of defense. Hamre, who oversaw the Pentagon's largely
successful inoculations against the Y2K computer bug, will become
head of a major think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said he had recommended de Leon
for the job. De Leon has been the Pentagon's undersecretary for
personnel and readiness for the past two years. He previously was
undersecretary of the Air Force and was an aide to the late Les
Aspin when Aspin was defense secretary in Clinton's first term.

<HEADLINE> Iran-Iraq War Veterans Rally  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Hundreds of veterans of the Iran-Iraq war
rallied Tuesday during a visit by Germany's foreign minister,
demanding compensation for injuries they said Berlin helped cause
during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the protest, Joschka Fischer said he sensed that Iran
''wanted to leave the confrontations of the past behind and make a
new start,'' following the overwhelming victory by reformers in
recent parliamentary elections here.
</P>
<P>
   ''German-Iranian relations have a new chance,'' Fischer told
reporters after he had returned to Berlin. ''There may be setbacks,
but we should not let that deter us.''
</P>
<P>
   The electoral setback for hard-line, anti-Western leaders has
''created an opportunity for us that we must fully exploit,''
Fischer said. ''This opportunity was created by the people of Iran.
We look at this development very positively and intend to exploit
it suitably.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Iranian officials have repeated the accusation that
Germany provided Iraq with chemical weapons during the war. More
than 1 million people on both sides are estimated to have died in
the conflict
</P>
<P>
   Fischer did not mention the protesters, but German officials
have previously said that the country never authorized the export
of goods that can be used directly for production of chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has prosecuted German businessmen for conducting such
sales to Iraq on behalf of private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens in the crowd of about 300 that gathered at the German
Embassy in Tehran appeared to have been victims of chemical attacks
that Iraq allegedly conducted during the war. Some walked with
canes, some wore masks hooked up to small oxygen tanks they carried
with them, and others had gruesome burn marks on their face or
arms. After about an hour and a half, the demonstrators left
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday Fischer, whose visit is aimed at recovering lost
ground and strengthening ties, met with Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had our difficulties, but I hope that this is now in the
past,'' Fischer said in Germany. ''We hope for better relations,
also between the European Union and Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranian-German relations were strained over the two-year ordeal
of German businessman Helmut Hofer who was twice sentenced to death
in Iran for an illicit relationship with a 26-year-old Iranian
medical student, but was finally acquitted and released from prison
in January.
</P>
<P>
   His release was widely seen as a prelude for a visit to Germany
by Khatami. Fischer said that one of the aims of his visit was to
prepare the grounds for a visit by Khatami, but he did not say
whether a date had been decided.

<HEADLINE> Rio's Carnival Party Winds Down  </HEADLINE>
By ANY CABRERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Carnival in Rio de Janeiro began
winding down on Tuesday with the end of its world-famous samba
parade that celebrated the 500th anniversary of the nation's
discovery by Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two days, thousands of Brazilians and foreign
tourists packed the grandstands to watch 14 top flight samba groups
parade down Rio's half-mile-long Sambadrome.
</P>
<P>
   Each group has up to a 300-piece percussion section and some
4,000 brightly costumed dancers. Judges will weigh the groups'
music, floats, costumes and dancing and announce the top group on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although less intense, the partying will continue through Ash
Wednesday as revelers keep the carnival spirit alive in private
parties or on the streets, dancing and singing to the throbbing
rhythms of samba drums.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Rio, the best known festivities occurred in the
northeastern cities of Salvador, Recife and Olinda, where instead
of samba, revelers danced to Afro-Brazilian rhythms such as frevo
and maracatu.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary was meant to mark an outflowing of national
pride, but some were critical.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems as if our 500-year history was only marked by
exploited Indians and slavery,'' said Iara Amaral, referring to the
themes most common among the parade's floats in Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso traveled to
Portugal for ceremonies marking the 500th anniversary of the
departure of Portuguese explorer Pedro Alvares Cabral. After weeks
of sailing, Cabral discovered Brazil on April 22, 1500. Brazil was
a Portuguese colony from around 1530 until 1822.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cardoso was to join President Jorge Sampaio in
Belem -- the port Cabral set sail from -- to inaugurate a regatta of
twenty-odd Portuguese and Brazilian sailboats, including the
replica of a 16th-century caravel, the ''Boa Esperanca,'' which
will retrace Cabral's route.

<HEADLINE> Kerrey To Delay Social Security Act  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Bob Kerrey said Tuesday he wants to delay
Senate passage of a bill to lift the Social Security earnings limit
to underscore the failure of Congress and the Clinton
administration to enact long-term reform of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''What it shows is that members of Congress of both parties,
after shouting at the top of our lungs that we're going to save
Social Security, haven't done it,'' the Nebraska Democrat, who is
retiring after two terms, said in an interview. ''We've got 500
co-sponsors of the do-nothing plan.''
</P>
<P>
   After the House unanimously passed the earnings-limit bill last
week, Senate Republican leaders had hoped to rush the measure to
final passage after most Democrats dropped their objections. Kerrey
said, however, he is ready to use Senate rules permitting a member
to delay a bill and may try to offer his Social Security reform
bill as an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings-limit bill would scrap a Depression-era law that
cuts Social Security benefits by $1 for every $3 a recipient age
65-69 makes in wages over a certain threshold, which is $17,000
this year. Kerrey said he favors the bill, but it should be changed
so that 65 is no longer termed ''normal retirement age.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It will no longer be a retirement program. It will be an
old-age program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey conceded that the earnings limit bill probably eventually
will pass the Senate 100-0 and be signed into law by President
Clinton. But, he added, financial problems faced by Social Security
as the baby boom generation retires will get no better.
</P>
<P>
   ''The answer is either to cut benefits by 33 percent, raise
payroll taxes by 50 percent or find a mechanism to generate
revenue, such as individual investment accounts,'' he said. ''The
problem is no matter what you do, you make somebody angry.''
</P>
<P>
   If the earnings limit measure doesn't come up this week, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said it would reach the floor
later this month. ''We will go forward,'' he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Senators Spar Teacher Training Fund  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee rejected a bid by Democrats
Tuesday to expand President Clinton's effort to help school
districts hire, train and mentor more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., wanted the Senate Heatlh,
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to put the $2 billion
teacher plan in a Republican-backed bill that would instead give
states more leeway in spending aid under existing programs. The
committee voted 10-8 along party lines against the Kennedy measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are giving schools, districts and parents the opportunity
to explore different options for the basic reason that we have not
accomplished what we intended to accomplish,'' said Sen. Judd
Gregg, R-N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sponsored by the committee's chairman, Jim Jeffords,
R-Vt., would let schools use funds now reserved for reducing class
size for other teacher programs. The measure sets the stage for
lengthy debate on the renewal of a 34-year-old federal law that
assists kindergarten-through-12th grade education.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional compromise is expected to be difficult to achieve,
given that each party is looking for political advantage on
education issues in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The debate will be much more extended than this, you can take
that to the bank,'' said Jim Manley, a spokesman for Kennedy, the
panel's top Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate panel also angered the administration Tuesday by
approving a pilot program to let 15 states spend federal education
dollars as they see fit. Money for projects such as class-size
reduction in elementary schools could be used for other purposes,
incluing signing bonuses for new hires or funding private school
vouchers. The states, which are not specified, would have to show
that poor children are catching up in test scores and other measure
of school performance, GOP backers say.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will veto any renewal of the nation's flagship
education law that short-changes his teacher-hiring plan, said
Education Secretary Richard Riley.
</P>
<P>
   ''This moves in the wrong direction ... away from spending
federal resources effectively on critical national priorities and
practices that work,'' Riley said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The House drew a presidential veto threat when it passed a
similar measure last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said Tuesday that the federal
government should set such priorities. She said poor children have
failed over the years because states, which provide more than 90
percent of all education money, have not made such children a
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you block-grant money to a governor, you give them the
option of providing these dollars,'' said Murray, who promised to
save Clinton's class-size reduction plan. ''Kids at the bottom are
the ones who lose out. We are here to make sure these kids get a
good education.''

<HEADLINE> Labor Party Wins in St. Kitts  </HEADLINE>
By CLIVE BACCHUS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts and Nevis (AP) -- Prime Minister Denzil
Douglas' Labor Party strengthened its parliamentary majority in
elections in the twin-island Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and
Nevis, according to results released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Labor won eight seats in Monday's election for the islands'
11-member National Assembly. The Concerned Citizens Movement won
two seats and the Nevis Reformation Party claimed the third seat.
Labor had seven seats going into the election.
</P>
<P>
   Both Douglas and Deputy Prime Minister Sam Condor were
re-elected by wide margins.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to soothe tensions that flared in the weeks leading up to
the election, Douglas held a ''reconciliation rally'' Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I therefore accept the challenge that these election results
provide for us to steer our political ship of state clear of the
divisions that have characterized our politics over the years,''
Douglas said in a nationwide address.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the election, Labor had seven of St. Kitts' eight
seats, but none in Nevis. The islands have an uneasy union that
barely survived an August 1998 secession referendum in Nevis, where
residents complain they don't receive their fair share of federal
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Elected in 1995, Douglas pointed to his efforts to promote
resort construction in tourism-dependent St. Kitts, salary hikes
for public servants, and efforts to combat crime.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader Kennedy Simmonds, whose People's Action
Movement failed to win any seats, had assailed Douglas' failed
efforts to rejuvenate the sugar industry and deal with St. Kitts'
$192 million debt. Douglas blamed five hurricanes that have slammed
the islands in four years for frustrating economic development.

<HEADLINE> Mine Delegates Vote To Downsize  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA BRYSON HODEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Facing rising costs and coal industry layoffs,
delegates to the United Mine Workers convention voted Tuesday to
eliminate their vice president's position and move up union
elections to avoid a conflict with contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Lowe, a former president of District 28 in southwest
Virginia, told delegates that the move is essential to the
110-year-old union's survival.
</P>
<P>
   ''All over, we've seen locals having to merge with other locals,
districts having to merge, all because of layoffs in the coal
industry,'' said Lowe, whose district has been merged with another,
based in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to lay off my friends, and I even laid myself off to
make sure that District 28 could survive,'' Lowe said. ''With these
plans, we'll see that we make it as a union to 200 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The union has three officers -- president, vice president and
secretary-treasurer -- elected by its members. Under the plan, the
vice president's job now held by Jerry Jones of Sesser, Ill., will
be eliminated when his term ends in December 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Jones told delegates he supports the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates also approved moving up the next union election
from 2002 to this fall, when union President Cecil Roberts and
Secretary-Treasurer Carlo Tarley will stand for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The change will eliminate any conflict between union elections
and contract negotiations, said Bob Phalen, president of District
17 based in Charleston, W.Va. The union's national agreement with
the nation's four largest coal operators expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts has said he will ask for an early start to negotiations
and seek improved pensions and continued health care for retired
miners.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to march, we're going to fight, we're going to do
whatever we have to do to secure these benefits,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Titans Hire Broncos' Heimerdinger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Five weeks after a heartbreaking loss in
the Super Bowl, the Tennessee Titans hired an offensive coordinator
who helped Denver to Super Bowl victories the two previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Heimerdinger, who also served five years as Denver's wide
receivers coach and has 25 years of coaching experience, was
presented Tuesday as the Titans' top offensive assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very fortunate to add someone of his caliber to our
staff,'' Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher said. ''He comes from a
successful program at Denver and he expects to continue that
success here. Our offensive system and philosophy will remain the
same. This is our offense. Coach Heimerdinger is coming in to run
this offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's offensive philosophy is considered by many Titans fans
to be overly conservative. It drew criticism under former offensive
coordinator Les Steckel, who has moved to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Heimerdinger inherits an offense featuring the AFC's
third-leading rusher in Eddie George, a veteran offensive line, and
one of the NFL's most elusive quarterbacks in Steve McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously there's great talent here,'' Heimerdinger said. ''I
haven't studied the terminology, but you look on film and you see
talented receivers, talented backs and quarterbacks and tight ends,
and a talented offensive line that does a great job of protecting
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''So there's talent to work with and that makes it exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee also announced the promotion of assistant coach George
Henshaw to assistant head coach of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Fisher, whose current contract expires next year,
denied an ESPN report he has extended his contract with the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not extended my contract,'' said Fisher. ''There are
discussions going on. This (search for a coordinator) has been my
priority.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell early Wednesday after U.S.
stocks plunged on Wall Street. The dollar dropped against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 87.87 points,
or 0.44 percent, to 19,856.37 at the start of Wednesday's trading.
On Tuesday, the average closed up 147.89 points, or 0.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.26 yen, down 1.20 yen from late Tuesday in
Tokyo but above its late New York level of 106.16 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices moved lower following a steep tumble
on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average dropped
374.47 to 9,796.03 on Tuesday, its fourth-biggest one-day point
fall and its lowest close since March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow fell after an earnings warning from consumer products
giant Procter and Gamble raised concerns among investors about
profits at blue-chip and industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index, which soared more
than 100 points to 5,006.78 in early trading, turned lower amid
profit-taking and computer-programmed selling that kicked in at the
5,000 mark. The Nasdaq finished down 57.01 at 4,847.84.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar was under selling pressure
after the greenback fell during New York trading in response to
declines in U.S. stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 101.79 yen, down
from 103.30 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 7.91 points, or 0.47 percent, to 1,657.62.
The TOPIX closed up 15.70 points, or 0.95 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.7600 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.7800 percent. Its
price rose 0.18 point to 100.34.

<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Two passengers were killed and at least 16 others
injured when a rush-hour subway train derailed and was grazed by a
train coming in the opposite direction Wednesday morning, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo Fire Department spokesman Fukuo Isozaki said that along
with the two dead passengers, another three remained unconscious
shortly after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   He said 16 others were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known, said
spokesman Ryuichi Kinoshita of the Tokyo Rapid Transit Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Television news showed a side of a car of the train was torn
off, possibly when the derailed train hit the train coming in the
opposite direction on a parallel track.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of that more passengers were likely injured
in the accident, but officials could not immediately confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   Kyodo News agency reported that the train had been derailed by
an explosion inside one of the cars, but Kinoshita said he had no
information about the report.
</P>
<P>
   The train derailed at 9:03 a.m. Wednesday at Nakameguro Station,
the western terminus of the heavily traveled Hibiya Line, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Service has been resumed on part of the line, he added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Doesn't Expect To Join NATO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that
he does not expect NATO would admit Russia, days after saying that
joining the Western alliance could not be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was hard to imagine that they would invite Russia with its
territory and all its problems into NATO,'' Putin said during an
appearance in the city of Ivanovo.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, Putin caused a stir by telling the British
Broadcasting Corp. that Russia could join ''if and when Russia's
views are taken into account as an equal partner.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ivanovo, Putin distinguished between the political and
military sides of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we speak about the political aspect, yes, we are
interested. But if the military organization would make such
decisions as it made in Yugoslavia, we would not like that,'' he
said. ''We are not going to join such a union.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia-NATO ties were almost completely frozen last year after
Russia vehemently objected to the NATO bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia; the tension was aggravated by wide criticism in the
West of Russia's offensive in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But an agreement to restore ties was announced last month when
NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson visited Moscow, and officials
from both sides have been promising greater cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of thawing relations with NATO, Russia's defense
minister said Tuesday that the alliance is not an enemy and ties
will improve under the right conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not consider NATO an enemy,'' said Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev. ''A lot could change while an overall favorable situation
emerges to promote stability and peace in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most Russians see NATO expansion into Eastern Europe as a
threat. Sergeyev said any talk of Russia joining NATO would have to
be preceded by a serious transformation of the alliance, indicating
that the Russian military is still strongly against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   He said NATO must become a mainly political alliance and
possibly integrate itself into the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Runaway teen killed in police shootout after killing deputy isburied  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Somewhere between a cup of tea and a car
ride to Kansas lies the answer to the question everyone has asked
since 16-year-old Vincent Smith shot and killed a sheriff's deputy
and then died in a police shootout. Why?
</P>
<P>
   At Vincent's funeral Tuesday, the Rev. William Bigelow urged
mourners to put the question aside. It ''probably will not be
answered on this side of the heavenly Jerusalem,'' the priest said.
</P>
<P>
   But given the improbable sequence of events that brought 500
mourners together, the question could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Why would the good-natured child of a decorated police
lieutenant, who friends said had never even driven, take his
father's gun and mother's car and drive away from his seemingly
picture-perfect life in the dead of night?
</P>
<P>
   Why would this high school junior who aspired to follow his
father and uncle into law enforcement fatally shoot the Brown
County sheriff's deputy who had stopped to question him 1,000 miles
later as he walked along a Kansas highway?
</P>
<P>
   And finally, why would the teen-ager who friends said would
avoid fights come out shooting when confronted by officers
responding to the distress call made by Deputy Todd Widman as he
lay dying?
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary autopsy results released Tuesday indicated that
Widman was killed by two gunshot wounds and that Smith died from a
gunshot wound to the chest, the Brown County (Kan.) Sheriff's
Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent had made his parents tea and drank it with them before
going to bed last Monday, Feb. 28. At 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, he began
the journey that would end with his death 41 hours later on a
Hiawatha, Kan., creek bed.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent's father, Buffalo Police Lt. Thomas C. Smith, remains
stunned, said Mary Smith, his friend since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said 'He made us tea that night,''' she said. ''He went to
bed a good kid and woke up scared and alone.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Lt. Smith wrote to Widman's family, the officer who
gained national recognition for taking guns off the streets said:
''I just want you to know that the same boy who pulled that trigger
is not the same boy who we raised and loved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something in him snapped and only God knows what.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been talk Vincent, an average student, was worried
over his grades, but schoolmates at the all-boys, Roman Catholic
high school he attended doubted it.
</P>
<P>
   The theories stop there.
</P>
<P>
   The family is ''just having such a hard time because it's
something they don't understand,'' Mary Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kid never drove before ... They're all just so surprised,
so baffled,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There was apparently nothing in Vincent's background that would
point to trouble. He went to Mass every Sunday at Holy Family Roman
Catholic Church, where he had been an altar boy, mowed the lawn and
helped shovel snow.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was the greatest kid in the world. I could have him as a
son,'' said a church employee.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering Vincent was missing, his parents, older
brothers and sister searched for him all day and all night. Thomas
Smith, known as ''T.C.,'' then filed a missing-person report with
his department.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths' car was found abandoned Wednesday, March 1, in
northwest Missouri. Two people reported giving the teen a ride to
Hiawatha.
</P>
<P>
   Widman stopped Vincent in his patrol car about 6:50 p.m.
Wednesday. Smith allegedly pulled his father's 9 mm handgun from a
duffel bag, shot the deputy and fled on foot.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours later, officers spotted Vincent near a Wal-Mart.
He shot at officers, who returned fire. The teen-ager slipped away
again and officers surrounded the area.
</P>
<P>
   About a half hour later, Vincent emerged from a ditch and fired
at three officers. The officers shot back. Vincent died.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember Vinnie as a wonderful and wonder-filled teen-ager,''
Bigelow said at the funeral, attended by scores of police officers
in support of Lt. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vincent was truly a non-violent person,'' his friend, Ryan
O'Neill, said. ''He wanted to be a police officer, just like his
hero, Lt. Thomas C. Smith.''

<HEADLINE> Starks To Wait Out Arbitration  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Bulls fans won't be able to heckle John
Starks anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Starks went home to Tulsa, Okla., to await an arbitrator's
decision on whether he can forfeit the rest of his salary, leave
the Bulls and join a playoff contender. Starks, who didn't travel
with the Bulls for their game at Charlotte on Sunday, left Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a wife that's pregnant and he's got tendinitis in his
legs,'' Bulls coach Tim Floyd said Tuesday before Chicago's game
against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will allow him to be with his wife and with tendinitis,
the only way to heal it is rest,'' Floyd said. ''This will allow
him to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   Starks, 34, offered to forfeit the rest of his $4 million salary
-- roughly $900,000 -- if the Bulls would waive him, clearing the way
for him to sign with a playoff contender. The New York Knicks and
Miami Heat were interested in adding him if he won his case,
several league sources said.
</P>
<P>
   But arbitrator Kenneth Dam ruled Friday that the NBA didn't
circumvent the collective bargaining agreement when it rejected
Starks' request. Because there was no circumvention, Dam said a
grievance arbitrator needed to hear the case. Dam is a system
arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   A grievance arbitrator is expected to hear the case sometime
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Starks, never a fan favorite in Chicago after his thug-life days
with the New York Knicks, has been a lightning rod for criticism
since he took a seat on the bench Feb. 27 with tendinitis. He
insisted he's in pain, but he also said he'd play through it if he
was on a contending team.
</P>
<P>
   Fans booed him at Saturday's home game. One group chanted
''John, go home!'' as the game ended. Now they've got their wish.
</P>
<P>
   While putting a few hundred miles between Starks and the Bulls
makes him less of a distraction, Floyd said that isn't why he went
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he was 'sent' anywhere,'' Floyd said. ''I didn't
think he was a distraction and I don't think we saw it with our
team even though we've lost. We've been in game until the final
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls could still release Starks and let him sign with
another team, but they'd have to pay the remainder of his salary.
He'd remain shut out of the playoffs, too.
</P>
<P>
   Players released after 11:59 p.m. on March 1 who then sign with
another team are not eligible to compete in the playoffs. Starks
wanted his release retroactive to that date to make him eligible
for the postseason.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Man Pleads Guilty of Smuggling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiring to
smuggle at least $120,000 worth of rare and protected reptiles into
the United States from Haiti and the Peruvian Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Philip David Langston, 47, of Naples admitted to smuggling and
selling a variety of animals in south Florida in 1994 and 1995.
Those included 60 rhinoceros iguanas from Haiti, Caiman lizards,
Haitian boas and frog-headed turtles.
</P>
<P>
   The animals are protected under an international treaty.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his scheme, the Department of Justice said Langston
ran a ''breeding farm'' in Peru to make it appear that the Amazon
species were bred in captivity rather than caught in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Langston, a reptile dealer since 1992, will surrender his U.S.
Fish and Wildlife import-export license under terms of the plea
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine when
sentenced May 26 on the felony conspiracy charge.

<HEADLINE> President Clinton To Visit Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will visit Pakistan later
this month and tell the military government that took power there
last year that they must yield to civilian, democratic rule, the
White House said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of Clinton's visit ended debate over whether he
would bypass Pakistan when he visits that country's nuclear rival,
India. That trip, which also includes a stop in Bangladesh, was
announced weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee about
the Pakistan stop before the White House announcement, the White
House said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has kept Pakistan at arm's length
since a military coup in October ousted the civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is going because Pakistan is a friend,'' said a White House
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''He is not going
because he approves of or acquiesces in the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had asked for assurances that Clinton could
speak freely to Pakistani audiences, another administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president expects to address a number of issues of common
concern with Pakistan's leaders,'' a White House statement said.
''These include a return to civilian democratic rule,'' as well as
commitments to combat terrorism and avoid an arms race in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to leave Washington on March 18 and return
the following weekend. Clinton will stop for several hours in
Islamabad, Pakistan, at the end of the trip, White House officials
said. He does not plan to stay overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani ambassador Maleeha Lodhi welcomed Clinton's decision.
Clinton's ''visit to our region could be truly historic if it leads
to promotion of peace and security in South Asia and facilitates a
just and durable settlement of the Kashmir dispute based on the
wishes of the Kashmiri people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gen. Pervez Musharraf has refused to set a timetable for
a return to democracy, saying he wants to clean up a deeply corrupt
system and revive a weak and ailing economy before holding
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-CT., ranking minority member of the House
International Relations Committee, said he expects Clinton to
demand concrete action in Pakistan ''toward restoring democracy,
curbing terrorism and agreements on non-proliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan invited Clinton to come, but Indian officials hoped he
would decline. The two countries are historic rivals, and have
skirmished for years along their border in the disputed Kashmir
region.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton does not plan to mediate the Kashmir dispute
during this trip, he is concerned about rising tension between the
two countries, the White House said. One official said the
India-Pakistan relationship is at its most volatile in nearly 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of a visit to Pakistan argued that skipping the visit
would be an unnecessary slap to a strategically important country.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and eight
other Democratic senators asked Clinton to consider visiting
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The senators said the trip, the first by a president to the
region since 1978, offers a chance to make progress on controlling
dangerous weapons and the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hinted at the visit during a question and answer session
with reporters earlier Tuesday that also touched on other foreign
policy matters, rising gasoline prices, and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he thinks Congress will approve a $1.6 billion
anti-drug aid package for Colombia, despite concerns over whether
the U.S. might end up funding human rights abuses or by the
Colombian military.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that we're a lot better off trying to help stabilize
Colombia and save democracy there and help them fight narcotics
there and keep more drugs out of this country than if we walk away
from it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not know if he will agree to sell more U.S.
weapons systems to Taiwan, which is jousting verbally with China at
a time when Clinton is trying to persuade Congress to pass a
sensitive trade deal with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will do what I think the right thing to do is,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   On predictions that gas prices could reach $1.80 a gallon soon,
Clinton said he is still working to stabilize oil prices in
general, but offered no specific proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what we want are stable oil prices that aren't too
high. And I think that's what the oil-producing countries should
want,'' as well, Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Weinberger: Sweden Let Subs In  </HEADLINE>
By HARALD MOLLERSTROM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Former U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger said Tuesday that Sweden allowed NATO submarines to
enter its waters to test Sweden's coastal defenses during the Cold
War, despite its long-standing policy of neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cooperation was in the interest of both parties,''
Weinberger, who was defense secretary under former President
Reagan, said during an interview in his Washington office with the
investigative Swedish Television program ''Striptease''.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberger, 83, stressed that the tests did not violate the
country's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ''NATO subs never entered Swedish waters without being given
approval beforehand,'' Weinberger said. ''My understanding is that
there were consultations that they would be doing certain tests
that the Swedish government agreed they should do.''
</P>
<P>
   But his comments, which were confirmed by several military
experts, raised new questions about previously reported submarine
violations of the Scandinavian country's territorial waters as well
as its highly valued neutrality policy. Sweden has not fought a war
since 1815.
</P>
<P>
   Submarine activity was often the subject of controversy during
the Cold War and Sweden launched two commissions to investigate
alleged intrusions, the first in 1983, two years after a Soviet
submarine was found grounded off the southeast coast.
</P>
<P>
   The first commission fingered the Soviet Union and Sweden lodged
a protest with the Soviet government. A second commission in 1995
failed to identify intruders by nationality.
</P>
<P>
   Many military officials and politicians said they had never
heard of the NATO exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need some sort of agreement to do a thing like this. But I
know nothing of such an agreement,'' said Admiral Per Rudberg, head
of the navy from 1978 to 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Current Defense Minister Bjoern von Sydow said he was surprised,
but added, ''I have no reason to question what a former U.S.
defense secretary is saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir John Walker, a former head of Britain's military
intelligence, said NATO wanted to test Swedish antisubmarine
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you were going to operate inside the Stockholm archipelago,
you wanted to make sure that the Swedes would not attack you with
torpedoes,'' Walker said, adding that NATO was ''allowed a certain
amount of intrusion during a given period.''

<HEADLINE> Connecticut moderate voters come out for McCain  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Moderates and previously unaffiliated
Connecticut voters supported Republican Sen. John McCain on
Tuesday, while Texas Gov. George W. Bush drew from more
conservative voters who liked his stand on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who had favorable opinions of President Clinton,
meanwhile, helped Vice President Al Gore win easily over former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, preliminary results from exit polls
showed.
</P>
<P>
   Results were from exit polls conducted for The Associated Press
and television networks by Voter News Service.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters said they supported the son of former President
George Bush because of his values and his leadership qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's really got what it takes,'' said Tim Dock, an
insurance company worker who said he predicted in a college
politics class in 1997 that Bush would be the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Many McCain voters said they supported the Arizona senator
because of his personal qualities, and because they thought he was
a ''real reformer,'' preliminary poll results showed.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of those polled said McCain ''says what he
believes,'' while only a quarter of those polled said the same of
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I liked the fact that McCain tried to avoid getting into
negative politics. It always seemed that when Bush made a comment,
it was always a snide remark. He didn't seem genuine,'' said Edward
Del Santo, a McCain voter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters liked his stance on taxes, Medicare and moral
values. McCain voters supported his stance on campaign finance
reform, world affairs, Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls showed McCain was ahead of Bush among women and
more educated voters. Bush supporters tended to be less wealthy and
younger than McCain voters.
</P>
<P>
   Only voters registered with one or the other of the parties
could vote Tuesday. Independents had until noon Monday to choose a
party, and exit polling indicated many more of them voted for
McCain and Bradley than for Bush or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of President Clinton's job performance was a key factor
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that I like the way I see Clinton doing things for us.
I think Gore might probably replace him and do the same things, to
ensure a good environment for everybody,'' said Raphael Lopez, 37,
a Hartford machinist.
</P>
<P>
   More than three-quarters of Democrats said they approved of the
way President Clinton has done his job, and about two-thirds of
those voters went for Gore, the exit poll showed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore voters said they chose their candidate for the issues he's
presented, including Social Security, Medicare, the economy and
education. His support crossed racial, income, educational and
gender lines.
</P>
<P>
   More voters thought Bradley ''says what he believes'' than
thought the same of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen Gore really stand up for anything where he
doesn't later back down. He's swayed too much by public opinion and
not what he thinks is right,'' said Norman Blais, 28, a Hartford
resident who voted for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Voter News Service interviewed 695 voters in the Connecticut
Republican presidential primary and 586 voters in the Democratic
primary. The exit poll was conducted in randomly selected precincts
statewide. The margin of sampling error for each result is plus or
minus 5 percentage points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Ga., Ohio; McCain Wins Vt.  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush cruised to victories Tuesday in Ohio,
Georgia, Missouri and Maryland, revving up his drive to vanquish
John McCain's political insurgency. McCain captured two New England
states, but was struggling to break out of the region as voters in
13 states participated in the year's largest night of Republican
presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge step closer to the nomiantion,'' Bush told The
Associated Press in an interview. But he said he did not consider
himself the certain nominee. ''Tonights' going to be a good
night,'' he said, ''but my frame of mind is to keep moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Forging familiar coalitions, Bush relied on party faithful while
McCain drew from independents and moderate Republicans. McCain's
gamble of criticizing conservative Christian leaders may have
backfired in key states, while Bush's visit to a South Carolina
university with a history of anti-Catholic views seemed to be a
beneficial campaign issue for McCain in some states.
</P>
<P>
   Several McCain advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Arizona senator would take stock of his campaign Wednesday
when he travels to his retreat in Sedona. Some aides planned to
recommend the senator depart the race but McCain was hinting no
such thing as he embraced his victories in Massachusetts and
Vermont and held out hope in New York and Connecticut and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, we have done very well on the East Coast,'' McCain
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, suggested gently that McCain
might want to reassess his candidacy, ''It will be up to Senator
McCain to decide how to proceed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, Gore sought to sweep 16 party contests
against former Sen. Bill Bradley. Gore won easily in Georgia and
Vermont was a close race, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate could accumulate the magic number of 1,034
delegates Tuesday, but Bush hoped for a rout to drive McCain from
the race, allowing him to turn his attention to Vice President Al
Gore, who has gained against the GOP front-runner in head-to-head
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''The general election begins tonight,'' Charlie Black, an
adviser to Bush, said as voters were still streaming to the polls
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Tempering his enthusiasm, Bush said, ''I don't consider myself
the persumptive nominee'' and looked ahead to three Western state
primaries Saturday and six Southern state primaries next Tuesday,
including his homestate of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the Super Tuesday contests, McCain advisers said he
had to sweep the Northeast, win the majority of New York delegates
and claim victories in Ohio and California to retain a reasonable
shot at the nomination. With defeat in Ohio, his comeback scenarios
were few. Voting next week is in Texas and Florida, as well as four
other Bush-friendly southern states.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won Massachusetts, where Gov. Paul Cellucci had promised
to deliver his state to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At stake Tuesday were 613 delegates, more than half the total
needed for nomination, and bragging rights in the critical states
of California, New York, Ohio and Missouri. The elections pitted
Bush and his establishment allies against McCain's reform
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The races were projected based on exit interviews conducted by
Voter News Service, a consortium of the AP and television networks.
</P>
<P>
   From Maine to California, voters brought to a climax six weeks
of seesawing contests: McCain up in New Hampshire, down in South
Carolina, up in Michigan and down again last week, when Bush swept
Virginia, North Dakota and Washington state to solidify his claim
as the GOP's front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose staff is already raising money and drawing up battle
plans for November, said he was prepared for a tough campaign
against Gore and his Clinton administration allies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victories earned him all 35 delegates from Missouri and
at least 40 of the 154 delegates at stake in Georgia, Maryland and
Ohio, with the remainder to be allocated based on the winner of
each congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won all 37 delegates from Massachusetts and the 12 at
stake in Vermont, giving him an overall total of 154. Bush had
accumulated 245 delegates to date.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes was still in the GOP race, but not a factor in any of
Tuesday's states.
</P>
<P>
   The exit surveys across the states showed women preferring Bush
by a 2-to-1 margin over McCain. Among age groups, McCain carried
only younger voters; those over 30 voted for Bush. Among Catholics,
where Bush had stirred a tempest, the vote was split evenly between
the two candidates. By a big margin, the voters said McCain was
more likely than Bush to say what he believes.
</P>
<P>
   In New York and Ohio, two key battlegrounds, Bush found strength
among older voters and those with less education. He was favored by
voters who said taxes and education were the most important issues,
according to interviews conducted at polling places.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did best with men, moderates, independents, people voting
in their first Republican primary and those who decided to vote in
the past week. Voters who ranked Social Security and Medicare as
their top issues favored McCain, as did those looking for someone
who would stand up for what they believe.
</P>
<P>
   The real fight in the Northeast was over 101 delegates in New
York, where Gov. George Pataki brought his political machine to
bear for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   California was Super Tuesday's super state, offering its 162
delegates to the winner. McCain had hoped to tap the state's
independent-minded streak, but polls showed him trailing Bush among
Republicans; only GOP votes count toward the delegate hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers were left hoping that he could win the nonbinding
popular vote and claim a moral victory. It would be a tough sell:
McCain himself has said for months that the winner of California's
delegate chase would claim the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong Republican campaign in Super Tuesday states fueled
a debate over religious tolerance and inflamed the personal feuding
between the two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the fact that McCain's sister suffered from breast
cancer was ''all the more reason'' to question the senator's record
on the issue. Firing back, McCain said Bush might ''not be ready
for prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   They each accused the other of politicizing religion.
</P>
<P>
   The battle: 22nd graf a0639

<HEADLINE> Firefighters: Wildfire Fed By Arson  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE CITY, Fla. (AP) -- Firefighters battling an 7,000-acre
wildfire have found evidence that someone is setting blazes in the
remote north Florida timberland area.
</P>
<P>
   Forty tractors, four helicopters and an air tanker were being
used Tuesday to battle the blaze, which has doubled in size since
Sunday when it was reported on timberland owned by Rayonier
Southeast Forest Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Some flareups amounting to about 1,000 acres were caused by
arson, said Terence McElroy, a spokesman for the Florida Division
of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida agricultural inspection station near the Georgia
state line was evacuated and U.S. 441 north of Lake City was closed
Tuesday because of the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-acre fire near Bunnell forced officials to close U.S. 1 for
several hours Monday and again Tuesday morning. And a blaze that
had burned more than 3,000 acres in Georgia also burned 50 acres in
Florida, but was contained Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 1, Florida firefighters have fought 1,370 fires,
which burned 38,586 acres. Arsonists are suspected in 281 of the
fires.

<HEADLINE> Gore wins Connecticut primary  </HEADLINE>
sdstfmiscrh
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore collected an easy
victory in Connecticut's presidential primary Tuesday, an election
that drew a higher-than-usual turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, Arizona Sen. John McCain was leading Texas
Gov. George W. Bush in a much closer contest. With 60 percent of
precincts reporting, McCain was ahead 48 percent to 46 percent.
Alan Keyes ran a distant third, with 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With 60 percent of precincts reporting, Gore led Bradley 56
percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polling conducted for The Associated Press and television
networks by Voter News Service found Gore led in almost every part
of the state except along the coast, where Bradley may have
benefited from his former career as a New Jersey Knicks basketball
player.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had the backing of the state's Democratic leaders and spoke
at the state party's annual fund-raising dinner on Feb. 19 -- an
appearance that miffed Bradley's backers, who were irked that he
was not invited.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was in Hartford early on the morning after the New
Hampshire primary, and visited the state in mid-February and again
on Thursday. His wife, Ernestine, visited Wesleyan University on
Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   With just 67 delegates to the Democratic Party convention and 25
delegates to the GOP convention, Connecticut did not draw the
attention either party gave to such larger states as California,
New York and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz said turnout in the
state appeared to be running higher than the 20 percent seen in
previous primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because there's been a very lively debate both on the
Republican side and the Democratic side, I think that generated a
lot of interest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we'll see a turnout in excess of 30 percent, maybe
even close to 40 percent,'' she said earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Only voters affiliated with one of the major parties could vote
Tuesday. Democrats and Republicans who went to the polls seemed
more influenced by emotion than by issues raised by the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Taylor, 51, of Hartford cast his ballot at the West End
Fire Station. He said he was voting for Gore mainly because he
likes him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has more experience than Bradley and he's helped President
Clinton get the country in great shape,'' said the 51-year-old
sanitation worker.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Parker, 71, of Hartford, a retired church secretary who
also voted at the fire station, said she chose for Gore ''because
he's straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bradley's OK, but I like the way Gore backed up the president
during all that trouble,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Helen Kaminsky, 76, a retired waitress who voted at the
Whiting Lane School in West Hartford, said she was voting for
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could say it's sort of a vote against Gore. Also, I'm
Catholic, but I'm pro-choice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Joe Pizzella, 36, a marketing manager who cast his
ballot at the school in the affluent neighborhood, said he simply
liked Bush better than McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush just seems presidential in appearance and the way he
speaks,'' Pizzella said. ''I think he would be a refreshing
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Norton, 69, a Republican who worked as an insurance manager
before retiring, said she thinks Bush will make a dependable
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I voted for him even though even though I disagree with him on
abortion,'' she said. ''I'm not sure McCain is stable; I always get
the feeling he's about to blow, even when he's smiling.''

<HEADLINE> McSorley Plans To Plead Innocent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Marty McSorley must now
answer in a Canadian court for his stick attack on Vancouver's
Donald Brashear.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Bruins defenseman -- one of the league's tough guys --
was charged with one count of assault with a weapon for his Feb. 21
attack. He plans to plead innocent, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley, who will not have to appear at the hearing, would face
a maximum of 18 months in jail if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed,'' McSorley said in an interview with ESPN.
''I'm disappointed it's going to court because I don't know if
anybody really knows right now how much I've already lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old defenseman was suspended by the NHL for the rest
of the season in the league's harshest penalty ever for an on-ice
infraction. He must meet with commissioner Gary Bettman before the
league will consider letting him play again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been in contact with a very good lawyer in Vancouver and
we were trying to not have it go to court,'' McSorley said. His
suspension already will cost him an estimated $72,000 in salary.
</P>
<P>
   His Vancouver lawyer, Bill Smart, said he hopes for a trial date
in late summer or early fall.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Gaul, a spokesman for the British Columbia criminal
justice branch, said the decision to charge McSorley was made after
a prosecutor's review and a police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL said it does not agree with the move, but said it will
fully cooperate with Canadian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the league dealt with the matter quickly,
decisively and appropriately -- and did not feel that any further
action was either warranted or necessary,'' said Bill Daly, the
NHL's chief legal officer.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins president and general manager Harry Sinden also expressed
disappointment that the courts were getting involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The National Hockey League has handed down a severe discipline
in this case and we feel that was sufficient,'' he said, adding
that the team would also cooperate fully.
</P>
<P>
   After McSorley hit him in the right temple, Brashear fell
backward, striking his head against the ice as his helmet came off.
His body twitched and blood came from his nose. He was diagnosed
with the most serious kind of concussion and his status is to be
reviewed in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley and Brashear, another NHL tough guy, had fought earlier
in the game, and McSorley said he was trying to goad Brashear into
another fight at the end of the game, a 5-2 victory by the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had absolutely no intention of hurting Donald Brashear with
my hockey stick,'' McSorley told ESPN. ''I wanted a confrontation
with Donald Brasher, no different than I've done on so many other
nights. ... It just went badly.''
</P>
<P>
   McSorley has lasted 17 years in the league because of his
ability to fight and protect his more skilled teammates. He had six
previous suspensions in his career.
</P>
<P>
   He is best known for serving as Wayne Gretzky's protector with
the Edmonton Oilers and then with Los Angeles as the two were
traded together in one of hockey's biggest deals.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley said he has received calls of support from players in
the league and Hall of Famers -- ''numerous tough guys'' -- who say
they understand what happened and offered to speak on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   He told them to stay out of it because he didn't want attention
drawn from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's one thing I really feel bad about is the fact the game
doesn't need a black eye -- and I don't want to be the cause of
it,'' he said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   It took police just over a week to investigate the slash, which
was witnessed by thousands of fans at the game and shown repeatedly
on TV highlight clips.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot more involved in this than just that second and
a half or two seconds that the video shows,'' McSorley said. ''I
think he embarrassed me. You definitely want a rematch. You have to
stand up for yourself. Our bench was challenged. Our team was
challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have gotten involved in several previous on-ice conflicts
in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Wayne Maki of the St. Louis Blues and Ted Green of
Boston were the first NHL players taken to court after a
stick-swinging duel at a September 1969 preseason game. Green, who
fractured his skull, and Maki, who was not injured, were acquitted
of assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Dave Forbes of the Boston Bruins went to trial, accused
of using excessive force against Henry Boucha of the Minnesota
North Stars. The trial ended in a hung jury and the prosecution did
not seek a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent, Minnesota's Dino Ciccarelli was sentenced to
one day in jail and fined $1,000 in 1988 for striking Toronto's
Luke Richardson several times in the head with his stick.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Coach Upset by New Policies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy is unhappy
with new NBA rules regarding the added use of cameras and
microphones, saying they are intrusive and a hindrance to coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The league sent out a memo recently to all 29 teams, telling
coaches that they may be asked to wear microphones during
nationally televised games. The league also is planning to put
cameras in the locker rooms, offering a behind-the-scenes look at
what transpires during halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It negatively impacts the coach because you now have to
monitor what you say,'' Van Gundy said Tuesday night. ''It might
not get on the air, but someone hears it in some truck and can
repeat it. You now have to be very leery of what you say.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy also took issue with another dictum from the league
ordering teams to open the final 30 minutes of practice to the
media. Van Gundy explained that he often schedules game preparation
walkthroughs for the final half-hour of practice, meaning he will
have to adjust his schedule to keep the most sensitive preparation
behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the NBA has the best interest in mind,'' Van Gundy
said. ''The reason they're doing this is because less people are
watching. So the concern is real.
</P>
<P>
   ''But going into the locker room is taking more than necessary
to make it a good product,'' Van Gundy said.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Bordick Out With Flu  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- It's been a rough week for
Baltimore Orioles shortstop Mike Bordick. Instead of enjoying the
Florida sun, he's been under the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick missed a second straight game Tuesday night and will not
accompany the team to Jupiter on Wednesday for a game against the
Montreal Expos. He hopes to return to the lineup Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick, who practiced on Tuesday, still has plenty of time to
prepare for the April 3 season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are going to be opportunities for me to get the at-bats
I need,'' he said. ''I feel bad because I don't want to miss any
time in spring training, but fortunately it's at the beginning of
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, I don't want to set myself back too far. Hopefully
one more day will make me feel better and I can come back and play
the rest of the way.''

<HEADLINE> Super Tuesday Shaping the Tickets  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eight months to the day from the
ticket-shaping verdicts of Super Tuesday, Americans will elect a
new president, choosing between Democrat Al Gore and, almost
surely, Republican George W. Bush to settle what will be the
longest and costliest head-to-head White House campaign ever waged.
</P>
<P>
   That, barring some incredible change, is the prospect, with the
vice president piling on victories in a sweep over Democratic
challenger Bill Bradley, and the Texas governor capturing states
Sen. John McCain couldn't afford to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio was the first among them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's landslide undercut McCain's fading hope of a combination
that would keep him going as a competitor into major state
primaries later in the spring. His own strategists said he couldn't
do it without Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also won in Georgia, Missouri, Maryland and Maine. He said
he'd taken a huge step toward the nomination but did not consider
it won yet.
</P>
<P>
   McCain captured Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont, New
England support that showed first when he vaulted past Bush to
start the season in New Hampshire, just five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He and Bush were running almost even in Connecticut, once the
political home of the Bush family. And the governor's victory in
Maine cracked what McCain had tried to hold as a solid New England
front.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's victory in New Hampshire, just five weeks ago, fueled a
fierce Republican contest that turned harsh, personal and divisive,
a split that could and Vermont, New England support that showed
first when he vaulted past hurt the GOP unless it heals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really do believe that it will come back together,'' said
Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Bush ally who suffered with him two
weeks ago when McCain won the primary there, boosted by crossover
Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP rivalry also was expensive, draining millions from the
record treasury that once loomed as a major Bush advantage over
Gore during the five months before the national party conventions.
</P>
<P>
   While their cash reserves may be about even now, Bush is going
after $10 million more, and Gore still faces spending restrictions
that do not apply to the governor because he didn't accept federal
campaign subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates will start even after the conventions; each
nominee gets $67.6 million in federal funds for the general
election campaign. There's also a wild card: the $12.5 million
available to the Reform Party nominee, with ex-Republican Pat
Buchanan seeking that role and bankroll.
</P>
<P>
   Bush already was talking party unity, praising McCain's campaign
for recruiting waves of new voters. ''Change is coming in politics
in America,'' McCain said. But not enough to keep him competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush is a competitor but he doesn't take this
personally,'' said Karl Rove, his chief strategist, as the Super
Tuesday votes were counted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Engler said in an interview that he thinks McCain could
wind up as vice presidential nominee on a Bush ticket. ''If John
McCain is willing to go, I think he's going to be right there at
the top of the list,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   Bitter rivals have run together before.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's rhetoric could be an obstacle: His attack on two
leading figures of the Christian conservative movement backfired
and hurt him on Tuesday, according to Voter News Service exit
polls. That is a part of the Republican base the party needs to
hold in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic contest, Gore and Bradley both had tempered
their attack tactics in the final push toward Super Tuesday, with
the end in sight for the challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think competition is good for the party,'' Bradley said as
he greeted voters in New York, where he trailed badly in home
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won Ohio, Georgia and Vermont, the first states to report
their primary votes. He led comfortably in polls in the other eight
Super Tuesday primaries. And he'd turned his campaign sights from
Bradley to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Voter polls in Tuesday's primary states pointed to some
vulnerabilities facing Bush. One voter in three questioned whether
he had the knowledge required to serve effectively as president, an
impression reflected in prior primary polls, and one that will
burden him unless he can dispel it.
</P>
<P>
   There also were signs that McCain may have, as he claimed, a
broader appeal than Bush to voters Republicans will need against
Gore. Nearly 20 percent of Republican voters on Tuesday said they
would support Gore over Bush, twice as many as said they would do
so were McCain the nominee. Polling of Democratic voters produced
the mirror image of those opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's victories were built on the votes of Democrats who said
they wanted a strong, experienced leader. ''This year in this
election we are the party of the mainstream,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The primaries are by no means over. There are 23 states to go,
major ones including Illinois, Pennsylvania and New Jersey among
them. Along with states like Michigan and Super Tuesday's
California and New York, they will be the battlegrounds in the
final contest to succeed President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote: not many campaigns ago, the first Tuesday in March
was the start of the primary competition, not the day things were
settled.

<HEADLINE> Gore Sweeping Past Bradley  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore swept past Bill Bradley in state after
state on Super Tuesday, pushing his rival to the brink of
withdrawal in the Democratic presidential campaign and turning his
own gaze to the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won from New York to Georgia to Ohio and at several stops
in between, regularly gaining 60 percent of the vote or more. He
also bid for victory in California, the biggest prize on the
busiest night of the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the returns contentedly from a hotel room in his home
state of Tennessee, Gore sought to begin unifying the party. ''I
have the greatest respect for Senator Bradley,'' said the vice
president, who had attacked the former senator vigorously in
campaign debates.
</P>
<P>
   Polling place interviews with voters in every region of the
country underscored the vice president's strength among core
constituencies vital in Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and Hispanics preferred Gore over Bradley by a margin of
8-1; the margin among union members was smaller, but a healthy 3-1.
Bradley fared better among independents. The exit polling was
conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of the AP and
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Come what may, we will not be dropping out this evening,''
said Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, shortly before polls began
closing in the early states. He said the campaign would have an
announcement on Wednesday ''about our plan for Thursday and
beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to the former New Jersey senator did not discourage
talk of a withdrawal if -- as the Bradley forces clearly expected --
Gore was en route to a rout, possibly even a sweep in primaries in
all regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gore defeated Bradley in the New England states of Maine,
Vermont, Connecticut and Massachusetts. He triumphed, as well, in
Georgia, where was winning roughly 80 percent of the vote; Ohio,
roughly 70 percent; and Maryland and Missouri, roughly 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley came closest in Vermont, where he was gaining 44 percent
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The delegate tally lagged the popular vote by hours.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-evening on the East Coast, Gore had won 107 of the 1,315
delegates at stake during the day, compared to 43 for Bradley,
according to AP estimates based on early returns.

<HEADLINE> Bulls' Floyd Ejected in 1Q  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Bulls coach Tim Floyd didn't stick around
for much of Tuesday night's game against the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd was ejected with 2:51 left in the first quarter after a
heated argument with referee Tim Donaghy over two no-calls. It was
the first ejection of the season for Floyd, who's been a model of
calm after his fiery, coat-throwing days at Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls center Dickey Simpkins was hacked by Alan Henderson as he
went up for a layup with 2:57 left, but no foul was called. Floyd
might have been even more irate at Dikembe Mutombo, who had his
arms wrapped around Bulls guard Randy Brown on the same possession.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd started screaming at Donaghy, who immediately called the
first technical with 2:51 left. Floyd kept yelling, following
Donaghy across the floor as Bulls guard B.J. Armstrong called for
someone to grab Floyd and pull him back. No one did, and Donaghy
called the second technical.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd threw out a few more insults before walking off the court
to a round of applause from fans.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Asks Ambassador To Leave  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Guatemala ordered Belize's acting
ambassador to leave Tuesday after he reportedly helped smuggle four
security officers wanted by Guatemala out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest twist in a border dispute between the Central
American neighbors, the Guatemalan Foreign Relations Ministry
demanded that Belize replace Salvador Figueroa, who had been
filling in for the official ambassador for the past month. In the
evening, Figueroa left Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Three soldiers and a police officer from Belize were arrested by
Guatemalan officials on illegal weapons charges Feb. 24 near the
Guatemala-Belize border. Each country contends the four were in its
territory. They were imprisoned until a higher court ordered them
released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The court order required the contingent to remain under house
arrest in the Belize Embassy until the matter could be reviewed,
said Judge Marco Antonio Posadas, who drafted the order.
</P>
<P>
   But Figueroa reportedly defied the court order. He told
Guatemala City's Siglo Veinteuno newspaper that he arranged for the
men to fly to Belize City on Friday night, less than 12 hours after
their conditional release.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care if there is a judicial order that they remain in
Guatemala,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Guatemalan government was unaware the prisoners had left the
country until they saw the article Tuesday morning, said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Edgar Arana. He said Figueroa violated
Guatemalan law that bars diplomats from interfering in legal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa, who is also Belize's ambassador to Mexico, was named
acting ambassador on Feb. 10 after Ambassador Mike Mena headed to
Houston to treat an undisclosed illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems we are breaking diplomatic relations here and that is
part of the problem with the relations between the two countries,''
said Figueroa, as he boarded a plane bound for Mexico City late
Tuesday. ''We have to talk directly about the problem, directly
between the countries, and especially with the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 24 arrests, which followed the killing of two
Guatemalans by Belizean border guards last fall, fueled tensions
between the two countries over their long disputed border.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Gov't Resigns; Leader Named  </HEADLINE>
By ALBERT AJI, 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- President Hafez Assad named a senior
official of his ruling Baath Party as the new prime minister after
the government resigned Tuesday in the first Cabinet shake-up in
about 8 years.
</P>
<P>
   Assad picked Mohammed Mustafa Miro, the governor of the northern
Aleppo province, to form a new Cabinet, presidential spokesman
Jibran Kourieh said, adding that the outgoing government would
continue working in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Media reports in past weeks hinted of a reshuffle, speculating
that Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa would be the new premier. It
was not clear whether al-Sharaa, who is in charge of the Mideast
peace talks, would have a role in the coming Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The shake-up was seen as a move by Assad to improve his working
team in an effort to press ahead with promised social and economic
reforms. It also reflected the leadership's desire to inject new
blood in the aging Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ''An improved administration is the key goal of this process,''
said Assad's son and heir apparent, Bashar, in remarks published
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He told the London-based Arabic daily Al Hayat that the country
was ''in need of change'' in all spheres of life, including
economics, information, education and technology, as well as
international relations. ''We need (change) today more than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a Cabinet reshuffle was fueled by Assad's re-election
speech last year, in which he hinted at his dissatisfaction with
the government's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, the ultimate authority in this country, accepted the
resignations of all 37 members of Prime Minister Mahmoud
el-Zouebi's Cabinet. Assad is serving his fifth seven-year term in
office.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Central Committee of the ruling Baath Party, the
59-year-old Miro has served as governor of the northern al-Hasakah
province and of the southern Dar'a province. He is also a former
member of the Executive Bureau of the Arab Teacher Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of the new government could have a direct
bearing on Syria's peace talks with Israel. Negotiations between
the two countries were indefinitely suspended in January when Syria
sought an upfront promise that Israel would withdraw to the
pre-1967 war frontier. Israel has refused.

Chretien Refuses Premiers' Demands For Health Summit
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien has rejected a
request by provincial premiers for an urgent summit meeting on
health care.
</P>
<P>
   But the premiers may yet decide to hold the meeting without him.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard, Chretien said
health ministers should be allowed more time to sort out the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their work is progressing well but it is not sufficiently
developed to serve as a basis for a productive first ministers
meeting,'' Chretien said in the letter made public late Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was sent to Bouchard because he is currently chairman
of the premiers' group.
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation the federal Liberals would like to postpone
a first ministers meeting until Bouchard, whose party wants to pull
Quebec out of Canada, is no longer chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In a related health issue, NDP Leader Alexa McDonough said
Ottawa should fine Alberta if the province goes ahead with
legislation expanding the role of for-profit surgical clinics.
</P>
<P>
   But Health Minister Allan Rock gave no indication Tuesday of how
he will respond to the bill introduced last week by Alberta Premier
Ralph Klein's Conservatives.

Court Rules Two Convicted Montreal Officers Can Keep Their Jobs
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Two police officers convicted of assault causing
bodily harm in the fatal 1993 beating of taxi driver Richard
Barnabe can keep their jobs, a Quebec Court judge ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Constables Pierre Bergeron and Louis Samson were ordered fired
for using excessive force on Barnabe, who never regained
consciousness and died after 29 months in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   The beating was denounced as flagrant police brutality but Judge
Jean Longtin ruled the Quebec Police Ethics Committee, which issued
the dismissal orders, didn't follow the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Longtin ordered suspensions without pay of 300 days for
Bergeron and 240 days for Samson.
</P>
<P>
   When the ruling was made public Tuesday, Barnabe's family was
stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're kidding,'' said Carole Barnabe, the cabbie's
sister-in-law. ''That doesn't make any sense.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted all the police involved not to work any more as
police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise ruling came as an investigation continues into a
similar incident involving the fatal beating last fall of
Jean-Pierre Lizotte, a homeless man, outside a downtown bar.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte died in hospital Oct. 16 after suffering two broken
vertebrae and neck injuries as officers tried to handcuff and
arrest him. He was not in custody when he died.

Cinar Stock Plunges After Trading Resumes on Troubled Company
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- The vultures were circling as ailing film
company Cinar Corp. tried to revive itself Tuesday from the
shocking departures of its three top executives and revelations of
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Cinar shares were battered on North American stock markets, with
the company losing about two-thirds of its value.
</P>
<P>
   The urge by investors to sell Cinar stock was intense. But with
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange delayed most of the day by
computer glitches, anxious investors dumped their Cinar stock on
the Nasdaq market, where the company's shares are interlisted.
</P>
<P>
   The trading volume on the Nasdaq hit 18.3 million shares, and
the stock dropped by more than two-thirds to $5.75 US.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts speculated that the once high-flying entertainment
company would be easy takeover prey, with the common shares closing
Tuesday at $8.35 on the TSE compared with $28 on Friday, the
previous day Cinar shares traded.

Toronto Stock Exchange Stops Trading Twice Due to Computer Trouble
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Canada's largest stock exchange suffered the
latest in a series of technological meltdowns Tuesday, shutting
down trading for more than 2{ hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole system is just bursting at the seams,'' said an
exasperated Fred Ketchen, chief equities trader at Scotia Capital
Markets, as technical problems related to heavy trading volumes
delayed the market's opening by an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third instance of computer glitches in as many weeks
at the TSE.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of beginning to trade at 9:30 a.m. EST, the TSE opened
at 10:30. Problems continued later in the day, prompting a second
shutdown between 1:17 p.m. and 2:55 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the exchange blamed the first delay on a hardware
error in equipment that transfers data and information.
</P>
<P>
   ''We delayed the opening,'' said TSE spokesman Steve Kee. ''It
wasn't that the equipment wasn't functioning . . . it was a
precaution.''
</P>
<P>
   The second shutdown was prompted because exchange officials
determined the initial problem had created an inconsistent flow of
incoming stock orders, Kee said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak Discuss Peace  </HEADLINE>
By SAMAR ASSAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met late Tuesday to consider a
U.S. plan to restart the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The plan involves a new timetable for achieving a permanent
peace by September, said Yasser Abed Rabbo, the senior Palestinian
negotiator. It was not clear after the meeting ended whether Arafat
or Barak had accepted the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Peace negotiations broke down last month after Palestinians
rejected Israel's plans for its latest army pullback in the West
Bank. That caused the two sides to miss a Feb. 13 deadline to draw
up the framwork of a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour meeting held somewhere in Israel was attended by
Barak and his foreign minister, David Levy, and Arafat and the
speaker of the Palestinian legislature, Ahmed Qureia, as well as
President Clinton's top Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
   According to Abed Rabbo -- who was not at the meeting, but
learned of the proposal from Arafat -- the proposed new timetable
set a May deadline for a framework agreement and included an
additional Israel troop pullback in June.
</P>
<P>
   The new pullback would be part of a third interim phase,
something the Palestinians have long demanded and which Israel has
promised but has sought to avoid. The Palestinians want to
maximalize land gains before negotiations on a final deal, while
the Israelis want to miminize handovers.
</P>
<P>
   Abed Rabbo said he personally was not happy with the proposal,
because it handed the Israelis the framework of a final agreement
before the final interim pull out.
</P>
<P>
   Handing the Israelis even a preliminary permanent agreement
''would pave the way for Israel not to implement the third phase,''
he said. He did not know whether Arafat was seriously considering
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's spokesmen were not reachable after midnight, but Israel
radio quoted his office as saying the meeting with Arafat was
''satisfactory,'' without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was spurred in part by the peacemaking efforts of
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   Ross arrived in Israel earlier in the day in his second visit to
the region since talks collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat suspended final status talks last month over the final
part of the second phase of Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank,
which was supposed to hand over 6.1 percent of the territory. The
Palestinians wanted that area to include populous West Bank suburbs
of Jerusalem; Israel refused, saying discussion of the suburbs
belonged to final-status negotiations on the city, claimed by both
sides as a capital.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown not only scuttled the original framework deadline.
It also put the Sept. 13 deadline for a final peace agreement in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Arafat told his legislature that he would
declare statehood this year, with or without Israel's consent. He
said Israel must stop procrastinating if it wants to meet the
September deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the moment of truth. The government of Israel must
stop dictating and wasting time,'' Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians prefer to win statehood as a result of a peace
agreement with Israel. A unilateral declaration would leave Arafat
with control over only 40 percent of the West Bank, and could
possibly trigger a military confrontation with Israel, which he
could not win.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat already agreed once -- in May 1999 -- to postpone a
statehood declaration, and thus would find it difficult to do so
again if a peace treaty is not reached by September.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian legislature, meanwhile, overwhelmingly
re-elected Qureia as its speaker on Tuesday. Qureia, a top
negotiator in current talks, took part in secret negotiations that
led to the 1993 Oslo accords, which lay the groundwork for the
current peace process. Since then, he has become a vocal critic of
what he calls Israeli intransigence.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges For Gun Checks Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Complaining that Congress ''has kept the
American people waiting long enough,'' President Clinton urged
lawmakers Tuesday to break an eight-month deadlock and require
background checks on gun show sales. But Senate Republicans reacted
cooly to Clinton's plea.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are poles apart,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman
of a House-Senate negotiating committee charged with writing a
compromise juvenile justice bill containing gun control provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on Congress to pass a gun bill by the April 20
anniversary of the Columbine High School slayings a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many people have to get killed before we do something?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the fatal shooting of Michigan first-grader Kayla
Rolland, Clinton met privately with the 6-year-old girl's mother,
Veronica McQueen. In a television interview earlier, McQueen said,
''I just don't want to see another parent have to bury another baby
over this, over something that is preventable, something that is
very, very preventable.''
</P>
<P>
   With election-year politics clouding Congress' agenda, Clinton
summoned the leaders of the House-Senate conference committee led
by Hatch. Last year, the Senate voted to institute 72 hour
background checks on gun show sales, but the House rejected that
provision when Republicans complained it was too strict and some
Democrats complained it was too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Despite White House prodding, the conference committee has not
met since August.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the gun lobby is cranking up pressure on Congress
again,'' the president said. ''But when first graders shoot first
graders, it's time for Congress to do what's right for America's
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the White House, Hatch appeared reluctant to heed
Clinton's request for a committee meeting, saying that ''might help
polarize (matters) even more.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, Hatch cited the Second Amendment's guarantee to
bear arms and said, ''I'm very loathe to go along with some of the
suggestions that have been made by those on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said one Senate bill provision -- a 72-hour waiting period
sponsored by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. -- ''would basically do
away with gun shows and it would push these people out into the
streets where we'd have more problems with guns.''
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., promised
to search -- with Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the panel's senior
Democrat -- for a compromise outside the formal conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hopeful, and we aren't going to abandon this at all,''
said Hyde, who has been trying to build support among Republicans
for a 24-hour waiting period for gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left the door open for compromise. ''My criteria is:
Does it work?'' He said more than 90 percent of the checks could be
completed within 24 hours but that the remaining people are ''20
times more likely to be turned down .... We have to have some
provision to deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
said Congress should proceed with the juvenile justice bill and gun
control provisions that have broad support, such as a requirement
for child safety locks and a ban on sales to people with juvenile
records. Lott said it was unfortunate that Clinton did not want
House Democrats to vote for a bill that contained those provisions
but lacked the gun show check.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers decried Hatch's reluctance to call a new conference
session and said inaction would carry a political cost: ''That's
going to cost the Republicans votes at the polls in November, not
us.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Gun Checks Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Complaining that Congress ''has kept the
American people waiting long enough,'' President Clinton urged
lawmakers Tuesday to break an eight-month deadlock and require
background checks on gun show sales. But Senate Republicans reacted
cooly to Clinton's plea.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are poles apart,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Failed To Release Letter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge ruled this week that the
Pentagon should have turned over a letter that referred to
confidential information about Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said ''the court is
mind-boggled'' that the Pentagon maintains it was not required to
surrender the letter for a lawsuit filed by a conservative group,
Judicial Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The letter details how the Pentagon in 1998 improperly provided
the news media with information from Tripp's personnel file in
which she incorrectly stated that she had never been arrested. In
fact, Tripp was arrested in 1969 for grand larceny, then freed on a
reduced charge of loitering.
</P>
<P>
   The letter by Les Blake, chief of the Pentagon's Freedom of
Information and Privacy Office, said that he was criticized by a
Pentagon superior because Blake e-mailed the superior details of
how Tripp's personnel information was released to the New Yorker
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said he was told by Margaret Munson, ''I should not have
put in writing the circumstances of the release ... as this
constitutes a 'record' and this is a very serious issue which could
involve the impeachment of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the letter was not responsive to a subpoena in
the lawsuit because the discussion between Blake and Munson
occurred after the Pentagon released the confidential information
about Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's failure to provide the document in the case
''calls into question ... DOD's ... good faith efforts to comply
with the subpoena,'' Lamberth said.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch said it was sent Blake's letter anonymously.

<HEADLINE> Fans blame Bills for losing Thomas  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo football fans can forgive
Thurman Thomas for joining the enemy. But they're finding it
tougher to let the Bills off the hook for letting their beloved
running back go free.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy that he found a home, and heartbroken that the Bills
wouldn't be man enough to step up to the plate to do something for
the guy,'' said Curt Noon over lunch Tuesday at Danny's Buffalo
Cuisine, located just down the street from the Bills' home, Ralph
Wilson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they should've matched his contract,'' added Noon, a
Bills season-ticket holder. ''He was a definite asset for this
team. But instead, now he's going to the enemy, we're going to face
him twice a year and watch them beat our heads into the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   While Thomas was in Miami officially announcing his signing with
the Dolphins, Noon and other Bills fans used the news as an
opportunity to vent their frustrations at the Bills for losing
Thomas, unceremoniously waiving him last month, as well as two
other core veterans Bruce Smith and Andre Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Adding salt to the wound was the fact that Thomas wound up a
Dolphin, a team considered to be the Bills' AFC East Division
archenemy.
</P>
<P>
   Noon accused the Bills of lacking class for the way they simply
gave up on Thomas, who spent his first 12 seasons with the Bills,
finishing as the team's all-time leading rusher.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to see him with the Dolphins. I'd rather have
Thurman Thomas still on my team,'' said Noon.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from Danny's, Big Tree Inn co-owner Bill Lindy
was still trying to come to grips with the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just can't picture him wearing that jersey,'' said Lindy,
who befriended Thomas and even attended his wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not really throwing stones, I just think that (the Bills)
could have handled this better,'' said Lindy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't heard anybody say they're glad to see him go,''
added Lindy. ''It's just the way they did it. It showed a total
lack of class.''
</P>
<P>
   Margie Pendleton tried to look at Thomas' departure from both
sides of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame. Emotionally, you'd like to think they'll be here
forever because you like them. But it's a business,'' Pendleton
said. ''You can't pay top dollar for something that has a lot of
miles on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills declined to comment on Thomas signing with the
Dolphins.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING to CORRECT writethru designation  </HEADLINE>
By RICH HARRIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore collected an easy
victory and insurgent Republican Sen. John McCain narrowly defeated
George W. Bush in Connecticut's presidential primaries Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The elections drew a higher-than-usual turnout.
</P>
<P>
   With 90 percent of precincts reporting, Gore led Bradley 55
percent to 42 percent. McCain led Bush 48 percent to 46 percent.
Alan Keyes ran a distant third with 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polling conducted for The Associated Press and television
networks by Voter News Service found Gore leading in almost every
part of the state except along the coast, where Bradley may have
benefited from his former career as a New York Knicks basketball
player.
</P>
<P>
   McCain drew support from moderates and previously unaffiliated
voters who registered Republican before the primary. But even in
GOP strongholds such as Fairfield County, McCain led Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush never played on his Connecticut roots: His father, former
President Bush, was a student at Yale University in New Haven when
the future Texas governor was born July 6, 1946. His grandfather,
Prescott Bush, was a U.S. senator from Connecticut from 1952 to
1963.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush largely ignored the state -- with its relatively paltry
25 GOP convention delegates -- in favor of larger prey in
California, New York and Ohio. His only recent visit to Connecticut
was a brief airport rally Saturday in Windsor Locks.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spoke Friday at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, in
what initially appeared would be competing appearances at Roman
Catholic universities in that city. But Bush canceled a speech at
Fairfield University, citing a scheduling conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In January, McCain held a fund-raiser in Greenwich and spoke at
the Metro Hartford Chamber of Commerce. He appeared at Yale in
December.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also drew support from Connecticut's wealthy Indian
tribes. A group of executives of the Mashantucket Pequots and
Foxwoods Resort Casino donated at least $20,900 to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is in his third term as senator from Arizona, is a
past chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. He remains a
member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had the backing of the state's Democratic leaders and spoke
at the state party's annual fund-raising dinner on Feb. 19.
Bradley's backers were irked that he was not invited.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was in Hartford early on the morning after the New
Hampshire primary, and visited the state in mid-February and again
on Thursday. His wife, Ernestine, visited Wesleyan University on
Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Chairman Ed Marcus lauded the efforts of town
chairmen and labor unions who supported Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a victory that was achieved with almost no money being
spent,'' he said Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's voting mirrored that of Massachusetts and Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   With just 67 delegates to the Democratic Party convention,
Connecticut did not draw the attention either party gave to larger
states.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz said turnout appeared
to be running higher than the 20 percent seen previously.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because there's been a very lively debate both on the
Republican side and the Democratic side, I think that generated a
lot of interest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican turnout was somewhat higher, she said, probably
because that race was considered more closely contested.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout appeared highest in Fairfield County, which Bysiewicz
attributed to the campaigns' high visibility in nearby New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was also heavier in the 16 cities and towns that had
town committee primaries, including West Haven, Windsor and
Newington.
</P>
<P>
   Only voters affiliated with one of the major parties could vote
Tuesday. Voters seemed more influenced by emotion than by issues.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Taylor, 51, of Hartford cast his ballot at the West End
Fire Station. He said he was voting for Gore mainly because he
likes him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has more experience than Bradley and he's helped President
Clinton get the country in great shape,'' said the 51-year-old
sanitation worker.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Parker, 71, of Hartford, a retired church secretary who
also voted at the fire station, said she chose for Gore ''because
he's straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bradley's OK, but I like the way Gore backed up the president
during all that trouble,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Joe Pizzella, 36, a marketing manager who cast his
ballot at the school in the affluent neighborhood, said he simply
liked Bush better than McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush just seems presidential in appearance and the way he
speaks,'' Pizzella said. ''I think he would be a refreshing
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Norton, 69, a Republican who worked as an insurance manager
before retiring, said she thinks Bush will make a dependable
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I voted for him even though even though I disagree with him on
abortion,'' she said. ''I'm not sure McCain is stable; I always get
the feeling he's about to blow, even when he's smiling.''

<HEADLINE> Pacers 90, Nuggets 89  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indiana, the league's leading free throw
shooters, made Denver pay for its fouling Tuesday as the Pacers
defeated the Nuggets 90-89 for their 24th consecutive home victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers overcame 39 percent shooting from the field by
outscoring Denver 23-6 from the free throw line. It was Denver's
ninth straight loss to the Pacers, a run that dates back to March
31, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio McDyess had 23 points for Denver, which outrebounded the
Pacers 60-43, with Keon Clark pulling down a career-high 22. The
Nuggets had 21 offensive rebounds, but they converted the
second-chance opportunities into just 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana trailed by as many as 18 in the first quarter and
overcame a 10-point deficit in the third to tie the game for the
first time at 67 on a 3-pointer by Reggie Miller. He had been
scoreless until he hit a jumper to reduce Denver's lead to 65-64
with 1:52 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose led the Pacers with 19 points and nine assists. Five
Pacers finished in double figures, with Travis Best scoring 13 off
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by Sam Perkins gave Indiana, which hasn't lost at
home since Nov. 25, its first lead at 80-79. Nick Van Exel put
Denver ahead for the last time with a jumper with 5:54 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick McKey then hit four free throws to put Indiana ahead to
stay while the Nuggets were going three minutes without a field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's 3-pointer made it 87-81, but Raef LaFrentz, who scored
17, hit a 3-pointer. Best then drove the length of the court for a
layup.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers were 23-of-32 from the free throw line, but missed
five straight with a chance to put the game away in the final
minutes. Best then ended the slump by making his second attempt
with 9.4 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Denver opened an 18-point lead in the first quarter when the
Pacers shot only 22 percent (4-of-18) from the field. A three-point
play by Chris Gatling put the Nuggets ahead 32-14.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers got back into with 27 points from their bench and
trailed 49-47 at halftime.
Notes: The Nuggets put Roy Rogers on the injured list with a
strained right thumb and activated Chris Herren, who had been on
the injured list since Feb. 1 with a left knee strain. ... Denver
also played without Tariq Abdul-Wahad, who has a sprained left
wrist. ... Rose scored in double figures for the 29th straight
game. ... Indiana has a league-best 27-2 record at home.

<HEADLINE> Capitals 4, Panthers 2  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Capitals completed their
improbable climb to first place, a position they haven't held this
late in 11 years, by beating the Florida Panthers 4-2 Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Konowalchuk and Adam Oates scored first-period goals, the
13th of the season for both, Peter Bondra netted his 19th and Uhf
Dahlen his 11th as the Capitals built a 4-0 lead and moved two
points ahead of their Southeast Division rivals with 15 games to
go.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 16, the Capitals were at .500 and trailed the Panthers
by 16 points. But they are 23-5-6 since Christmas and are unbeaten
in six games (5-0-1). The last time the Caps held sole possession
of first place in a division this late was March 17, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals, who lead the league in fewest losses (five) at
home, play nine of their final 15 games at the MCI Center. The
Panthers play six of their next seven on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Kozlov scored an unassisted goal late in the second and
Cameron Stewart tallied in the third for the Panthers, 3-7-1 in 11
games. Pavel Bure, who leads the league with 45 goals, never got in
the flow and was a non-factor for a team that played with little
intensity after the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and Florida don't play again in the regular season.
The Panthers won the first two meetings, but the Caps won the last
three.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals took the lead, just 2:08 in, on their first shot.
Dahlen, working down the right wing on a counterattack, waited
before delivering a pass just as Konowalchuk arrived in front of
the crease to slide home the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Oates was almost in the same spot when he made it 2-0, taking a
pass across the crease from Joe Sacco at 13:44.
</P>
<P>
   Bondra got the third goal during 4-on-4 play at 1:22 of the
second, ripping a slap shot from the right circle off a feed from
Andrei Nikolishin.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlen, an aggressive force throughout the game, was rewarded
with a power-play goal when he put in a rebound at 18:44 of the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Olaf Kolzig made 28 saves for the Capitals, but wasn't smooth
early and survived some hairy moments. Ryan Johnson beat Kolzig
with a slap shot in the first period, but the puck trickled just
wide of the post.
</P>
<P>
   Kolzig, 24-4-4 in his last 32 starts, was his usual masterful
self the rest of the way, making a nice leg save on Jaroslav
Spacek's slap shot after a chaotic sequence in the second period.

<HEADLINE> Knicks 111, Grizzlies 86  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Charlie Ward made an immediate difference in his
return from the injured list, showing the Knicks how much they
missed a true playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   New York opened a big early lead and cruised past the Vancouver
Grizzlies 111-86 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ward hit Larry Johnson with a crisp pass on a fast break just
under four minutes into the game, and Johnson turned it into a dunk
for a 13-0 lead. The Knicks stayed comfortably in front for the
rest of the night as they ended a two-game losing streak with ease,
shooting a season-high 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston scored 22 points apiece,
Patrick Ewing had 21 and Johnson and John Wallace added 13 each.
</P>
<P>
   Ward contributed five points, six assists and a team-high seven
rebounds to help the Knicks, the NBA's worst rebounding team, beat
an opponent on the boards for the first time in eight games. New
York outrebounded Vancouver 39-28.
</P>
<P>
   Ward has been on the injured list since Feb. 19 with a broken
little finger on his right hand, an injury he suffered against
Charlotte on Feb. 7 but continued to play with. Coach Jeff Van
Gundy used a big starting backcourt of Sprewell and Houston during
Ward's absence, and the team went just 5-4. It had trouble getting
into an offensive rhythm and broke 90 points only one time during
that span.
</P>
<P>
   All those offensive problems were nowhere to be found against
the Grizzlies and their soft defense, as New York had no trouble
maintaining a double-digit lead throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing had nine points and Sprewell eight in the first quarter,
and Ewing was up to 17 on 7-for-8 shooting by halftime as the
Knicks moved ahead 53-37.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell started the second half with a steal and a tomahawk
dunk, and Ward gave New York a 70-54 lead by driving past Mike
Bibby on an isolation play and converting an easy layup.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing left for good with 1:38 remaining in the third quarter and
the Knicks ahead by 19. Sprewell reached 20 points for the 27th
time this season when he hit a corner jumper for a 92-68 lead with
9:08 left. Houston scored 20 or more for the 31st time.
</P>
<P>
Notes: To make room for Ward, the Knicks placed forward David
Wingate on the injured list with a sore knee. ... The Grizzlies
activated center Bryant Reeves, who had been out since Feb. 26 with
a sore knee, and placed guard Milt Palacio on the injured list with
back spasms. ... Knicks backup point guard Chris Childs early in
the second quarter complaining of a headache and dizziness. He did
not return. ... Vancouver lost its fifth straight to remain one
victory shy of tying the franchise record of 19 set in 1997-98.
Shareef Abdur-Rahim led the Grizzlies with 18 points. ... The
Knicks improved to 11-3 in the first night of back-to-back games.
They are 3-10 on the second night going into Wednesday's game at
Washington -- the makeup of a game postponed by snowy weather on
Jan. 25. ... A fan in a front-row seat brought a ''Free Starks''
sign.

<HEADLINE> Ohio's DeWine, Md.'s Sarbanes Win  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio and Democratic Sen. Paul
Sarbanes of Maryland easily won nominations for new terms Tuesday
in the year's first round of state primaries.
</P>
<P>
   On a day of voting dominated by presidential contests in 16
states, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein was favored to gain
nomination for a second full term in California. Voters there also
were deciding 20 ballot questions, including whether to outlaw gay
marriage, toughen juvenile justice laws, tighten campaign finance
regulations and make Indian gambling legal.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine easily fought off two challenges from the right, pulling
in 79 percent of the vote. Real estate broker Ted Celeste, the
brother of former Gov. Richard Celeste, won the Democratic primary
to oppose DeWine, who hopes to become the state's first Republican
senator re-elected since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Sarbanes, running for a fifth term, was polling 84 percent of
the Democratic vote. Former Howard County police chief Paul
Rappaport was leading an eight-way GOP field.
</P>
<P>
   In the race to fill the seat of Ohio GOP Rep. John Kasich, the
retiring House Budget Chairman, voters nominated his endorsed
successor -- state Rep. Patrick Tiberi -- while Democrats chose
Columbus City Councilwoman Maryellen O'Shaughnessy.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Ohio, Mary Rose Oakar, who spent seven terms in Congress
before the House bank scandal ended her career in 1992, made a
political comeback. She won the Democratic nomination to a state
House seat from a working-class district in Cleveland -- tantamount
to election since there is no Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Another ex-House member bidding for a comeback was California's
Jay Kim, who was ousted out by voters after he pleaded guilty to
accepting illegal donations to his 1992 campaign. He bucked the
Republican leadership in a bid to challenge newly elected
Democratic Rep. Joe Baca.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, both parties are looking to position themselves for
November battles that will determine control of the new Congress.
Currently, Republicans hold a slim majority in the House, 222-212,
and a 55-45 majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In California, moderate Rep. Tom Campbell gave up his Silicon
Valley seat to seek the GOP nomination to challenge Feinstein. He
faced two conservative Republicans. Feinstein, bidding for a second
full term, had just a token primary challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Two long-time Democratic congressmen faced serious challenges.
Ohio Rep. James Traficant Jr., target of a Justice Department
investigation into organized crime, survived his, fighting off
three challengers to win nomination to a ninth term in his Rust
Belt district that includes Youngstown.
</P>
<P>
   California Rep. Matthew ''Marty'' Martinez, who has bucked party
leadership on gun control and abortion, was opposed in his bid for
a 10th term by state Sen. Hilda Solis, a fellow Hispanic, in his
working-class district near Los Angeles. With no Republicans
running, nomination is tantamount to election.
</P>
<P>
   In another Southern California primary, Mark Dornan, the son of
former Rep. Robert Dornan, sought the GOP nomination for a heavily
Republican district not far from the one that turned out his
firebrand conservative father four years ago. Car alarm millionaire
Darrell Issa, who lost a race for Senate two years ago, also was in
the primary for the seat of retiring GOP Rep. Ron Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti, last re-elected
after the O.J. Simpson trial, sought a third term amid criticism
for his handling of a Los Angeles Police Department corruption
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And San Diego voters were choosing a new mayor to replace
Republican Susan Golding, who is leaving office after two terms.
Bank chairman Peter Q. Davis and county Supervisor Ron Roberts were
among 12 candidates vying to lead the state's second-largest city.
A November runoff would be required if no one gained a majority.

<HEADLINE> Minorities flock to Gore; GOP moderates help McCain  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Black and Hispanic voters abandoned Bill Bradley
despite his focus on race relations and helped hand Vice President
Al Gore an overwhelming victory in New York's Democratic primary
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal and moderate Republicans -- who make up half of those
voting in New York's GOP primary -- went strongly for Arizona Sen.
John McCain, helping him keep the race very close with Texas Gov.
George Bush. Bush won among the nearly 50 percent of Republicans
who describe themselves as conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Results were from exit polls conducted for The Associated Press
and television networks by Voter News Service.
</P>
<P>
   Minority voters make up a third of the Democratic primary vote
in New York and went overwhelmingly for Gore, with blacks choosing
him 3-1 and Hispanics 6-1. Less than 10 percent of Democratic
voters said race relations was the most important issue in the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial gender gap also helped Gore, in which white women
preferred him 3-2. White men were the only racial group to prefer
Bradley, a former basketball star, and just barely, as Bradley
captured only a little more than half of their votes. Nearly every
other demographic group -- age, income, religion, etc. -- went for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On the GOP side, McCain's criticism of the religious right did
not appear to help him. Those who said it ''affected'' their vote --
about a third of the total GOP vote -- went 3-1 for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University, an anti-Catholic
school, did not appear to have hurt him. Catholics split about
evenly between the two Republican men -- as did most other
demographic groups.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who was a Vietnam POW, appeared to have a slight edge
among veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights supporters went heavily for McCain while
anti-abortion voters went for strongly for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki's endorsement of Bush did not matter to
three-fourths of the voters, but those who did care went 3-1 for
Bush. In Michigan, Gov. John Engler's endorsement of Bush had the
opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, New York Republicans said by a 2-1 margin that Bush
''has the knowledge to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley voters are also the mavericks of their
respective parties in their feelings about the Clintons. A fifth of
McCain voters said they approve of Hillary Rodham Clinton, compared
to 10 percent of Bush voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley voters also tended to be much more anti-Clinton -- both
anti-Bill and anti-Hillary -- than Gore supporters. Twenty percent
of Bradley voters disapprove of the president's job performance,
compared to 5 percent of Gore voters; a third of Bradley supporters
hold an unfavorable opinion of the first lady, compared to 10
percent of Gore voters.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the Democrats also said they hold a favorable
opinion of McCain -- compared to just 10 percent of Democrats who
view Bush favorably.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security and Medicare was cited as the top issue by about
a fifth of the Democrats, followed by health care, education and
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Moral values was cited as the top issue by about a fourth of
Republicans, followed by Social Security/Medicare. Campaign finance
reform and world affairs -- two of McCain's biggest themes -- were
each cited as top issues by about 1 in 10 voters.
</P>
<P>
   Voter News Service interviewed 1,092 voters in the New York
Republican presidential primary and 1,560 voters in the Democratic
primary. The margin of sampling error plus or minus 4 percentage
points on the Republican side and plus or minus 3 percentage points
for Democrats; it's larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Strike Halts Oil Export  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- Shipments from Nigeria's main crude oil
export terminals ground to a halt Tuesday, a day after thousands of
oil and petroleum industry workers went on strike, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   However, drilling and production in the world's sixth largest
oil exporter continued at nearly the highest levels ever, a senior
official of the Shell Oil Co. said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's large Bonny and Forcados sea terminals were among
those affected.
</P>
<P>
   The strike initiated Monday by the Petroleum and Natural Gas
Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, joined by at least one other
union, precipitated a consumer fuel shortage in the commercial
capital, Lagos, where lines of cars snaked through service stations
to wait for dwindling fuel supplies.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Heroin Trafficking Emerges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican authorities said Tuesday that they
have discovered a new drug trafficking organization smuggling
heroin into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the group's existence has become apparent from
a two large heroin seizures over the past year -- the latest on
Monday when more than 55 pounds were captured in the central state
of Zacatecas. In March 1999, agents captured 57.2 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be premature to say that this group is connected to
one of the established drug cartels'' in Mexico or in other parts
of the world, Assistant Attorney General Alfonso Navarrete said at
a news conference. ''But what we have at this moment are signs of a
well-organized group dedicating itself to transporting heroin to
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarrete said authorities are investigating whether the
organization is also operating drug laboratories or a garage where
cars are altered to hide drugs for transport.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's seizure, Federal Judicial Police agents, during a
routine inspection at a highway checkpoint, found 43 packages of
heroin in a secret dashboard compartment of a Ford Crown Victoria
with California license plates.
</P>
<P>
   The car's two occupants, who were detained, had met in a Los
Angeles bar with a contact who agreed to pay them $10,000 to
transport the drug, Navarrete said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican investigators are working with U.S. drug agents to
determine the nature and exact location of the drug organization,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Wizards 90, Timberwolves 86  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- After a succession of horrendous away games
throughout January and February, the Wizards are suddenly the kings
of the road in March.
</P>
<P>
   Losers of 15 straight away games through the end of last monthy,
Washington won its second consecutive road game Tuesday, outscoring
the Minnesota Timberwolves by 12 in the final period to win 90-86.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by eight, the Wizards started the final period with a
14-2 run to take the lead for the first time in the half. Reserve
Tracy Murray scored a game-high 17 for the Wizards, including 10 in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, which saw an eight-point lead become a seven-point
deficit in the first 10 minutes of the fourth, was led by Kevin
Garnett and Wally Szczerbiak, each with 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota had won seven of its last eight, but had fallen in
seven of its last eight vs. Washington. Early on, the Wizards set
the stage for another upset.
</P>
<P>
   Washington led by as many as five points on two separate
occasions in the first quarter on the strength of seven points by
Mitch Richmond. It was not until the final minute of the opening
period that the Wolves took their first lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Minnesota rallied before the half to lead by five at the
break. The Timberwolves were paced by Anthony Peeler's eight-point
second quarter and Garnett's 14-point first half.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota led by as many as 10 in the third quarter, as
Szczerbiak, a rookie, went 5-for-5 from the field and had 12 points
in the period.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Wizards lead the league with five former CBA players on
their roster. Chris Whitney, Aaron Williams, Ike Austin, Gerard
King and Lorenzo Williams all spent time in the CBA. ... The
Timberwolves have never beaten the Wizards. Minnesota's last win
vs. Washington came in April 1997, when the team was still known as
the Bullets. Washington is 8-1 at Target Center, the best of any
Timberwolves opponent.

<HEADLINE> Gore Lays Out GOP Battle Plan  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- For Al Gore, the inevitability of a
Super Tuesday rout yielded not so much a celebration as a making of
amends with his Democratic rival-- and a laying down of plans to go
after his Republican presidential foe.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, in television interviews, challenged the
eventual GOP nominee to eliminate 30- and 60-second radio ads,
debate twice a week and give up so-called soft money -- donations
that go to political parties that then help their candidates by
running issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''Join us now, because our campaign is your cause,'' Gore
beckoned, throwing the Democratic Party tent wide open to
supporters of Sen. Bill Bradley, independents and Republicans. ''We
are the party of the mainstream. We are the party of hope. We
appeal to hope, not anger or exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took the stage inside a hotel ballroom, only partly filled,
and wasted little time reveling in his grand defeat of Bradley in
Tuesday's Democratic presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he used his 15 minutes before a national audience -- and
four pages of typed script, which he closely followed -- to put
Republicans on notice for the brutal presidential fight ahead on
issues from abortion to the environment to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to build on our record of prosperity. We don't need to
go back to where we were eight years ago. They tried their approach
before,'' Gore said, referring to deficit-ridden Republican
administrations. ''It produced a triple-dip recession and
quadrupled the national debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a contrast with his take on the nasty Republican primary
contest between Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, Gore
promised his would be a campaign ''conducted in full daylight, and
not through secretly funded, special-interest attack ads or smear
telephone calls from the extremist right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would continue to hold open meetings around the
nation, with his next planned in Detroit on Wednesday night. He and
his wife, Tipper, also pledged to conduct ''working family days,''
which aides described as opportunities for both Gores to visit
workplaces and learn firsthand the everyday concerns of teachers,
nurses, factory workers, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to his primary rival, Gore extended a generously
conciliatory hand to Bradley, with whom Gore had traded accusations
and insults for months. Bradley telephoned his congratulations to
Gore on Tuesday night for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bradley had ''moved and touched'' Americans with his
campaign for healing the nation's racial divide.
</P>
<P>
   ''He believes in this healing heart and soul. I share his
commitment to it. I have learned from his passion for it. And
tonight I salute Sen. Bradley and his wife, Ernestine,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech echoed off a flat crowd of supporters. ''After all
the weeks of anticipation, people really just expected him to
win,'' Mary Kate Campbell, a Vanderbilt University graduate
student, said by way of explaining the sedate feel to Gore's party.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore tried to rally some festivity. ''They may be
celebrating Fat Tuesday around the world, but here in Nashville is
the very best place to celebrate Super Tuesday!''
</P>
<P>
   Confetti cannons punctuated the end of her husband's speech.
Before Gore ran off to a round of live television interviews, Rep.
Bart Gordon, D-Tenn., plucked a piece of red confetti that had
stuck to the balding spot on Gore's head.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who just five months ago pronounced his campaign badly
off-track, watched win after win drift in as he cuddled on the sofa
of his 10th-floor hotel suite with his wife. Watching CNN with
reporters watching them, Gore was playful but not gloating.
</P>
<P>
   Deflecting the journalists' questions, Gore made fun of his own
rote response -- ''I'm not taking a single vote for granted'' -- to
any and all queries over the past several days.
</P>
<P>
   ''My principal concern now is to build suspense for the speech
I'm going to give in the ballroom,'' Gore quipped. ''And I'm not
taking anyone's applause for granted.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees Go 0-6 in Spring Training  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER, AP Baseball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Once again, George Steinbrenner made an early
exit. And then he went out of his way to say he's not worried about
his team -- yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Boss left his box -- along with guest, television host Regis
Philbin -- as his winless New York Yankees lost to Minnesota 7-5
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat dropped the World Series champions to 0-6 in spring
training. Steinbrenner, however, was downright jovial after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be the first to let you guys know when it's not early,''
the owner said. ''Until then, relax.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting close. One of these days very soon, we're going
to bust out.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was ready to explode, he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, the Yankees. The Yankees. Not me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, Steinbrenner ducked out during a 15-1 pasting by
Cleveland. He later said he had a dinner engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody likes losing. I don't like losing,'' Steinbrenner said
at the time. ''I don't like losing by the numbers we're losing
by.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the stats Steinbrenner has seen so far in spring
training: New York has been outscored 56-21 and has not held a lead
in any game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime they're 0-6, that kind of stands out for the
Yankees,'' said Twins pitcher Eric Milton, who started his career
in New York organization. ''Anytime you see the Yankees losing, it
is a little odd. But it is spring training and you can't go by
spring training records.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will try for their first win Wednesday against
Boston in Fort Myers, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   No need to remind the Boss that the Yankees went 14-19 last
spring before rolling to their second straight Series sweep. Or to
mention that Los Angeles is also 0-6 this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The only spark this spring came in the exhibition opener when,
trailing 9-0 with two outs in the ninth inning, New York brought
the tying run to the plate in a 9-7 loss to Toronto. Steinbrenner
attended that game, too, but left before the rally.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Steinbrenner watched Roger Clemens give up five runs
in 2 2-3 innings before ducking inside. Prior to the game, David
Cone joked with Steinbrenner, calling his start against the Indians
a ''must-win.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone lasted 2 2-3 innings, giving up three runs and four hits.
He left after Roberto Alomar's home run.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody wants to be embarrassed, but it's early,'' Cone said.
''As far as I'm concerned, the Kansas City Royals can win the
Grapefruit League.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Royals started out 0-4.
</P>
<P>
   ''The record doesn't matter, but how you play matters,''
shortstop Derek Jeter said. ''We aren't doing anything right. We
haven't hit well, we haven't pitched well, we haven't played
defense well, we haven't run the bases well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though it's early, this was not the way the Yankees wanted
to start out.
</P>
<P>
   Not after Darryl Strawberry was suspended. Not after Orlando
Hernandez, Ramiro Mendoza and Ed Yarnall weren't healthy enough to
pitch at the start.
</P>
<P>
   And now, these six losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Am I worried about it? No,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said
before the Twins game. ''Does it consume me? No. Am I going to try
and do something different? No.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Losing in spring training is not important. It's important to
make sure you play the game right. We've been a little sloppy
playing the game and that bothers me.''

<HEADLINE> No. 1 Conn. 79, No. 8 Rutgers 59  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Sue Bird scored 18 points as top-ranked
Connecticut won its seventh straight Big East tournament title,
beating No. 8 Rutgers 79-59 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut (30-1) has won 10 regular-season titles and nine
tournament championships since the 1988-89 season. The Huskies' 19
titles are the most in the country by any women's or men's program.
Georgetown's men are second with 13.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second appearance in the title game for the
Scarlet Knights (22-7). They lost the 1998 final 67-58 to
Connecticut at the Louis Brown Athletic Center at Rutgers. The win
gives Connecticut a three-game sweep over Rutgers this season.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut overcame spotty shooting in the first half, hitting
17-of-20 from the floor for 85 percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies never trailed. Bird hit a 3-pointer with 17 seconds
gone in the first half to kick off a 7-2 run, but neither team
settled into an offensive flow in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers shot 28 percent, hitting 9-of-32. Connecticut didn't
fare much better, hitting 8-of-27 for 29 percent, but held on to
the lead with 10-of-14 shooting from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   The physical play resulted in a combined 18 fouls in the half.
Tamika Williams made 8-of-12 free throws. And for nearly 10
minutes, that was all of Connecticut's offense. Swin Cash's layup
at 15:12 was the last field goal until a Williams' layup with 5:20
left. In between, the Huskies were 7-of-8 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut got its uptempo game untracked in the second half
and cured its shooting woes with an opening 12-2 burst, hitting
5-of-6 in the first five minutes. Rutgers was 1-of-5 in the same
span and had four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's Svetlana Abrosimova, scoreless in the first half,
had eight of her 12 points in the first six minutes. Cash had 13
points and nine rebounds for Connecticut, which dominated the
boards, 41-27.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut shut down Shawnetta Stewart using six different
players to guard the Knights' scoring leader. She was held to just
nine points, six below her average.
</P>
<P>
   Tasha Pointer and Usha Gilmore had 13 points apiece for Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers reached the final with wins over Villanova and Notre
Dame. Connecticut advanced by beating St. John's and Boston
College.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Subway Derails; 2 Killed  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Two subway trains carrying more than 1,500
rush-hour commuters collided when one of the trains derailed
Wednesday, killing two people and injuring at least 34 others,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The trains were traveling toward each on parallel tracks when
the sideswipe collision occurred, shearing off the outer wall on
one of the train's rear cars. Torn out seats, chunks of buckled
metal and other debris littered the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the injured were rushed to hospitals in critical
condition following the 9:03 a.m. accident, said Tokyo Fire
Department spokesman Fukuo Isozaki. At least 31 others were less
seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the derailment near Nakameguro Station in western
Tokyo, one of Tokyo's busiest subway lines, was not immediately
known, said spokesman Ryuichi Kinoshita of the Tokyo Rapid Transit
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Kyodo News agency reported that the train had been derailed by
an explosion. But Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and other officials
quickly denied the report, saying there was no evidence of foul
play. Obuchi's Cabinet set up a task force to deal with the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Subway spokeswoman Sachie Uehara said both trains were traveling
less than 25 mph when they collided.
</P>
<P>
   She said both of the dead -- a man in his 50s and a woman in her
20s -- were on the end car of the derailed train. Two cars in the
middle of the other train were also heavily damaged. She said most
injured passengers were on these three cars.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw a huge lump of metal penetrating my car, and everybody
was panicking,'' a 21-year-old commuter, who did not give his name,
told television network NHK in a live interview from the scene.
''Many passengers were collapsing.''
</P>
<P>
   The train that derailed was carrying about 240 passengers and
the other train had 1,300 people aboard, the fire department
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Police cordoned off the busy thoroughfare near the Nakameguro
station, causing a massive traffic jam. Hundreds of workers in
hardhats and yellow jackets swarmed around the gouged car on the
train.
</P>
<P>
   Service was soon resumed on some parts of the subway line, but
throughout the morning tens of thousands of passengers were
directed to use other trains or buses to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was believed to be the worst in Tokyo since an
out-of-service train and a 12-car express collided, injuring 32
people, in October 1997. In May 1991, a crowded tourist train
slammed head on into a local train in western Japan, killing 42
people and injuring 415.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall Moderately  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell moderately Wednesday
morning after U.S. stocks plunged on Wall Street. The dollar
slipped against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 144.15 points,
or 0.72 percent, to 19,800.09 at the end of the morning session. On
Tuesday, the average closed up 147.89 points, or 0.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 107.37 yen at late morning, down 0.09 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 106.16
yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices moved lower following a steep tumble
on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average dropped
374.47 to 9,796.03 on Tuesday, its fourth-biggest one-day point
fall and its lowest close since March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow fell after an earnings warning from consumer products
giant Procter &AMP; Gamble raised concerns among investors about
profits at blue-chip and industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index, which soared more
than 100 points to 5,006.78 in early trading, turned lower amid
profit-taking and computer-programmed selling that kicked in at the
5,000 mark. The Nasdaq finished down 57.01 at 4,847.84.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar was lower amid mild selling by
overseas investors in line with its trend in New York. But traders
said the dollar's slide was limited because of heavy dollar-buying
from Japanese banks.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 103.00 yen, down
from 103.30 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 9.43 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,656.10.
The TOPIX closed up 15.70 points, or 0.95 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.7450 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.7800 percent. Its
price rose 0.30 point to 100.46.

<HEADLINE> Art Critic Faces Driving Charge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERTH, Australia (AP) -- Author and Time Magazine art critic
Robert Hughes was ordered Tuesday to stand trial for dangerous
driving that caused a car crash that almost killed him last year.
</P>
<P>
   Police allege Hughes caused the crash, which also injured three
others, when the rental car he was driving veered across the road
into the path of an oncoming car.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, 60, suffered multiple fractures in the accident. Doctors
considered amputating his right leg before deciding instead on a
reconstruction instead using a metal rod and pins.
</P>
<P>
   The three others were less seriously injured in the collision,
which occurred May 28 on the Great Northern Highway, 73 miles south
of the town of Broome on the northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian-born, New York-based critic traveled from the
United States attend a preliminary hearing in Broome Magistrate's
Court on Tuesday, to face two charges of driving in a manner
causing grievous bodily harm. He entered the court in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   He was committed to stand trial on May 8, and released on his
own recognizance on $1,800 bail.

<HEADLINE> Chargers, Punters OK Four-Year Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Punter Darren Bennett agreed to a new four-year
deal with the San Diego Chargers on Tuesday, keeping together the
team's kicking unit.
</P>
<P>
   Financial details weren't immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett will turn 39 just after the 2003 season, the last year
under the new deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm planning on still punting on this level for the next four
years, so it's a great to get a show of faith from the Chargers,''
said Bennett, who was selected to the Pro Bowl as a rookie after
the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, 35, broke into the NFL after playing Australian Rules
Football. He visited the United States and tried out with the
Chargers after winning an Aussie Rules long-ball kicking contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett visited the Green Bay Packers last week and planned to
visit another team Tuesday, ''but when the Chargers gave us an
offer, it was a good offer and we decided to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bennett and long snapper David Binn had been unrestricted
free agents. Binn re-signed for two years in February. Bennett
doubles as holder for kicker John Carney. The three have been
together since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''The three amigos,'' Bennett said. ''Those guys are like my
brothers. We've got a great rhythm together. I think John was
relieved. He thought he might have to break in a new holder.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett led the NFL with a 38.7-yard net average in 1999, and
had a 43.9-yard gross average. He matched his own club record with
89 punts and set a personal-best with 32 inside the 20-yard line.

<HEADLINE> Export of PlayStation 2 Prohibited  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Exporting Sony Corp.'s newly-released PlayStation 2
game console is prohibited without permission from Japan's Trade
Ministry, company and government officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The console and accompanying 8-megabyte memory cards are subject
to controls under Japan's Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade law
because of high-powered encryption technology used in the system,
Sony Computer Entertainment spokeswoman Yuko Takano said.
</P>
<P>
   Takano said it was the first time a Sony game machine has fallen
under the regulations, which typically apply to high-tech
electronic equipment, sensors and computers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, PlayStation 2 was designed according to Japanese
safety standards and may not function properly elsewhere, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Using this product in countries other than Japan may lead to
serious accidents due to voltage difference, etc.,'' a statement
from Sony said.
</P>
<P>
   Takano also said, however, that the system to be marketed
overseas later this year will be produced for use in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The new game machine, released March 5, has stirred excitement
in Japan for its use of cutting-edge technology, vivid graphics and
Internet connectability.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, which plans to release PlayStation 2 in the United States
and Europe in autumn, will have to get a special permit from the
Trade Ministry before doing so, ministry officials said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley lays claim to driving debate  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bill Bradley fashioned a celebration of sorts
Tuesday night, finding little to trumpet in the day's votes but
much to take credit for in a campaign ''that shaped the national
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   His thinking seeming to slip into the past tense, he told 1,000
supporters in a packed hotel ballroom 20 blocks from Madison Square
Garden -- where he found basketball stardom playing for the New York
Knicks -- that he'll soon make his plans known.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe history will write that we tried to change politics,
to restore trust, and to defeat the politics of expediency,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've brought core Democratic issues to the fore. When nobody
was talking about the 44 million Americans without health
insurance, we gave voice to the voiceless. When no one was talking
about the 13 children who die every day from gun violence, we heard
their cries.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more down-to-earth note -- if not crashing to earth --
Bradley invoked a football coaching legend in describing his
congratulatory phone call to Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just called the vice president to congratulate him on his
victories tonight,'' he said. ''He won. I lost. And on one level I
agree with Vince Lombardi when he said winning isn't everything,
it's the only thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Music captured the mood at his campaign party. As the first
polls closed at 7 p.m., the blues echoed through a nearly empty
room.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign had told the Harlem-based Real Deal Soul Band to be
ready to break into ''Ain't No Stopping Us Now'' if the night took
a surprising turn for the better.
</P>
<P>
   The cue never came.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd eventually did, with the ballroom filling up. Wearing
stony expressions, dozens of key supporters assembled on stage at 9
p.m. to await a concession speech everyone knew would come.
</P>
<P>
   It happened shortly before 9:30 p.m. as Bradley told the crowd
he had called Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keep running, Bill!'' yelled a supporter from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after the speech, closed-circuit televisions
throughout the room played a Bradley campaign film featuring clips
of Bradley, his wife Ernestine and such high-profile supporters as
Harvard professor Cornel West, Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone and
actor Harvey Keitel.
</P>
<P>
   The film played in a loop, over and over, never reaching an end.
</P>
<P>
   Young Bradley aides, who have spent months working in his West
Orange, N.J., office, had already converged on New York City for a
few nights of partying.
</P>
<P>
   Other supporters brought Mardi Gras beads, determined to
celebrate Fat Tuesday if not Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers wearing blue ''Team Bradley'' identification passes
nibbled snacks and waited for something, anything, to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Many had never worked on a campaign before, like Ory Brown of
New York, an opera singer who spent her free afternoons helping the
Bradley campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I know is what I did,'' Brown said. ''I worked really hard
and I voted, and that's all I can do.''

<HEADLINE> Bulls 89, Hawks 82  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Say this for the Atlanta Hawks and the Chicago
Bulls: They know how to make a meaningless game interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Brand scored 31 points and Randy Brown came through with a
huge 3-pointer and two free throws Tuesday as the Bulls beat the
Hawks in an ugly game featuring two ejections and six technical
fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carr scored six points in the last eight minutes,
including two free throws with 44 seconds left to seal the game.
</P>
<P>
   The victory snapped an eight-game losing streak for the Bulls,
who won despite shooting a dismal 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lost its third straight despite six players in double
digits. Alan Henderson led the Hawks with 15 points before fouling
out with 8:16 left. Dikembe Mutombo had 12 points and 21 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson unraveled with his last foul, and he took the Hawks
right along with him. With the Hawks clinging to a one-point lead,
he was called for his sixth foul on a pass into the post to Dickey
Simpkins. He argued the call for about 20 seconds before his
teammates guided him back to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   He continued muttering, and referee Ken Mauer hit him with his
second technical. Henderson had picked up his first technical in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second ejection of the night. Bulls coach Tim Floyd
got tossed in the first quarter for arguing two no-calls on a Bulls
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hoiberg made the technical foul shot, and Brown hit a rare
3-pointer to give the Bulls a 74-71 lead. Jason Terry scored for
the Hawks, but the Bulls came right back with baskets from Carr and
Brand, and two foul shots from Brown for the 80-73 lead with 3:30
left.
</P>
<P>
   Carr put the game away with a 9-foot jumper with 49 seconds left
and the two free throws, which gave Chicago an 86-79 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With the two worst teams in the Central Division, this game
didn't have much meaning. And for most of the night, it looked more
like a WWF match than a basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd didn't even make it through the first quarter. On a
possession with about 2:55 left, Henderson hacked Simpkins as
Simpkins went up for a layup while Dikembe Mutombo wrapped his arms
around Brown's neck and face.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd started yelling, and referee Tim Donaghy quickly gave him
a technical. Floyd kept screaming, following Donaghy around the
floor, so Donaghy ejected him -- the first ejection of the season
for Floyd, who was a screamer and a coat thrower at Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Lorenzen Wright picked up a technical with 10:35 left
in the second. Six minutes later, Bulls assistant Phil Johnson got
one while sitting on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the technicals, only 35 fouls were called in the
game.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Bulls only had six turnovers. ... The Hawks
outrebounded the Bulls 52-44. ... Hoiberg was the only starter to
not pick up at least one foul.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Roman Turek made 16 saves to record his fifth
shutout as the St. Louis Blues extended their unbeaten streak to
four with a 4-0 win against the Phoenix Coyotes on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Turek, with 35 wins, is one away from tying Curtis Joseph's team
record for most in a season. Joseph set the mark in the 1993-94
season.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis lowered its league-leading goals against average to
1.99. The Blues have allowed two goals or less in 47 of 66 games
and are 37-3-7 in those contests.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Finley, Michal Handzus, Marty Reasoner and Scott Young
scored for the Blues, 9-1-1 in their last 11. Lubos Bartecko and
Pavol Demitra assisted on Handzus' goal, giving that line 56 points
in the last 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix leads the NHL with four players with 20 or more goals,
but the Blues held the Coyotes to just two shots from the 10:00
mark of the first period through the second. Coyotes goalie Sean
Burke faced 30 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Burke had the Blues shutout until Finley scored, 7:19 into the
second period with his second goal. Finley broke in 2-on-1 with
Tyson Nash, and scored on a rebound on Nash's slap shot.
</P>
<P>
   With just 43 seconds left in the period, Handzus gave the Blues
some insurance thanks to some nice work by Bartecko. After firing a
centering pass from Demitra wide of the goal, Bartecko tracked the
puck down behind the net and fed Handzus in front. Handzus put it
over Burke for his 22nd goal.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoner scored his eighth off a rebound of Dave Ellett's shot
at 12:39 of the third. Young scored on a pass from Craig Conroy at
14:29.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis is the only team with a perfect record (29-0-0) when
leading after two periods.

Bush Wins California, N.Y. Primaries
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- George W. Bush won California, New York and five other
Super Tuesday primaries, accelerating his drive to vanquish John McCain's
political insurgency. "It's a huge step toward the nomination," Bush declared as
McCain considered whether to continue his Republican presidential campaign.ush
captured 162 delegates in California's winner-take-all primary. Bush won Ohio,
Georgia, Missouri and Maryland by double-digit margins -- and he broke McCain's

Connecticut, Rhode Island and Vermont as voters in 13 states participated in the

Gore Routs Bradley

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Gore swept past Bill Bradley in Super Tuesday primaries
from Maine to California, pushing his rival to the brink of withdrawal in the
Democratic presidential campaign. "We need to build on our record of
prosperity," the vice president said, turning his focus toward November. Blacks
and Hispanics preferred Gore over Bradley by a margin of 8-1; the margin among
union members was smaller, but a healthy 3-1. Bradley fared better among
independents. "In this election, we are the party of the mainstream," the vice
president said, swiftly turning his focus toward November.

Arafat, Barak Discuss Peace
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met late Tuesday to consider a U.S. plan to
restart the stalled peace process. The plan involves a new timetable for
achieving a permanent peace by September, said Yasser Abed Rabbo, the senior
Palestinian negotiator. It was not clear after the meeting ended whether Arafat
or Barak had accepted the proposal. Peace negotiations broke down last month
after Palestinians rejected Israel's plans for its latest army pullback in the
West Bank. That caused the two sides to miss a Feb. 13 deadline to draw up the
framwork of a final peace agreement.

interested. But if the military organization would make such decisions as it
made in Yugoslavia, we would not like that," he said. "We are not going to join
such a union." Russia-NATO ties were almost completely frozen last year after
Russia vehemently objected to the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia; the
tension was aggravated by wide criticism in the West of Russia's offensive in
Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Minorities flock to Gore; women, Catholics prefer Bush  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Black and Hispanic voters abandoned Bill Bradley
despite his focus on race relations and helped hand Vice President
Al Gore an overwhelming victory in New York's Democratic primary
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Strong support from women and conservative Republicans -- along
with the endorsement of Gov. George Pataki -- helped Texas Gov.
George Bush beat Arizona Sen. John McCain in the Republican
primary. Women voted 55-40 for Bush over McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Religion also played a role in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic voters did not desert Bush, supporting him 5-4 over
McCain despite Bush's much-criticized appearance at Bob Jones
University, where anti-Catholic statements have been voiced.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right made up just 15 percent of New York's
Republican primary voters, but McCain's recent attack on that
element of his party appeared to have backfired. Nearly 40 percent
of all GOP voters Tuesday said McCain's criticism of the religious
right affected their vote, and they went for Bush better than 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Results were from exit polls conducted for The Associated Press
and television networks by Voter News Service.
</P>
<P>
   Minority voters made up a third of the Democratic primary vote
in New York and went overwhelmingly for Gore, with blacks choosing
him 3-1 and Hispanics 5-1. Less than 10 percent of Democratic
voters said race relations was the most important issue in the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial gender gap also helped Gore, with white women
preferring him 3-2. White men were evenly split between Gore and
Bradley, a former basketball star. Nearly every other demographic
group -- by age, income, religion, education -- went for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On the GOP side, liberal and moderate Republicans -- who make up
half of those voting in New York's GOP primary -- preferred McCain
by about a 10-point spread. But the other half of Republican
primary voters -- the self-described conservatives -- went nearly 2-1
for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was a Vietnam POW, but veterans were about evenly split
between him and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights supporters preferred McCain while anti-abortion
voters went strongly for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki's endorsement of Bush did not matter to
three-fourths of the voters, but those who did care went 3-1 for
Bush. In Michigan, Gov. John Engler's endorsement of Bush had the
opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who they voted for, a third of GOP primary voters
said they do not believe Bush ''has the knowledge to serve
effectively as president.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley voters turned out to be the mavericks of
their respective parties in their feelings about the Clintons. A
fifth of McCain voters said they approve of Hillary Rodham Clinton,
compared to 10 percent of Bush voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley voters also tended to be much more anti-Clinton -- both
anti-Bill and anti-Hillary -- than Gore supporters. Twenty-two
percent of Bradley voters disapprove of the president's job
performance, compared to 6 percent of Gore voters; a third of
Bradley supporters hold an unfavorable opinion of the first lady,
compared to 10 percent of Gore voters.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the Democrats also said they hold a favorable
opinion of McCain -- compared to just 10 percent of Democrats who
view Bush favorably.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security and Medicare was cited as the top issue by about
a fifth of the Democrats, followed by education and the economy.
Health care -- despite its prominence as an issue between Gore and
Bradley -- was cited as a top issue by only a tenth of Democratic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Moral values was cited as the top issue by about a fourth of
Republicans, followed by Social Security/Medicare. Campaign finance
reform and world affairs -- two of McCain's biggest themes -- were
each cited as top issues by about 1 in 10 voters.
</P>
<P>
   Voter News Service interviewed 1,414 voters in the New York
Republican presidential primary and 1,698 voters in the Democratic
primary. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Suns 108, Rockets 101  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Rodney Rogers scored six of his 15 points in the
final two minutes to spark the Phoenix Suns to 108-101 victory over
the Houston Rockets on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Anfernee Hardaway led Phoenix with 24 points, followed by Tom
Gugliotta with 23, Cliff Robinson with 19 and Jason Kidd and Rogers
each with 15.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Francis paced Houston with 32 points, followed by Shandon
Anderson with 20, Cuttino Mobley with 14 and Hakeem Olajuwon with
12.
</P>
<P>
   A basket by Anderson gave Houston a 91-86 lead with 7:05 left.
The Rockets led 95-93 after a basket by Mobley before the Suns
outscored them 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   A field goal by Rogers was countered by Francis' basket as the
Suns retained a 102-99 advantage with 1:53 left. Rogers then sank a
pair of free throws and added a dunk moments later.
</P>
<P>
   After a basket by Francis, Kidd converted two free throws with
18 seconds left to secure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Francis scored 17 third-quarter points, including 12 in the
final four minutes of the period. The score was tied 80-80 going
into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix moved ahead 10-2 after two baskets by Gugliotta.
Consecutive baskets by Anderson gave Houston its first lead, 19-18,
with 3:48 left in the period. The Suns then outscored Houston 14-6
to lead 32-25 going into the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns lead 38-29 with 7:46 left in the second period, before
Houston went on a 12-2 run, eight by Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   Two baskets by Olajuwon in the final minute of the half boosted
Houston to a 55-51 lead at the half.
Notes: Mobley leads all NBA players with 10 starts or less in
scoring with a 15-point average. ... Houston is 8-29 over the last
three seasons in games that are nationally televised. ... When the
Suns score 21 or more points off opponent turnovers, they are 17-5.
... Phoenix is 29-9 when holding its opponent to fewer than 100
points.

<HEADLINE> Tuesday's Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Juan Gonzalez and Sammy Sosa hit their first home
runs of the
spring, while Jose Canseco and Jay Buhner tried to show they've
recovered from injury problems.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gonzalez connected for one of five homers in the Detroit Tigers'
10-7 loss to the Atlanta Braves in Lakeland, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just looks menacing at the plate, doesn't he?'' new Tigers
manager Phil Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, acquired from Texas during the offseason, hit a long,
two-run shot. He's been nursing a strained left hamstring. As a
result, he has been used only as a designated hitter this spring,
and only at Joker Marchant Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to see him get to where he wants to be, which is
swinging the bat,'' Garner said. ''He doesn't need to make road
trips in spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, Ariz., Sosa homered in a five-run fifth, but the
Arizona Diamondbacks rallied for four runs with two outs in the
ninth to beat the Chicago Cubs 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's drive off the left-field scoreboard at Electric Park was
estimated at 425 feet.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Petersburg, Fla., Canseco's back felt fine and he had a
run-scoring single in his spring debut.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm healthy. That's my main concern,'' the 35-year-old
designated hitter said after going 1-for-3 with a walk in the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays' 3-1 win over Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco sat out the first weekend of exhibition games after
arriving in camp five days late. He was sidelined for six weeks
following back surgery last summer, and manager Larry Rothschild is
allowing him to get into playing shape at his own pace.
</P>
<P>
   With Ken Griffey gone, the Seattle Mariners are counting on
Buhner to become a home run threat again. He appears ready for the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner hit his second home run of the spring Tuesday to lead the
Mariners over the Anaheim Angels 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   At Tampa, Fla., the Yankees dropped to 0-6, losing to the
Minnesota Twins 7-5. New York has been outscored 56-21 and has not
held a lead in any game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Am I worried about it? No,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said
before the game. ''Does it consume me? No. Am I going to try and do
something different? No. Losing in spring training is not
important. It's important to make sure you play the game right.
We've been a little sloppy playing the game and that bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   In roster moves, catcher Gregg Zaun was traded to the Kansas
City Royals from the Detroit for a player to be named or cash, and
pitcher Jeff Juden, unwanted by many in the New York Yankees'
organization, was placed on waivers for the purpose of his
unconditional release.
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Reds (ss) 3, Phillies (ss) 1:
</P>
<P>
   At Sarasota, Fla., Ken Griffey Jr. went hitless and Sean Casey
bruised a knee. Griffey flied out to left field and walked twice,
leaving him 2-for-8 in four games with one homer. Casey was hit on
the back of the right knee by one of Joe Grahe's pitches in the
fourth inning. The first baseman came out of the game but was
expected to play Wednesday.
Reds (ss) 5, Phillies (ss) 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Clearwater, Fla., with his father watching from the stands,
Pete Rose Jr. went 2-for-3 in his first start of the spring. He
tied the game at 2 with an RBI single in the second off Ron
Villone.
Cardinals (ss) 2, Dodgers (ss) 1:
</P>
<P>
   At Vero Beach, Fla., five St. Louis pitchers combined on a
two-hitter, dropping Los Angeles to 0-5. Starter Garrett
Stephenson, Luther Hackman and Gene Stechschulte pitched two
hitless innings each. Jose Vizcaino got the Dodgers' first hit off
Mike Mohler in the seventh. Mike James finished, allowing a single
to Juan Castro.
Cardinals (ss) 5, Dodgers (ss) 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Kent Bottenfield unveiled a new sinker and
Larry Sutton was 2-for-2, breaking an eighth-inning tie with an RBI
single off Terry Adams as the Cardinals improved to 5-1.
Red Sox 13, Pirates 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla. Ramon Martinez pitched two scoreless innings
and Trot Nixon had three hits.
Indians 2, Astros 1:
</P>
<P>
   At Winter Haven, Fla., Lance Johnson singled and scored the
winning run on a head-first slide into home plate. The loss was the
Astros' first in spring training after four straight wins. Houston
starter Shane Reynolds pitched three scoreless innings and Dwight
Gooden followed with two perfect innings.
Blue Jays 3, Royals 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Dunedin, Fla., Carlos Delgado hit his first home run of the
spring in a three-run seventh inning, dropping Kansas City to 0-5.
Mets 5, Orioles 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Mike Hampton allowed one earned run
and two hits in four innings for the Mets, who made four errors but
went ahead with a pair of unearned runs in the ninth on third
baseman Jesse Garcia's error.
Expos 5. Marlins 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Viera, Fla., A.J. Burnett lasted just 1 2-3 innings, giving
up five runs and four hits. Jose Vidro homered as Montreal took a
5-0 lead.
Rockies (ss) 9, Brewers 8:
</P>
<P>
   At Tucson, Ariz., Jeff Manto hit an RBI single off Joe Crawford
in the 10th. Kevin Barker went 3-for-3 and had five RBIs for the
Brewers, including a grand slam off Manny Aybar in the third.
Padres 6, Athletics 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Peoria, Ariz., San Diego third baseman Phil Nevin sprained
his right ankle when he slipped on wet grass during a rundown play
in the third. He left the game immediately and was taken for
precautionary X-rays, which were negative. His replacement, Ed
Sprague, hit a two-run homer off Omar Olivares in the third.
Giants 3, White Sox (ss) 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Scottsdale, Ariz., Kirk Rueter pitched three hitless innings.
Calvin Murray, a former first-round pick making his bid to win a
job with the Giants as a reserve outfielder, hit a go-ahead,
two-run double off loser Aaron Myette in the sixth.
White Sox (ss) 4, Rockies (ss) 1:
</P>
<P>
   At Tucson, Ariz., James Baldwin pitched three scoreless innings
and Greg Norton drove in two runs with a double, lifting Chicago
past Colorado. Rockies starter Brian Bohanon pitched three
scoreless innings.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 113, Cavaliers 95  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone scored 30 points and John
Stockton tied a season high with 18 assists as the Utah Jazz won
their fifth straight, beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 113-95 on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Malone scored Utah's first six points of the third quarter and
had 10 during the period as the Jazz used a 14-1 run over a span of
3:42 to pull away from a 62-55 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hornacek scored 18, Bryon Russell had 15 points and 10
rebounds and center Olden Polynice added 10 points as Utah won its
fifth straight. Since the All-Star break, the Jazz have won 10 of
12.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, the NBA's career assists leader, was at his best in
outdueling Cleveland rookie Andre Miller. In recent years, the two
faced off in pickup games during Miller's career at the University
of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Miller led the Cavaliers with 15 points and eight assists but
was ineffective in the second half. After he missed a layup late in
the third quarter, the frustration was evident on Miller's face.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Kemp and Andrew Declercq scored 14 points each for
Cleveland, Danny Ferry had 11 and Lamond Murray 10.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland pulled within 66-63 on a jumper by Murray with 8:02
remaining in the third, but Malone scored six points and Stockton
handed out assists on four straight possessions during Utah's
decisive surge.
</P>
<P>
   Miller pulled up for an 8-footer on the left baseline, cutting
the deficit to 80-72 with 1:48 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   But Russell and Stockton scored, and Stockton found Adam Keefe
for a dunk at the third-quarter buzzer for an 86-72 lead. The Utah
bench scored the first 10 points of the fourth quarter to put the
game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Malone has been on a roll lately. He was selected the NBA's
player of the week Monday after averaging 28.8 points, 10.8
rebounds and 5.5 assists as the Jazz won four games last week,
including three on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Cavaliers had won three straight on their four-game
road trip, and fell to 7-24 away from home this season. ...
Stockton had six assists in the first quarter. ... Both teams shot
well in the first half. The Cavaliers hit 58.3 percent (21-of-36)
while Utah made 56.8 percent (25-of-44). ... Donny Marshall, signed
Monday by Cleveland to a 10-day contract, scored two points in
seven minutes. ... Utah's Howard Eisley, who shot 9-of-29 in his
last five games, hit 4-of-6 for eight points.

<HEADLINE> Players, Officials React To McSorley  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   NHL players and officials think Marty McSorley's
suspension for
his stick attack on Donald Brashear was sufficient punishment.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Canadian court ruled otherwise Tuesday, charging the Boston
Bruins defenseman with one count of assault with a weapon for his
two-handed swing to the head of the Vancouver enforcer Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we stated at the time the suspension was imposed, we
believe the league dealt with the matter quickly, decisively and
appropriately -- and did not feel that any further action was either
warranted or necessary,'' said Bill Daly, the NHL's chief legal
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old player was suspended by the NHL for the
remainder of the regular season, which at the time consisted of 23
games. The penalty, the harshest ever for on-ice violence, would
also include the playoffs should the Bruins qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were all hoping it would stay in the hockey environment,''
said defenseman Ray Bourque, McSorley's teammate until being traded
to Colorado on Monday. ''As a player we all hoped that what came
down from the NHL on how they reacted to the incident was going to
be it.''
</P>
<P>
   McSorley, a veteran of 17 seasons, must meet with commissioner
Gary Bettman before he is allowed to return to the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know Marty feels bad about it,'' Bourque said. ''I just hope
it works out for Marty because he really is a great guy and he's a
great competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one condones McSorley's behavior, the belief is that
the NHL can police itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a governing body of the NHL that's in charge of
suspensions and things like that,'' Boston right wing Steve Heinze
said. ''What happened with Marty, I thought that would be the end
of it. But the saga continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles captain Rob Blake, McSorley's former teammate with
the Kings, wants to keep on-ice issues out of the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really agree with that,'' Blake said of the charge.
''I've listened to a lot of people and I kind of feel the same way
most do -- that what happens on the ice should be handled by the
people in the NHL who handle the suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish it would have been left that way, but there's not a lot
we can do about that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago enforcer Bob Probert thought McSorley was already
punished too harshly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ridiculous. The league handled it,'' Probert said. ''I
thought the league handled it right. I actually thought the
suspension was a little stiff, I thought 15 games would have been
more than enough. But to bring the courts into it, that's uncalled
for.''

<HEADLINE> Bourque Leads Avalanche Defense  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, it was Patrick Roy and then Theo Fleury. Add Ray Bourque
to the growing list of marquee players brought to Colorado through
the shrewd maneuvering of Pierre Lacroix.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix, a former agent in his sixth season as Colorado's
general manager, took many by surprise Monday. He completed a trade
that sent Bourque and forward Dave Andreychuk from Boston to Denver
for Brian Rolston, two minor league prospects and a draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   It had seemed Detroit and Philadelphia were the only serious
contenders to acquire Bourque, a 39-year-old defensemen and one of
the best players at his position.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a philosophy that when you do business, it's nobody's
business,'' Lacroix said. ''Why expose whatever you're trying to
accomplish until it's done? It's easy to talk after the fact. Why
spend energy talking about it when you don't even know if you're
going to be able to do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Anonymity is Lacroix's preference, but it is not his only
formula for success.
</P>
<P>
   He was aggressive in pursuing Roy from Montreal after the goalie
demanded that the Canadiens trade him in December 1995. Colorado
was often mentioned as a possible destination for Fleury before
Calgary traded him to the Avalanche last February.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, however, was considered a long shot to land in Denver
because it takes him from his family roots on the East Coast.
Bourque acknowledged Tuesday that Philadelphia was his first
choice. But he is excited about a chance to win his first
championship in 21 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're a very talented team that has struggled
somewhat at times this year because of injuries,'' Bourque said.
''They've got everybody back now, they're healthy. They've got a
world class goalie, world class players, and I think we will be
competing for a Stanley Cup in Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy, Fleury and Bourque spent their entire careers in one city
before moving to Colorado. Fleury later bolted for the New York
Rangers, but Roy remains a key player for the Avalanche as they
pursue a second Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''To bring in a guy like Bourque is pretty amazing, I think it's
a little different than the Theo thing,'' Colorado defenseman Adam
Foote said. ''It's a lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, honored as the NHL's top defenseman five times, will
join Foote in front of Roy and add experience to an already
dangerous power play. He and Andreychuk joined the Avalanche on
Tuesday for their game in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, we can pick our game up and bring Ray what he's
looking for,'' said Colorado forward Dave Reid, who spent 10
seasons in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, wearing his trademark No. 77, picked up his first point
for Colorado midway through the second period Tuesday night,
assisting on Milan Hejduk's goal that gave Colorado a 6-3 lead en
route to an 8-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque left the game early in the third period because of a
slight groin injury. The Avalanche said Bourque is expected to play
Friday night in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   The price for Bourque and Andreychuk was youth.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado sent forward Brian Rolston, 27, and prospects Martin
Grenier, 19, and Samual Pahlsson, 22, to Boston. The Bruins also
will get the Avalanche's first-round draft pick in 2000 or 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you do what we did, you have to admit that you're going
to give something very important away,'' Lacroix said. ''We know
that we gave good future for the Boston Bruins. On the other hand,
we have enough talent in our system to face the future.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bourque's future? Lacroix said he will worry about that
after the season because Bourque has not committed himself to
another year in the NHL. The next four months could play a major
role in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't been satisfied by how I've been playing this year
and I think a challenge like a Stanley Cup run will bring the best
out of me and I sure hope it does,'' Bourque said. ''That will
answer a lot of my questions with regards to whether I'm going to
play next year.''

<HEADLINE> Women's Soccer Coach Disputes Pay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tony DiCicco, who coached the United States to
the 1999 Women's World Cup championship, made $315,686 less that
year than his counterpart with the U.S. men's national team.
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco earned $167,166, while men's coach Bruce Arena made
$482,852, not counting a $133,927 signing bonus he received in late
1998, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported in Wednesday's editions,
citing federal tax records it obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Arena coached the men in 13 games last year, winning seven and
finishing third at the Confederations Cup. DiCicco coached the
women in 29 games, winning 25, including a sweep through the World
Cup that captivated the country.
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco's base salary was about $100,000, with the remainder of
his 1999 pay coming in bonuses, the Union-Tribune reported. Four
administrators with U.S. Soccer, the sport's national governing
body, made more than DiCicco.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not surprised by that,'' said DiCicco, who resigned as
national coach last fall with a 103-8-8 record. ''I think that
reflects society. It's certainly not just happening in soccer. It's
just the reality of where we are right now in society. Those things
need to be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do I think it's too far of a separation? Absolutely. Do I
think it should be exactly equal? Probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   New women's coach April Heinrichs is believed to make an amount
similar to DiCicco's, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women, who boycotted three games earlier this year,
agreed to a deal in February that for the first time gives women on
a national team the same salary as men. The women also would get
part ownership of a league planned to start in April 2001, the
first such arrangement for any major pro sport in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an apples to oranges comparison,'' said Richard Motskin,
Arena's agent. ''A more relevant comparison is what Bruce is making
vis-a-vis other men's national coaches in the top 25 in the world,
and in that regard I believe Bruce is fairly compensated.
</P>
<P>
   ''With regard to Tony's situation, I applaud his accomplishments
and think he did a great job with the women's team. Whether or not
he was fairly compensated is an issue for others, not for me or
Bruce.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson said U.S. Soccer wouldn't comment on individual
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why wouldn't U.S. Soccer hire a $500,000 coach for the
women?'' said Donna Lopiano, executive director of the Women's
Sports Foundation. ''There isn't a marketplace of soccer coaches
who only coach men's soccer. They're soccer coaches, period.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's saying to me that U.S. Soccer isn't going to get as good
a coach for the women as for the men because they don't want to
spend $500,000.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Stopping for Reflection  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John McCain declared he will ''never give up
this mission'' no matter what happens to his campaign, as he took
stock of his rough night against George W. Bush and planned a time
of reflection before deciding whether to keep up his Republican
nomination fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may meet again in primaries a few days from now and we have
both earned a little rest,'' he told supporters Tuesday night,
leaving unsaid that they may not meet again, too.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee pots that had been brought out to keep bleary eyes awake
as the results flowed in were stowed away about a half hour before
the polls closed in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't understand this campaign unless you come to
Sedona,'' said McCain, speaking of his rustic Arizona cabin where
he planned to huddle with aides Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior McCain aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he expects McCain to depart the race Thursday but cautioned no firm
decision had been made.
</P>
<P>
   In front of his supporters, McCain asserted: ''We will never
give up this mission, my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But that mission, as he described it, was not necessarily a
political campaign, but could also be a more general effort to
reform his party and politics.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Republican Party ''needs to recover its purpose to
be as big as the country we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That is the purpose of our campaign and as I said, I have no
intention of ever surrendering it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain suffered more losses than even he had said in advance he
could afford.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the next few days we will take some time to enjoy our
victories and take stock of our losses,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Predators 3, Blackhawks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Sebastien Bordeleau scored a
short-handed goal in the first period as the Nashville Predators
snapped a five-game losing streak with a 3-1 victory over the
Chicago Blackhawks on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dunham made 31 saves for the Predators, who beat Chicago on
Feb. 23 for their last victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks, who started a five-game road trip, had won four
of five -- including victories over top teams Dallas, St. Louis and
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville moved out of last place in the Central Division, one
point ahead the Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeleau's short-handed tally was the only goal of the first
period. He pounced on a loose puck that bounced off Chicago's
Anders Eriksson and skated in alone on goalie Steve Passmore.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeleau deked Passmore to the ice and put in a back-hander.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-man advantage in the second period, Predators
defenseman Drake Berehowsky ripped a slap shot past Passmore's
glove from the top of the left circle. Rookie David Legwand made it
3-0 later in the period on a back-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Atcheynum, formally of the Predators, made it 3-1 at 2:03
of the third with a blast that sailed by Dunham's stick.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago pulled Passmore for a sixth attacker with 1:57 left, and
had a two-man advantage after a late Predators penalty, but
Nashville blocked two point shots.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Sergei Krivokrasov, Nashville's top goal scorer last
season, was a healthy scratch. Chicago's Eric Daze (back) and Doug
Gilmour (ribs) were both sidelined.
