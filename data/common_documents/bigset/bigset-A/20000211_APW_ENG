Chinese Ship Not Seen as a Threat
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China's acquisition of a Russian-built destroyer is not
expected to pose a significant threat to the U.S. military presence in Asia, the
State Department said Thursday. "While clearly improving China's naval
capabilities, it is fair to say the appearance of one additional modern warship
will not fundamentally alter the regional balance of power, spokesman James P.
Rubin said. A Taiwanese defense expert said Wednesday U.S. ships that have
protected Taiwan could be threatened by the delivery of the Sovremenny-class
destroyer.

Court Rules for Software Maker
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A software company that developed a low-priced program
allowing computer users to play Sony video games did not violate Sony's
copyright, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday in a case that divided the
computer industry. Sony Computer Entertainment, whose $129 PlayStation console
displays the same games on television screens, drew legal support from fellow
hardware companies Nintendo, Sega and 3dfx Interactive. Connectix, maker of the
$50 Virtual Game Station, was backed by fellow software makers and trade
associations.

Airlines Ordered To Inspect Planes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The government is requiring airlines to inspect the
tails of MD-80 series jetliners and related planes for damage similar to what
was discovered in the wreckage of Alaska Airlines Flight 261. About 1,100 jets
in the United States -- all MD-80s, MD-90s, DC-9s and Boeing 717s -- will be
covered by an order that was being drafted late Thursday by the Federal Aviation
Administration. The airlines will have two to three days to comply. Passengers
should expect minor delays, the FAA said. "It's far more important that we get
these airplanes inspected," said Tom McSweeny, the FAA's associate administrator
for certification.

Economy Should Continue Expansion
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The current economic expansion, already the longest in
the nation's history, should keep going this year and beyond even though a
recent surge in productivity may not last, the Clinton administration said
Thursday. The administration used this year's 432-page "Economic Report of the
President" to take part of the credit for the good times, with unemployment and
inflation both at 30-year lows and consumer confidence at record highs. While
praising the Federal Reserve for pursuing an astute monetary policy, the
economic report said the administration deserved credit for making the tough
choices to eliminate the soaring government deficits it had inherited.

McCain Mixes Reform, Fund Raising
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- From the campaign trail where he decries the Washington
money chase, Sen. John McCain beamed his image into the ballroom of a capital
hotel where corporate lobbyists helped raise as much as $500,000 for his
presidential bid. They are the same lobbyists who press McCain's Senate Commerce
Committee to act on legislation that affects their corporate clients -- AT&AMP;T,
United Airlines and other giants. McCain, who is running on a pledge to change
the way campaigns are financed, finds himself having to use the system he
criticizes in order to fund his presidential bid. His Washington fund-raiser
today -- where tickets went for $500 and $1,000 -- was the centerpiece of a
one-day series of events expected to bring in as much as $500,000.

Internet Cos. To Strengthen Systems
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Unnerved by a rash of hacker attacks on the world's leading
Web sites, big Internet companies rushed to strengthen their computer systems
Thursday in a high-tech game of cat-and-mouse with the phantom perpetrators.
Taking advantage of an apparent lull in major disruptions, big Web companies and
government agencies stepped up training of technicians in detecting unusual
activity. Others installed advanced software filters to detect and block
delivery of suspicious electronic data.

New Nasdaq High; Dow Ends Off 55.53

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index soared to a new high Thursday
while blue-chip stocks lagged again, pulled down by persistent worries that
their earnings aren't growing fast enough to offset rising interest rates. The
Nasdaq rose 122.39 to 4,485.63, the fourth new closing high in five sessions.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 55.53 to close at 10,643.63. Japan markets

Griffey Goes To Reds
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds acquired Ken Griffey Jr. Thursday,
sending four players to the Seattle Mariners to obtain the center fielder. The
final piece of the deal came when Griffey agreed to a nine-year contract worth
$116.5 million, the richest package in baseball history. The pact covers from
2000-09, and the Reds even have an option for a 10th season. Reds pitcher Brett
Tomko and outfielder Mike Cameron were sent to Seattle along with a pair of
minor leaguers.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Strike Continues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. officials said Thursday they were still assessing
the effects of the strike by its engineering and technical workers, though the
union for the employees say the strike already was having an effect.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the 22,000-strong Society of Professional Engineering Employees
in Aerospace walked off the job Wednesday after contract negotiations with a
federal mediator broke down the night before.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company continues to be obstinate," said SPEEA Executive Director
Charles Bofferding. "Until they come around, we are striking."
</P>
<P>
	   Union officials said the strike was already having an effect, citing the
Federal Aviation Administration's temporary suspension of authority delegated to
Boeing to certify aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe it means there will be no airplanes delivered, no service
bulletins signed off ... without direct FAA involvement," SPEEA President Craig
Buckham said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA and Boeing said production would not be affected by the move,
however.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line is that this temporary suspension should not impact our
ability to continue operations and to deliver aircraft," Boeing spokesman Peter
Conte said.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue was a right delegated by the FAA to three specially designated
Boeing engineers to sign off on aircraft that were deemed ready for delivery,
said Druzie Andersen, an FAA spokeswoman in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now that we are being slightly more careful because of the strike, we have
taken back that authority...," said Druzie Andersen, an FAA spokeswoman in
Washington, D.C., adding FAA officials would now sign off on the aircraft.
"Production will not be affected."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the three specially designated engineers is honoring the strike,
Conte said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bofferding claimed a Qantas jet in Bangkok, being serviced by SPEEA members,
was left unfinished on the tarmac, and that the airline had complained. The
union also claimed that a part fabrication plant near Tacoma ground to a halt
because no SPEEA workers were there.
</P>
<P>
	   Conte could not confirm the union's claims. Boeing is still trying to figure
out how many people walked out on Thursday, he added. The company estimated
about 75 percent, or 17,000, of the SPEEA-covered employees went on strike
Wednesday, while SPEEA claimed 95 percent had walked out.
</P>
<P>
	   Regardless of the number, production of aircraft remains unaffected, Conte
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our contingency plans are in place and they are working."

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
    By VICTOR L. SIMPSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The scenario has been the subject of whispers for
years: An aging pope in failing health and no longer able to continue the highly
public role that has been his hallmark, calls it quits and retires to a
monastery in his native Poland.
</P>
<P>
	   Pure speculation, and not something Vatican officials like to talk bout
openly.
</P>
<P>
	   So when a top German bishop merely suggested recently that Pope John Paul II
could at some time choose such an option, it set off a frenzy in the Italian
press.
</P>
<P>
	   Continued alarms about the 79-year-old pope's health -- that he will lose
his speech and might have to use a wheelchair -- have sent Vatican anger rising.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the pope seems annoyed.
</P>
<P>
	   At a recent audience, when Spanish schoolchildren chanted, "The whole world
loves you," John Paul curtly responded: "Who knows?"
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican has taken to angrily brushing off the alarm, seeing it as a
campaign to undermine the office of the papacy.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Jubilee proceeds at the pope's pace, apparently faltering but
internally vigorous," wrote editor Mario Agnes in the Vatican's daily newspaper
L'Osservatore Romano.
</P>
<P>
	   This, he said, is an "objective reality that seems to annoy a hidden, meager
group that from time to time announces, through some compliant media outlet,
predictions without sense and without foundation."
</P>
<P>
	   Enough talk about resignation, the newspaper demanded in a later commentary.
"Physical weakness does not mean incapacity."
</P>
<P>
	   Those close to the top dismiss out of hand the possibility that the pope,
certainly a traditionalist, has any intention of resigning. He has spoken of his
duty and how he has come to terms with his advancing years.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not out of the realm of possibility, but as for the foreseeable future
I think the answer is no," said George Weigel, author of a recently published
biography of John Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's not the CEO of a corporation but the father of a family. You don't
resign paternity," said Weigel.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the pope's deteriorating health is plain to all.
</P>
<P>
	   His speech is slurred and his hands tremble, both symptoms associated with
Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurological disorder. Since hip surgery
following a fall in his bathroom in 1994, he has had difficulty walking and
climbing stairs.
</P>
<P>
	   In a radio interview in January, Bishop Karl Lehmann, head of the German
bishops conference, said he thought that the pope, "if he were to feel that he
is simply no longer capable enough to lead the church, ... he would have the
strength and courage to say, 'I can no longer fill that which needs to be done.'
"
</P>
<P>
	   Lehmann even mentioned precedent -- Pope Celestine V, who abdicated in 1294,
feeling himself unfit for the post. He spent the last two years of his life in
confinement because his successor feared he could become the rallying point for
a schism.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehmann's remarks have echoed throughout Catholic circles, with some
supporters of the traditionalist pope suspecting an effort to ease him out.
Quoting an article suggesting he could not function if unable to speak, the
National Committee of Catholic Laymen, a conservative U.S. group, said in its
newsletter, "A silent church? A speechless pope? Sounds to us like wishful
thinking on the part of the modernists."
</P>
<P>
	   John Paul turns 80 in May. The health issue will clearly become more
pressing in the months and years ahead. Church law has no procedure to declare
incapacity.
</P>
<P>
	   It does provide for resignation, requiring only that this is done "freely
and that it be duly manifested, but not that it be accepted by anyone."
</P>
<P>
	   As for the foreseeable future, John Paul is only barely paring back his
schedule, although his doctors have pressed him to reduce it even further.
</P>
<P>
	   In February and March alone, he has trips planned to the foot of Mount Sinai
in Egypt and the Holy Land, and he has an event-filled schedule for the entire
2000 church Holy Year.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Vatican and elsewhere, there are many who believe that the sight of a
pope battling his physical ailments sends out a positive signal in a world, as
Weigel put it, used to "disposable humans."
</P>
<P>
	   "What's wrong with a pope in a wheelchair?" Weigel asked.

<HEADLINE> Murder Charges Withdrawn in Chicago  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- All of a condemned serial killer's murder convictions are
getting thrown out after another suspected serial killer confessed to one of the
slayings.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the murder charges for which Hubert Geralds Jr. was convicted will
now be pinned on Andre Crawford, who admitted in a videotaped confession that he
killed the victim, 24-year-old Rhonda King, said Bob Benjamin, a spokesman for
the Cook County prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the case against him was consolidated and tried before one jury,
Geralds, 35, will have to be retried in the killings of five other women and the
attempted killing of a sixth in the city's Englewood neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Geralds was convicted in November 1997 of killing six women and attempting
to kill a seventh in 1994 and 1995. He was then sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford, 37, was charged less than two weeks ago with killing 10 women in
the same impoverished, crime-infested South Side neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   A third man, Gregory Clepper, has been charged in the deaths of 14 women
from 1991 to 1996 in that same area and is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Ryan recently took the unprecedented step of putting all
executions on hold in Illinois, which over the past two decades has freed more
inmates from death row -- 13 -- than it has put to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Illinois becomes the first of the 38 states with the death penalty to issue
a moratorium on executions while the system is examined.

<HEADLINE> Four Track Athletes Killed in Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KARNACK, Texas (AP) -- Four Prairie View A&AMP;M track athletes were killed
Thursday night when their van rolled over on Texas Highway 43 near the
Texas-Louisiana border, the Texas Department of Public Safety said.
</P>
<P>
	Three students were dead at the scene of the accident and another died while
being transported to Louisiana State University Hospital at Shreveport, La. Six
people were injured.
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle was en route to Pine Bluff, Ark., when the wreck occurred.
</P>
<P>
	The names of the dead were being withheld pending notification of next of kin.
</P>
<P>
	Four survivors were rushed to Marshall Regional Hospital, hospital spokeswoman
Paula Jaco said. Lamar Adams and David Attebery were listed in stable condition
and were being monitored in the intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
	Hoover Wright was in serious condition in the ICU and Trenton Harris was in

<HEADLINE> Model Boat Maker Loves His Job  </HEADLINE>
   By SHANA McNALLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- For Will Lesh it has always been about sailing.
</P>
<P>
	   He claims to remember his first sailing trip with his father at 6 months
old, and he still has his first wooden sailboat.
</P>
<P>
	   He's captained a sailing team, taught sailing and sailed in the Bahamas, the
Caribbean and across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
	   While he also dabbled as an English teacher and law school student, when it
came time to really settle down, Lesh returned to his hobby. Lesh formed
Tippecanoe Boats, a model sailboat company, where he makes his living and does
his part to get future generations hooked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sailing was the best experience of my childhood so I remember and I know
what the experience can mean to a child and an adult,'' said Lesh, 48.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1986, Lesh has sold 45,000 12- to 32-inch toy sailboats made out of
Western red cedar, starting in museum, marine and toy stores, and now also on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices range from $32 to $1,000. His most popular model, the 18-inch T Class
Racing Sloop sells for $56 as a kit, $96 if finished. More expensive models have
been commissioned by Eddie Bauer, FAO Schwartz and Columbia Records even ordered
a customized model for country singer Shania Twain in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Lesh's T15 Racing Sloop won the Parents' Choice Gold Medal for Excellence in
Toys in 1998 and is capable of sailing  1/8 mile in 5 minutes, or 142 feet per
minute.
</P>
<P>
	   The secret to his success, Lesh believes, is that he puts his diverse
background and sailing experiences into his model sailboat designs.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Washington, D.C., Lesh grew up sailing with his father in Maryland.
He graduated from Princeton with an English degree, taught English in Vermont,
taught sailing at an Outward Bound School in Maine and even attended law school
for a year at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
	   But in between, the sailing bug bit hard and often.
</P>
<P>
	   He took time off to sail in the Bahamas, followed up on a vow he made to
himself at age 13 to sail across the Atlantic and once spent $800 building a
boat out of chicken wire and cement that he sailed for 3,000 miles before ending
up shipwrecked on a desert island in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
	   So, when his wife Cynthia decided to attend graduate school in 1983 at the
University of Washington to pursue degrees in Chinese language and music, Lesh
was ready to settle down.
</P>
<P>
	   He started building model sailboats with cedar hulls, brass fittings and
cloth spinnaker sails in the garage of their rented home.
</P>
<P>
	   He almost quit several times -- too little space, too few materials, too
labor intensive -- but he persevered and a 1986 move to Everson -- a small town
with open space and proximity to the mountains and the water -- helped.
</P>
<P>
	   So did computers.
</P>
<P>
	   With computers, Lesh was able to create the graphics he needed and attract
customers through the Internet. Now 50 percent of his revenue and 30 percent of
his profit comes from Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Internet works especially well for a company of our size,'' he said.
``We can make our site very personalized with a lot of interesting information
about our family, our business and our product.''
</P>
<P>
	   With orders pouring in from across the United States, Lesh has between five
and 20 employees, depending on the season, producing 10 different types of boats
at a rate of 15,000 models a year.
</P>
<P>
	   His boats are made to sail in winds as strong as 25 miles per hour and half
the weight is in the keel so the boat won't tip over.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Rice, 44, of Seattle, is a devoted customer. He has made an annual
practice of taking his summer YMCA group of fourth through sixth graders to the
beach for an annual boat race.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sailing model boats is a great equalizer because, unlike other sports, you
never know what the outcome is going to be. Plus, you can continue to use the
boat afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lesh's next project is a less expensive version of his popular 18-inch
wooden sailing boat with a plastic hull to sell for less than $20. He also would
like to use the boats as a way to introduce more people to the sport of sailing
and encourages use of his model boats by sailing instructors.
</P>
<P>
	   Ken Ong, 49, a New York City sailing buff, agreed the two endeavors require
similar skills.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sailing a model sailboat has all the nuance and suggestion of what it's
really like to go sailing itself,'' Ong said. ``It has all the positives -- like
how the boat interacts with the wind and how it glides through the water -- and
none of the negatives, like boat maintenance and paying for the boat.''

<HEADLINE> Dell Earnings Rise Slightly  </HEADLINE>
    By CONNIE MABIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. reported profits that met analysts
reduced expectations. Revenue increased 31 percent, which represented a slowdown
for Dell, largely because of chip supply problem and a post-Y2K sales slowdown.
</P>
<P>
	   To deliver robust growth in the future, Dell -- known for pioneering direct
sales of personal computers -- will give new attention to providing
Internet-related customer services and products, said Dell vice chairman Kevin
Rollins. He pointed to an announcement earlier this week that the company was
forming a sales division dedicated to the needs of large dot-com companies and
other high-tech firms as evidence of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman and CEO Michael Dell said selling online is only part of the
company's plans to utilize the Internet in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "Customers are increasingly demanding the type of direct relationship we
pioneered in this industry, and the Internet is enhancing that preference," he
said. "Analysts estimate that U.S. companies alone will spend $200 billion
annually on their Internet infrastructures by 2003, a sizeable portion of which
will be for server and storage hardware. That trend plays directly to our
strength as the No. 2 and fastest-growing major provider of servers in the
United States and the world."
</P>
<P>
	   Dell's net income for the three months ended Jan. 28 was $436 million, or 16
cents a share, compared to $425 million, or 15 cents per share, a year ago, the
company reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The results include an investment gain equal to 1 cent per share, the
company said. Excluding that gain, Dell matched the revised analyst estimate of
15 cents per share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Round Rock, Texas-based Dell announced two weeks ago that earnings would not
meet expectations, because of problems getting computer chips and
slower-than-expected post Y2K sales. Analysts had been expecting earnings for
the quarter would be 21 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported revenue of about $6.8 billion for the fourth quarter,
up from $5.17 billion in prior-year period.
</P>
<P>
	   Online sales accounted for nearly 50 percent of revenue and averaged $40
million per day, up from $14 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Although revenue grew 38 percent in fiscal 1999 to $25.2 billion compared
the prior year, Dell shares have fallen about 30 percent from its 52-week high
of $54.31 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Barry Jaruzelski, an analyst with Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton in New York, said
Thursday he expects revenue growth at Dell will slow from its previous torrid
pace, but that doesn't mean stockholders should go rushing to unload their
shares.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody goes through some level of maturation," Jaruzelski said. "It was
not possible to keep up with that level of staggering growth, but it's still
staggering."
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that the one thing we can agree with is that it's probably not
logical for a company of our size to continue growing at 50 percent a year,"
Rollins said.

<HEADLINE> Experiment May Have Exposed to AIDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A gene therapy experiment may have inadvertently exposed
more than two dozen young cancer patients to the virus that causes AIDS, The
Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston discovered the accidental exposure in December,
but did not inform federal regulators until last week, the Post said Friday. The
researchers began contacting patients and their parents about the possible
infections Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper reported that researchers and federal officials said early
testing of the gene-based medicine may have been contaminated with HIV-1, the
virus that causes AIDS, and HCV, which causes hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
	   Two subsequent tests found no contamination, indicating that the first
results might have been false. The Food and Drug Administration is now
conducting more reliable tests and is looking into possible laboratory problems
and the timing of the reporting, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
	   While testing continues, researchers have ended the study.
</P>
<P>
	   Deidre Malone, St. Jude's public relations director, would not comment on
the Post report other than to say the hospital would have a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Laura Bowman, the study's principal investigator at St. Jude, was quoted by
the Post as saying that all of the volunteer cancer patients were near death and
only a handful of the 20 patients she treated are alive today, the rest having
died from their cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Institutes of Health was already investigating St. Jude for its
handling of patient deaths in a different study, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cancer patients suffered from neuroblastoma, a brain cancer that is the
second most common childhood malignancy. The experimental therapy involved
removing a patient's own tumor cells and inserting an immune system gene with a
gene-altered virus. The modified cells were put back in the patient to galvanize
the immune system to fight the cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowman said she discovered last fall that the two most recent volunteers a
child and a teen-ager treated a year ago received viruses that had been
processed incorrectly and could have been contaminated.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she could find no evidence that the original batch of cells from
1995 used to grow the viruses had been properly screened for contamination. In
November, she sent cells from the original batch for testing at an outside lab,
which sent back results that twice showed the presence of DNA from HIV and HCV.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she decided to contact the FDA last week when further test results
were slow to arrive.
</P>
<P>
	   Malcolm Brenner, who initiated the study while at St. Jude and continued the
work at Baylor, told the Post he doubted the initial test results, but if the
contamination was real it could have been caused by HIV-infected blood in the
laboratory being accidentally splashed on the viruses.
</P>
<P>
	   The surviving volunteers would probably only need AIDS testing if further
tests confirm the contamination, Bowman said.

<HEADLINE> Critically injured police officer emerges from a coma  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A police officer who landed on his head after
being struck by an out-of-control car has emerged from a coma nearly a month
later.
<P>
	   Scott McLaughlin, 36, was interviewing a possible robbery suspect Jan. 18 at
a busy intersection when the car climbed a curb and slammed into him. He was
thrown in the air, dropped on a concrete structure and sustained critical brain
injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The driver, Edward Jones, 41, apparently had suffered an epileptic seizure.
He was charged with first-degree assault, which carries a maximum sentence of
five to 25 years in prison. Authorities say a doctor warned him three days
before the crash that he shouldn't drive because he wasn't taking medication to
control his seizures.
</P>
<P>
	   McLaughlin, a 14-year police veteran, underwent emergency brain injury but
his prognosis was grim. In the past week, doctors began to detect signs that he
might be pulling out of his coma.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over the past couple of days ... I felt enough confidence to judge it
likely that he's awake and responsive," Dr. Robert J. Maciunas, a neurosurgeon
at Strong Memorial Hospital, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're delighted we could cheat death in this case," Maciunas said. "What
remains to be seen is how much capacity he has for recovering neurological
function."
</P>
<P>
	   McLaughlin began breathing without the aid of a ventilator this week and was
moved from a trauma unit to a neurological-care unit. He was transferred
Thursday to a regular ward.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he shows signs of possible paralysis to his right side, McLaughlin
has been sitting up in a chair in recent days. He is focusing his eyes on people
close to him - his parents and fellow officers - but "his injuries have left him
with a number of neurological impairments which may or may not be permanent,"
Maciunas said.
</P>
<P>
	   McLaughlin also seems to have difficulty understanding spoken language and
has not yet uttered a word.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given his age and the possibilities of intensive rehabilitative therapy,
there is the possibility that he might recover significantly from where he is
now," Maciunas said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's still an open question how things will turn out, but where there's
life, there's hope."

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore now has double-digit lead on Bradley in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - GOP Sen. John McCain is deadlocked with Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley in possible November presidential
matchups in New York, a new poll says.
<P>
	   McCain, riding high after his defeat of Texas Gov. George Bush in New
Hampshire's presidential primary, pulled 42 percent to Gore's 46 percent in one
possible matchup. He did even better against Bradley, getting 40 percent to
Bradley's 43 percent, according to a Quinnipiac College Polling Institute survey
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrat would win in New York in either matchup against Bush, the poll
indicated. Gore was preferred by 53 percent of those questioned while Bush got
37 percent. Bradley would get 53 percent vs. 34 percent for Bush in that
possible matchup.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain still trails Bush in New York 44 percent to 37 percent, according to
the new poll.
</P>
<P>
	   However, before his strong win in New Hampshire, McCain was down almost 20
percentage points to Bush, who has been getting support from the New York
Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore leads Bradley 56 percent to 32 percent among Democrats. This comes less
than a month after a similar poll showed the two men were in a statistical dead
heat.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bradley's hopes in New York were pinned on a stronger showing in New
Hampshire and a surge of media interest focusing on his glory days with the
Knicks," said Scott McLean, a Quinnipiac political science professor. "Instead,
McCain has stolen the ball from Bradley, grabbed all the headlines and is
threatening to slam dunk Bush."
</P>
<P>
	   The poll released Thursday has a margin of error of 3 percentage points when
both Republicans and Democrats were questioned. The margin of error increased to
4.5 percentage points for the answers from the 481 Democrats questioned, and to
5.2 percent for the responses of the 357 Republicans questioned.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's presidential primary is on March 7.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Mayor is conducting campaign of insults  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LITTLE FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton and the head of New
York's Conservative Party have something in common - they are both pummeling her
senate race rival, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
<P>
	   On Thursday, Clinton accused Giuliani of running a campaign based on insults
and demanded he make public the fund-raising letters he has sent out for the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Conservative Party boss Michael Long called on Richard Viguerie,
the guru of conservative direct-mail fund raising, to drop Giuliani as a client.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's not a conservative," Michael Long wrote Viguerie.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter from Long was the latest sign that the small, but politically
important party would shun Giuliani. Since 1974, no New York Republican has won
a statewide race without also having Conservative Party backing.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hate to admit that I agree with Hillary Clinton, but I too was 'appalled"
by your recent letter" sent out to raise funds for Giuliani, Long wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   For a second straight day, the first lady criticized the New York City mayor
for sending out a fund-raising letter to conservatives that accused her of
harboring "hostility toward America's religious traditions."
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it is wrong to use religion as a political weapon and he should
know that," Clinton said outside the Ann Street Restaurant &AMP; Deli in Little
Falls about 60 miles west of Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said she wanted the mayor to release all his fund-raising letters
because, "I would like the people of New York to know there's a big difference
between the kind of campaigns we're running. I intend to run a campaign based on
issues and ideas, not on insults."
</P>
<P>
	   As he had on Wednesday, Giuliani continued to laugh off the Clinton attack.
The mayor said Thursday he would make public his fund-raising letters only if
Clinton reimbursed the federal government for the full cost of her travel on
government airplanes during her campaign trips.
</P>
<P>
	   "When they make out the check, we'll make the letters available," the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton camp has said it has reimbursed the government what it is
required to.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, the head of the Washington, D.C.-based Interfaith Alliance
took Giuliani to task for sending out his fund-raising letter.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am frightened by the specter of a New York senatorial campaign that turns
religion into a political football," the Rev. C. Welton Gaddy, executive
director of the 100,000-member, clergy-led organization, wrote in a letter to
both candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   While Clinton obviously intended to stay on the attack, she did end up
giving the mayor faint praise when a reporter asked whether he might be taking
too much credit for the crime rate reduction in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's been a good partnership and a good team and I give full credit
to the mayors of all the cities, including New York, who have used the tools at
our disposal, who have worked with the federal government and particularly with
the president," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton said the improving economy, her husband the president and the
Congress - and Giuliani's first police commissioner, William Bratton, whom the
mayor fired - should also share in the credit.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Clinton said she was "very grateful" that Giuliani helped lobby
for President Clinton's Omnibus Crime Bill in 1994 aimed at putting an extra
100,000 police officers on the streets. The mayor's support for the president
had been criticized at the time by some Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to give credit where credit is due," she said.

<HEADLINE> UPI Is in Talks on a Possible Sale  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- As part of an effort to focus its business on the Internet,
United Press International is in talks that could lead to another sale of the
news service.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks are proceeding with one potential partner and an announcement
could come as soon as the end of the month, UPI president Arnaud de Borchgrave
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   De Borchgrave declined to name the other party, but acknowledged that a sale
to an Internet company was a possibility. "We're all thinking of clicks rather
than bricks," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   De Borchgrave, a Newsweek veteran who took over the struggling news provider
just over a year ago, would not comment on the potential value of the deal,
which would be the latest shakeup for UPI.
</P>
<P>
	   UPI, once a major news service, has gone through two bankruptcy
reorganizations and four owners since being sold by the Scripps family in 1982.
It was bought in 1992 by Middle East Broadcasting Centre, a Saudi corporation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The present owners have authorized me to negotiate a different future for
UPI in which they would no longer be directly involved," de Borchgrave said. "My
job is to save UPI, and I'm doing it."
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after taking over as head of UPI in late 1998, de Borchgrave said he
would lead an effort to bring more of the nearly 100-year-old company's business
onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   UPI got out of the broadcast news business last August, selling contracts to
provide news to more than 400 radio and television stations to The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
	   At that time, de Borchgrave said UPI would shed 47 radio news jobs but add
26 positions for coverage of specialized fields such as Internet newsletters and
more in-depth stories.
</P>
<P>
	   UPI, which declined to disclose its revenue, said it has 110 full-time
employees and 725 stringers around the world. Its reports are disseminated
through contracts with about 150 "redistributors" throughout the world, such as
the Kyodo News agency of Japan.

<HEADLINE> Trimming the cost of shuffling off to Buffalo - or elsewhere in New  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Located in the middle of New York, the Tompkins
County business community jokes that it's "centrally isolated" - with prices on
flights from the Ithaca airport often through the roof and the nearest large
airport an hour's drive away.
<P>
	   So when Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno outlined a $650 million plan to
subsidize in-state flights and improve highways around airports, runways and
terminals Thursday, business leaders' spirits soared.
</P>
<P>
	   Upstate New York has been plagued with air fares that rank among the highest
in the nation. Critics say the rates have crippled the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno's office released a list of round-trip airfares advertised Tuesday to
prove the point. A flight from Ithaca to Buffalo - a distance of only 124 miles
- was listed as $1,168, while a flight from Ithaca to Paris was $348.
</P>
<P>
	   "Where would YOU go?" asked Jean McPheeters, president of the Tompkins
County Chamber of Commerce. "That can be very typical."
</P>
<P>
	   A flight from Islip on Long Island to Binghamton, Bruno's office also
pointed out, was listed at $650 while one from Islip to Los Angeles was $283.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know that by improving airport facilities we can increase traffic and
stimulate competition among air carriers, ultimately lowering costs to business
and leisure travelers," Bruno, a Republican, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno dubbed his initiative the Statewide Opportunities for Airport
Revitalization program - or "NY SOARS." He said the state would provide $200
million over five years for terminals, runways and airport access highways. The
amount includes the $73 million Gov. George Pataki has already proposed spending
in a five-year plan for airport improvements. Airports would have to apply for
the funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno proposed spending another $20 million in state funds on a three-year
pilot program to subsidize air fares between upstate airports.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno's plan also banks on bringing in an additional $430 million from the
federal government and municipalities around the airports.
</P>
<P>
	   Taxes, energy costs and airfares are the three biggest complaints about
doing business in New York, said Kevin O'Connor, of the Center for Economic
Growth in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Albany recently expanded its airport and in the spring, Southwest Airlines
is expected to bring lower-cost flights - and a 20 percent increase in
customers. That means the airport will need help paying for improved roadways
and additional parking, said spokesman Doug Myers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno's proposal resulted from a task force on upstate airports Bruno
appointed in 1997. The Assembly's Democratic leadership had no immediate
response to the plan. The governor's budget office said it will take a look at
it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been waiting a long time for something like this," said Charles
Everett, Syracuse Hancock International Airport's commissioner of aviation.

<HEADLINE> And now, live on the Internet: Funerals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - So far, Fred Fergerson hasn't had any takers for
his new service. But just wait.
<P>
	   Fergerson is a second-generation funeral director here, and he's offering to
broadcast funerals on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   If that sounds like something out of the "Twilight Zone," it really isn't.
Fergerson said Thursday that he decided to do it out of compassion - for loved
ones and friends who cannot attend funeral services in person. That way they
won't feel left out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there's going to be a big demand for it," said Fergerson, who
is providing the service for free. "But we've got it if anybody wants it."
</P>
<P>
	   And he thinks he may be the only one.
</P>
<P>
	   "I went all over the Internet on search engines," said the 52-year-old
Fergerson, whose father started the business here in 1948. "Nobody's doing it.
To my knowledge, we're the only ones."
</P>
<P>
	   Probably not for long. Fergerson said a New York City parlor is set to go on
line, and industry experts feel that others will follow.
</P>
<P>
	   "What you are dealing with here is the front end of a trend. Death is
different now than it was 50 years ago because family, friends and relatives are
more scattered," said Kelly Smith of the Wisconsin-based National Funeral
Directors Association. "The need for this kind of service is greater. If we
reach the point where the computer is the tie that binds the family, more
directors will use the Internet."
</P>
<P>
	   Just how quickly the trend will develop is unknown. It all depends on
mortality and how quickly those in the funeral business get on line.
</P>
<P>
	   "The funeral service profession is somewhat behind the curve when compared
with other businesses in providing consumers with e-commerce services," Smith
said. "A large majority of funeral service consumers are not yet asking for it
because most of them are of a generation different from the computer generation,
mostly the World War II generation and mid- to late baby boomers."
</P>
<P>
	   Visitors to the new video page on Fergerson's website
(www.FergersonFuneralHome.com) can click on Gallery and see the front entrance
to the funeral home and traffic passing by in the distance.
</P>
<P>
	   Fergerson said he tested the system last week, broadcasting a hearse
procession as it left the funeral home. He uses a fixed camera installed at the
entrance to the funeral home and says he also can broadcast from inside or take
the camera to a cemetery for a graveside service if a grieving family so wishes.
He's also working on adding audio.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea came out of the blue - after the death of an old high school
friend's father about two weeks ago. His friend, who lives on the West Coast,
returned to Syracuse to make funeral arrangements but couldn't come back when
his dad died.
</P>
<P>
	   "I started thinking about it," said Fergerson, a computer whiz in college.
"If we could get this camera working, we could do it worldwide. I didn't have it
working at that point. It took three days of configuring to get it the way I
wanted it."
</P>
<P>
	   During the testing and setup period, Fergerson said he inadvertently left
the camera on during a funeral. That's when he found out the system was ready.
</P>
<P>
	   "My brother in Maine saw it," Fergerson said. "I gave him the link for it."
</P>
<P>
	   Fergerson said he has three laptops he can give to those who are unable to
attend a funeral for whatever reason. He said he has good control over the setup
and can limit who sees it.
</P>
<P>
	   But just the thought of it all had Nicholas P. Bush furrowing his brow.
</P>
<P>
	   "It gets very impersonal at some point, and I still think tradition holds
the best process of grieving," said Bush, also a second-generation funeral
director in nearby Rome, N.Y. "And that means being present for viewing and
ceremony. I don't see it at this point, but if it was something where the public
was interested on a regular basis, then I guess I would."

<HEADLINE> No. 21 Utah 83, San Diego St. 65  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Nate Althoff scored a career-high 22 points, filling
the void left by injured Hanno Mottola, and No. 21 Utah cruised past San Diego
State 83-65 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite playing without Mottola, out indefinitely with sprains to his left
elbow and right thumb, the Utes easily extended the nation's longest home
winning streak to 49.
</P>
<P>
	   Mottola, who missed Utah's first nine games with a knee injury, could be
back if he receives clearance from team trainer Trevor Jameson. The Utes'
leading scorer is undergoing extensive tests to determine whether he will
require surgery for either injury.
</P>
<P>
	   At halftime, the school retired Andre Miller's No. 24 jersey. Miller, the
Cleveland Cavaliers' top draft pick in 1999, stopped in Utah on his way to the
Rookie Challenge at the NBA All-Star game in Oakland on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah jumped out to a 19-5 lead and remained unbeaten at the Huntsman Center
since a 70-59 setback to Wake Forest on Dec. 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Althoff topped his previous career-best of 20, which he posted in Utah's
70-55 win at San Diego State on Jan. 10. The 6-foot-11 junior center dominated
the paint, shooting 6-of-8 from the field and making 10-of-11 foul shots.
</P>
<P>
	   The Utes (18-4, 7-1 Mountain West) bounced back from their first conference
loss, 72-66 at UNLV on Saturday, and beat San Diego State for the 10th straight
time.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Harvey made all five of his shots from the field and all three free
throws in scoring 14 for the Utes. Jeff Johnsen and Phil Cullen each added 11 as
Utah shot 54 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
	   The Aztecs (5-16, 0-8) did not get their first basket until David Abramowitz
made a 3-pointer more than five minutes into the game. Utah's pressure defense
had already forced five turnovers by that point.
</P>
<P>
	   Abramowitz made 7-of-9 3-pointers for 21 points while Marcelo Correa had 12.
</P>
<P>
	   A dunk by Cullen followed by two free throws from Althoff gave Utah a 19-5
lead with 9:14 left in the first half. The Utes pushed their lead to 27-9 when
Mike Puzey added a pair of foul shots.

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief Endorses Sydney Effort  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN PYE-
Associated Press Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Disregarding a barrage of criticism against
organizers of the Sydney 2000 Olympics, International Olympic Committee
Coordination Committee chairman Jacques Rogge has given SOCOG a glowing
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a press conference Friday in the buildup to the 10th Coordination
Commission meeting this weekend, Rogge said SOCOG was well on course to deliver
the best Olympics ever.
</P>
<P>
	He said SOCOG's $123 million budget blowout and ticketing problems were small
scale compared with problems leading into Olympic Games in Montreal (1976),
Moscow (1980), Los Angeles (1984) and Seoul (1988).
</P>
<P>
	Rogge described SOCOG's initial profit and revenue estimates as ambitious, but
said the IOC was aware of that at the time and was confident there was ample
contingency in the budget to make the Games a success.
</P>
<P>
	He said there was a tendency for organizers to overestimate but the IOC had to
trust SOCOG's confidence.
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be ambitious when you are involved in the Olympic Games,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said he supported Olympic Minister and SOCOG president Michael Knight's
decision to shift key operational responsibilities from SOCOG to the
jurisdiction of the government-run Olympic Coordination Authority.
</P>
<P>
	``SOCOG could deliver some responsibility to OCA and concentrate on the
management of sport and not the backup of the venues and logistics. We think
that makes sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	The changes sparked speculation of a major rift between Knight and high-ranking
SOCOG staff and a lack of confidence by the New South Wales Government, which is
underwriting the Games, in the organizing board.
</P>
<P>
	Rogge rejected reports of division, saying ``There's a very good chemistry
between the main actors of both organizations. There's always been good
integration, so we're confident that this is the best solution.''
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, the Australian Olympic Committee and the NSW Government agreed last
week to forgo their respective shares of budget surplus to deliver a rescue
package to SOCOG but the tradeoff for SOCOG was losing responsibility for venues
and transport issues.
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said he had a different perspective on Olympic-related problems than most
critics of SOCOG because of his experience as an athlete and administrator
dealing with infrastructure problems in Montreal, boycotts in Moscow and Los
Angeles and riots in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
	``We don't see any major problems here,'' he said. ``I'm now an old-timer, I
have 14 Olympics under my belt as an athlete, or as a team leader or an NOC
delegate or an IOC member.''
</P>
<P>
	Sydney organizers have made errors but, ``SOCOG has noticed these errors,
they've corrected them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamentals are very good. You have excellent venues, you have very
skillful people running them, the test events were a great success -- the
international federations were very happy -- and the budget is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
	``Is this is a recipe for the best-ever games? I think Sydney is in a good
shape and it is very promising. We in the IOC are happy with what they are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
	The coordination commission had a checklist of more than 40 items it will
investigate during the Sydney meetings.
</P>
<P>
	``We will be reviewing the revised SOCOG budget and assessing where minimum
cuts can be achieved without affecting the quality of games. We'll continue to
monitor ticket sales and delivery, also focus on transport,'' said Rogge, adding
that the emphasis of preparation will shift from operation and strategic
planning to delivery of the Games.
</P>
<P>
	``SOCOG is switching to a very important mode and that's the delivery mode.''
</P>
<P>
	The commission meetings will be followed by IOC executive board meetings in
Sydney next week.

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Stanford 76, No. 24 Oregon 61  </HEADLINE>
    By ROB GLOSTER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Stanford, with the nation's stingiest defense,
turned yet another high-powered offense into a mess of missed shots and lost
chances.
</P>
<P>
	   Casey Jacobsen and Mark Madsen each had 19 points and Ryan Mendez added 14
as the No. 2 Cardinal, who hold opponents to the lowest shooting percentage in
the nation, never trailed in a 76-61 win over No. 24 Oregon on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon (16-5, 7-3 Pac-10) entered the game shooting 49 percent, the
11th-best mark in the nation. But the Ducks were held to 36 percent from the
field by Stanford, including just 33 percent in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford (20-1, 9-1), which has won eight straight against Oregon, also had
eight blocked shots -- including four by Jason Collins -- despite the absence of
its top shot blocker.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cardinal were missing reserve center Curtis Borchardt, who needs one
block to tie the Stanford freshman record of 43 set by Tim Young in 1994-95.
Borchardt is out indefinitely with a stress reaction in his right foot, a
problem he aggravated last weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Alex Scales had 14 points and eight rebounds to lead Oregon. But A.D. Smith,
the Ducks' leading scorer with 15.7 points per game, was held to two points in
the second half and 11 overall.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cardinal, who have won 20 games for a school-record sixth straight
season, led by 11 points at halftime and took a 45-33 lead on David Moseley's
3-pointer with 3:05 gone in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon scored six straight points to pull within 45-39, but the Cardinal
responded with a 19-6 run that began with a 3-pointer by Mendez and was capped
by another Mendez 3-pointer to make it 64-45 with 8 1/2 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory was the first by Stanford against a ranked team since the
Cardinal's 67-58 win over No. 2 Auburn in late November. Stanford had played
only one other ranked school since then, a 68-65 home loss to No. 5 Arizona in
early January.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford led throughout the first half, with Tony Giovacchini's 3-pointer at
the buzzer giving the Cardinal a 40-29 halftime lead. Jacobsen had 12 points in
the first half to lead the Cardinal, while Smith had nine for Oregon.

<HEADLINE> Former Chinese Official Dies at 91  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Ji Pengfei, a former Chinese deputy premier and
foreign minister and a veteran of the 1949 revolution, has died at 91, state
media said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ji died Thursday in Beijing, said obituaries on the front page of the
Communist Party newspaper People's Daily and in other newspapers. The reports
gave no cause of death, but mentioned old age and unspecified illness.
</P>
<P>
	   In a political career that spanned six decades, Ji also was
secretary-general of China's Cabinet, ambassador to East Germany and a member of
the national legislature. In 1972, he headed China's delegation to the Vietnam
Conference in Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   Born into a peasant family in 1909, Ji graduated from a military medical
college and enlisted in the Nationalist Forces led by Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a revolt by his unit, he switched sides to the communists in 1931.
</P>
<P>
	   Ji joined Mao Tse-tung's legendary 1934-35 Long March into northwestern
China to escape the Nationalists. He later became director of the medical
department of the Communist Party's military committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Ji began a new career as a diplomat after the 1949 communist victory. He
traveled extensively in Africa and led delegations to Britain, France, Iran and
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   As deputy foreign minister in the late 1960s, Ji weathered attacks by the
Red Guards, ultraradical forces incited by Mao that terrorized China during the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   He became foreign minister in 1972, and later held a series of senior party
and government posts. He was appointed deputy premier in 1979 and cabinet
secretary-general in 1980, his last known official appointment.
</P>
<P>
	   State media did not give any information on survivors or funeral
arrangements.

<HEADLINE> No. 7 Arizona 65, Washington 56  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM COUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Loren Woods had a career-high 29 points, 13 rebounds and six
blocked shots as No. 7 Arizona withstood Washington's second-half comeback in a
65-56 victory on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats (9-1, 20-4) led by 20 points in the first half when the Huskies
(3-7, 8-14) missed their first 10 shots and had nine turnovers in the first nine
minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona led 16-1 before David Dixon's dunk gave Washington its first basket
with 9:15 left in the first half. The Wildcats were on top 30-10 and 32-12 late
in the first half before Washington came back and cut the score to 34-17 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Johnson's 12-footer from the key for the Huskies cut the Wildcats'
lead to 56-51 with 4:50 to play before Woods, a 7-foot-1 junior center who
transferred to Arizona from Wake Forest, went to work.
</P>
<P>
	   He sank an 18-footer with 4 1/2 minutes to play and then sank two free
throws with 3:54 to go after being fouled by Marlon Shelton, son of former NBA
player Lonnie Shelton, to put Arizona ahead 60-51.
</P>
<P>
	   Down the stretch, Michael Wright had two free throws and Woods added a
three-point play on a five-foot jump hook and a foul shot for the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods, who tied an NCAA record with 14 blocked shots against Oregon last
week in Tucson, dazzled the Huskies with 12-of-20 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilbert Arenas had 14 points and Wright 12 for Arizona, which beat
Washington for the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Deon Luton led the Huskies with 19 points.

<P>
    EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Lindsey Dion scored 16 points, and Angelina Wolvert hit
the go-ahead basket with 13 seconds remaining as Oregon defeated No. 24 Stanford
61-57 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ducks (16-7, 7-3 Pac-10) moved into a tie for third place in the
conference with Stanford (14-6, 7-3). Arizona leads the league at 8-2, and UCLA
is 7-2.
</P>
<P>
	   After Wolvert's layup, Stanford point guard Milena Flores threw the ball out
of bounds. Wolvert took the inbounds pass and was fouled, but missed the first
free throw with just under five seconds to go. Thinking it was a two-shot foul,
no one went for the rebound, and finally a Stanford player heaved the ball
toward the basket, but it was far short.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon's Shaquala Williams made two free throws with eight-tenths of a
second left.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolvert had 12 points and Jenny Mowe had 11 for the Ducks. Dion was making
her first start since a concussion against Cal on Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Lauren St. Clair and Carolyn Moos each scored 12 points for the Cardinal.
Flores had eight assists but committed seven turnovers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Strike Looms at Midwest Express Air  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Midwest Express Airlines canceled more than a dozen
flights in anticipation of a possible pilot strike this weekend, The Milwaukee
Journal Sentinel reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations between the airlines and a pilots union resumed Thursday, a day
before a deadline that would allow the airline's 320 pilots to go on strike.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots could walk out at 11:01 p.m. CST Friday if no deal is reached
through negotiations with the National Mediation Board in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline canceled the flights so planes wouldn't be away from its bases
in Milwaukee, Omaha, Neb., and Kansas City, Mo., in the event of a strike, Lisa
Bailey, spokeswoman for Oak Creek-based Midwest Express, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 passengers held tickets on the flights, which were scheduled to
depart on Friday night and Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Bailey said the company will continue negotiating with the union.
</P>
<P>
	   "We fully expect to continue those talks up until the strike deadline or
even after, if need be," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between the Milwaukee-based airline and the Air Line Pilots
Association have been going on for 19 months. The contract would be the first
between the two.
</P>
<P>
	   Hal Myers, spokesman for the pilots association, said the Mediation Board
requested that both sides not discuss the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Union officials have previously said the major unresolved issues are
pensions, wages and health insurance for retirees.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully, we'll get an agreement prior to the deadline," Myers said.
"That's our goal."
</P>
<P>
	   The 16-year-old airline employs nearly 2,800 people, with 80 percent of them
in Milwaukee. There are 130 Midwest Express flights per day.

<HEADLINE> Some May Have Been Exposed to AIDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A gene therapy experiment may have inadvertently exposed
more than two dozen young cancer patients to the virus that causes AIDS, The
Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers discovered the accidental exposure in December, but did not
inform federal regulators until last week, the Post said in its Friday issue.
The researchers from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston began contacting patients and their parents about
the possible infections Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper reported that researchers and federal officials said early
testing of the gene-based medicine may have been contaminated with HIV-1, the
virus that causes AIDS, and HCV, which causes hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
	   Two subsequent tests found no contamination, indicating that the first
results might have been false. The Food and Drug Administration is now
conducting more reliable tests and is looking into possible laboratory problems
and the timing of the reporting, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said the study had been terminated, but Claire Bassett,
spokeswoman for Baylor, said Thursday night the study conducted in Houston had
only been suspended as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   Bassett said that the contamination evidence had come from St. Jude, and
that there had been no contamination found in the therapy given to the six
children treated at Baylor. Two of the children treated at Baylor have since
died of cancer, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything that took place that the FDA has a concern about did take place
at Memphis," Bassett said.
</P>
<P>
	   Deidre Malone, St. Jude's public relations director, would not comment on
the Post report other than to say the hospital would have a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Laura Bowman, the study's principal investigator at St. Jude, was quoted by
the Post as saying that all of the volunteer cancer patients were near death and
only a handful of the 20 patients she treated are alive today, the rest having
died from their cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Institutes of Health was already investigating St. Jude for its
handling of patient deaths in a different study, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cancer patients suffered from neuroblastoma, a brain cancer that is the
second most common childhood malignancy. The experimental therapy involved
removing a patient's own tumor cells and inserting an immune system gene with a
gene-altered virus. The modified cells were put back in the patient to galvanize
the immune system to fight the cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowman said she discovered last fall that the two most recent volunteers a
child and a teen-ager treated a year ago received viruses that had been
processed incorrectly and could have been contaminated.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she could find no evidence that the original batch of cells from
1995 used to grow the viruses had been properly screened for contamination. In
November, she sent cells from the original batch for testing at an outside lab,
which sent back results that twice showed the presence of DNA from HIV and HCV.

<HEADLINE> British Bill Would Lower Gay Age  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British lawmakers overwhelmingly approved on Thursday a bill
to lower the age of consent for homosexuals from 18 to 16. But the proposal
faces stiff opposition in the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
	   The unelected House of Lords has already thrown out two previous attempts by
the government to equalize the gay and heterosexual ages of consent.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, which would bring Britain in line with most other European Union
nations, was approved Thursday evening in the House of Commons by 263 votes to
102.
</P>
<P>
	   Opening the debate, Home Secretary Jack Straw said lowering the age of
consent for homosexual men was about creating a society ``free from prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Straw's counterpart in the opposition Conservative Party spoke against the
move.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's wrong that a young person of 16 should be free in law to embark on a
course of action that might lead to a lifestyle which would separate him, maybe
permanently, from the mainstream life of marriage and family,'' Anne Widdecombe
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lords' powers are limited to delaying legislation, by blocking it and
bouncing it back to the more powerful House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has already indicated it will resort to the rarely used
device of invoking the Parliament Act -- created to ensure that the will of the
country's elected lawmakers prevails -- to force the bill through if it is
defeated by the Lords again.
</P>
<P>
	   Five years ago, Parliament narrowly rejected lowering to 16 the consent age
for homosexuals, reducing it instead from 21 to 18. Homosexual sex between
adults ceased to be a crime in Britain three decades ago.

L.A. Cop Tells of Criminal Clique

<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A criminal clique within the Los Angeles Police
Department gave plaques to honor officers who shot people, says a disgraced
former officer whose allegations are at the heart of a scandal that has led to
the overturning of more than 30 verdicts. The Los Angeles Times reported
Thursday that it had obtained 2,000 pages of transcripts including 50 hours of
interviews with former Officer Rafael Perez. So far, 32 criminal cases have been
reversed as a result of the investigation and 20 officers have been relieved of
duty, suspended or fired or have quit.

covered by an order that was being drafted late Thursday by the Federal Aviation
Administration. The airlines will have two to three days to comply. Passengers
should expect minor delays, the FAA said. "It's far more important that we get
these airplanes inspected," said Tom McSweeny, the FAA's associate administrator

Economy Should Continue Expansion

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The current economic expansion, already the longest in
the nation's history, should keep going this year and beyond even though a
recent surge in productivity may not last, the Clinton administration said
Thursday. The administration used this year's 432-page "Economic Report of the
President" to take part of the credit for the good times, with unemployment and
inflation both at 30-year lows and consumer confidence at record highs. While
praising the Federal Reserve for pursuing an astute monetary policy, the
economic report said the administration deserved credit for making the tough
choices to eliminate the soaring government deficits it had inherited.

<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Dickerson scored a career-high 40 points and the
Vancouver Grizzlies set a club record with their seventh road victory, beating
the Los Angeles Clippers 112-90 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 10 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter for the
Grizzlies, who matched their best offensive output of the season and won for the
fourth time in 14 games despite the absence of Mark West with stomach flu and
Cherokee Parks because of a bruised right knee.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss was the sixth straight and 20th in 22 games for the Clippers, who
were able to dress only eight players because of injuries to Tyrone Nesby, Eric
Murdock, Brian Skinner and leading scorer Maurice Taylor. Derek Anderson led Los
Angeles with 29 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson's 3-pointer ignited a 13-4 run that increased Vancouver's 10-point
lead to 71-52 with 3:10 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers got no closer than 13 points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson, obtained from Houston in the trade sent rookie Steve Francis to
the Rockets, scored 24 points on 10-for-14 shooting in the first half to help
Vancouver take a 51-39 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson's previous high was 31 last season against Minnesota. Bryant
Reeves set the club record of 41 in 1998 against Boston. Notes: Maurice Taylor
didn't dress after spraining his right hand at Portland. It was the ninth game
he has missed this season. ... The Grizzlies ended a 15-game road losing streak
against Pacific Division opponents, dating to last season. ... Vancouver was the
third last-place team the Clippers have played in their last four home games --
losing to each. ... Vancouver has scored at least 100 points in each of their
last seven victories, and fewer than 100 in each of their last 16 losses.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves Nevada As Waste Site  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over Nevada's heated objections, the Senate directed
Thursday that thousands of tons of nuclear waste be shipped from power plants
nationwide to that state. But the legislation faces a certain presidential veto
that is not expected to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the nuclear waste legislation cleared the Senate by a 64-34 vote,
Nevada's two senators declared victory because they had gotten enough support
against the bill to assure a veto will be sustained if necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This victory puts the brakes on the latest attempts by Republicans to bury
Nevada in nuclear waste,'' declared Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation calls for more than 40,000 tons of highly radioactive used
reactor fuel -- now kept at commercial power plants in 31 states -- to begin to
be shipped to Nevada as early as 2007 if a permanent waste burial site there
receives a federal license. The site is a few miles from where hundreds of
nuclear bomb tests were conducted during the Cold War years.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, the bill's chief sponsor, had sought
numerous compromises to gain administration support, but failed to budge the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is hard-core politics ... to accommodate my colleagues from Nevada,''
complained Murkowski. He said the administration had promised to take the waste
from the utilities ``and solve this problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   Falling short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a threatened
veto, Murkowski told reporters, ``This bill is dead until we get a new
administration.''
</P>
<P>
	   The House has not acted on the matter and may not because a veto is assured.
</P>
<P>
	   While 12 Democrats joined 42 Republicans in support of the legislation, two
defections from the GOP ranks -- Sens. Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado and
Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island -- were viewed as critical by the Nevada
senators.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has struggled for six years over what to do with the more than
40,000 tons of highly radioactive used reactor fuel sitting at commercial power
plants. By law, the waste, which will remain radioactive for 10,000 years,
should have been taken by the Energy Department two years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents of the bill said some utilities are running out of storage space
in waste pools and in some cases dry cask containers. And they argue that the
spent fuel rods would be safer kept at a central location instead of at 71
reactor sites across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   But the White House has opposed a requirement to ship waste to Nevada until
after a permanent underground facility is built at Yucca Mountain. To do so
might undermine the development of the permanent site, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The permanent Yucca Mountain facility being proposed 90 miles northwest of
Las Vegas is still under scientific review, but it is scheduled to be opened in
2010 if found to be technically suitable. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is
expected to decide whether to give it a license in 2006. The Senate-passed bill
would require shipments to begin a year later, before the permanent facility is
built.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson -- and Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle
of South Dakota -- also objected to a provision in the bill that they said would
weaken the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to set radiation standards
for the future permanent waste repository.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the legislation, the EPA would have to consult with the NRC and the
National Academy of Sciences if it wanted to issue the standards before June 1,
2001. The NRC has suggested less-stringent standards than the EPA is considering
for the Yucca Mountain site.
</P>
<P>
	   Murkowski rejected criticism that the EPA's role was being reduced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The EPA has the final authority on determining radiation standards. Make
no mistake on that,'' he declared. ``The effort is to get the best science.''
</P>
<P>
	   He abandoned a provision that would have required the Energy Department to
assume title of the waste at the power plants. He did so after seven governors
raised concern about the title transfer, fearing it could lead to the waste
staying at the power plants for decades, perhaps permanently.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem, said Murkowski, is ``nobody wants the waste'' but ``if you
throw it up into the air, it's got to come down somewhere.'' He argued that the
Nevada site is a logical place to bury it.

northern Kashmir state and opened fire, killing six people, and wounding three
others, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, an explosion Thursday on a train in troubled Jammu-Kashmir state
killed at least five people and wounded six others, police said. The victims
included an infant and a paramilitary soldier, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>

shortly after the train left Jammu, the summer capital of the state, for the
eastern city of Calcutta. Press Trust of India said seven coaches were derailed

immediately identified.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Judge rules for defense in death penalty case pre-hearing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - Prosecutors seeking the death sentence for
serial killer Michael Ross will have to prove he intended to inflict extreme
pain and suffering on his victims.
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge Thomas P. Miano on Thursday sided with defense lawyers
who argued that standard is required by the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
	   But Miano said he was "troubled" by the language in a state Supreme Court
ruling that set the precedent for death penalty prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue may be discussed more next Thursday, at what may be the last
pretrial hearing before the penalty hearing for Ross begins Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Miano also ruled that prosecutors may view a videotape of the serial
killer's 1995 competency hearing, but said they will have to ask again if they
want a copy of the tape or want to introduce it as evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross, 40, a former Jewett City insurance salesman, has admitted to killing
eight women and girls in Eastern Connecticut and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The penalty hearing will determine if Ross should be put to death for four
of those killings.
</P>
<P>
	   His first death sentence was tossed out on appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   He has already received two life sentences for two murders in Windham
County, and has not been prosecuted for the two New York killings.
</P>
<P>
	   In setting ground rules for the hearing, Miano, prosecutors and defense
lawyers have reviewed the state Supreme Court's December ruling in the case of
Sedrick Cobb. The ruling upheld Cobb's death sentence for killing a woman in
Waterbury in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   New London State's Attorney Kevin Kane had argued at a hearing last week
that the Cobb decision required him to prove only that Ross intentionally
engaged in conduct to kill, the conduct inflicted extreme pain and suffering on
the victim beyond what was necessary to kill, and that Ross was callous and
indifferent to that suffering.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Barry Butler said the standard was higher- that prosecutors
also must prove Ross intended to inflict extreme pain and suffering on the
victim beyond what was necessary to kill her.
</P>
<P>
	   Miano said if he accepted the prosecution's interpretation, there would be
little left to prove in the penalty hearing, since the intent to kill already
was proven to secure the conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Cobb case was troublesome and not helpful to the Ross case, but
he noted that other Supreme Court decisions that set death penalty rules have
been upheld.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm troubled by the language and I'm leaving it on the table to revisit if
the state wants to revisit," Miano said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, Miano reiterated his earlier ruling that the Most. Rev.
Daniel Hart, Bishop of Norwich, may testify about his correspondence with Ross
but cannot testify about the Roman Catholic Church's teachings on forgiveness or
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Hart was not required to attend Thursday's hearing to discuss his testimony.

<HEADLINE> Remaining rebate checks expected by mid-March  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The last round of $50 sales tax rebate checks
should be in 260,000 mailboxes by mid-March.
<P>
	   That's the promise from state lawmakers who must make up a $10 million
difference in the underfunded rebate plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Ranking lawmakers said Thursday they expect the money will be approved, but
that likely won't happen until March 1. The Legislature's Appropriations
Committee must support the measure before it's sent to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican lawmakers and state budget director Marc Ryan had urged House
Speaker Moira Lyons and Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan, both
Democrats, to authorize a bypass of the committee process and have the $10
million spending bill ready for a vote in the General Assembly Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Brian Flaherty, R-Watertown, said that plan collapsed when lawmakers
from both parties tried to pad the bill with other spending measures.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some people wanted to put other things in there besides the $10 million for
the rebates," Flaherty said. "That is a rotten thing to do because it has
delayed people's checks."
</P>
<P>
	   Lyons said there was never serious consideration of filling the $10 million
gap before March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   She and Sullivan said they want legislation to get speed through the
Appropriations Committee so it's ready for a vote in the General Assembly on
March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   "No matter what we did, the checks wouldn't be ready to go out until Feb.
29," Lyons said. "We felt there was no need to discuss an emergency bill."
</P>
<P>
	   Department of Revenue Services Commissioner Gene Gavin said the checks could
be in the mail by March 15.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have not been printed yet," Gavin said. "We know who the checks are
going to, but we can't cut them until we get the money first."
</P>
<P>
	   The state had earmarked $108 million of last year's revenue surplus for
rebates to about 2.4 million people. At the time, only 60,000 Social Security
recipients were considered to be eligible for the rebates. But that calculation
was based on old information for the Social Security Administration, Galvin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   When the state received updated information, officials realized there were
200,000 more people who were entitled to rebates.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're waiting until we get all the money before we send the rebates to the
Social Security recipients," Gavin said.

<HEADLINE> Four Track Athletes Killed in Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KARNACK, Texas (AP) -- Four Prairie View A&AMP;M track athletes were killed
Thursday night when their van rolled over on Texas Highway 43 near the
Texas-Louisiana border, the Texas Department of Public Safety said.
</P>
<P>
	Three students were dead at the scene of the accident and another died while
being transported to Louisiana State University Hospital at Shreveport, La. Six
people were injured.
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle was en route to Pine Bluff, Ark., when the wreck occurred.
</P>
<P>
	``At this point it looks like something caused the vehicle to go out of
control,'' DPS spokesman Mike Cox said. ``It eventually rolled and ended up on
its top in a dirt driveway.''
</P>
<P>
	An accident reconstruction team was scheduled to do a more detailed
investigation Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
	The names of the dead were being withheld pending notification of next of kin.
</P>
<P>
	Four survivors were rushed to Marshall Regional Hospital, hospital spokeswoman
Paula Jaco said. Lamar Adams and David Attebery were listed in stable condition
and were being monitored in the intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
	Hoover Wright was in serious condition in the ICU and Trenton Harris was in
stable to serious condition, Jaco said.
</P>
<P>
	Louis Edmond, who was in serious condition, was transferred to Good Shepard
Medical Center in Longview, Jaco said.
</P>
<P>
	The condition of a second student taken to LSU Hospital wasn't immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
	Prairie View officials were meeting late Thursday and had no comment on the
accident.
</P>
<P>
	This was the fifth van accident involving a college team in the last two
months.
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 30, two members of the Wisconsin-Oshkosh swimming team were injured
when the van they were riding in overturned on icy Interstate 65.
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 22, five women from DePaul's track team were injured, one critically,
when a school van rolled over on Interstate 65 after hitting a patch of ice.

<HEADLINE> New England's delegation gets high marks from environmentalists  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - New England lawmakers received greener marks on an
environmental advocacy group's scorecard than colleagues in other regions of the
country.
<P>
	   That could be because the region has a bigger mess to clean up, said Betsy
Loyless, political director of the League of Conservation Voters which issues
yearly "Environmental Scorecards."
</P>
<P>
	   Or they could take inspiration from "how the wind blows, literally," she
said. The region is downwind from some of the nation's dirtiest industrial
facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The League of Conservation Voters' represents a coalition of conservation
and environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The League's yearly scorecard ranks U.S. senators and members of Congress
based on their votes on key environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 106th Congress, Senate environmental issues included a resolution
urging tougher fuel economy standards and a measure that would have diverted
funds from a program that subsidizes logging on public lands toward programs
that protect fish and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
	   House votes included an amendment to replenish a fund to purchase public
lands for open space and one to divert money away from building national forest
trails and toward promotion of timber sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Scores ranged from zero, the lowest, to 100.
</P>
<P>
	   New England's lawmakers had the highest regional average, with 79 in the
Senate and 87 in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because lawmakers recognize their constituents appreciate their
surroundings, said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. "We have the Cape and the
Berkshires. We have lakes and rivers that run through our state. We have a
tradition that goes back to Henry David Thoreau."
</P>
<P>
	   The lowest regional score was a 10 for senators from the Rocky Mountain
region and the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
	   Individual senators with perfect scores included Kerry, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont and Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Lincoln Chafee, R-R.I., also scored 100 though the rating was based on
a single vote in opposition to exempting coal mining operations from clean water
laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists have been watching Chafee since he was appointed to fill
his father's seat.
</P>
<P>
	   John Chafee, who died in October, was chairman of the Senate Environment and
Public Works Committee and received the League's 1999 Lifetime Achievement
Award.
</P>
<P>
	   His successor in the chairmanship, Sen. Robert Smith, R-N.H., got a zero on
the scorecard.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those with perfect scores in the house were Connecticut Democrat Rep.
Rosa DeLauro and Republican Christopher Shays, Massachusetts Democratic Reps.
Michael Capuano, Edward Markey, McGovern, Martin Meehan and John Olver.

<HEADLINE> Rowland requests $20 million in federal aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Connecticut lobstermen, devastated by the die-off
of their catch in Long Island Sound, are a step closer to getting federal
disaster aid.
<P>
	   Gov. John G. Rowland on Thursday requested $20 million in federal funds to
help offset the lobstermen's lost income.
</P>
<P>
	   The request comes about two weeks after U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley declared a fishery failure in the Sound, which allowed Congress to
appropriate money to help the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "The failure of this fishery has decimated the industry in Connecticut,
affecting not only lobster fishers, but businesses along the coast which rely on
a healthy lobster fishery," said Rowland.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Senators Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and Chris Dodd, D-Conn., joined their
colleagues from New York in sending a letter Thursday to the leaders of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, urging them to include the money in the
committee's emergency disaster relief bill. That legislation, expected to be
debated in the next few weeks, is designed to provide relief funds to several
regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also asked the state Department of Transportation to help the
fishermen find storage places for their pots. Because of the financial
hardships, some lobstermen cannot afford to lease storage space for the winter
and would be forced to leave the pots unattended in the water.
</P>
<P>
	   Roughly eight out of every 100 lobsters pulled from the Sound has died in
recent months and the catch rate there plummeted 90 percent by November.
Lobstermen estimate their $36 million annual industry was been cut in half.
</P>
<P>
	   The money will be used to help the fishermen meet their bills and will offer
career retraining programs. Some of the money also will go toward studies to
determine what caused the die-off. Researchers suspect a parasite that attacks
the lobster's nervous system is the likely culprit.
</P>
<P>
	   New York Gov. George Pataki has asked Congress for $15 million for
lobstermen in his state.

<HEADLINE> Diplomats Seek IRA Commitment  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- With Britain poised to suspend the powers
of Northern Ireland's new government, the leader of its Cabinet sounded a
hopeful note that the crisis was not ``terminal.''
</P>
<P>
	   David Trimble, the Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, tried to
give reassurance Thursday that the imperiled peace process would survive as
today's deadline for a breakthrough on Irish Republican Army disarmament drew
near.
</P>
<P>
	   The region's 1998 peace accord, which has at its core the
Protestant-Catholic coalition government, envisioned that the IRA would hand
over its weapons by May, but set no date for a start to disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   After delaying the setting up of the Cabinet for a year over the issue,
Trimble sat down with the IRA-allied Sinn Fein in the four-party Cabinet two
months ago -- in the expectation that the IRA would disarm in return.
</P>
<P>
	   The outlawed group agreed to talk to an independent disarmament commission,
but has made no move to hand over weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission reported Jan. 31 that the IRA had offered nothing concrete in
two months of secret discussions. In response, the British government pledged to
take back the Belfast Cabinet's powers in advance of a planned Ulster Unionist
conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The move is Britain's best bet for keeping the Cabinet going on life
support. If Britain did not take action, the Ulster Unionists could withdraw
from the administration, collapsing it.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA's failure to disarm also jeopardized Trimble's already shaky hold on
the unionists. Despite considerable hostility, he persuaded his party to accept
the compromise and form the Cabinet in hopes the IRA would respond.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The basic reality is that we jumped, others didn't jump, and consequently
we've got problems,'' Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I have to emphasize that they are just problems. And people would be
wrong to regard this as a terminal crisis,'' added Trimble. ``No matter what
difficulties we might have, no matter what might flow from my own council
meeting on Saturday, nobody should regard that as being the ending of this
process.''
</P>
<P>
	   The authority needed to resume direct control of Northern Ireland from
London became law Thursday night, when Queen Elizabeth II gave her assent to a
bill that both houses of Parliament passed this week by overwhelming majorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration's senior Catholic minister, Seamus Mallon, challenged
Britain's entire rationale for seeking to suspend its powers. He said the idea
of rendering the Cabinet powerless, but still intact, seemed nonsensical.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no half-suspended ministers. We're either full ministers with
powers, or we're not ministers at all,'' said Mallon, whose Social Democratic
and Labor Party is Sinn Fein's larger competitor for Catholic votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein leaders angrily accused the British and Ulster Unionists of
unfairly pinning all blame for the current crisis on the IRA.
</P>
<P>
	   The party's Conor Murphy said that the 1998 peace accord required Britain to
publish a policy document outlining army base closures and troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy said the international focus was ``entirely on the weapons of the IRA
-- which are silent, have not been seen or heard of in years -- while we live
daily and constantly under armed occupation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy lives in South Armagh, a border region of Northern Ireland dubbed
``bandit country'' because of its reputation as an IRA power base.
</P>
<P>
	   While British bases and battalions have been reduced in other parts of the
province, the army in South Armagh has maintained an extensive network of
watchtowers and travels exclusively by helicopter, citing the continued threat
from IRA dissidents opposed to the group's 1997 truce.

<HEADLINE> CBS To Air Some Nickelodeon Shows  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Some of Nickelodeon's most popular shows for preschoolers
will soon air on Saturday mornings on CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   It could be one of the first changes viewers will see as a result of the
pending merger of CBS and Viacom, which owns Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS's low-rated block of Saturday morning children's programming would be
replaced by shows from the Nick Jr. lineup, which runs on weekday mornings on
Nickelodeon, according to executives from both companies who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   It hasn't been determined exactly which shows will air on CBS, though the
popular "Blue's Clues" mystery-solving show and "Little Bill" are almost
certain. Other Nickelodeon pre-school shows include "Franklin," "Maurice
Sendak's Little Bear" and "Gulla Gulla Island."
</P>
<P>
	   CBS could use a lift in children's programming, where Nickelodeon, the WB
and Fox are generally considered the market leaders. ABC revived its own
Saturday morning fortunes in recent years by letting its parent, Walt Disney
Co., program its kids' schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   Many young viewers barely know that CBS exists. The arrangement will help
the network because Nickelodeon will promote CBS's schedule within its schedule,
and CBS will do the same for Nick.
</P>
<P>
	   Nickelodeon's own popular Saturday morning lineup will not be affected,
since it is geared toward a slightly older audience.
</P>
<P>
	   The change would begin this fall, executives said.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS has also been working with two other Viacom networks, the music channels
MTV and VH1. One of MTV's leading personalities, Carson Daly, was host last week
of the "Miss USA Pageant," which aired on CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   The show recorded its lowest ratings since it began airing in 1974, however,
drawing 1 million fewer viewers than the previous low last year. It may be an
indication that CBS's audience, which averages over age 50, and MTV's audience
doesn't easily mix.
</P>
<P>
	   VH1 is producing a pre-telecast program to air before the Grammy Awards,
which are being aired Feb. 23 on CBS. The show will be aired on several
CBS-owned television stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the merger took place, VH1 had set up agreements with CBS to air
reruns of concert specials first shown on the network, involving Shania Twain,
Celine Dion and Ricky Martin, said VH1 chief programmer Jeff Gaspin.

<HEADLINE> Rib Injury Eyed in Navy Jet Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- A pilot's rib injury may have led to the crash that
killed him and another member of the Navy's Blue Angels flying team last year in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Cmdr. Kieron O'Connor's injury might have given him trouble tensing his
abdominal muscles to avoid blacking out during maneuvers that exert extreme
gravitational forces on pilots, according to a Navy report issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The report rejected another investigator's conclusion that O'Connor might
have tried to avoid hitting a bird with the F/A-18 Hornet.
</P>
<P>
	   The rib injury theory is ``the most likely scenario supported by the known
facts,'' wrote Rear Adm. Michael Bucchi. The Blue Angels are based at Pensacola
Naval Air Station.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor, 35, and Lt. Kevin Colling, 32, were killed on Oct. 28 while
practicing for air shows with the five other Blue Angels jets at Moody Air Force
Base. There was no evidence of a mechanical problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said that six days before the crash, O'Connor had accidentally
fallen on his side during a ``squadron game'' requiring everyone to drop to the
ground from their chairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Dickerson scored a career-high 40 points and the
Vancouver Grizzlies set a club record with their seventh road victory, beating
the Los Angeles Clippers 112-90 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 10 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter for the
Grizzlies, who were four points shy of their best offensive output of the season
and won for the fourth time in 14 games despite the absence of Mark West with
stomach flu and Cherokee Parks because of a bruised right knee.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss was the sixth straight and 20th in 22 games for the Clippers, who
were able to dress only eight players because of injuries to Tyrone Nesby, Eric
Murdock, Brian Skinner and leading scorer Maurice Taylor. Derek Anderson led Los
Angeles with 29 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson's 3-pointer ignited a 13-4 run that increased Vancouver's 10-point
lead to 71-52 with 3:10 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers got no closer than 13 points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson, obtained from Houston in the trade sent rookie Steve Francis to
the Rockets, scored 24 points on 10-for-14 shooting in the first half to help
Vancouver take a 51-39 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson's previous high was 31 last season against Minnesota. Bryant
Reeves set the club record of 41 in 1998 against Boston. Notes: Maurice Taylor
didn't dress after spraining his right hand at Portland. It was the ninth game
he has missed this season. ... The Grizzlies ended a 15-game road losing streak
against Pacific Division opponents, dating to last season. ... Vancouver was the
third last-place team the Clippers have played in their last four home games --
losing to each. ... Vancouver has scored at least 100 points in each of their
last seven victories, and fewer than 100 in each of their last 16 losses.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Diallo stood throughout shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A medical expert with experience testing assault
weapons on live pigs says Amadou Diallo could have been shot more than a dozen
times and still been standing.
<P>
	   Testifying Thursday at the trial of four police officers accused of
murdering Diallo, 22, with a hail of 41 bullets, Dr. Martin Fackler theorized
the rapid-fire, full metal jacket ammunition tore through Diallo's body in as
little as four seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Fackler, a surgeon specializing in "wound ballistics," and defense
pathologist Dr. Richard Mason told jurors the West African immigrant was turning
to face the officers when 15 of the 19 bullets that struck him pierced his left
side.
</P>
<P>
	   "To me, the evidence is clear he was standing while he got the shots to the
side of his torso," Fackler said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the remaining shots entered Diallo's chest and damaged his spine, the
doctors said. His fall then was broken by a wall of the 5-by-7-foot vestibule
where he died, they added.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense's medical testimony clashed with that of Dr. Joseph Cohen, the
medical examiner who autopsied Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen testified this week that the chest shot paralyzed Diallo "early on."
He said the rest of the bullets must have struck Diallo as he was going down or
flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo was killed by the plainclothes officers as they searched for suspects
in the early morning of Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims the victim refused orders to halt and pulled out a black
object that turned out to be a wallet. The officers believed he was a threat the
entire time it took to fire the 41 bullets into his dimly lit doorway, the
defense says.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors assert the gunfire took much longer than the defense's estimate.
Some of Diallo's neighbors also have testified the deadly burst was interrupted
by a pause. The pause could be used to argue the officers should have realized
their mistake and ceased fire.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, Fackler - who charged $250 an hour to testify - said his
theories had been tested in Europe by firing Russian assault rifles at
anesthetized "people-size pigs."
</P>
<P>
	   "And the anesthetized pigs, did they die?" prosecutor Eric Warner asked on
cross-examination. The question was disallowed after a defense objection.
</P>
<P>
	   Sean Carroll, 36, Kenneth Boss, 28, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy,
27, have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder charges. If convicted, they
face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of an unarmed black man by four white officers sparked enough
pretrial publicity and protest over police abuse of minorities that an appeals
court moved the case to Albany. The trial was adjourned until Monday, when the
officers are expected to begin taking the stand in their own defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Thursday, the defense asked State Supreme Court Justice Joseph
Teresi to order prosecutors to turn over the rap sheet of a volatile eyewitness,
Schrrie Elliott. The judge agreed to let defense attorneys use the information
to attack Elliott's credibility when she resumes testifying.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of Elliott's past were not revealed in court. But records show that
a 32-year-old woman named Schrrie Elliott has been arrested and convicted for
possession and sale of drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys gambled Wednesday by subpoenaing Elliott - who had refused
to work with them - to testify as a defense witness about what she heard while
walking home along Diallo's block that morning. She told jurors someone yelled
"Gun!"
</P>
<P>
	   But the move appeared to backfire on cross-examination when the witness
claimed the officers cornered Diallo and opened fire without warning. Prodded by
prosecutor Donald Levin, she broke into tears and said the officers kept
shooting after he fell to the ground.

<HEADLINE> Norville To Be an Anchor, Jailbird  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- "Inside Edition" anchor Deborah Norville is headed for
jail.
</P>
<P>
	   She plans to enter a North Carolina penal facility Saturday morning to spend
five days as a prisoner. She will provide reports from Davidson County Jail in
Lexington for her weekday syndicated newsmagazine next Monday through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The best way to portray what life behind bars is really like is to spend a
considerable amount of time behind bars," Norville said Thursday. "One day
wouldn't do it."
</P>
<P>
	   Norville listed some of the regulations of this famously tough prison:
24-hour lockdown; twice-a-week showers in a communal facility; no TVs or
newspapers; no makeup.
</P>
<P>
	   She, along with the rest of the prison population, will be forced to rise at
4:30 a.m. -- about the same time she used to get up to appear on NBC's "Today"
show. There will be no coffee.
</P>
<P>
	   Norville is scheduled to get sprung Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   To capture her jail experience, a video crew will be on hand selectively. At
other times, a producer will wield a lightweight "Hi-8" video camera. A camera
will be lodged in the ceiling of Norville's cell, and a point-of-view camera
will be sewn into her prison uniform, she said, stressing that "all the inmates
understand we'll be taping them."
</P>
<P>
	   Norville admits this story wasn't her idea, but instead an assignment she is
duty-bound to carry out.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if she's nervous, she replied, "Who wouldn't be? I'm probably going in
with the same trepidation that any lady in there probably feels. Sure I'm
scared!"

</P>
<P>
	   Calgary, 0-8-2 in the second half of back-to-back games, led 2-0 after
Jarome Iginla beat Roy from just outside the crease 1:34 into the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   Ozolinsh started Colorado's comeback when he scored from just inside the
blue line on a power play at 6:31. The puck bounced off Jean-Sebastien Giguere's
glove and trickled into the net.
</P>
<P>
	   The misfortune snowballed from there as Hejduk tied it on a rebound on
another power play at 12:46. The Avalanche had failed to convert 23 straight
power plays before Ozolinsh and Hejduk broke through.
</P>
<P>
	   Calgary has given up 16 power-play goals in its last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado trailed 1-0 after one period and failed to tie the game in the
second despite having a man advantage for 3:47 after a double-minor penalty on
Andrei Nazarov.
</P>
<P>
	   The Avalanche managed just two shots on the extended power play, and nearly
gave up a short-handed goal to Iginla, who missed wide left on a breakaway
attempt.

and scored on their first shot to take a 1-0 lead at 8:19 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
	   Derek Morris provided the goal, his seventh of the season, scoring from the
top of the right circle after taking a pass from Iginla that set up a 2-on-1
break.
</P>
<P>
	   The assist extended Iginla's point streak to five games.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado played its third straight game without Peter Forsberg, who is
recovering from a concussion.

<HEADLINE> Hijacking Leads to Asylum Questions  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- After nearly half the freed hostages from an Afghan jet
hijacking sought asylum in Britain, the government is taking a tough stance to
show that seizing a plane is not the way to win refuge.
</P>
<P>
	   After the four-day hijacking, hostages spent their first night of freedom at
a four-star airport Hilton Hotel, but Britain's top law enforcement official
warned the 74 asylum-seekers among them not to get too comfortable.
</P>
<P>
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw told legislators Thursday Britain would try to
deport them, if the law allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I personally will make the determination of any application for asylum
made by persons on board this aircraft,'' said Straw, who is responsible for law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Subject to compliance with all legal requirements, I would wish to see
removed from this country all those on the plane as soon as reasonably
practicable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw's stance was backed by Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose spokesman said
a clear signal must be sent out that hijacking was not the way to obtain asylum
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Amnesty International urged the government to consider Afghanistan's poor
record on human rights, which it said included the disappearance of political
opponents, massacres and punishments including floggings, amputations and
executions.
</P>
<P>
	   But opposition politicians in Britain suggested the hijackers had been
attracted to Britain by a reputation for lenience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why the United Kingdom? How many European Convention on Human Rights
signatories did that plane fly over on its journey from Moscow to the U.K.?''
Conservative Party lawmaker Anne Widdecombe said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostages, who police described as being in ``remarkably good health,''
were transferred to the hotel after the crisis ended peacefully before sunrise
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   At 3:50 a.m., about 85 captives -- mostly women and 21 children -- streamed
down the aircraft's rear stairs. The rest, including the hijackers, filed down
the stairs two hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested 21 people on board in connection with the hijacking. Only 70
of the former hostages said they wanted to return home.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers had taken over the Ariana 727 jet early Sunday during what
should have been a short domestic flight from the Afghan capital of Kabul to the
northern town of Mazar-e-Sharif. It stopped over in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and
Russia, before reaching Stansted, 25 miles north of London.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout tense negotiations with Essex police, the hijackers never gave a
clear explanation of their aims, said David Stevens, chief constable of Essex
County police.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It became clear in the last hour of the negotiations that they were
expressing concern about the political situation in Afghanistan,'' he said.
``For the first 75 hours, they didn't talk about the political situation at
all.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens anticipated a long process of interviewing all the people aboard the
aircraft, mainly through translators, to build a case.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain received 3,975 applications for asylum from Afghan citizens last
year, out of a total of 71,160 from all countries, the Home Office said. In
1998, 35 Afghans were granted refugee status and 1,500 others given permission
to remain in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-line Taliban government in Afghanistan thanked British authorities
for ending the hijacking safely, and asked that the plane -- one of only nine in
state-run Ariana Airline's aging fleet -- and its passengers be returned.

<HEADLINE> Blood Pressure's Effects Last  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- High blood pressure in middle age sharply raises the
risk of strokes later in life -- even for those who have brought their pressure
under control, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors have long known that high blood pressure is the single most
important cause of strokes, which hit more than 600,000 Americans annually.
However, doctors traditionally consider only a person's current blood pressure
-- not past readings -- when judging whether their risk is higher than usual.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found that a history of high blood pressure is a powerful
predictor of stroke risk, no matter where a person's blood pressure now stands.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings, from the 50-year-long Framingham Heart Study in the Boston
suburbs, were presented Thursday by Dr. Sudha Seshadri of Boston University
Medical School at a meeting of the American Stroke Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not just the blood pressure you have now," she said. "It's the blood
pressure you had in the past."
</P>
<P>
	   Her study was based on a review of 5,197 study participants, including 367
who had suffered strokes. Researchers looked at current blood pressure, as well
as blood pressure decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   A standard blood pressure reading is given as systolic pressure over
diastolic pressure. Systolic, the larger of the two numbers, should ideally be
below 120, while the diastolic number should be under 80.
</P>
<P>
	   The Framingham researchers found that a 20-point elevation in systolic
pressure when people are in their 60s raises their stroke risk by 50 percent
after they reach age 70. A 20-point elevation during the 50s raises the risk 40
percent later on.
</P>
<P>
	   An increased risk persists even if people bring down their blood pressure in
old age, though the risk is lower than if hypertension is left untreated.
</P>
<P>
	   "This study is important, because it shows that a risk factor is in effect
over a lifetime. The longer you have it, the greater its effect," said Dr. Ralph
Sacco of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Another study by Dr. George Petty of the Mayo Clinic shows the importance of
leaky and deformed heart valves in triggering strokes. The researchers followed
more than 700 people who had problems with their aortic or mitral valves, the
two main valves that control blood flow on the left side of the heart.
</P>
<P>
	   They found that severe mitral valve narrowing was an especially important
risk. People with this condition were nearly four times more likely than usual
to suffer full-blown strokes or ominous mini-strokes.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Strokes More Deadly for Blacks  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN BACHMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Blacks ages 35 to 54 are four times more likely to die of a
stroke than their white counterparts, according to research by the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   Middle-aged Hispanics, Asians, American Indians and Alaska natives also are
at greater risk, the CDC reported Thursday. American Indians and Alaska natives
in that age group are nearly twice as likely as whites to die of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   The racial gap narrowed sharply at older ages, suggesting that younger
minorities are not getting the message about the risk factors, said Carma Ayala,
a CDC epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
	   "Many people believe stroke is an older person's disease," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC also cited lack of access to health care and mistrust of the medical
system as reasons for the racial gap.
</P>
<P>
	   Obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, diabetes, poor nutrition and high blood
pressure are the major risk factors for stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC said stroke was the third leading cause of death in 1997, killing
157,791 Americans. Overall, U.S. stroke deaths in the declined 70 percent from
1950 to 1996.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Test Blood Clot Zappers  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Doctors are developing entirely new approaches to stop
strokes, the nation's No. 3 killer, including lasers, sound waves and gadgets to
attack blood clots deep inside the brain.
</P>
<P>
	   The first report on one of these devices -- a laser beam on the tip of
skinny, flexible tube -- was made Thursday at a conference of the American
Stroke Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Only heart attacks and cancer kill more Americans than strokes. Most occur
when a blood clot gets stuck in one of the brain's arteries, choking off the
blood supply. Unless it can be dislodged within six hours or so, a section of
brain dies, causing paralysis and other problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Clot-dissolving drugs can stop strokes if given quickly enough, but the
therapy can also trigger bleeding in the brain so doctors are often reluctant to
offer it. Other recent attempts at developing stroke medicines have been
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
	   Now experts say at least a dozen companies are developing devices intended
to physically remove or destroy clots. The first results were reported by Dr.
Wayne M. Clark of the Oregon Stroke Center in Portland.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark tested a laser developed by TaLIS Inc. of Coon Rapids, Minn. The
results demonstrate both the difficulties and the promise of this approach.
</P>
<P>
	   The arteries inside the head are very narrow and kinked with hairpin turns.
Just reaching them without causing damage is a technological feat.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark's team so far has used the laser on five patients with strokes in the
middle cerebral arteries or their branches. In two cases, the laser never
reached the clot. In one case, it partially obliterated the clot, while in
another it destroyed the clot.
</P>
<P>
	   However, in the most recent case, one of the steps in the treatment poked a
hole in the clogged artery, triggering bleeding in the 79-year-old woman's
brain. The patient died, although it is unclear whether the laser or the stroke
itself was to blame.
</P>
<P>
	   The program has been suspended while doctors investigate the death.
Eventually, they hope to do 12 procedures, then assess whether the technology is
worth pursuing.
</P>
<P>
	   "An adverse event would not necessarily mean they should abandon the effort.
But it means they have to figure out what went wrong," said Dr. Lynn Smaha,
president of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
	   In the one success, Clark said, a 78-year-old woman came to the hospital
unable to talk and paralyzed on her left side. She "went from a huge stroke to,
three months later, living alone and taking care of herself. But it's just one
case, and maybe the clot would have dissolved by itself."
</P>
<P>
	   TaLIS's president, Charles Hadley, said the laser was developed more than a
decade ago at Massachusetts General Hospital to remove red birthmarks. Because
the laser is absorbed only by red material, doctors looked into the possibility
of using it to blast the blood clots that trigger heart attacks, but the work
was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
	   The laser is threaded into the brain through a liquid-filled catheter that
is one millimeter thick. Doctors use X-rays to follow its progress.
</P>
<P>
	   To work, the laser must get within a centimeter of the clot. It takes a
minute or two of laser blasting to destroy it. In theory, the artery walls
should not be harmed because they are white, not red, and so will not absorb the
laser energy.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one other company, EndoVasix of Belmont, Calif., is also testing a
laser on stroke patients. Stephen Johnson, the chief financial officer, said the
company hopes to have results by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Employing an altogether different approach, Possis Medical Inc. of
Minneapolis has developed a catheter designed to suck blood clots out of the
brain. The device fires a high-speed water jet away from the clot. This create a
vacuum that draws the clot into the catheter.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can get into the upper reaches of the middle cerebral artery," said
Eapen Chacko, a Possis spokesman. "We think we can do that and evacuate the
clot."
</P>
<P>
	   Testing of the approach is to begin in March at six medical centers.
</P>
<P>
	   Other devices in the works could obliterate clots with sound waves or grab
them with a variety of mechanical claws and haul them out. Still another
approach is to try to put oxygen into the brain to compensate for the blocked
blood flow.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides potentially being less likely to trigger bleeding, these mechanical
devices may also work faster than clot-dissolving drugs, which take an hour or
two to break up a clot.
</P>
<P>
	   "The idea is, the quicker you get it removed, the better," Clark said. Using
a laser, "it takes seconds vs. hours."

<HEADLINE> Negotiations Key to Hijacking's End  </HEADLINE>
   By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Six hours before the end of the four-day Afghan
hijacking drama, British negotiators gambled on a simple proposal to the
hostage-takers -- let the remaining 150 people on board leave the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly thereafter a face-to-face meeting on Thursday was held with the two
main hijackers, who had grown to call the negotiators by their first names. In
less than an hour, passengers began streaming off the plane into the pre-dawn
darkness.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout 76 hours of talks, police communicating via the plane's radio had
been continually trying to build up trust with the hijackers aboard the Ariana
Airlines Boeing 727 on the tarmac of Stansted airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The main concern of the hijackers was for their own fate upon surrendering.
What would happen once they set foot on British soil?
</P>
<P>
	   Unfamiliar with British law, much of the talk with the hijackers focused on
how they would be treated, said Essex County police Chief Constable David
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's about building a rapport, building a relationship,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
	   Never throughout the entire negotiations did the hijackers make any
political demands, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was very difficult to have an understanding of why they had taken'' the
plane, Stevens said. The hijackers seized the plane on a domestic flight in
Afganistan on Sunday and took it through stops in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and
Russia, before reaching Stansted, 25 miles north of London.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators tried to bond with the hijackers by providing food for
passengers, keeping the traditional Muslim diet and meeting other requests
pertaining to the comfort of those on the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   A representative of the U.N. High Commission for Refugees was brought in
Tuesday to reassure the hijackers that they would suffer no human rights
violations in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   That came right before the negotiations reached their most critical phase --
when four crew members escaped from the cockpit about 10:45 p.m. Wednesday
during a break in the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   It apparently was not until more than four hours later that the hijackers
realized the crew was gone. For the first time, threats were issued about
harming the passengers and the hostage-takers were ``screaming down the line to
negotiators,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although using force to end the takeover was always an option, police said
it didn't come into play even as the talks turned tense.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just as important for us to remain calm under those circumstances as
anybody else,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a testament to how much trust had been built up over the previous few
days, negotiators were able to restore the previous calm tenor of the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, at midnight Wednesday, police for the first time proposed that
everyone come off the plane, Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers seemed ready to take that final step, he said, but only before
one last test of trust: a highly unusual face-to-face meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Police left a box with walkie-talkies behind the plane so the hijackers that
came out would be able to communicate with their comrades remaining aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   At about 2:45 a.m., the two hijackers who were the negotiators' key contacts
stepped off the plane for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Just a half-hour later, about 85 passengers, including all the women and
children, began streaming off the plane toward waiting police.
</P>
<P>
	   The crisis was now nearly over.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, in the standoff's final hour, the hijackers talked about
the political situation in Afghanistan. Although they could face jail sentences
in Britain, they would face the death penalty in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, just before 6 a.m., the last of the approximately 65 people aboard
the plane started streaming off. Last out: a hijacker.

<HEADLINE> Air Farming Researched in S. Dakota  </HEADLINE>
    By JOE KAFKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PIERRE, S.D. (AP) -- Far-fetched as it may seem, the new frontier for
farming may be the air.
</P>
<P>
	   And South Dakota legislators want to make sure their farmers are poised to
cash in on the new crop: carbon dioxide pollution removed from the air through
absorption by plants.
</P>
<P>
	   The process is called carbon sequestration, or depositing carbon into soils,
which could help slow global warming by reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
	   A bill unanimously endorsed Thursday by the South Dakota Senate Agriculture
Committee will provide $250,000 for research into the carbon-storage potential
of the state's soils.
</P>
<P>
	   Preliminary information suggests that the state's landowners could get $103
million a year for growing vegetation that absorbs carbon, placing the pollutant
into soils. That also benefits soils by helping make them more fertile and
increasing their capacity to hold moisture.
</P>
<P>
	   The economic data comes from Pat Zimmerman, head of the Institute of
Atmospheric Sciences at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in Rapid
City.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is what his quick analysis is of the value on an annual basis to the
landowners in the state of South Dakota," said state Sen. Paul Symens. "We're
going to know a lot more down the road."
</P>
<P>
	   Symens offered a carbon-farming bill that was rejected by the Agriculture
Committee a few weeks ago. However, Gov. Bill Janklow was intrigued by the
subject, and suggested the $250,000 to get the research going.
</P>
<P>
	   Symens said payments to landowners may come from coal-fired power plants and
other polluters who must meet federal air-quality standards. Rather than trying
to completely eliminate pollutants with industrial scrubbers, plants would get
credits for carbon removed from the air by vegetation.
</P>
<P>
	   If farmers were paid for carbon removal, they may be more apt to plant trees
and other vegetation along streams instead of planting crops to the bank's edge,
said Jim Burg, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission. That would reduce
soil runoff into streams and improve wildlife habitat, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Farmers fed up with low prices for mainstream crops
stand to gain from a popular medicinal herb that grows wild in western areas, a
Minnesota man says.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Bischke is seeking to study echinacea farming in North Dakota and has
plans to build a processing plant in Harvey, where his family lives.
</P>
<P>
	   But he has no help so far from the North Dakota Agricultural Products
Utilization Commission, which rejected Bischke's $30,000 request this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Bischke said he still intends to move ahead with his project.
</P>
<P>
	   Echinacea has contributed to the rise of the multibillion dollar herbal
supplement industry in the last decade because it fights colds, flu and other
viruses, Bischke said. The herb is an ingredient in pills, cough drops, soups
and even chocolates with echinacea filling.
</P>
<P>
	   Bischke said farmers can make a living by planting a five-acre echinacea
plot. He said the crop can yield several hundred pounds per acre, fetching
prices of up to $15 per pound.
</P>
<P>
	   "Five acres of echinacea ... would far outshine a quarter of wheat," said
Bischke. "It's fairly lucrative stuff."

<HEADLINE> Marino Voids Rest of Contract  </HEADLINE>
    By MARK LONG AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- If the Miami Dolphins are able to retain their free
agents and bring in some from other teams, they owe a great deal to Dan Marino.
</P>
<P>
	   The NFL's career passing leader voided the final two years of his contract
Thursday, clearing $5.8 million under the salary cap and paving the way for the
Dolphins to be highly competitive during the free-agent signing period, which
began today.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino is now a free agent, but he has not decided whether to retire, return
to the Dolphins for less money or opt to do the unthinkable -- play elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   "He deserves to go out on a white horse and with lots of fanfare," said
tight end Troy Drayton, who was released by Miami on Thursday. "He's done a lot
to revolutionize the quarterback position and the NFL as a whole.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't see Dan in another uniform."
</P>
<P>
	   It could happen, though, if Marino wants to contend for a starting job.
</P>
<P>
	   Dolphins coach Dave Wannstedt has shown little interest in retaining the
38-year-old quarterback.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino threw 12 touchdown passes and 17 interceptions last season, missing
five games and most of a sixth because of a neck injury. He finished with a
career-low 67.4 passer rating.
</P>
<P>
	   Wannstedt has indicated that he would prefer to go with a younger
quarterback like Jim Druckenmiller or Damon Huard, who was 4-1 as a starter last
season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got a new coordinator, a new head coach and we're going to have a new
offensive system," Dolphins president Eddie Jones said. "And I don't know how
Dan fits into that.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he intends to retire, he knows the time. He'll pick the right time, and
there is no timetable right now to do that."
</P>
<P>
	   Marino did have a timetable to void the final two years on his contract. He
needed to void his contract by Thursday, or the Dolphins would have had to waive
him or pay him $5.75 million for the 2000 season, plus a $1 million bonus for
being on the roster April 1. Marino would have made $6.75 million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dan knew right where we were headed," Jones said. "He knew that voiding the
contract helped us. I never said to Dan, 'You've got to void your contract.' We
talked about alternatives, but I never once pushed him in any direction."
</P>
<P>
	   Though Marino does not have to make his decision any time soon, he likely
will make an announcement before March 20, the day the Dolphins begin their
offseason workout program.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not going to speculate about what Dan's going to do," Jones said. "Dan
is a great athlete and he's done everything possible he can do in football.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sure he's going through the thought process of, 'Do I still want to do
this?' He had the injury last year and his knees are not getting any better. I'm
sure that's what he's thinking about."

<HEADLINE> Bills Release 3 Veterans  </HEADLINE>
    By CAROLYN THOMPSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- The realization that his days in a Buffalo Bills
uniform were over hit Bruce Smith hard after he and veteran teammates Thurman
Thomas and Andre Reed were released.
</P>
<P>
	   After 15 years, there would be a lot of goodbyes -- to fans, coaches, and
players.
</P>
<P>
	   "These are strong ties built over the course of 15 years, and now it's
gone," an emotional Smith told The Associated Press on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The release of the so-called Big Three, the last holdovers from the four
Super Bowl teams of the 1990s, came as the Bills maneuvered to get under the
NFL's $62.2 million salary cap by today's deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   "None of us wanted to see this happen, and we worked diligently trying to
avoid this situation," general manager John Butler said. "I have to say honestly
that this was one of the toughest business decisions we have ever had to make."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said the salary cap was contributing to "the demise of Hall-of-Famers'
careers."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not the only one affected by this," he said. "It's sad the fans are
being affected as well, not seeing their favorite players finish their careers
with one team."
</P>
<P>
	   Pressured to trim more than $10 million from their payroll, the Bills were
unable to make 12-year veteran Thomas an offer and offered Smith about half of
the $4.6 million he was slated to make, said agent Leigh Steinberg, who
represents both players.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed, meanwhile, wanted to go. While becoming the No. 2 receiver in NFL
history last season, he had grown increasingly disgruntled with his diminished
role in the Bills' offense. He was told by coach Wade Phillips on Wednesday that
his 15-year career with the Bills was over.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today was the big day I've been waiting for," Reed said on his Internet
site. "The Bills released me. Isn't it something? Most people don't want to be
released, but I wanted this so bad. My wife even said, 'We're free agents now!
I'm so happy for you.' It's a big sigh of relief that it's over with."
</P>
<P>
	   Reed, Smith and Thomas have spent their entire careers in Buffalo. None is
ready to retire.
</P>
<P>
	   "We plan to actively explore free agency," Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas, 33, rushed for more than 1,000 yards eight straight seasons
beginning in his second year in 1989. He had his best seasons in the Super Bowl
years of 1990-93 and holds NFL playoff records for games (20), touchdowns (21)
and yards gained (2,114).
</P>
<P>
	   He accepted a reduced role in the offense last season when he stepped aside
for Antowain Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed, 35, passed Art Monk with 945 catches to trail only Jerry Rice in
career NFL receptions. Reed also passed Steve Largent and took over fourth place
on the NFL's yards receiving list with 13,095.
</P>
<P>
	   In his final season in Buffalo, Smith led the Bills defense to a No. 1
ranking for the first time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought I would have finished my career in Buffalo and had an opportunity
to go back and win a championship in Buffalo," he said. "It's very emotional for
me."

<HEADLINE> Warrants Issued in Ray Lewis Case  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Contending Ray Lewis was actively involved in a brawl that
led to two killings and lied repeatedly to protect his friends, prosecutors are
planning to seek murder indictments against the Baltimore Ravens linebacker and
two associates.
</P>
<P>
	   The men -- Reginald Oakley, 31, of Baltimore and Joseph L. Sweeting, 34, of
Miami -- were still at large late Thursday and should be considered armed and
dangerous, deputy police chief C.B. Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oakley and Sweeting were with Lewis at a Buckhead club the night of the
killings and have extensive criminal records, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say Lewis drove away in a limousine and later was uncooperative
with investigators, providing "misleading statements and outright lies."
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes silence speaks volumes," Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said. "The
perpetrators were literally dripping with blood, and yet not a single occupant,
not a single passenger has contacted the police to provide any information about
what occurred."
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis' attorneys maintained his innocence, saying he tried to break up the
Jan. 31 fight after the Super Bowl. They said he was at least 60 feet away when
Richard Lollar, 24, and Jacinth Baker, 21, both of Decatur, were stabbed and did
not see the crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Ed Garland gave reporters a copy of a witness' affidavit
saying Lewis "only acted as a peacekeeper in restraining people from fighting
and attempting to get people in the limo."
</P>
<P>
	   Garland said authorities have been hasty and incomplete in their
investigation. He said witnesses supporting Lewis would come forward, but so far
have been afraid of being arrested themselves or even of repercussions from
Sweeting and Oakley.
</P>
<P>
	   Garland said Lewis did not know the real names or criminal records of
Sweeting and Oakley, whom he called "hangers-on" and "groupies."
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys say police focused quickly on Lewis, a three-time Pro Bowl
player, because of his high profile.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've made a case against a celebrity and they're going to try to make it
stick no matter what the facts are," Garland said. "We're going to bring them
the facts, and those facts will exonerate Ray Lewis."
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson said several witnesses saw Lewis punching Lollar just before he was
stabbed. He can be charged with murder if he was involved in the fight, even if
someone else stabbed the men.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson said police have the knife that was used to kill both men. Lewis was
with Sweeting and Oakley when one of them bought the knife at a suburban Atlanta
sporting goods store where Lewis was signing autographs the day before the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   On his lawyers' advice, Lewis has refused speak to investigators since his
first interview before his arrest. In that interview he misled investigators,
including saying that former University of Maryland football player A.J. Johnson
was one of the men with him the night of the killings, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson was not in Atlanta Super Bowl week. Garland said Lewis was confused
about the names of some of the men in the limousine.
</P>
<P>
	   "He did know one of the men by the name A.J., and under the pressure he was
under at that moment, he got the last name wrong," Garland said. "He was being
grilled and being treated in a very hostile fashion."
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis led the NFL in tackles last season and played college football at
Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   He is being held without bond pending a hearing scheduled for Monday. That
hearing would be postponed if a grand jury hands down the three murder
indictments, as Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard has asked.

<HEADLINE> NFL's Biggest Stars on the Market  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The NFL's salary cap doesn't leave room for sentiment.
</P>
<P>
	   So Dan Marino is no longer with the Miami Dolphins and Bruce Smith, Thurman
Thomas and Andre Reed are no longer Buffalo Bills, the last of the veterans who
played on four straight championship teams of the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino, who holds almost all the NFL's passing records, renounced the final
two years on his contract Thursday, the day before the free-agent period began.
</P>
<P>
	   And Smith, Thomas and Reed were all released by the Bills to make cap room
for younger players. Only Reed, who had his differences with the coaching staff
this season, went willingly.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a sad day, a very sad day," said the 36-year-old Smith, who trails
only Reggie White in career sacks. "I thought I would have finished my career in
Buffalo and had an opportunity to go back and win a championship in Buffalo,"
</P>
<P>
	   The cap, which favors youth over age, wreaked havoc on older players as it
rarely has before -- particularly older players with Hall of Fame credentials,
like Marino and Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Another veteran star, quarterback Steve Young, renegotiated his contract
with San Francisco to allow the 49ers to cut $3 million from the cap. But
Steinberg, who also represents Young, said his client, who missed most of last
year with a concussion, won't decide until April whether to retire, return to
the 49ers or ask to be released to go to a team like Seattle or Denver that has
a better chance to make the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Not only did old players get cut, but some younger stars who would have
become unrestricted free agents today were left very unhappy at being designated
"franchise players," meaning their current team controls their future. They can
negotiate with other teams, but their current team gets two first-round picks in
return.
</P>
<P>
	   They include three top defensive ends -- Simeon Rice of Arizona, Robert
Porcher of Detroit and Tony Brackens of Jacksonville -- tight end Ken Dilger, at
27 the oldest starter on Indianapolis' high-powered offense, as well as
Washington's Stephen Davis, who led the NFC in rushing last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Wide receiver Joey Galloway of Seattle also was made a franchise player
after an arbitrator made him a free agent by rejecting the Seahawks' contention
that his eight-game holdout this season made him Seattle property for another
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am just speechless," said Steve Weinberg, Davis' agent. "If that's where
the Redskins are at, then hopefully another team will sign Steve to a fair
contract. They don't seem to care if they have him or if they don't have him.
The only people that are against Stephen are the Redskins' front office."
</P>
<P>
	   Other former All-Pros besides Marino and the Bills veterans were included in
the salary cap purge.
</P>
<P>
	   Tight end Troy Drayton, Marino's teammate, was released and said he wouldn't
consider re-signing for less with Miami. The Patriots, who cut tight end Ben
Coates on Wednesday, did the same Thursday to left tackle Bruce Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
	   Offensive tackle Lomas Brown, a 15-year-veteran, was released on Wednesday
by Cleveland, and 34-year-old guard Randall McDaniel, who started last weekend
in his 11th consecutive Pro Bowl, was cut by Minnesota. The Vikings also
released two other one-time mainstays, wide receiver Jake Reed and tight end
Andrew Glover.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the veterans could return to their former teams at reduced salaries,
including Marino, who also could retire or move on, perhaps to Tampa Bay, to get
a last shot at a Super Bowl ring. If Marino goes back to Miami, he's not
guaranteed a starting spot -- new coach Dave Wannstedt wants to give Damon Huard
and Jim Druckenmiller shots at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
	   The salary cap is expected to go up just $5 million this season, or about
one year for one good player. The three defensive ends who were franchised --
Porcher, Brackens and Rice -- want at least $8 million, the average that another
Pro Bowl defensive end, Michael Strahan of the Giants, got when he re-signed
last season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vikings, for example, didn't seem ready to welcome back the players they
released.
</P>
<P>
	   "Randall McDaniel has been a great Viking player throughout the years. Both
Jake Reed and Andrew Glover have been starters and have made solid
contributions," coach Dennis Green said. "All three guys want to continue
playing, and we wish them the best in their playing careers in the future."
</P>
<P>
	   Leigh Steinberg, the agent for Smith and Thomas, negotiated through the day,
but was unable to reach a deal that would allow his clients to remain in
Buffalo. But he also didn't think he'd have trouble finding them jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Plenty of teams want a great pass-rusher and a back who can still do some
great things," Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some players stayed.
</P>
<P>
	   Safety Lawyer Milloy signed a $35 million, seven-year deal with New England.
But the Patriots acknowledged that his deal might make it harder to sign other
players. The Jaguars re-signed another top defensive back, Aaron Beasley.
</P>
<P>
	   Wide receiver Tim Brown, who has spent his 12-year career with the Raiders
in a love-hate relationship with managing general partner Al Davis, decided he
would stay in Oakland, not exercising an option in his contract that would have
made him a free agent. His decision came after he publicly aired many of his
differences with the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't listen to any of the radio broadcasts nor did I read many of the
articles," coach Jon Gruden said. "Tim Brown is a guy that wants to be with this
organization. He's a very loyal person, and loyalty is a two-way street, the
organization to the player and the player to the organization. Tim called me
yesterday and told me he wanted to stay with the Raiders. The rest was easy."

<HEADLINE> Weiss Leads After Short Program  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The only attempted quadruple jump was flawed, and so was the
competition.
</P>
<P>
	The men's short program at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships was hyped as a
high-flying, aerial circus. Instead, it looked more like amateur hour at the
local rink.
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Michael Weiss avoided disaster on an easy jump and is the
leader heading into the final over local jumping sensation Timothy Goebel and
teenager Matt Savoie following Thursday night's ragged performances.
</P>
<P>
	``For me to go out and have a good warmup, save the combo like that and be in
first place was pretty good for me,'' said Weiss, who nearly touched the ice on
his second jump, a triple axel, double toe loop combination.
</P>
<P>
	The entire evening wasn't even pretty good. Neither Weiss nor Goebel was in top
form and were outskated by the 19-year-old Savoie, who went last, but scored the
highest technical marks.
</P>
<P>
	Each got three first-place votes, leaving Saturday night's free skate wide
open. Last year's runner-up, Trifun Zivanovic, was fourth.
</P>
<P>
	Weiss, bothered in recent months by a stress fracture in his left ankle, played
it safe from the start. He planned a quad toe loop on his first jump, but
changed it to a triple toe.
</P>
<P>
	``I was just getting into it and I was pretty close to the boards, and that got
me out of my rhythm a little bit,'' he said. ``I've done it before in that spot,
but it threw me off. I didn't get the height I wanted, and I instinctively
opened up.''
</P>
<P>
	On his next jump, Weiss got crooked in the air on a triple axel and followed it
with a double toe instead of his planned triple.
</P>
<P>
	``The axel was good,'' Weiss said. ``I fought through it.''
</P>
<P>
	Weiss finished the routine like a champion, skating with precision and power.
</P>
<P>
	He knew he had avoided a small disaster, and although he wondered why one judge
would give him a 5.0 for required elements, Weiss was pleased to have the lead.
</P>
<P>
	``It's always tough to come back and defend,'' said last year's bronze medalist
at the world championships. ``But I have a lot of confidence in myself.''
</P>
<P>
	Fired up by a hometown crowd cheering even his simplest spins in warmups,
Goebel was hoping to become the first skater to land a four-rotation jump at
nationals.
</P>
<P>
	Goebel, who in 1998 became the first skater to land a quadruple salchow in
competition, made four turns on his first jump, but stepped out of the landing.
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little hesitant going into it, and I just held back,'' said Goebel,
who has three quads planned for his free skate. ``If I had just gone barreling
into it like I do in practice, I would have been fine.''
</P>
<P>
	If Goebel would have landed it, there's no telling how the Gund Arena crowd
would have reacted. They had little reason to get out of their seats, saving
their only standing ovation for Shepherd Clark, who withdrew during his routine
because of a back injury.
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had that much applause going onto the ice, and it pumped me up,''
said Goebel, who estimated he had a couple hundred friends on hand.
</P>
<P>
	By the time Savoie finished, he had won over a few fans himself.
</P>
<P>
	Skating to an orchestral version of the Rolling Stones' ``Paint It Black,''
Goebel was cleaner in the air than Goebel, Cleveland's Jumping Jack Flash.
</P>
<P>
	Savoie's triple axel, triple flip-triple toe combination and triple lutz were
the most precise jumps of the night. And once the Peoria, Ill., native stuck his
early jumps, he gained confidence.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleased that I skated well for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev repeated as ice dancing
champions. Jamie Silverstein and Justin Pekarek, who skated as juniors last
year, finished second.
</P>
<P>
	Two-time defending U.S. champion Michelle Kwan skates today in the women's
short program.

Hijacking Leads to Asylum Questions
</SUBHEAD>

	   LONDON (AP) -- After nearly half the freed hostages from an Afghan jet
hijacking sought asylum in Britain, the government is taking a tough stance to
show that seizing a plane is not the way to win refuge. After the four-day
hijacking, hostages spent their first night of freedom at a four-star airport
Hilton Hotel, but Britain's top law enforcement official warned the 74
asylum-seekers among them not to get too comfortable. Home Secretary Jack Straw

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over Nevada's heated objections, the Senate directed
Thursday that thousands of tons of nuclear waste be shipped from power plants
nationwide to that state. But the legislation faces a certain presidential veto
that is not expected to be overcome. Although the nuclear waste legislation
cleared the Senate by a 64-34 vote, Nevada's two senators declared victory
because they had gotten enough support against the bill to assure a veto will be
sustained if necessary.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A criminal clique within the Los Angeles Police
Department gave plaques to honor officers who shot people, says a disgraced
former officer whose allegations are at the heart of a scandal that has led to
the overturning of more than 30 verdicts. The Los Angeles Times reported
Thursday that it had obtained 2,000 pages of transcripts including 50 hours of
interviews with former Officer Rafael Perez. So far, 32 criminal cases have been
reversed as a result of the investigation and 20 officers have been relieved of
duty, suspended or fired or have quit.

Chinese Ship Not Seen as a Threat

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China's acquisition of a Russian-built destroyer is not

State Department said Thursday. "While clearly improving China's naval
capabilities, it is fair to say the appearance of one additional modern warship
will not fundamentally alter the regional balance of power, spokesman James P.
Rubin said. A Taiwanese defense expert said Wednesday U.S. ships that have
protected Taiwan could be threatened by the delivery of the Sovremenny-class

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The government is requiring airlines to inspect the

in the United States -- all MD-80s, MD-90s, DC-9s and Boeing 717s -- will be
covered by an order that was being drafted late Thursday by the Federal Aviation
Administration. The airlines will have two to three days to comply. Passengers
should expect minor delays, the FAA said. "It's far more important that we get
these airplanes inspected," said Tom McSweeny, the FAA's associate administrator

<HEADLINE> Bennett Has Narrow View of Boxing  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.-
AP Boxing Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Michael Bennett has a rather narrow, long-distance view of
the future.
</P>
<P>
	``My tunnel vision is Sydney right now,'' said the world and U.S. 201-pound
boxing champion, who advanced to the finals of the Olympic Trials Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
	``Everything past is past, all the wins, all the losses,'' said the 28-year-old
Bennett, who learned to box while serving seven years for armed robbery in
Menard prison in Illinois. Everyone is hungry now.''
</P>
<P>
	Bennett pounded out an 11-8 semifinal decision over 19-year-old Jason Estrada
of Providence, R.I. His opponent in the final will be DaVarryl Williamson of
Aurora, Ill., who stopped Bennett in the second round of the National Golden
Gloves final in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	``He was definitely the best man that day,'' said Bennett, who got serious
about boxing after being released from prison July 8, 1998. ``But he has to be
the best of this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Williamson, a three-time U.S. champion, outpointed Mike Kirkman
of Acoma, N.M., 10-6.
</P>
<P>
	Two other world champions advanced to the finals at the Tampa Convention Center
tonight and Saturday afternoon by winning Thursday night at the Tampa Port
Authority Cruise Terminal No. 6.
</P>
<P>
	They are 19-year-old Brian Viloria of Waipahu, Hawaii, at 106 pounds and
19-year-old Ricardo Juarez of Houston at 125 pounds.
</P>
<P>
	Viloria found himself in a family feud with the Donaire brothers of San
Leandro, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	He beat 20-year-old Glenn Donaire on Thursday night and now will box
17-year-old Nonito Donaire, the U.S. champion.
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed my brother lost,'' said 17-year-old Nonito Donaire. ``All
he said was he won the fight. He made the world champion run.''
</P>
<P>
	``I expected him to come out and not to be scared,'' the 19-year-old Viloria
said of the 20-year-old Glenn Donaire. ``He's strong, really strong and I
couldn't overpower him. In the last two rounds, I tried to box him, and it paid
off.''
</P>
<P>
	Nonito Donaire is more of boxer than his brother.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to try to overpower, but if I can't, I'll box him,'' Viloria said
of Nonito Donaire.
</P>
<P>
	``He's an inside fighter, and I'm a boxer,'' Nonito said. ``People say he's
good, and he is good, but I can outsmart him and send him back to the losers
bracket where my brother can take care of him.''
</P>
<P>
	The trials are a double-elimination tournament. So Glenn Donaire will now box
in the challengers (losers) bracket. The winner in this bracket will box the
losers of the championship finals. The winner of those bout will challenge the
trials champions at the box-off Feb. 24-26 at Foxwoods Casino at Mashantucket,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
	Juarez beat Teaunce Shepherd of Milwaukee, the boxer he beat in the final of
this year's U.S. championships. Then the score was 21-8. Thursday night, it was
9-5.
</P>
<P>
	``I give Teaunce a heads up, he gave me a tough fight,'' Juarez said. ``Since
the world championship I've gained a lot of confidence that I can be in there
with the best. I go into a fight as the man to beat.''
</P>
<P>
	Juarez's final opponent will be Steven Luevano of LaPuente, Calif., a 22-0
winner over Hong Gu of Ft. Carson.
</P>
<P>
	Other semifinal winners were Roberto Benitez of New York and Jose Navarro of
Los Angeles, 112; Aaron Garcia of Vista, Calif., and Clarence Vinson of
Washington, D.C., 119; David Jackson of Seattle and Marshall Martinez of
Fontana, Calif., 132; Jose Celaya of Salinas, Calif., and Ricardo Williams Jr.
of Cincinnati, 139; Larry Mosely of Los Angeles and Dante Craig of Cincinnati,
147; Sergio Mora of Los Angeles and Jermain Taylor of Little Rock, Ark., 156;
Jeff Lacy of St. Petersburg, Fla., and Randy Griffin of Philadelphia, 165;
Olanda Anderson of Ft. Carson and Felix Cora of Galveston, Texas, 178; and
Calvin Brock of Charlotte, N.C., and T.J. Wilson of Tulsa, Okla., super
heavyweight.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution: Volpe promised lawyer he'd "say nothin"' about  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Federal prosecutors say they have witnesses ready to
testify that just before he agreed to plead guilty to a sodomy attack on Abner
Louima, officer Justin Volpe assured a lawyer he would "say nothin"' to
implicate fellow officer Charles Schwarz in the crime.
<P>
	   The surprise move, in a letter to U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson,
injected a new element Thursday into the trial of Schwarz and two other officers
for conspiring to conceal Schwarz's role in the August 1997 incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Nickerson did not immediately rule on whether to admit the evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe and Schwarz were on trial last May for violating Louima's civil rights
when Volpe abruptly decided to plead guilty. Schwarz was convicted and faces a
possible life sentence. His appeal for a new trial was rejected by Nickerson
last August.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 34, and officers Thomas Bruder, 37, and Thomas Wiese, 34, face up
to five years in prison if convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice in the
current case.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the letter from Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad, rumors
of Volpe's decision to plead guilty were circulating through the Brooklyn
federal courthouse on May 20, when, during a lunch recess, Schwarz's lawyer,
Stephen Worth, "confronted Volpe in the lobby" and asked a question. The letter
continues:
</P>
<P>
	   "In response to Worth's apparent inquiry, Volpe responded in substance:
'Don't worry, man. I'm not going to say nothin'. Worth thanked Volpe. Volpe and
Worth then parted."
</P>
<P>
	   Worth, currently defending another officer in the Amadou Diallo murder trial
in Albany, refused comment on whether he had any such conversation with Volpe.
"They know where to find me," he said. "I'd be happy to respond to a subpoena."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers in the Brooklyn trial declined comment but Bruder attorney Stuart
London said they would confer on the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutors' letter, dated Feb. 9, said the government hoped to call
"one or more witnesses who overheard the conversation between Volpe and Worth,"
but did not identify them.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe and Worth conversed on May 20, the letter said. Five days later, Volpe
pleaded guilty to sodomizing Louima, a Haitian immigrant, with a broken
broomstick and said a second, unnamed officer took part.
</P>
<P>
	   At his sentencing in December 1998, where he drew a 30-year term, Volpe said
for the first time that the "second officer" in the bathroom during the attack
on Louima was not Schwarz, but Wiese, who did not participate or interfere.
</P>
<P>
	   In moving for a new trial, Worth - then Schwarz's lawyer - claimed the
government withheld from him its knowledge that Volpe would deny Schwarz's
presence in the bathroom. The prosecutors' letter suggests that Worth knew of
Volpe's intention from the officer himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "Volpe would have had no reason to indicate to Schwarz's attorney his intent
to 'say nothing' if Schwarz had not participated in the sexual assault of Mr.
Louima," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvyn Kornberg, who was Volpe's attorney, described the letter as "grasping
at straws" by the state. "It shows the prosecutors are mortally afraid of Mr.
Volpe's testimony," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony, James Burns, a former senior official of the police
department's Internal Affairs Bureau, described an interview with Wiese days
after the incident in which that officer identified himself as the second cop in
the bathroom and said he never saw Schwarz anywhere but at the precinct house's
front desk.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Burns, Wiese said he helped Volpe escort Louima toward the
arrest processing room and was surprised when Volpe took a sharp right to the
bathroom, saying he wanted to "clean up the prisoner."
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes later, hearing noises, Wiese said he entered and found Volpe,
broomstick in hand, with his foot on the prostrate Louima's back, Burns said.
Wiese said Volpe dragged Louima away from the toilet by his legs as he explained
that the man had soiled himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, a police officer admitted he told police and state investigators he
didn't know who escorted Louima to the station house bathroom, but named Schwarz
when questioned months later by the FBI and a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   "I made a mistake... it was a mistake not to do so," Officer Mark Schofield
said when defense lawyers pressed him to explain his failure to tell what he
knew to IAB detectives and the Brooklyn district attorney when questioned days
after the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied that anyone told him to lie.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Testifies Before Arbitrator  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- John Rocker got the chance Thursday to explain his
controversial comments, testifying on the second and final day of a hearing he
hopes will lead to a reduction in his suspension.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlanta Braves reliever, suspended by commissioner Bud Selig until May 1
and fined $20,000, was the primary witness called by the players' association,
which hoped to convince arbitrator Shyam Das to overturn the penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Das' decision is expected later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be no sooner than 10 days from now,'' management lawyer Rob
Manfred said.
</P>
<P>
	   Braves pitchers and catchers are scheduled to report to spring training Feb.
17.
</P>
<P>
	   Former major league pitcher Scott Sanderson was the only other witness
called by the union. He testified on the effects of shortened spring training.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's before the arbitration panel. There's nothing more I can say,'' union
head Donald Fehr said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a very full day of testimony,'' Manfred said. ``It was eight
hours.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to Wednesday, the first day of the grievance hearing, there were
few protesters on the sidewalk outside baseball's offices.
</P>
<P>
	   Selig testified Wednesday on the rationale of his decision and was
questioned by union lawyer Gene Orza on what precedents he considered. Braves
president Stan Kasten also testified on the opening day along with an Atlanta
city councilman.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Hallinan, baseball's executive director of security, was management's
final witness Thursday and talk about the measures baseball took to protect
Rocker last September and October, when he got into verbal sparring with New
York fans.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker, razzed by Mets and Yankees fans during the pennant race and
postseason last year, told Sports Illustrated in December he would never play
for a New York team because he didn't want to ride a subway train ``next to some
queer with AIDS.'' He also mocked foreigners and called a Latin teammate a ``fat
monkey.''
</P>
<P>
	   Selig responded Jan. 31 by suspending him for all 45 days of spring training
and the first 28 days of the season, fining him $20,000 and ordering sensitivity
training. The players association, successful at overturning or shortening many
suspensions, then filed a grievance.
</P>
<P>
	   The union says the suspension was without ``just cause,'' arguing speech
shouldn't be punished, even if it's offensive.

<HEADLINE> News Council in Fight With Media  </HEADLINE>
   By HUNTER T. GEORGE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- Got a beef with the media?
</P>
<P>
	   Those upset with news organizations have traditionally written letters to
the editor or gone to court or maybe just muttered under their breath. In
Washington state, a privately funded council that handles complaints against
media outlets has marked an important step.
</P>
<P>
	   The first hearing for the Washington News Council will be Saturday. It
involves an Olympia man who says the local newspaper trashed his reputation.
</P>
<P>
	   The council has no regulatory authority and offers only bad publicity as
punishment for irresponsible journalism. But it promises to provide an impartial
forum.
</P>
<P>
	   Most media outlets are keeping their distance: The council's founder has
been a sharp critic of regional reporters and some journalists believe the
council is a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just another thing for foundations to put a bunch of money into so
people can sit around and ruminate,'' said Rowland Thompson, executive director
of Allied Daily Newspapers of Washington. ``It's pointless because it's not
going to change anybody's opinion of the media.''
</P>
<P>
	   The council's founder, former Seattle Times editorial writer John Hamer, has
heard the industry's concerns about his motivation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our mission is to help maintain public trust and confidence in the news
media by promoting and encouraging fair, accurate and balanced journalism,'' he
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a lot of good journalism out there. There is also some journalism
that falls short of the media's own standards.''
</P>
<P>
	   Approximately 30 news councils exist worldwide. Hamer modeled the 23-member
council her after a panel that has operated in Minnesota for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamer said the panel will not seek out bad journalism, but give citizens an
outlet to complain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We wait for the phone to ring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since its creation last summer, the council has received numerous inquiries,
but only one formal complaint, which requires a waiver of the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
	   The complaint was filed by Bernie Friedman, a failed candidate for the
Olympia City Council last year who said an editorial in The Olympian endorsing
his opponent was inaccurate, inflammatory and ``wrongly damaged his
reputation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Friedman, a law clerk for a state Supreme Court justice and a retired Air
Force lieutenant colonel, said he respects the newspaper's First Amendment right
to endorse a candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Oct. 21 editorial crossed the line by recounting an encounter
Friedman had at a city council meeting and calling it ``one example'' of his
lack of ``civic deportment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Friedman argued with the mayor and other council members after they declined
to hear his complaint that the city was overpaying private attorneys. The mayor
reportedly summoned the police.
</P>
<P>
	   Friedman said he rejected The Olympian's invitation to submit a guest column
because editors would not guarantee to run it unedited. He wants ``some public
rehabilitation'' of his reputation and assurances that The Olympian's
``monopoly'' on Thurston County news is kept in check by professional peers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My dream solution would be a Sunday editorial in The Olympian headlined
'We were wrong,' and then explaining the circumstances,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anything I write will appear to be self-serving and whiny. It just
wouldn't have the same effect. They caused the harm. It's up to them to cure
it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Olympian stands by its editorial and has declined to participate in the
hearing process. In letters sent to Friedman and the council, Executive Editor
Vickie Kilgore defended the editorial as accurate and balanced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mr. Friedman disagrees with our opinions,'' she wrote. ``He is entitled to
do that, but our opinion has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hamer has tried to structure the panel so that half the members have a media
background and the other half come from the general public.
</P>
<P>
	   The media half is stacked mostly with retired journalists since news
organizations have declined to participate. Seattle Times reporter Robert T.
Nelson is the only active daily newspaper journalist.
</P>
<P>
	   The council's ``public'' half includes former state Supreme Court Chief
Justice Robert Utter, former Seattle Mayor Wes Uhlman and William H. Gates, the
father of the Microsoft co-founder.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, the council plans to hear evidence from Friedman and consider
Kilgore's letters. The panel will ask questions and deliberate openly before
voting on whether to ``uphold'' the complaint.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not a trial,'' Hamer said. ``Our only power is a verdict in the
court of public opinion.''

<HEADLINE> JetBlue boasts low fares and deep pockets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - New Yorkers pay some of the nation's highest airfares
for in-state travel. Now, a new airline promises to change all that.
<P>
	   Besides lower fares, JetBlue Airways has deep pockets and something kids
will love - live cable TV.
</P>
<P>
	   The new discount carrier's first $79 flight from New York to Fort Lauderdale
was scheduled to take off today. The airline begins $49 flights to Buffalo a
week later. Prices are 30 to 65 percent below typical fares, which can cost $200
or more one-way between New York City and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   In a few weeks, JetBlue becomes the first airline to offer live transmission
of 24 cable channels, at your seat, from takeoff to landing. And this summer,
JetBlue will be the first airline at John F. Kennedy International Airport to
offer a shuttle bus directly from its terminal to a nearby Long Island Rail Road
station in Jamaica, Queens. From there it's a short train ride to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   But can JetBlue survive in an extremely tough industry? Of the 39 jet
carriers that began operation between 1989 and 1999, only 17 remain in business,
according to figures from the U.S. Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it's a matter of survival," JetBlue's founder David Neeleman
insisted at a news conference at Kennedy Airport Thursday. "We have the capital
to survive. We're going to be profitable within a year. Our costs are
significantly lower than the majors. ... When you use technology the way we do,
you can be efficient."
</P>
<P>
	   JetBlue claims to be the best-financed start-up in aviation history, with
$130 million in backing from billionaire George Soros and Chase Capital
Partners. The money has enabled Neeleman to buy all new Airbus jets, which cost
less to operate than older models. His 300 employees include stay-at-home moms
in his native state of Utah, who take reservations from home on laptop
computers, and airport staff wearing preppy blue polo shirts. Passengers can
also arrange their own ticketless travel through a Web site, www.jetblue.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he's a college drop-out, Neeleman has a heap of experience in his
industry. He helped found Morris Air, a Utah-based carrier that Southwest
Airlines bought for $129 million in 1993. He's also worked for WestJet, a
profitable Canadian discount carrier, and was CEO of Open Skies, a reservations
company now owned by Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Decota, aviation director for the Port Authority, which manages JFK,
said he has high hopes for JetBlue. "A lot of new airlines have tried to spring
up but a lot of them haven't been this well capitalized, haven't had the
management, haven't had the resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Southwest - a discount airline based in Texas - has also recently begun
service from New York, flying out of a small airport in Islip, Long Island. The
carrier plans to fly planes out of Albany beginning in May to four unannounced
destinations.
</P>
<P>
	   By the end of the year, Neeleman plans to add eight planes to JetBlue's
current two, and fly to Tampa, Fla., Burlington, Vt., and in New York, Rochester
and Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   JetBlue hopes to fly to another 38 cities over the next three years,
including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Indianapolis, Nashville, New
Orleans, Salt Lake City and Washington.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Trails at Buick Invitational  </HEADLINE>
    By BERNIE WILSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Even on the opening day of the Buick Invitational,
Tigermania was at full throttle. Too bad Tiger Woods wasn't.
</P>
<P>
	   Tiger was tired.
</P>
<P>
	   Drained from his dramatic comeback win at Pebble Beach on Monday that gave
him golf's longest winning streak in 52 years, and with no time off in between,
Woods appeared mortal on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   While fans in the huge gallery -- six deep in places -- strained to catch a
glimpse of Woods, his shots were erratic and his putting left him anything but
pleased. He shot a 1-over-par 71 on the Torrey Pines North Course, leaving him
six strokes behind Davis Love III.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods didn't even feel like going to the driving range to try to figure out
what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been grinding pretty hard lately," Woods said. "Maybe I'm just a
little tired and need a little rest."
</P>
<P>
	   The AT&AMP;T National Pro-Am at Pebble Beach was pushed back a day because of
rain, ending Monday with Woods' thrilling rally from seven strokes down with
seven holes to go.
</P>
<P>
	   With his sixth straight tour victory in hand, he headed to San Diego and was
on Torrey Pines North by 6:15 a.m. Tuesday for a practice round. Wednesday was
another early start, for a pro-am.
</P>
<P>
	   "You would think that the way I've been playing, I'd feel a little more
comfortable," Woods said. "That's just the way golf is sometimes."
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe Woods gave others an opening. Love took the lead with a 7-under 65 on
the tougher South Course, and Phil Mickelson excited his hometown fans with a 66
on the North.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tiger is forcing everybody to play at a whole other level," Mickelson said.
"Nobody has really done it yet. I think guys like Fred Couples (68), Davis Love
and myself are really trying to play at a different level, and hopefully have a
different winner on tour."
</P>
<P>
	   Then again, after making the cut by just two strokes at last year's Buick,
Woods roared back by playing 17-under the last two rounds to win the tournament
by two strokes over Billy Ray Brown, sinking an eagle putt on 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Or, as he proved Monday, he can even wait until the last nine.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a lot of holes to play," Woods said. "I proved that last year.
You can go out there and make it up on the weekend, or even tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods' streak is the longest since Ben Hogan also won six tour starts in
1948. Should Woods rally here, he'd be within four of tying Byron Nelson's
record of 11 in a row in 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's the guy to beat as long as he doesn't hurt himself," Love said after
playing the more difficult South Course. "He's been on a roll since high
school."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods hurt himself early, ripping his first drive into the right rough. He
saved par, but bogeyed his second and third holes to go 2-over, failing to hit a
fairway or a green in regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   When he made a 30-foot eagle putt on the 14th to get back to par, Woods gave
a tired-looking smile, raised his putter in the air and licked his finger to
chalk one up.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just didn't have it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Love, meanwhile, had an adventuresome round. He didn't record a par until
his 10th hole.
</P>
<P>
	   He sandwiched a 6-foot birdie around two bogeys, ran off three more birdies
before missing another green for bogey, and ended the front nine with two more
birdies.
</P>
<P>
	   On the par-4, 398-yard No. 14, he had to take an unplayable lie, hit his
third shot within 30 feet and made the putt.
</P>
<P>
	   Love and Mickelson are both former Buick winners. Woods, though, proved last
February that he can tame Torrey Pines.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods has finished lower than seventh only once since April.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's become an intimidating player," Love said. "You start wondering what
he's going to do, and you lose track of what you're doing. We saw that happen
last week."
</P>
<P>
	   DIVOTS: Woods didn't use his change of caddies as an excuse. He's letting
his high school friend, Bryon Bell, carry his bag this week, figuring he
deserves it since he also was on his bag during last year's Buick win. His
regular caddy, Steve Williams, took the week off to race cars in New Zealand.
"It's different, because obviously Stevie knows how I like to work. But so does
Bryon," Woods said. "We work well together. We've won a few tournaments together
and he's been there in some pretty intense, pressure-packed situations." ...
Along with making changes in his swing, Davis Love III went back to steel shafts
in his irons. Love started using graphite shafts in the Tour Championship, and
stuck with them until this week. He says he was hitting his irons too far.
"That's why you see graphite in metal woods, but not always in irons," he said.
... Woods had his favorite driver back in the bag on Thursday, the one with the
head that snapped off last Friday. Titleist had it repaired earlier in the week.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Marriage Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Married people rich and poor would get a tax relief
valentine under legislation passed by the House aimed at cutting income taxes by
$182 billion over 10 years. Among the beneficiaries would be 25 million couples
who now pay more than they would if they were single.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are doing here is providing relief for all married couples, but we
are accentuating the marriage tax penalty, which is wrong,'' said Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's vote, timed to coincide loosely with Valentine's Day next week,
was 268-158 to send the bill to the Senate. Although 48 Democrats joined all
Republicans in favor, it was short of the margin needed to override a possible
veto by President Clinton, who has complained about the bill's cost and timing.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Republicans said they were eager to push similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We look forward to righting this wrong,'' said Senate Finance Committee
Chairman William Roth, R-Del.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate passage is far from certain. Still, House GOP leaders trumpeted the
measure as the first in a series of tax cuts that would return a portion of
projected budget surpluses to taxpayers and limit the growth of government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need a tax code that doesn't punish married couples,'' said House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``They need to buy braces for the kids. They need
to buy insurance for the car and the home. They don't need the federal
government picking their pocket.''
</P>
<P>
	   Fixing the tax code's ``marriage penalty'' is a popular issue in this
election year, even if Republicans and Democrats disagree on how to do it. At a
Capitol Hill appearance, Clinton said ``We know we should do this'' -- but the
president wants marriage tax relief targeted more toward lower- and
middle-income taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Millions of couples who file joint tax returns are forced to pay taxes at
higher rates than they would if they were single and filing separately,
especially if each spouse earns roughly the same income. The penalty strikes
most frequently at income levels between $20,000 and $75,000 and costs couples
an average of $1,400 a year, according to congressional estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP bill would cut taxes for those couples as well as millions of others
who already get a marriage ``bonus,'' mainly those in which one spouse earns
most of the family income. It would gradually expand the bottom 15 percent tax
bracket to apply to more of a married couple's income, boost the standard
deduction in 2001 for married filers to twice that of singles and raise the
income cap to allow more lower-income couples to claim the earned income tax
credit.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats complained that half of the bill's total tax cut would go to
couples who already receive a bonus and would consume a large chunk of the
projected budget surplus before plans are laid to ensure the future solvency of
Social Security and Medicare, to pay down the national debt and to guarantee
adequate government spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republicans want to have a political gimmick for Valentine's Day,''
said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. ``If they just want a political issue, they've
got it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats also said two-thirds of the tax cuts would go to couples earning
more than $75,000 a year once it is fully phased in by 2008, and would entangle
some of them in the complex alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
	   But Republicans, who are pushing a series of tax cuts that were part of last
year's vetoed $792 billion, 10-year tax cut, said their marriage bill would help
stay-at-home mothers and couples who itemize their tax deductions such as
homeowners, unlike narrower marriage penalty bills proposed by Clinton and House
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   The political undercurrents of Thursday's vote were apparent on an issue
Republicans believe they can use against Democrats in the fall election in
competitive House districts. Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., recited how many married
taxpayers live in many Democratic districts during the debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You may be able to explain your opposition to them, but I sure can't,''
Weller said each time.
</P>
<P>
	   Passage of the Republican bill came after the House defeated by 233-192 a
Democratic alternative costing $95 billion over 10 years that was geared more
toward middle- and lower-income married couples.
</P>
<P>
	   That bill also would not have taken effect until Congress adopted a
``framework'' to guarantee Social Security and Medicare and to pay down the
national debt. Clinton, meanwhile, has proposed $45 billion in marriage penalty
relief, although his plan would not help couples who itemize and is focused on
those with dual incomes.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite their opposition to the GOP plan, Democrats were clearly wary of the
issue's potency. The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, told
reporters, ``There is a real good possibility we'll pass some form of marriage
penalty tax relief this year.''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> McCain's Challenge: Get Voters  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, S.C. (AP) -- Walter Lawson was named U.S. marshal by Lyndon B.
Johnson and has worked for Democratic Sen. Ernest Hollings, yet this
self-identified ``very Yellow Dog Democrat'' is mooning over a Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain is one helluva guy,'' Lawson says.
</P>
<P>
	   He may vote for McCain in the Feb. 19 Republican primary against national
front-runner George W. Bush. Whether or not Lawson and thousands of other
Democrats and independents turn out for the Arizona senator may determine the
race between McCain and Bush -- in this and other primary states.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting is open to non-Republicans in several upcoming GOP contests,
including South Carolina, Michigan, Virginia, North Dakota, Missouri and
Georgia. States with so-called closed primaries are reporting a flood of
inquiries from people hoping to switch their registration to Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many of them say they're doing it for McCain,'' said William F. Galvin,
secretary of state in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain thumped Bush in New Hampshire by securing a majority of GOP voters
and a virtual sweep of the state's large independent bloc. Bush's political team
vastly underestimated the independent turnout, in part because of an ill-advised
refusal to conduct tracking polls.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor's pollsters are hard at work in South Carolina trying to
gauge the impact of McCain's cross-party appeal. Bush himself has reshaped his
message to raise doubts about his rival's centerpiece pledge to reform politics.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain campaign, meanwhile, has identified 200,000 people with voting
histories that cross back and forth between party primaries. Those voters are
inundated with telephone calls and mail from the Arizonan's camp.
</P>
<P>
	   The mailings reads like traditional Democratic material, touting the need to
save Social Security and attacking tax cuts that ``mostly benefit the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's staff has also scoured voting records for Republicans who
participate in every general election but rarely, if ever, vote in primaries.
These ``casual Republicans'' are also being wooed by McCain organizers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're running a 1998 campaign in 2000 out of the Republican base like
Bush, you're in trouble,'' said Trey Walker, national field director for McCain.
``We're expanding the base and bringing Republicans back in.''
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls from the past two GOP primaries suggest that about a third of the
participants consider themselves independents or Democrats, fertile territory
for McCain. Thousands of new state residents are also prospects.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Republicans look to Bush to win because he has the support of the
establishment, but there are going to be a lot of veterans, Democrats and
independents voting in this primary,'' said Glen Broach, political science
professor at Winthrop University.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain will have a tougher time in South Carolina than in New Hampshire,
where registered independents outnumber both Republicans and Democrats. He has
fought Bush to a dead heat in polls here, yet the question remains: Will his
backers bother to vote?
</P>
<P>
	   ``I like McCain's knack for beating up the establishment,'' said former
Democratic state lawmaker Bill Houck, who has voted Republican a few times in
the past and will do so again Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't like Bush. I can't even put it into words but I'm voting for
McCain,'' said Mary Ham, 57, of Camden, another swing voter.
</P>
<P>
	   She lives along the I-20 corridor that roughly splits the state in half,
with Bush's conservative base to the north and McCain's independent-minded
voters to the south. In towns along the freeway, nonpartisan voters like Ham
could decide the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Lantz, 57, polished off a hot dog at a Camden diner, wiped a dab of
mustard from his lip and proclaimed McCain the best candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has a command of foreign policy. I don't think he'll pussyfoot
around,'' said Lantz, a military veteran who voted for President Clinton in 1996
and President Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Ham said she probably won't vote in the primary, and Lantz wasn't sure.
That's good news for Bush backers; they suspect that Democrats flirting with
McCain are inflating his polls numbers, and won't vote in the end.
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican officials have said they hope to attract as many as 400,000
voters, up from 278,000 in 1996. Bush's advisers believe they can beat McCain if
the turnout is 350,000 or lower because his voters are more likely to stay home.
</P>
<P>
	   The bottom line is McCain needs Democrats like Lawson to do more than sing
his praises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I told you I like the man,'' the LBJ appointee said. ``But I'm not sure
I'll vote in that (GOP) primary. I think it would cause me some local political
problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   It's the same story for one of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate
leader John Drummond, who announced Wednesday that he'll give money to McCain
and urge his pals to vote for the Arizonan.
</P>
<P>
	   And yet, Drummond said he won't give McCain what a candidate needs most: his
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it would be proper for me to register and vote for anybody
in that other primary,'' the Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of their anxiety, Bush backers are worried that Democratic
operatives will work to help McCain. When the Democratic National Committee
dispatched an opposition research specialist to the state, the Texan's advisers
assumed the Democrat was secretly turning out voters for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can overcome the normal Democratic crossover, but an organized effort
would concern me,'' Bush adviser Warren Tompkins said.
</P>
<P>
	   The wild cards in this election are voters like Naylor Smith, a hard-core
Democrat who plans to vote in the GOP primary because his party is not holding a
contest Feb. 19 and ``McCain seems like a fresh, hard-charging guy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pressing bricks into gray mortar poured along a Camden sidewalk, Smith
smiled wide and said, ``Besides, I could wreak havoc on them Republicans.''

<HEADLINE> Gibraltar's Head Faces Re-Election  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL WOOLLS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GIBRALTAR (AP) -- A young lawyer who has overseen Gibraltar's robust
economic growth while fending off Spanish claims of sovereignty won re-election
as the British colony's head of government.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Caruana, a 43-year-old conservative, garnered 54 percent of the vote
compared with 44 percent for his main rival, leftist Joe Bassano, according to
final results announced early Friday after an all-night manual tally of ballots
from Thursday's legislative election.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout in this quaint patch of Britain located at Spain's southern tip was
83 percent, down from more than 90 percent in the last election, held in 1996.
The electorate is 18,000 people out of a population of 27,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Caruana, whose title is chief minister, and Bossano, a 61-year-old
former union boss, have ruled out giving in to Spain's claims to the 2
1/2-square-mile chunk of limestone that looms over the isthmus that connect the
Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain in 1713 under the Treaty of Utrecht, but
now wants it back. Britain says it cannot give up the territory because the
majority of residents oppose joining Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   The territory largely controls its own internal affairs. Britain appoints a
governor and is responsible for defense and foreign affairs. Gibraltar is not
represented in the British Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Only one of the four candidates, Peter Cumming, favors any kind of
accommodation with Spain and he was running last in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruana main campaign theme was the island's vibrant economy, which has
virtually no unemployment, thanks in large part to Gibraltar's emergence as a
duty-free tourist mecca and offshore financial center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gibraltar is experiencing a breath of fresh air,'' Caruana said as he cast
his ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Bossano, who served two terms as chief minister until he was unseated by
Caruana four years ago, has accused the government of failing to share the
wealth with middle and lower-class residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the Gibraltar Senior Citizens Center on Thursday several voters
accused Caruana point-blank of catering to business interests and the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he is a bit of an actor,'' said Lisanne Davis, a 25-year-old
housewife. ``He promises many things but does not deliver.''

<HEADLINE> Government releases more money to New York to help poor pay heating  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - New York will receive an additional $34 million in
federal emergency funds to help low-income people deal with soaring heating oil
costs.
<P>
	   "We've gotten the message. We know there's a crisis in the Northeast. We
hear our people are hurting," Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration is releasing $130 million nationally, one-third
of it going to the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   New York received only $2.6 million in the Clinton administration's last
round of emergency fuel help last month. That was well below what state
officials had sought for the 1.4 million poor residents eligible for federal low
income assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   The spike in heating oil costs has struck particularly hard in New York,
which relies on heating oil more than any other state. Forty-three percent of
New York households use oil for heat. Of those 2.9 million households, nearly 80
percent are concentrated in the New York City metropolitan area, according to F.
William Valentino, president of the New York State Energy and Research and
Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   He said over the past three weeks retail heating oil prices have increased
by more than 75 cents per gallon to $2.02 per gallon on average statewide. In
the New York City area, prices are running $2.25 per gallon. Last year, the
price was 91 cents per gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   Valentino testified Thursday before the House International Relations
Committee hearing on the oil crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   At that hearing, Democratic and Republican lawmakers blasted the Clinton
administration for not taking the problem seriously enough. They also attacked
the administration for not putting enough pressure on oil-producing nations to
loosen their stranglehold on the supply.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil prices soared after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
cut the supply by 4.3 million barrels a day last year after a dip in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a matter of trying to get the OPEC nations to turn on the spigot and
let the market determine what the prices should be," said the committee's
chairman Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-Middletown.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices have also been pushed skyward by severe weather in the Northeast.
Frigid temperatures have forced consumers to use more oil and have clogged
waterways with ice making it more difficult for barges to deliver oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers on Thursday also questioned why the government had not released
oil from the emergency government stockpile to try to dampen prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said unless something was done to break OPEC's
stranglehold, gas prices would also soar this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richardson said the administration remains opposed to using the
strategic reserve to affect prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is this administration's view the markets should dictate prices,"
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richardson said a variety of measures would be taken to try to boost
heating oil production at Northeast refineries.
</P>
<P>
	   These include issuing temporary waivers at some refineries for compliance
with clean air laws, urging refiners to defer routine maintenance and lifting
waivers on the hours that truckers carrying heating oil may work, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson also said the U.S. Coast Guard was creating a task force to give
priority to heating oil shipments at terminals and the government was urging
utilities to switch from heating oil to natural gas in an effort to ease the
price crunch.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Co Sues Over 'Millionaire'  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The hit game show, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," is
apparently too generous for its insurer.
</P>
<P>
	   The company that insures the ABC show is suing to get out of its contract.
It claims the questions are too easy and is worried about paying out too much
money.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC says viewers shouldn't worry about the legal fight -- they're planning
no changes to the show.
</P>
<P>
	   The London-based insurance underwriters Goshawk Syndicate filed suit in
Britain's High Court of Justice on Jan. 24 against Buena Vista Entertainment
Inc., the show's producers.
</P>
<P>
	   In essence, Goshawk said it needed assurances that "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" would ask harder questions and select dumber contestants.
</P>
<P>
	   "Millionaire" has been the television sensation of the year, frequently
pulling in 30 million viewers a night and propelling ABC to the top of the
ratings. Host Regis Philbin's question -- "Is that your final answer?" -- has
become a national catchphrase.
</P>
<P>
	   Other television networks have quickly tried to imitate "Millionaire" with
mixed success.
</P>
<P>
	   Under its contract, Goshawk is required to pay out prize money to
contestants who win $500,000 or more on the show. There's a deductible of $1.5
million before Goshawk is required to pay and a ceiling of $5 million. That
means, for example, Goshawk would only be required to pay prizes to five winners
of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Reached in London on Thursday, a spokeswoman for Goshawk refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unquestionably, the integrity of the show is above reproach and nobody is
claiming otherwise," ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said. "This is simply a
dispute in which the company providing insurance is trying to get out of
coverage on the basis of a conversation it had with a broker."
</P>
<P>
	   Two "Millionaire" contestants -- an Internal Revenue Service agent from
Connecticut and a Miami attorney -- correctly answered 15 questions and won $1
million. No player on the original British version of the game show has ever won
the big prize.
</P>
<P>
	   Through 51 shows, there have also been three $500,000 winners. "Millionaire"
has given out a total of $9.3 million in prize money since it has been on the
air, according to ABC.
</P>
<P>
	   The multiple-choice questions are frequently easy in the early rounds. One
contestant was asked which condiment is also known as a Latin dance, correctly
choosing salsa over the other options: mustard, mayonnaise and relish.
</P>
<P>
	   They get harder as the stakes grow. The first million-dollar winner won by
correctly identifying the U.S. president to appear on the television show,
"Laugh-In" (Richard Nixon). The second had to know the distance between the
Earth and the sun (93 million miles).
</P>
<P>
	   Simply getting on the show can actually be harder than winning big money: it
requires potential contestants to successfully navigate a three-tier elimination
process where they are judged on speed and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
	   In the lawsuit, Goshawk said it needed "significant changes in the level of
control" to "reduce the unacceptable level of losses." Specifically, the
syndicate asked for changes in the method of contestant selection and the degree
of difficulty of the questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Since no changes were made since it first asked for them in late December,
Goshawk said that "substantial losses under the insurance are expected."
</P>
<P>
	   Hoover was not sure what the next step in the case would be.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if the show's producers were to lose the insurance, it wasn't likely to
affect ABC's commitment to the series. It now airs three nights a week, and
gives ABC bragging rights as the No. 1 network -- with the substantial
advertising revenue that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, ABC announced on Thursday that it was airing three more special
editions of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" during the February ratings
"sweeps."

<HEADLINE> Griffey Traded to Cincinnati Reds  </HEADLINE>
    By JOE KAY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. wanted to go home and didn't care if it
cost him a lot to get there.
</P>
<P>
	   Passing up the chance to get tens of millions of dollars more through free
agency in a year, Griffey agreed to a greatly reduced deal Thursday so he could
play for the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
	   Junior accepted $116.5 million for nine years, with most of the money
deferred until after he retires.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati sent four players to Seattle -- pitcher Brett Tomko, center
fielder Mike Cameron and two minor leaguers -- to complete one of baseball's
most remarkable trades ever.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In these times when big markets and big money seem to steal the stars, it
speaks so much of Ken's character that he has chosen instead to come back to
where he belongs,'' Reds owner Carl Lindner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of going to New York or another big city, Griffey figured he would
be happiest heading back to the place where he learned that sweet swing of his.
</P>
<P>
	   He used to run around the Reds clubhouse while his father, Ken Sr., helped
the Big Red Machine win championships in the 1970s. He wants his son to have the
chance to do the same thing in the very same clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Growing up, it was all about family,'' Griffey said. ``When the Reds won,
we ran in the locker room and took bats, gloves, balls and went out and did
whatever. When they lost, we were upset because we couldn't go see our dads and
get the bubble gum and the red pop and play.''
</P>
<P>
	   All across Cincinnati, giddy fans honked horns, hung up ``Welcome Home''
signs and acted like a long-lost member of the family had finally found his way
back.
</P>
<P>
	   After Griffey agreed to the new contract, he got on Lindner's plane in
Orlando, Fla., for a two-hour flight home to announce the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   He was surprised to see about 200 people at the airport when he landed, his
first hint of what was afoot. The city was reveling in the Reds' biggest trade
since they brought Pete Rose back as player-manager in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His name comes up like Pete Rose's name as far as Cincinnati,'' said coach
Ron Oester, a native who played for the Reds. ``That's the magnitude he's at for
Cincinnati fans.''
</P>
<P>
	   And for all of baseball, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Widely regarded as the best all-around player in the game, the 30-year-old
Griffey is considered a threat to break Hank Aaron's career home run record of
755. Griffey already has 398 and was voted onto baseball's All-Century team last
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   When he shows up for spring training in Sarasota, Fla., later this month,
the 10-time All-Star will wear his cap backwards as usual. This time, it will
have a wishbone ``C'' on it.
</P>
<P>
	   The thought left him nervous Thursday as he stood in front of a lectern that
overflowed with microphones.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm so happy to be here, and I really don't know what to say,'' he said.
``This is something you dream of as a little kid, and I finally did it. I'm
finally back in the hometown where I watched some of the great players play.''
</P>
<P>
	   He was Seattle's greatest player, but wanted to move closer to his current
home in Orlando when his contract expired after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
	   When he turned down a $148 million, eight-year extension offered by Seattle
last summer, he essentially forced the Mariners to trade him rather than let him
simply leave after 2000 as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
	   By rejecting a trade to the New York Mets and allowing the Mariners to
explore a deal only with Cincinnati, Griffey set up two months of often snagged
talks. His willingness to take a lot less in a long-term deal, expressed to the
club on Tuesday through agent Brian Goldberg, made it come about.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We would not have made this trade if we did not have the ability to sign
Mr. Griffey to a long-term contract because we did not want him for just one
year, to rent a player,'' general manager Jim Bowden said. ``We wanted a
permanent superstar in Cincinnati to open our new stadium (in 2003) and we
accomplished that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Mariners tried to make the best of a tough situation by getting the
Reds' starting center fielder in Cameron and a young starting pitcher, Tomko,
who struggled so badly last season that he was shipped to the minors and demoted
to the bullpen. They also received minor leaguers Antonio Perez and Jake Meyer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wouldn't know our new players if they walked in the room,'' president
Chuck Armstrong said. ``But I think we got four pretty good ballplayers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Mariners made Griffey the first overall pick in the 1987 draft. While he
developed into one of the game's best, the Mariners turned into a playoff team
in 1995 and moved into a new stadium last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hope that Ken decides to go into the Hall of Fame as a Mariner,''
Armstrong said. ``We might not have baseball here except for Ken, and we might
not have Safeco Field.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Cincinnati, Griffey will be reunited with his father, who is the bench
coach and a possible successor someday to Jack McKeon. McKeon was honored as the
NL manager of the year for leading the Reds to 96 wins last season, but got only
a one-year extension through 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Junior put in a plug for his father, who has never managed in the majors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's been around baseball for 20-plus years, he knows what it takes to be
a manager,'' he said. ``I hope he gets that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
	   It's unclear whether Griffey will get No. 24 in Cincinnati -- it was worn by
Tony Perez, who was voted into baseball's Hall of Fame last month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's one of the guys that I watched growing up,'' he said. ``He's one of
the guys that I admired as a kid. It's up to him. If he allows me to wear that
number, I'll wear it. I'm not going to be upset if he says no.''
</P>
<P>
	   He'll fit nicely into a lineup that already includes Sean Casey, Barry
Larkin and Dante Bichette. He'll also turn the NL Central into a home run derby
haven, teaming up with St. Louis' Mark McGwire and Chicago's Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of all, he'll be home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't matter how much money you make,'' he said. ``It's where you'll
be happy, and Cincinnati is the place I thought I'd be happy.''

<HEADLINE> Rocker Testifies Before Arbitrator  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bud Selig had his say, and so did John Rocker. Now it's up
to arbitrator Shyam Das to decide whether the suspension of the Atlanta Braves
reliever should be shortened.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker, suspended by Selig until May 1 and fined $20,000, testified Thursday
on the second and final day of his grievance hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Braves pitchers and catchers are scheduled to report to spring training at
Kissimmee, Fla., next Thursday, and it appears Rocker won't be there. Das'
decision is expected later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be no sooner than 10 days from now,'' management lawyer Rob
Manfred said.
</P>
<P>
	   Former major league pitcher Scott Sanderson was the only other witness
called by the union. He testified on the effects of shortened spring training.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's before the arbitration panel. There's nothing more I can say,'' union
head Donald Fehr said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a very full day of testimony,'' Manfred said. ``It was eight
hours.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to Wednesday, the first day of the grievance hearing, there were
few protesters on the sidewalk outside baseball's offices.
</P>
<P>
	   Selig testified Wednesday on the rationale of his decision, and the
commissioner was questioned by union lawyer Gene Orza on what precedents he
considered. Braves president Stan Kasten also testified on the opening day along
with an Atlanta city councilman.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Hallinan, baseball's executive director of security, was management's
final witness Thursday and talked about the measures baseball took to protect
Rocker last September and October, when he got into verbal sparring with New
York fans.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker, razzed by Mets and Yankees fans during the pennant race and
postseason last year, told Sports Illustrated in December he would never play
for a New York team because he didn't want to ride a subway train ``next to some
queer with AIDS.'' He also mocked foreigners and called a Latin teammate a ``fat
monkey.''
</P>
<P>
	   Selig responded Jan. 31 by suspending him for all 45 days of spring training
and the first 28 days of the season, fining him $20,000 and ordering sensitivity
training. The players association, successful at overturning or shortening many
suspensions, then filed a grievance.
</P>
<P>
	   The union says the suspension was without ``just cause,'' arguing speech
shouldn't be punished, even if it's offensive.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Link McCain to Democrats  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush plans to paint Sen. John McCain as a
do-nothing senator and draw strong links between McCain and Democrats, a top
campaign adviser told supporters during a private conference call.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign manager Joe Allbaugh told participants in the call Thursday that
Bush's sharper rhetoric this week, which has included holding up McCain as a
hypocrite on campaign finance reform, was intended to ``staunch the
hemorrhaging'' caused by the senator's win in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   According to four participants who described the call to The Associated
Press, Allbaugh said campaign polls show that Bush's more aggressive style ``was
having an effect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to next week, Allbaugh said Bush would portray McCain as a
career Washington politician with no major legislation to show for his 17 years
in Congress, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Allbaugh said Bush also will draw stronger links between McCain and
Democrats, highlighting the Arizona senator's alliance with Sen. Russell
Feingold, D-Wis., on campaign finance reform, McCain's support from unions in
Michigan and praise from Vice President Al Gore, participants said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those on the call included former Republican National Committee chairman
Haley Barbour, Bush adviser Charlie Black, and Bush administration lawyer C.
Boyden Gray, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   During the 3 p.m. call, which lasted about 20 minutes, participants
suggested finding a way to stop the Republican ``sniping'' at Bush's campaign
coming from ``inside the Beltway,'' according to the four participants who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Back on the telephone, Allbaugh assured those on the line that Bush's two
Capitol Hill chairman, Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., and Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.,
had received talking points every day to help fight off friendly fire, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahead of South Carolina's key Feb. 19 primary, a new American Research Group
poll showed a tight race with 46 percent of likely GOP voters polled supporting
Bush and 39 percent McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   As the conference call occurred, Bush already was using a new line of attack
on McCain in South Carolina, criticizing the senator for transferring $2 million
from his Senate campaign account to his presidential fund. Bush said he would
end that practice as president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor, noted that in a speech on the floor of the Senate
in 1990, McCain said rolling over money from one account to another was a
practice used to ``intimidate'' challengers and amounted to ``hypocrisy'' among
reformers.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said the senator was speaking in 1990 about
the practice of Senate incumbents building warchests to scare off challengers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think that anyone is intimidated by John McCain's fund-raising,''
Opinsky said.

<HEADLINE> Ventura May Leave Reform Party  </HEADLINE>
   By ROCHELLE OLSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura shocked the nation when he became
the country's first Reform Party governor, but he now wants to drop all ties to
the party and maybe set up a new organization, officials close to him say.
</P>
<P>
	   He scheduled a news conference today at the governor's residence on
``national politics.'' Ventura is expected to condemn discord in the national
party, urge the Minnesota Reform Party to leave and possibly set up a new
organization -- perhaps called the Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to focus on a new direction for the Minnesota party, and we've
been too distracted with the national party politics,'' said Minnesota party
Chairman Rick McCluhan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Minnesota Reform Party central committee plans a meeting Saturday at the
Capitol to consider breaking with the national organization. The matter would
have to go to a vote of 300 state convention delegates. Such a vote would clear
the way for the state party and Ventura to officially sever ties with the
national Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura's spokesman John Wodele refused to confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
	   For months, Ventura has expressed displeasure with the direction of the
national Reform Party's presidential contest. Ventura, a liberal on social
issues, doesn't like Pat Buchanan, the conservative former Republican now
seeking the Reform nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura has been more interested in Donald Trump, who also has expressed
disgust with the national organization. Trump now is considering running for
president under Ventura's new party banner, according to a knowledgeable
official who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The official said Trump and Ventura discussed the possibility of a
Ventura-Trump ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Trump has talked of running for president, he has indicated no
interest in the No. 2 spot. He is to announce his plans next week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The speculation is getting almost irresponsible,'' Wodele said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCluhan shot down the possibility of a Ventura-Trump ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The governor is not going to run for president or vice president,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura has never been warm to the national Reform Party. Founder Ross Perot
provided no help in Ventura's 1998 win, and the Ventura and Perot factions of
the party have consistently disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Even as governor, Ventura has never shown much interest in building the
Minnesota or the national Reform parties. Carleton College political science
professor Steven Schier doesn't think he would work very hard at building a new
party, either.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's not a party person at all. He's a Jesse person. He is the head of a
political party of one,'' Schier said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Schier calls Ventura the ``face'' of the party nationwide and believes a
departure would be a blow to party recruitment and organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Gerry Moan, vice president of the Reform Party's national committee and a
Perot loyalist, dismissed the significance of a departure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been here before him and we'll be here long after him. ... A lot of
people are tired of that kind of act,'' Moan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Party infighting flared over the location of the nominating convention in
August. Ventura's faction wants it in St. Paul, while Perot's faction insists on
Long Beach, Calif. The two sides have signed contracts, put down deposits and
fought in court.
</P>
<P>
	   The sides also split over whom to support for president. Buchanan drifted
toward Perot's faction. Ventura supported Trump.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura's announcement was scheduled a day before Perot's group was to meet
in Nashville, Tenn., in an effort to oust National Chairman Jack Gargan, who is
aligned with the governor. Gargan says the meeting is illegal under party rules
and won't count.
</P>
<P>
	   The party still could have a significant impact in this year's presidential
election, since its nominee will receive $12.6 million in federal campaign
funds.

<HEADLINE> Hijacking Leads to Asylum Questions  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- After nearly half the freed hostages from an Afghan jet
hijacking sought asylum in Britain, the government is taking a tough stance to
show that seizing a plane is not the way to win refuge.
</P>
<P>
	   After the four-day hijacking, hostages spent their first night of freedom at
a four-star airport Hilton Hotel, but Britain's top law enforcement official
warned the 74 asylum-seekers among them not to get too comfortable.
</P>
<P>
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw told legislators Thursday Britain would try to
deport them, if the law allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I personally will make the determination of any application for asylum
made by persons on board this aircraft,'' said Straw, who is responsible for law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Subject to compliance with all legal requirements, I would wish to see
removed from this country all those on the plane as soon as reasonably
practicable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw's stance was backed by Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose spokesman said
a clear signal must be sent out that hijacking was not the way to obtain asylum
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Amnesty International urged the government to consider Afghanistan's poor
record on human rights, which it said included the disappearance of political
opponents, massacres and punishments including floggings, amputations and
executions.
</P>
<P>
	   But opposition politicians in Britain suggested the hijackers had been
attracted to Britain by a reputation for lenience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why the United Kingdom? How many European Convention on Human Rights
signatories did that plane fly over on its journey from Moscow to the U.K.?''
Conservative Party lawmaker Anne Widdecombe said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostages, who police described as being in ``remarkably good health,''
were transferred to the hotel after the crisis ended peacefully before sunrise
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   At 3:50 a.m., about 85 captives -- mostly women and 21 children -- streamed
down the aircraft's rear stairs. The rest, including the hijackers, filed down
the stairs two hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested 21 people on board in connection with the hijacking on
Thursday and another man early today. Only 70 of the former hostages said they
wanted to return home.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers had taken over the Ariana 727 jet early Sunday during what
should have been a short domestic flight from the Afghan capital of Kabul to the
northern town of Mazar-e-Sharif. It stopped over in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and
Russia, before reaching Stansted, 25 miles north of London.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout tense negotiations with Essex police, the hijackers never gave a
clear explanation of their aims, said David Stevens, chief constable of Essex
County police.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It became clear in the last hour of the negotiations that they were
expressing concern about the political situation in Afghanistan,'' he said.
``For the first 75 hours, they didn't talk about the political situation at
all.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens anticipated a long process of interviewing all the people aboard the
aircraft, mainly through translators, to build a case.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain received 3,975 applications for asylum from Afghan citizens last
year, out of a total of 71,160 from all countries, the Home Office said. In
1998, 35 Afghans were granted refugee status and 1,500 others given permission
to remain in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-line Taliban government in Afghanistan thanked British authorities
for ending the hijacking safely, and asked that the plane -- one of only nine in
state-run Ariana Airline's aging fleet -- and its passengers be returned.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Tangling on Abortion  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, under fire for old pro-gun votes
and bracing for another round of questions about his past anti-abortion record,
angrily accused Bill Bradley of trying to drive a wedge between Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For far too long some politicians have been willing to play with the issue
of choice for their own personal political ambition,'' Gore howled late Thursday
at a Beverly Hills campaign fund-raiser organized by women activists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So I say to Sen. Bradley: Stop trying to divide us on the issue of choice.
It's time to join hands and fight the real enemy'' in the Republican party, Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore read from notecards what amounted to his most extensive public
explanation to date of his anti-choice positions as a congressman from
Tennessee. It was a pre-emptive strike against Bradley, who was heading to
Seattle today to hammer some more at questions of whether abortion rights is a
core value for Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I respect people who have a right-to-life position,'' Bradley said
Thursday in a televised interview. ''... But it's important when you make that
kind of change on an issue of such fundamental principle that you explain why
you made that change, what was the journey.''
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Gore was receiving an endorsement from the Human Rights Campaign, the
nation's largest gay and lesbian rights group, representing 350,000 members.
Both Bradley and Gore courted the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey who is trying to build a
comeback in the Democratic primary fight after defeats in Iowa, New Hampshire
and Delaware, was able to narrow Gore's edge with women in New Hampshire by
highlighting his past views on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Bradley and Gore now defend a woman's right to an abortion, but Bradley
has forced Gore to concede that ``my position has changed'' since his days in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, speaking to a backyard gathering that anted up about $200,000 for his
campaign, conceded again Thursday that he once wrestled with the question of
using public funds to pay for abortions through Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Since then, I have come to believe that because poor women deserve the
same constitutional right to safe, legal abortions that more affluent women
have, they need Medicaid funding so they can make that decision for
themselves,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stories from women about the circumstances in which abortions are sought so
changed his mind on abortion, Gore said, that ``it is impossible for me to now
imagine anyone making that choice except for the woman who is involved.''
</P>
<P>
	   Washington state, where Bradley was campaigning today, has the West's second
largest bloc of delegates to the Democratic National Convention, after
California. It is one of 16 states, plus American Samoa, that will hold
primaries and caucuses March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,300 delegate votes will be up for grabs that day, about 60
percent of the 2,169 needed to win the Democratic nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that we're going to win on March 7 and go on from there,'' Bradley
said on ``Hardball with Chris Matthews'' on MSNBC. ``I think that we're going to
be able to draw the difference between who's the real Democrat in this race.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Los Angeles on Thursday, Bradley stood with parents of children killed by
guns and accused Gore of coming late to gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not an issue that I came to after seeing television pictures of
Columbine,'' Bradley said. ``This is an issue that I believed as a matter of
fundamental principle throughout my public life.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have always supported common-sense gun control. Al Gore has not always
done that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore voted against a 1990 bill to expand a federal ban on assault weapons
and his campaign proposals this year would only register new handguns -- not 60
million existing weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley wants to register and license all handguns and their owners, an idea
Gore has dismissed as impractical.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The essence of leadership is to take on that which is considered too hard
to do and make it happen,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   On MSNBC, Bradley also said he is not happy to see President Clinton back on
the trail raising money for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's got to be some restraint here,'' said Bradley, an advocate of
campaign finance reform. ``How can you be for eliminating soft money and be
participating in the process of raising it?''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, in the final year of his presidency, will raise millions for the
Democratic National Committee by attending four or five events a month for the
next three months.
</P>
<P>
	   The money may fund ``issue ads'' -- certain to promote Gore's agenda --
later this year, DNC spokeswoman Jenny Backus said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore will only swear off soft money if Republicans do too, said spokesman
Doug Hattaway. ``Unlike Bill Bradley, Al Gore feels an obligation as leader of
the Democratic Party to help the party raise funds.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Stars in New Bill Bradley Ad  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Jordan is putting his famous name behind Bill
Bradley, but it's unclear whether the man who makes millions selling sneakers
will be as successful pitching politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley hopes Jordan's endorsement will jump start his campaign in time for
the March 7 round of primaries that are critical to Bradley's effort to win the
Democratic presidential nomination. An ad Jordan taped two months ago will begin
airing today in more than a dozen states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's time for us to believe in something that will give every American an
opportunity to succeed, and be viewed equally,'' Jordan says, speaking directly
to the camera. ``That's why I'm supporting Bill Bradley for president. Shouldn't
you?''
</P>
<P>
	   Marketing experts suggest it might be tougher for Jordan to sell a
politician than a sports shoe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Can Michael Jordan sell Bill Bradley to America? No endorser can -- not
even Jordan, not even Babe Ruth,'' said Brian Murphy, editor of Sports Marketing
Letter, which covers the business of sports.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign would not give specifics, but said the ad would air in
some of the 16 states holding primaries on March 7, which include California and
New York. Bradley lost to Vice President Al Gore in Iowa and New Hampshire and
must do better in the upcoming primaries to maintain the viability of his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, a former star for the New York Knicks, already has collected
endorsements and cash from his basketball buddies. But the new Jordan ad may be
the most prized dividend from his days on the hard court as he seeks the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan and Bradley are friends, and that persuaded the sports icon to make
his first foray into politics, the campaign said. Jordan and his wife each have
donated the maximum $1,000 to Bradley's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've known him for a long while,'' Bradley said Thursday on MSNBC ``I'm
very pleased that he's a part of our effort. I think that he adds a certain
excellence to it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign professed no fear.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got Shaquille O'Neal. He's bigger,'' said spokesman Chris Lehane,
referring to the Los Angeles Lakers center.
</P>
<P>
	   The 30-second spot shows Jordan discussing issues that matter to him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know the kind of America I want for my children,'' Jordan says. ``It's a
place where every family has good health and no family suffers the tragedy of
gun violence. It's a place where every child has a bright future, and where skin
color or eye shape doesn't matter anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Justice Department to help implement "reentry courts" for  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The obstacles faced by ex-prisoners reentering society
are one of the most pressing problems faced by the nation, said Attorney General
Janet Reno.
<P>
	   "This problem has received too little attention for too long," Reno told
about 600 people Thursday at Manhattan's John Jay College of Criminal Justice,
of City University of New York. She added that the Justice Department would help
implement new "re-entry courts" so that fewer people end up back in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The new initiative uses judicial authority to more closely monitor released
offenders and provide support for the offenders' reintegration into the
community. The Justice Department will help re-entry court programs in
California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, New York, Ohio and West
Virginia, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Too often, offenders leave prison and return to the community without
necessary supervision, jobs and housing," she said. "The re-entry court would
promote positive behavior by linking released offenders to agencies and
community organizations that provide these services, while also using its powers
of punishment to be sure the individual stays on the right track."
</P>
<P>
	   Support for the initiatives comes as the nation's prisons grapple with a
record number of prisoners - and of offenders up for release. There are now 1.2
million people in federal and state prisons, compared to 320,000 in 1989. This
year, 585,000 prisoners are expected to return to society, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two-thirds of the nation's released offenders are rearrested within three
years of their release, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno said the nine states participating in the program will tailor their
re-entry courts to state laws and local needs, but all programs will include:
</P>
<P>
	   - Offender assessment and planning, which will bring together re-entry court
personnel such as a judge, parole or probation officer, to explain the re-entry
process to the prisoner and identify his/her needs upon release.
</P>
<P>
	   - Active offender oversight, which would include routine judicial visits
with all offenders.
</P>
<P>
	   - Accountability to the community, to include the development of initiatives
to ensure that offenders are held accountable both to victims and the community.
</P>
<P>
	   - A predetermined range of sanctions for violations of the conditions of
release that can be swiftly, predictably and universally applied.
</P>
<P>
	   - Access to an array of support services including substance abuse
treatment, job training programs, private employers, faith-based institutions,
housing services and community service providers.
</P>
<P>
	   - Rewards for successful offender behavior and compliance with the
conditions of release.
</P>
<P>
	   There are now no specific funds for the re-entry court program, but Reno
said the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs will work closely with
each area to see how existing federal, state or local resources can be used to
support the programs. President Clinton has requested $60 million in the 2001
budget to expand offender re-entry initiatives, she said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Has Edge Over McCain  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are paying more attention to the presidential
campaign in the wake of the New Hampshire primary and Gov. George W. Bush's
campaign is trying to capitalize in South Carolina by giving voters a different
view of rival Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign has flooded the airwaves and phone lines in the state with
messages about McCain as a Washington insider whose campaign finance plans would
help Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   And Bush has gained an edge in South Carolina as Republicans shifted away
from McCain, whose negative ratings crept up, said a poll out Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Research Group poll indicated Bush had 46 percent, McCain 39
percent and Alan Keyes had 7 percent support in the state, with 8 percent
undecided. The poll of 600 likely voters in the Republican primary was taken
Monday through Wednesday and has an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
	   An ARG poll taken right after the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1 showed McCain
with 45 percent and Bush with 42 percent, a race too close to call. South
Carolina's primary is Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's support among Republicans dropped and his unfavorable rating crept
up from 4 percent to 15 percent. Likely Republican voters cited advertising and
telephone calls providing negative information about McCain as reasons for
switching from McCain to Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Quinnipiac poll Thursday, McCain continued to close the gap in New
York. Bush led McCain 44 percent to 37 percent. Before New Hampshire Bush had a
20-point lead over McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Democrats, Vice President Al Gore had a double-digit lead in the
Quinnipiac poll, 56 percent to 32 percent, over former Sen. Bill Bradley. They
were virtually tied last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a national poll of voter interest indicates Americans started
tuning in to the presidential campaigns after New Hampshire, with about
three-fourths of people saying they're paying at least some attention.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a fourth said they were paying a ``great deal'' or ``quite a bit''
of attention to the campaigns in the days after the primary. Fewer than a fourth
said they paid no attention at all. In earlier weeks, four out of 10 in polls
for the Vanishing Voter project said they were paying no attention to the
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   During the period right after the primary, 33 percent of Americans said they
had discussed the campaign during the past day with another person. That's
double the average rate of people talking about the campaign in previous polls
by the Vanishing Voter Project, which is run by the Shorenstein Center on the
Press, Politics and Public Policy. The poll was taken Feb. 2-6 of 1,012 adults
and has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Quinnipiac poll of 481 Democrats and 357 Republicans in New York was
taken Sunday through Wednesday and has an error margin of plus or minus 4.5
percentage points for the Democrats and 5 percentage points for the Republicans.

House Passes Marriage Tax Cut
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Married people rich and poor would get a tax relief
valentine under legislation passed by the House aimed at cutting income taxes by
$182 billion over 10 years. Among the beneficiaries would be 25 million couples
who now pay more than they would if they were single. "What we are doing here is
providing relief for all married couples, but we are accentuating the marriage
tax penalty, which is wrong," said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee. Thursday's vote, timed to coincide loosely with
Valentine's Day next week, was 268-158 to send the bill to the Senate.

the conclusion of a study published today in the journal Science on the effects

Hijacking Leads to Asylum Questions

show that seizing a plane is not the way to win refuge. After the four-day
hijacking, hostages spent their first night of freedom at a four-star airport
Hilton Hotel, but Britain's top law enforcement official warned the 74
asylum-seekers among them not to get too comfortable. Home Secretary Jack Straw
told legislators Thursday Britain would try to deport them, if the law allowed.

<HEADLINE> Budget cut could put dog tracks in danger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A small item in Gov. John G. Rowland's state
budget plan could mean financial trouble for the state's two dog tracks.
<P>
	   Rowland wants to cut nearly $500,000 in funding that pays for urine testing
on racing dogs.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug tests, which are conducted at the University of Connecticut Health
Center, are mandated by the state to ensure bettors that races are fair.
</P>
<P>
	   The general manager of the Shoreline Star Park in Bridgeport said assuming
the cost of the tests would be a serious blow to the park, which is trying to
emerge from a 1996 bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
	   "It certainly puts a very dark cloud over things," Shoreline Star General
Manager Steve Alford said Thursday. He said the park has managed to run near the
break-even point since the bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   Shoreline Star is open seasonally, running seven shows a week from
May-October, and would be responsible for roughly one-third of the funding,
Alford said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's other park, the Plainfield Greyhound Park, which is open
year-round would be responsible for the remaining costs. That track runs up to
nine shows a week. Officials there have refused to comment on the possible loss
of state funds.
</P>
<P>
	   But State Rep. Michael Caron, R-Danielson, said it would be a serious
financial blow to the park.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're reeling from it," he said. "I just don't understand the motivation
for this, and they don't deserve it."
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Rotunda, a spokesman for the state Department of Special Revenue,
which oversees gaming in the state, said the department supports the cut in
funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Alford said the proposal came as a surprise, since the Legislature voted
down a similar measure last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was an issue last year and the discussion worked in our favor," Alford
said. "It wasn't with the understanding it was going to come up each year."

<HEADLINE> China Judge Put in Mental Hospital  </HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES HUTZLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- A judge in southern China has been put in a psychiatric
hospital and forced to take narcotics for refusing to renounce his belief in the
banned Falun Gong spiritual movement, a rights group said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The case of Huang Jinchun is the latest troubling sign that the communist
government is using mental institutions to punish political or religious
dissenters.
</P>
<P>
	   Huang displayed no symptoms of mental illness either at work or after being
sent to the hospital nearly three months ago, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported, citing former
colleagues and nurses.
</P>
<P>
	   But at the Longqianshan Psychiatric Hospital in the southern Guangxi region,
medical personnel gave Huang daily injections of a narcotic that left him sleepy
and muddled, after he refused to stop practicing Falun Gong, the rights group
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The doctors and nurses made fun of me: 'Aren't you practicing Falun Gong?
Let us see which is stronger, Falun Gong or our medicines?''' Huang related in
an appeal posted earlier this week on an overseas Falun Gong Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   The accounts could not be independently verified. Government, court and
hospital administrative offices and courts were closed today for the Lunar New
Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hospital authorities allowed Huang to go home Feb. 4 for a 10-day stay over
the holiday, and he is being kept under close surveillance, the Information
Center said.
</P>
<P>
	   His case underscores both how popular Falun Gong became even among educated
officials the Communist Party entrusts to carry out policy and how desperate the
government has become in trying to eradicate the sect's influence.
</P>
<P>
	   Founded by an ex-government grain clerk in 1992, Falun Gong attracted
millions of followers with its mix of slow-motion meditation exercises, Buddhist
and Taoist cosmology and message of moral living.
</P>
<P>
	   Fearful of the group's popularity and its ability to mobilize thousands of
followers for protests, Chinese leaders banned the group 6 1/2 months ago as a
menace to public order and party rule. Protests persist despite a crackdown that
has seen thousands sent to labor camps and top group leaders sentenced to prison
terms of up to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Huang, a judge in the civil trials division of the Intermediate People's
Court in Beihai, left the busy port city on the Tonkin Gulf last September to
join hundreds of fellow Falun Gong practitioners protesting the ban in Beijing,
the Information Center said.
</P>
<P>
	   Arrested in Beijing, Huang was sent back to Beihai and detained for 15 days,
according to his own account. It said the court fired him on Nov. 8 for refusing
to sever his ties with Falun Gong and a week later two police took him from his
home to the Longqianshan hospital in Liuzhou city, 180 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
	   The Information Center described Longqianshan as a the biggest mental
institution in Guangxi region, holding hundreds of patients and managed in the
style of a prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Police returned a veteran political dissident, Wang Wanxing, to a
psychiatric hospital outside Beijing in November after he threatened to tell
foreign reporters about his seven years confinement there.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, about 50 Falun Gong members were taken to a different mental
institution outside Beijing and held for six weeks. Recently released, some have
said they were not treated as psychiatric patients but were subjected to the
same mistreatment Falun Gong followers have received in other police detention
centers.

<HEADLINE> McCain Holds Internet Chat  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Republican Sen. John McCain is reaching into
cyberspace for what he calls an unprecedented presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain chatted Thursday on the Internet in real time via satellite video to
500 people who paid $100 each to watch and send in questions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even more impressive than the money is the way we communicate,'' he said
from the College of Charleston. ``We can communicate with somebody eight to 10
times a day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, McCain beamed his image into a Washington fund-raiser and 17 other
locations where corporate lobbyists helped raise as much as $500,000 for his
presidential bid. They are the same lobbyists who press McCain's Senate Commerce
Committee to act on legislation that affects their corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is campaigning in South Carolina for the Feb. 19 Republican primary.
He is headed to New York and New Jersey today for more fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator is running on a pledge to change the way campaigns are
financed, but he finds himself having to use the system he criticizes to fund
his presidential bid. The events have given ammunition to his rival, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said the Internet has helped him connect with younger voters and
people who don't normally participate in politics. His Web site,
www.mccain2000.com, has raised more than $4 million and has recruited thousands
of volunteers. McCain said Intel Corp. Chairman Andy Grove was one of the
volunteers who sent an e-mail to sign up.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura credits the Internet with his election win in
1998. He raised $70,000 from his Web site. McCain said he sent advisers to visit
Ventura and borrow his playbook.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain fielded participants' questions selected by his wife Cindy about the
environment, Internet taxes and patriotism. Before the cyberchat, McCain was
asked about his fear of Bush hackers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if any of them have that sophistication level,'' McCain
joked.
</P>
<P>
	   Computer glitches occurred only in a room where reporters were viewing the
event, McCain's aides said. A computer was knocked off line and was unable to
broadcast for several minutes. The images of McCain and his wife also were jumpy
and at times froze.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Washington fund-raiser, many guests wore red, white, and blue
stickers printed by McCain's campaign, that said ``McCain voted against my
bill.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's to make the point that there is no quid pro quo,'' said McCain
spokeswoman Nancy Ives.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain himself, asked earlier in the day about the propriety of raising
money from the lobbyists, said, ``They are supporting my candidacy because
they're sick and tired of the system in Washington today.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the contributions ``are in keeping with the reforms I want to
make.''
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of overhauling the campaign finance laws point out that McCain is
complying with the provisions of the legislation he has championed in the
Senate. The bill, co-sponsored with Democratic Sen. Russell Feingold of
Wisconsin, would ban ``soft money,'' the unregulated corporate, union and
individual contributions to political parties.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has pledged not to let the Republican Party spend soft money to help
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bottom line is he's against soft money and he's not raising soft
money,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who has sponsored similar
legislation in the House. ``Does he have to raise money to run a campaign? The
answer is yes. Is he abiding by his legislation? Yes. That's the important
thing.''

<HEADLINE> Alcohol-Brain Cell Link Found  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL RECER AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Laboratory studies suggest that a single drinking binge
by a pregnant woman can damage for life the brain of her unborn child.
</P>
<P>
	   That's the conclusion of a study published today in the journal Science on
the effects of alcohol on the very young.
</P>
<P>
	   The conclusion is based on a study conducted on laboratory rats, but experts
said the work helps to explain why children born to drinking mothers can suffer
learning disabilities, memory loss and other brain disorders.
</P>
<P>
	   The study indicates that rats, and presumably humans, are highly susceptible
to alcohol-related neurological damage when developing brain cells are furiously
building the connections needed for memory, learning and thought. In humans,
this period of rapid brain development starts in the sixth month of gestation
and continues for two years after birth. In rats, it comes in the two weeks
after birth.
</P>
<P>
	   "We call this a brain-growth spurt period," said Dr. John W. Olney, a
Washington University School of Medicine researcher and senior author of the
study.
</P>
<P>
	   During this spurt, said Olney, a single prolonged contact with alcohol --
lasting for four hours or more -- is enough to kill vast numbers of brain cells.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a massive wave of cell suicide after the brain is exposed to
ethanol (alcohol)," said Olney. "The cells die by the millions and millions."
</P>
<P>
	   During the brain's growth spurt, called synaptogenesis, brain cells must
receive a balanced signal from two types of neurotransmitter chemicals,
glutamate and GABA, he said. If this signal is disrupted, the developing brain
cells are programmed to commit suicide. This is the body's way of eliminating
surplus cells.
</P>
<P>
	   But, based on the rat studies, alcohol severely disrupts the glutamate-GABA
signals and this, in turn, causes nerve cell suicide at about 15 times the
normal rate, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Neuron cells that normally die during brain development are about 1.5
percent of the total, but in rat pups exposed to alcohol just days after birth,
said Olney, the dead neurons ranged from 5 to 30 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our study showed that it only requires one round of intoxication of about
four hours for this to occur," said Olney.
</P>
<P>
	   The "binge" used in the study gave the rats a blood alcohol level of .20, or
200 milligrams of alcohol per deciliter of blood. Such a level in people is
twice the legal standard of drunkenness in many states.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. David Lovinger of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine said in
Science that the study carries a powerful message: Drinking in late pregnancy
"is really unsafe for the brain."
</P>
<P>
	   A 1996 study by the Institute of Medicine showed that about 20 percent of
women who drink do not stop during pregnancy. About one in every 1,000 babies
born in the United States suffers from fetal alcohol syndrome, a disorder caused
by exposure to alcohol in the womb. The disorder can cause stunted growth, along
with memory and learning problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Olney said pregnant women need not be anxious about past, moderate alcohol
drinking.
</P>
<P>
	   "One glass of wine at dinner is unlikely to cause the damage, but we cannot
say that any added intake would be safe," he said. "The most prudent policy
would be to have no alcohol during pregnancy."
</P>
<P>
	   The connection between brain cell death and disruption of the glutamate-GABA
signals also prompts concern about common drugs used on children, said Olney.
</P>
<P>
	   Most anesthesia drugs in pediatric surgery, he said, disrupt either
glutamate or GABA in the brain. This means that surgery using these drugs might
increase the risk of brain damage for children under the age of two.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be important to carefully reevaluate how these drugs are used in
pediatric medicine," said Olney. He suggested the need for studies to establish
safety guidelines for use of these drugs on young children.
</P>
<P>
	   University of Colorado Health Sciences researcher Boris Tabakoff agreed on
the need to evaluate the anesthesia drugs used in young children.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this study is correct," Tabakoff said in Science, "one might need to
reassess their safety in (infants) while the brain is still developing."

<HEADLINE> Candidates on the Issues  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press picks an issue and asks the
presidential candidates a question about it. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Libya:
</P>
<P>
	   Now that Libya has surrendered for trial two suspects in the Pan Am 103
bombing, expelled a Palestinian terrorist group and voiced support for the
Middle East peace process, should the United States take steps to resume
diplomatic and trade ties?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``I welcome Libya's apparent cooperation with the Pan Am 103
trial and other recent positive actions. However, these are overdue and cannot
compensate for the pain and suffering Moammar Gadhafi has caused. Given
Gadhafi's history of support for terrorism, we should not ease the pressure on
him until and unless Libya is cleared of responsibility for the Pan Am 103
bombing and has consistently repudiated its support for terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``Although the government of Libya has taken an important positive
step away from its support of terrorism by surrendering the Lockerbie suspects,
I remain concerned at the country's potential to interfere with the national
security and foreign policy interests of the U.S. As president, I will continue
to encourage Libya to completely cease its support of terrorism and block its
efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``Among my first acts as president will be to declare an end
to all sanctions on the sale or transfer of U.S. food, medicine, or goods
essential to a decent life or a civilian economy now in force against Cuba,
North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Myanmar, Sudan, and all the other targeted
nations of U.S. sanctions policy. There are other ways to punish rogue regimes.
We can seize the bank accounts and overseas assets of their rulers, deny visas
to their diplomats and military, cut off World Bank and IMF loans, deny
Export-Import Bank credits, put tariffs on the principal exports of hostile
governments to deny them the hard currency to strengthen the state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``Libya has for 30 years been one of the most hostile regimes
in the world. Gadhafi is responsible for terrorist attacks that have taken the
life of U.S. servicemen. Libya must compensate victims of the Pan Am 103
bombing, cooperate with the trial of the two suspects, and cease all support of
terrorist organizations. Moreover, concrete steps of support beyond easily
reversed suggestions of being less hostile to the nation of Israel's right to
exist will also be required. As Libya remained a staunch opponent of the peace
process throughout the 1990s, the burden is on Tripoli to demonstrate a true
transformation in its approach to Middle East peace talks. These are the actions
Libya must take before improved or normal diplomatic ties could be restored.''

<HEADLINE> Community Centers Criticized  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After-school isn't all fun and games for Chantal Cotton,
a 13-year-old eighth-grader from Flint, Mich. At her federally funded community
learning center, tutoring comes first.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Then we have recreation,'' the youngster explained to House members
concerned that the centers focus more on baby-sitting young children than
providing a range of training and activities for children, adults and senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the kids want to do recreation, they have to do something educational
first,'' she said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Five years ago, Congress created a nationwide program of after-school
learning centers that were intended to bolster the technology, literacy and
other skills of poor inner city and rural residents.
</P>
<P>
	   But critics contend the Education Department undermines the broader-based
goals of the program by directing grant money to elementary and middle schools
rather than high schools and community organizations that could serve older
children and adults with better resources and equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Community organizations bring fresh ideas and new ways of thinking to the
table,'' Lynne Vaughan, a YMCA executive, told the House Education and Workforce
subcommittee on early childhood, youth, and families. ``There are organizations
in these communities that have the capacity to operate a quality after-school
program.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Michael Cohen, a deputy to Education Secretary Richard Riley, said the
2,100 school-based 21st Century Community Learning Centers are ``sound, strong
and moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his fiscal 2001 budget, President Clinton is seeking to double program
funds to $1 billion, increasing the number of centers to 4,000 by the next
academic year. About 500,000 children use the centers, more than 80 percent of
which also serve adults, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think we have strayed as far as you think we have,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., who five years ago helped create the
federally funded centers, said concentrating most of the centers in elementary
and middle schools defeats the intended purpose of offering a variety of
community-based training programs. Such schools, Gunderson said, are
ill-equipped to handle much beyond child care.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the 1994 law, centers must offer at least four programs from a list
that includes activities geared toward senior citizens, nutrition and health
education, parenting, employment counseling, technology training and child care
services.
</P>
<P>
	   Additionally, while the department's focus on keeping younger children off
the streets in safer environments is laudable, it may be duplicating other
federally funded efforts, said Gunderson, now a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Otherwise this is nothing more than glorified baby-sitting and I don't
think there's anybody in this room who wants that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education and Workforce
Committee, asked the Education Department to study the centers' effectiveness
before asking for more money.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said the centers were meeting educational needs and social services
for everyone. He said that a Tucson, Ariz., center tutors 1,000 students in math
and computer skills, while a Detroit charter school's center trains parents on
computers and offers everyone drug-abuse awareness and conflict resolution
counseling.

<HEADLINE> FCC Chief Talks on Bankrupt Cos.  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government is making plans for a second
auction of wireless licenses held by a bankrupt company, but it still needs a
favorable court decision to proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the latest twist in a protracted legal battle between the Federal
Communications Commission and NextWave Telecom, which bid more than $4 billion
for wireless licenses in a federal auction several years ago and later filed for
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   The company recently agreed to pay its debt in full. But the commission
wants that portion of the airwaves back, saying that under agency rules,
NextWave's licenses were canceled automatically when it failed to meet its
payment deadlines.
</P>
<P>
	   A New York bankruptcy court earlier this month rejected the commission's bid
to take back NextWave's licenses for a second auction.
</P>
<P>
	   That decision was appealed by the FCC to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
2nd Circuit, which previously had reaffirmed the commission's jurisdiction over
the licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the appeals court said the commission can begin preparing for
the second auction in July of the licenses, while the court makes its decision.
The FCC still needs a favorable ruling from the court for the auction to go
forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, at a hearing Thursday, FCC Chairman Bill Kennard told senators
that taxpayers stand to lose billions of dollars -- and the promise of new
communications services -- if valuable government licenses become tied up in
bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Spectrum belongs to the American public. It's a national resource,''
Kennard told the Senate Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Allowing bankrupt companies to hold on to the licenses -- and eventually pay
only a portion of what they bid -- undermines the entire process, Kennard said.
He again advocated for legislation that would ensure the government gets back
licenses from companies that file for bankruptcy. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., and
others have pushed for such measures in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the increasing demand for wireless voice and data services, the
NextWave licenses may be worth much more now. Mobile phone company Nextel
Communications has indicated that it would bid as much as $8 billion if the
licenses were put back on the auction block.
</P>
<P>
	   Gregg said Americans are taking a hit when NextWave and others bring
licenses into bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   The company ``is trying to beat down the taxpayers by going into bankruptcy
court,'' Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
	   NextWave officials rebuffed any suggestion that they filed for bankruptcy in
order to reduce what they owed the government. They instead blamed FCC license
policy for their financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Dolan, chief operating officer for NextWave, also chastised the
commission for not accepting the company's offer to pay for the licenses, so
they could be put to use to deliver wireless services to consumers.

<HEADLINE> Judges Confirmed Over Objections  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate impasse over federal judge nominations was
partially lifted when Majority Leader Trent Lott overrode the objections of his
own party members and allowed votes on two judges.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats applauded the votes but urged the Republican leadership to make a
more concerted effort to fill the 77 vacancies, nearly one-tenth of the total,
in the federal judicial system.
</P>
<P>
	   The votes Thursday on two largely non-controversial nominees, Thomas Ambro
to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the 3rd District and Joel Pisano to be U.S.
District Judge for the District of New Jersey, came despite a campaign by some
Republicans to stop all votes on President Clinton's federal judge nominees.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort was led by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., who said Clinton violated
an agreement with the Senate by making a recess appointment, a constitutionally
approved way for the president to appoint someone temporarily when Congress is
not in session.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott, R-Miss., said he was ``not one to get all weepy-eyed about having more
federal judges of any kind, anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he said that ``I don't think we should, or would, be able to go all year
without confirming any nominations.'' He said some of the nominees ``are good
men and women ... and in some of these states, there truly is a need for more
judges.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate voted 96-2 to confirm Ambro, and 95-2 for Pisano. Inhofe and Sen.
Bob Smith, R-N.H., voted against the nominees. Earlier, the Senate voted 79-19
to proceed to final confirmation. All 19 no votes were Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Senate tradition, a single senator can put a ``hold'' on a nomination
that effectively puts off all further floor action. But the majority leader has
the authority to ignore such a tactic.
</P>
<P>
	   Inhofe continued to assert that the president broke his word last December
by reappointing Sara M. Fox to the National Labor Relations Board. Under the
Constitution the president can make appointments during a congressional recess,
with the nominee allowed to serve until the end of the following year.
</P>
<P>
	   Inhofe said his effort to block future judge nominees was ``the only chance
in eight years to hold the president up to his word.''
</P>
<P>
	   The confirmation of judges has been a constant point of contention between
the White House and Senate Republicans, with the White House accusing the Senate
of holding up votes on nominees Republicans feel are too liberal. Republicans
contend that Democrats had no better record of moving nominations when they
controlled the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, Hispanic-American lawmakers and activists said President
Clinton promised them he would apply pressure on Congress to act on three
Hispanic judicial candidates who have been waiting up to four years for
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
	   The three are Enrique Moreno, nominated in September for the 5th Circuit
Court of Appeals; Julio Fuentes, nominated in March to fill a vacancy in the 3rd
Circuit Court of Appeals; and Richard Paez, the first Mexican-American to serve
as a federal judge in Los Angeles, who was nominated in January 1996 to a higher
judgeship on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president is 100 percent behind our effort to push these nominations
forward,'' said Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who leads the
congressional Hispanic Caucus.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, also
urged action on the nominations of Paez and attorney Marsha Berzon, also to the
9th Circuit. Both have been blocked by Republicans who say they are too liberal.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott said he would abide by a promise made last year to consider the two
nominations by March 15.

<HEADLINE> Pulitzer Prize winner just a stinker to FBI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - One man's Pulitzer Prize winner is a G-man's stinker.
<P>
	   Acclaimed New York columnist Murray Kempton, a 1985 Pulitzer Prize winner
for his "witty and insightful" work, was blasted in once-confidential FBI memos
as "a rat," "a snake" and - last but hardly least - "a real stinker."
</P>
<P>
	   The "real" was underlined for emphasis in the 194-page FBI file, which was
obtained by the Web site APBNews.com through a Freedom of Information Act
request. The site monitors law enforcement news.
</P>
<P>
	   Kempton, a one-time member of the Young Communist League, was monitored by
the FBI from the early 1950s through 1969 - the year he helped raise funds for
the Black Panther Party. Kempton later wrote a book, "The Briar Patch," about
the trial of several Panthers.
</P>
<P>
	   Kempton, who died in 1997, had requested his file and reviewed it in 1989.
In a column that year, Kempton said the FBI's surveillance had zero impact on
his career.
</P>
<P>
	   "My malice toward Hoover, which was always small, and his malice toward me,
which seems to have been outsized, were alike inconsequential for help or harm,"
Kempton wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   So why the extensive Kempton file?
</P>
<P>
	   Well, according to one FBI memo, Kempton "has belittled Bureau and Director
(Hoover) in columns." Another memo complained that Kempton "has taken a
forthright stand for the right of dissent in general and for the rights of
communists in particular."
</P>
<P>
	   At the bottom of a third memo, there was a hand-written notation: "He is a
real stinker."
</P>
<P>
	   Kempton, who rode a bicycle to his assignments, smoked a ubiquitous pipe and
loved jazz, aggravated Hoover and many others in a 55-year career that included
stints at the New York Post and Newsday. It was at the latter that he won his
Pulitzer in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI didn't share that appreciation of Kempton's work.
</P>
<P>
	   "When a newspaper hires a snake like Kempton they can expect the worst,"
said one memo.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am surprised that Scripps-Howard are taking on this rat," the same memo
said later, referring to Kempton's hiring by the New York World Telegram and
Sun.
</P>
<P>
	   Kempton was also placed on the FBI's "Do Not Contact" list, which provided
the names of people who would not help the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   In the file's twisted highlight, the FBI recorded a 1962 speech by Kempton
to a group called the Citizens for Constitutional Liberties. According to the
file, Kempton said "he regretted to say that he lives in a country where his
speech ... was being transcribed."

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Reviews Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is studying whether racial minorities
unfairly get more federal death sentences than white offenders and whether it
should suspend executions until the results are in.
</P>
<P>
	   So far the review, ordered by Attorney General Janet Reno two months ago
with no public announcement, is not a moratorium on executions like that
declared recently by Illinois Gov. George Ryan in his state, Deputy Attorney
General Eric Holder said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   But the White House says President Clinton is considering a Democratic
senator's request for a suspension of federal death penalties pending the
outcome of a study like the one Reno ordered.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure that the system is as fair as it can be,'' Holder
told a news conference. ``It's a historical study of the federal system with an
emphasis on finding out whether or not there are inappropriate racial
disparities'' in the federal capital punishment system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The study was ordered by the attorney general, I'd say almost out of an
abundance of caution,'' said Holder, who is leading the racial disparity review.
``We don't have anything to our knowledge that gives us reason to believe that
there is a disparity within the system. But we want to make sure that is so.''
</P>
<P>
	   Holder said the study would not prevent the Bureau of Prisons from setting
an execution date for any of the 21 people on the federal death row at the U.S.
penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. Two-thirds of those prisoners are minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   With appeals under way, no dates have been set for their executions.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno established an elaborate Justice Department review system for deciding
whether to seek death penalties, including private hearings for defendants'
lawyers. But the final decision belongs to her.
</P>
<P>
	   Though she personally opposes the death penalty, Reno has authorized federal
prosecutors to seek death penalties in 149 cases, out of 517 reviewed under her
procedure.
</P>
<P>
	   The last federal execution was in 1963. In 1972, The Supreme Court ruled the
death penalty had been unfairly applied. State and federal procedures were
revised, so the high court restored the death penalty on the federal level in
1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he was planning legislation
that would allow death row inmates to introduce new DNA evidence in an attempt
to prove their innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Friday, Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president is concerned
about the issues raised by Illinois' decision and will consider putting federal
executions on hold.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension request came in a letter from Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and
is being studied by the White House counsel, Lockhart said. He added there's no
guarantee Clinton will act soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Feingold based his request on Ryan's halt of executions in Illinois until
authorities determine whether the death penalty is administered fairly. Since
1977, Illinois has executed 12 prisoners. But 13 Illinois death row inmates have
been exonerated since 1987 through appeals, DNA evidence or, in a few cases,
persistent investigation by college journalism students.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationally, 85 people have been freed from death row since 1973, according
to the Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Feingold asked that Clinton suspend federal executions and have Reno
thoroughly review how the federal death penalty has been used.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before the federal government executes anyone, the Justice Department
should be absolutely certain that innocents have not been condemned to death,''
Feingold wrote.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agents Helped Suspected Spy  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Suspected Russian spy Stanislav Gusev had a willing
accomplice, if not in espionage, then at least in parking.
</P>
<P>
	   Gusev, accused of electronic eavesdropping on State Department conversations
from his car, did not get those choice spaces outside the building solely
through parking prowess, suggested David Carpenter, the department's top
security official.
</P>
<P>
	   Carpenter told a Senate hearing on Thursday that Gusev aroused suspicions of
State Department security officials when he was noticed being in the vicinity of
the building two or more times a week, where he ``walked the streets and fussed
about in his car.''
</P>
<P>
	   He parked as close as possible to the building whenever he could find an
available space, Carpenter said. ``Once we realized what he was doing, space was
always available,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States expelled Gusev in December after a listening device was
found in a seventh floor State Department conference room. Gusev allegedly
listened in his car to transmissions from the device.
</P>
<P>
	   Carpenter told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that the FBI still
was investigating the matter. A preliminary determination found that the
Russians had not obtained any vital American national secrets from the bug, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Carpenter said that some sensitive subjects were discussed in the
conference room where the bug was placed.
</P>
<P>
	   The conference room was used for a variety of meetings, including at least
some during which classified material was discussed, Carpenter said. One meeting
was held by a unit that deals with intelligence matters, he said. However,
Carpenter said that only material with moderate classification levels had been
discussed.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the conference room where the bug was planted was on the same floor
as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's office, it is on the opposite side of
the sprawling building.
</P>
<P>
	   Carpenter, assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, suggested
that budget cuts and a post-Cold War relaxation in security at the State
Department had contributed to lax procedures that made it easier for the bug to
be installed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It takes very little imagination for one to surmise that the Russian
intelligence service took advantage of our posture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carpenter said it still is not clear how the listening device was planted in
a strip of wooden wall molding, or by whom.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that clearly the device was installed ``in multiple visits to the
conference room.'' The strip of molding had been removed and replaced with
another strip containing the bug and then painted over to match the rest of the
strip.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation confirmed ``this was indeed a Russian intelligence
operation,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said security was being improved even before the bug was found, with
escorts now required of nearly all visitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee on
international operations, called the State Department's security system
``porous.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am concerned the State Department has become a soft target for foreign
intelligence services because of a lack of security consciousness in the State
Department culture,'' Grams said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing was held amid rising congressional concern about security
breaches, after the recent disclosure that former CIA Director John Deutch
violated security rules in 1996 by using an unsecured home computer attached to
the Internet to work on highly classified intelligence material
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, who has been stripped of his security clearances, so far has
declined to appear before congressional oversight panels. But Sen. Richard
Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday he
thought a deal was close under which Deutch soon would testify.

<HEADLINE> VA Office Warnings Predated Audit  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY MARGASAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a year before a devastating audit exposed the
situation, top officials at the Veterans Affairs Department were repeatedly
warned of questionable hiring and overspending in the agency's congressional
liaison office, documents show.
</P>
<P>
	   The problems at the Office of Congressional Affairs have angered a major
veterans organization. A key lawmaker on veterans issues questioned why the
official who led the office, Sheila Clarke McCready, is still at the agency
earning $130,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No other office in the VA during FY '99 showed such callous disregard for
reasonable financial management as OCA,'' chief agency financial officer Edward
A. Powell Jr. wrote Veterans Affairs Secretary Togo West on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   The memo was among several VA memos and e-mails obtained by The Associated
Press, in which Powell, internal auditors and other officials alerted top
management of the problems during 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Little action was taken until an inspector general's audit last month
concluded McCready overspent her $2.3 million budget and improperly hired
consultants to do the work of career employees.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, Powell had to transfer $390,000 to cover extra spending in the
liaison office, records show. The audit alleged the office failed to answer
congressional requests on behalf of veterans for months.
</P>
<P>
	   McCready has been transferred to a job in the Veterans Health Administration
but continues to earn more than $130,000 a year. She did not respond to phone
messages seeking comment Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Her attorney, Richard Gordin, said she ``was carrying out the secretary's
instructions in her efforts within the department and a full disclosure of all
memoranda and e-mails would confirm that she acted completely appropriately.''
He would not supply any of those documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., chairman of the House Veterans Affairs
investigations subcommittee, complained that McCready still holds a high
position in the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the real world, a corporate executive who overspent his office budget
by almost $390,000 and reduced his organization to chaos would be shown the
door,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The national commander of the American Legion also expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they had over a year to correct the problem, this organization is very
concerned with the absence of proper management,'' said the commander, Alan G.
Lance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many of our veterans ... who do not receive satisfactory responses,
adequate care or entitlements go directly to their congressmen,'' Lance added.
``As a result of the failure to correct the problem, how many veterans failed to
get legitimate benefits?''
</P>
<P>
	   VA spokesman John Hanson declined comment Thursday on why West did not act
sooner. Hanson pointed out that McCready has been transferred and all but one
consultant -- who now is one of West's schedulers -- had their contracts
terminated.
</P>
<P>
	   The internal memos detail a yearlong campaign by Powell, the chief fiscal
officer, and others to raise concerns about McCready's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Powell wrote McCready on Feb. 22, 1999, that he was ``troubled'' by her
desire to add staff without a department-required reorganization plan, and
added, ``I am not inclined to support additional funding for new personnel''
without such a plan.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, Powell wrote VA chief of staff Janice Joyner that McCready
``has consistently overspent her budget and continues to do so.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Gaskell, an official in the inspector general's office, wrote
McCready on Sept. 24 that her actions to extend the temporary assignment of a
Defense Department employee were ``inappropriate'' under terms of the federal
Anti-Deficiency Act.
</P>
<P>
	   That law prevents federal officials from spending money before they know the
funds are approved.
</P>
<P>
	   Two months earlier, VA budget official Kathleen Hamilton raised concerns
that she had ``not received any documentation'' from McCready to justify the
Pentagon detail -- a legal requirement for such interagency agreements.
</P>
<P>
	   Gordin, McCready's attorney, said his client's hiring and spending decisions
were ``within the guidelines that she as a career government employee was
provided by appropriate officials within the department.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last September, McCready denied in an e-mail to Powell that she improperly
used consultants or exceeded ``my amended budget authority.''
</P>
<P>
	   Powell, in his Jan. 19 memo to West, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Again and again, Sheila would request funding for activities which had not
been authorized,'' Powell wrote. His memo added that McCready ``threatened me
with your displeasure if I did not let her do what she wanted.''

<HEADLINE> More Funds Released for Heating Oil  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says he has gotten ``an
ear full'' about home heating oil prices. But aside from providing some money to
ease the crunch on the poorest of consumers, there is not much the Clinton
administration can do.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson on Thursday announced an additional $130 million in assistance to
help poor people pay for heating costs. About one-third is going to the
Northeast where the problem is most severe.
</P>
<P>
	   That money is on top of $45 million in low-income assistance made available
a week ago. An estimated 10 million to 14 million homes nationwide rely on oil
for heating, with the highest concentration in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've gotten the message. We know there's a crisis in the Northeast. We
hear our people are hurting,'' Richardson told reporters. He said he had met
with Northeast lawmakers and ``they gave me an ear full'' of complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   Northeast lawmakers called it a badly needed and welcomed step. ``This
additional assistance is coming none too soon,'' said Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   The average retail price for heating oil nearly doubled to $1.66 per gallon
from 86 cents a year ago. In the Northeast, prices are even even higher, with an
average of $1.74 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   Some lawmakers from the region insisted Thursday that the administration
should release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase supplies and
dampen prices.
</P>
<P>
	   But many oil economists said that likely would not have much of an impact on
current heating oil prices. It would take time for the oil to move through the
system and probably not that much oil could be released.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said the administration does not intend to use the reserve. ``It
is this administration's view the markets should dictate prices and that the
markets should flow on their own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said the soaring cost of heating oil, diesel and other fuels stem
from ``a volatile mix of conditions'' -- high oil prices, low stocks,
transportation problems that make it difficult for dealers to get supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials also said they are concerned about refinery output, which was at
about 90 percent of capacity. Although refinery runs have increased over the
last two weeks, some facilities have normal maintenance scheduled this time of
year, which could result in new supply problems, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a hearing Thursday of the House International Relations Committee, the
chairman, GOP Rep. Benjamin Gilman of New York, said the White House ought to do
more ``to get the OPEC nations to turn on the spigot and let the market
determine what the prices should be.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries rolled back production by
4.3 million barrels a day a year ago, causing prices to soar to nearly $30 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he was ``ramping up'' his contacts with key oil producing
nations and spoke with oil ministers from Mexico and Venezuela about U.S.
concerns over the oil prices and production levels. He planned meetings with oil
ministers from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in the coming days.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Has Victims' Rights Concerns  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House agrees on the need for a constitutional
amendment to protect victims' rights but says the language of current proposals
before Congress may go too far in impeding law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant Attorney General Eleanor D. Acheson, in testimony Thursday to the
House Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution, said both President Clinton
and Attorney General Janet Reno back a victims' rights amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said House and Senate bills likely to come up this year fail to
expressly preserve the rights of the accused, undermine the president's power to
grant clemency and could cause practical problems for law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, sponsor of the House version, insisted that
``nothing in this amendment will undermine or weaken the long-established rights
of defendants under our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
	   The House and Senate proposals would ensure that victims have the rights to
reasonable notice of court proceedings and an offender's release or escape, the
right to attend and be heard at legal proceedings and the right to an order of
restitution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Victims should not occupy the fringes of our criminal justice system,''
said James Barcia, D-Mich., a leading sponsor.
</P>
<P>
	   The Constitution in 15 places provides basic rights for the accused, but
none for victims, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Senate sponsor with Sen.
Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   She and others argued against passing new laws rather than changing the
Constitution, saying 32 states have enacted protections for victims but victims'
rights are still ignored.
</P>
<P>
	   Kyl said the Senate version had already undergone 63 drafts to meet the
concerns of the administration and others. The Senate bill, unlike the House,
covers only violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the president has no constitutional role in amending the
Constitution, his support would help garner the Democratic votes needed to gain
the two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate. An amendment also needs
ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration opposed previous GOP efforts to amend the
Constitution to require a balanced budget, impose term limits or ban flag
desecration. None has succeeded. There have been 27 amendments to the
Constitution, the last ratified in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   People on both sides of the argument mentioned the 1995 bombing of the
Oklahoma City federal building that killed 168 and the difficulty of
accommodating all the victims in such an instance.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the House Judiciary Committee chairman, said he
would probably support the measure. He said Oklahoma City was an example of
``the practical problems that get in the way of a smooth and logical adoption of
this amendment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Emmett Welch, of Oklahoma City, who lost his daughter in the bombing, said
he opposed the amendment because victim participation could impede government
efforts to make a case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think crime victims are too emotionally involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Acheson, in prepared testimony, also said the House bill, which covers any
crime subject to a prison term longer than a year, ``could conceivably create
enormous burdens in case of mass victimization.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate version was approved by the Judiciary Committee in September and
could reach the Senate floor in April, Feinstein said. House action is expected
later this year.

<HEADLINE> International Custody Fights on Rise  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE KOIDIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Like the father of Elian Gonzalez, Steve Fenton knows
what it's like to fight to get a child back from a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
	   Fenton's estranged wife took their 6-year-old son to southern Mexico for
Christmas one year and called to say they weren't coming back.
</P>
<P>
	   After more than a year of battling in U.S. courts and the State Department,
he went to Mexico, grabbed the boy and got on a plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was the most dramatic experience I ever went through in my life,'' says
Fenton, a 40-year-old building contractor from the San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
	   Fenton is among thousands of American parents whose spouses have fled with
their children to distant lands. In many cases, the parents have found it
impossible to retrieve their children even though they have international law on
their side.
</P>
<P>
	   Fenton was among six parents who traveled to Washington this week to discuss
the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas, said Elian's highly publicized case provides an
opportunity to raise awareness about the estimated 10,000 American children who
have been taken abroad by one parent without the consent of the other.
</P>
<P>
	   Fenton's case differs from that of Cuban Juan Miguel Gonzalez -- the father
of 6-year-old Elian -- because Fenton's son should have been returned under
terms of the 1980 Hague Convention treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   The international agreement among 54 countries established procedures for
returning abducted children. Cuba is not among the signatories, but Mexico is --
and the State Department says it is one of the most serious violators of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   While the United States has honored at least 80 percent of Mexican return
requests in recent years, Mexico has honored about 3 percent of U.S. requests,
according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a
Virginia-based nonprofit group partially funded by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Mexican Embassy called the figures ``outrageously
exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Antonio Zabalgoitia cited statistics showing both countries had about a
50 percent return rate last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think an accusation of Mexico being noncompliant with the Hague
Convention stands,'' he said. ``I think if we judge by results, we actually have
an outstanding performance.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added that Mexico has adjusted its legal system to better comply with the
Hague regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   By early next month, the General Accounting Office -- the investigative arm
of Congress -- is expected to release a report on the U.S. government's response
to international parental child abductions.
</P>
<P>
	   Lampson said legislation is needed to help American parents who are victims
in international abduction cases, though he doesn't yet have any specific
proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates for parents like Fenton say problems in getting children back from
Mexico include judges uneducated about the Hague treaty, a lack of officials who
can look for children and a lack of money that prevents some authorities from
even getting a working fax machine.
</P>
<P>
	   Any improvements in the way such situations are handled would be welcome
news to Fenton, who chronicled his experience in a three-part series that ran
last year in El Paso Inc., a weekly newspaper published by his older brother,
Tom.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Fenton's wife, a native of Mexico, left with their son in December
1992, they had joint custody.
</P>
<P>
	   After she called the next month to say she wasn't coming back, Fenton filed
for and was awarded custody of his son, Stephen. He also sought help from the
State Department, citing the Hague treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   For several months, he was told that authorities in Jalapa, Mexico, would
act on the petition and his son would be returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, he said he received explanations -- the boy wasn't home when agents
arrived; a local order granted custody to his wife; taking the boy would violate
the mother's constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Fenton gave up on the legal process. He paid $51,000 to a man who arranged a
``snatchback'' in April 1994. Risking arrest by Mexican authorities, Fenton went
to Mexico, took Stephen off a school bus and brought him home.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after they returned, Fenton put Stephen in counseling to help him
cope with the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Fenton said Mexican officials in the fall of 1994 formally asked U.S.
authorities to prosecute him for kidnapping, but the request was denied.
</P>
<P>
	   In June 1998, his wife, Esther, agreed to return to California to turn
herself in. She pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to
probation and community service.

<HEADLINE> 'DiCaprio's 'The Beach' Set To Open  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Leonardo DiCaprio became king of the heartthrobs when he
followed the ship down in "Titanic" -- adoring female fans helped make the film
an all-time box-office juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that DiCaprio has hit dry land in "The Beach," the question is whether
fans will flock to theaters to see their idol playing a dark, rather ignoble
character.
</P>
<P>
	   Opening today, "The Beach" stars DiCaprio as Richard, an American backpacker
in Thailand who embarks on a quest for paradise after obtaining a map to an
idyllic island.
</P>
<P>
	   While it's another journeyman's role for DiCaprio, his character is a
weak-willed cousin to the intrepid, artistic vagabond Jack Dawson of "Titanic,"
which took in $1.8 billion at theaters worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   There's more weasel than hero about Richard. Instead of dancing jigs in
steerage and freezing in the North Atlantic to save his true love, Richard
sleeps around, lies unabashedly and goes savage and sneering in the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard is a juvenile braggart, a feeble philosopher and a bit of a coward
to boot. He also swills snake's blood, unable to back away from a dare.
</P>
<P>
	   Not a pretty picture for your typical teen idol.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's a picture DiCaprio may have needed to paint to keep his career
moving forward, said Nancy Krulik, author of a biography and a trivia book about
the actor.
</P>
<P>
	   "To continuously play the handsome artist from Paris, that only goes so
far," she said. "It's wise to move away from that because it will increase his
longevity."
</P>
<P>
	   Being a heartthrob "is a very short-lived career," Krulik said. "You don't
want to end up as the next 'E! True Hollywood Story' of David Cassidy."
</P>
<P>
	   DiCaprio, 25, has borne the heartthrob mantle for only two of the dozen or
so films he's done: "Titanic" in 1997, and "William Shakespeare's Romeo +
Juliet" the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   He's taken on much chancier roles for other movies. In "The Basketball
Diaries," DiCaprio played a teen-age junkie who fantasizes about going on a gun
rampage in his school. He was Meryl Streep's surly son in "Marvin's Room," and
Robert De Niro's abused stepson in "This Boy's Life." He earned an Oscar
nomination as Johnny Depp's retarded brother in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"
</P>
<P>
	   "There's nothing cynical in his choices," said Tom Rothman, president of the
film group for 20th Century Fox, which released "The Beach" and co-produced
"Titanic" with Paramount. "He chose to do 'The Beach' when he basically could
have done any movie Hollywood had to offer."
</P>
<P>
	   But Fox figures the movie plays as well to men as an adventure tale as to
women for the DiCaprio romantic element, Rothman said. But the film will lose
some of DiCaprio's faithful teen audience -- it's R rating for violence means
anyone under 17 is supposed to be accompanied by a parent or guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Bucksbaum, a film analyst for Reel Source Inc., said DiCaprio's
darker persona in "The Beach" may win him new fans among adults who were "kind
of disgusted with how much attention he got from 'Titanic."'
</P>
<P>
	   "The worst thing that could happen for this movie is that with new ID
procedures at theaters, most of his teen-age following around 13 and even
younger will not get a chance to see it," Bucksbaum said. "You may get a lot of
girls paying for another movie then slipping in to see 'The Beach."'

<HEADLINE> Clinton Credits Fiscal Restraint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton credits America's economic strength on
low interest rates and a reduced federal deficit which helped reshape the
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   In published interviews today, Clinton says the economic expansion of the
1980s was funded by ``an old-fashioned explosion of deficit spending'' which
guaranteed ``long-term problems for the economy.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, he said, ``The main thing we did was to cut interest rates by
getting rid of the deficit.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president was interviewed in the Oval Office on Thursday by reporters
from three newspapers, USA Today, the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So I think our main contribution in the short run was to make it
absolutely clear that we would have a consistent, disciplined fiscal approach
that would cut and then eventually eliminate the deficit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think anyone can claim sole credit,'' he said. ``I think we've had
a remarkable balance here, where the American people, all of us in our own way,
essentially have done what we were supposed to do. And there's more than enough
credit to go around.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president said that only in the last few years has the contribution of
technology to the economy been fully appreciated.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also said he was concerned about recent attacks by computer hackers
on several popular Web sites, but he warned against overreacting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll figure out -- we'll continue to figure out -- how to secure the
Internet without shutting it down or closing off options,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said that while rising petroleum prices may be a burden to people
who rely on oil for home heating, he doesn't think oil prices will ``sink the
overall economy or threaten it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The country's overall reliance on oil is much less than it was 25 years
ago when we had the big oil price problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On another matter, Clinton said researchers and the public -- not just a
small group of drug and biotech companies -- should have access to the human
genetic code as a source of new treatments of hereditary diseases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got to get the basic information out to everybody who might find
some particular use for it,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Some May Have Been Exposed to AIDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration is investigating a gene
therapy experiment that may have accidentally exposed more than two dozen young
cancer patients to the virus that causes AIDS, The Washington Post reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA is conducting follow-up testing after preliminary independent tests
found that the gene-based medicine may have been contaminated with HIV-1, the
virus that causes AIDS, and HCV, which causes hepatitis C, the Post said in
today's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA's more thorough testing is needed because these types of tests often
give false results and two other tests found no signs of contamination, the Post
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers discovered the accidental exposure in December, but did not
inform federal regulators until last week. The researchers from St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston began contacting patients and their parents about the possible
infections Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA is looking into possible laboratory problems and the timing of the
reporting of the discovery.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post said the study had been terminated, but Claire Bassett, spokeswoman
for Baylor, said Thursday night the study conducted in Houston had only been
suspended as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   Bassett said that the contamination evidence had come from St. Jude, and
that there had been no contamination found in the therapy given to the six
children treated at Baylor. Two of the children treated at Baylor have since
died of cancer, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything that took place that the FDA has a concern about did take place
at Memphis," Bassett said.
</P>
<P>
	   Deidre Malone, St. Jude's public relations director, would not comment on
the Post report other than to say the hospital would have a statement today.
</P>
<P>
	   Laura Bowman, the study's principal investigator at St. Jude, was quoted by
the Post as saying that all of the volunteer cancer patients were near death and
only a handful of the 20 patients she treated are alive today, the rest having
died from their cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Institutes of Health was already investigating St. Jude for its
handling of patient deaths in a different study, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cancer patients suffered from neuroblastoma, a brain cancer that is the
second most common childhood malignancy. The experimental therapy involved
removing a patient's own tumor cells and inserting an immune system gene with a
gene-altered virus. The modified cells were put back in the patient to galvanize
the immune system to fight the cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowman said she discovered last fall that the two most recent volunteers --
a child and a teen-ager treated a year ago -- received viruses that had been
processed incorrectly and could have been contaminated.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she could find no evidence that the original batch of cells from
1995 used to grow the viruses had been properly screened for contamination. In
November, she sent cells from the original batch for testing at an outside lab,
which sent back results that twice showed the presence of DNA from HIV and HCV.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she decided to contact the FDA last week when further test results
were slow to arrive.
</P>
<P>
	   Malcolm Brenner, who initiated the study while at St. Jude and continued the
work at Baylor, told the Post he doubted the initial test results, but if the
contamination was real it could have been caused by HIV-infected blood in the
laboratory being accidentally splashed on the viruses.
</P>
<P>
	   The surviving volunteers would probably only need AIDS testing if further
tests confirm the contamination, Bowman said.

<HEADLINE> Two Studies Fault St. John's Wort  </HEADLINE>
    By EMMA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- St. John's wort, a popular herbal remedy used to relieve mild
depression, can interfere with drugs used to treat HIV-infected people and heart
transplant patients, new research shows.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists said the findings add to growing concerns that the herb may
interact dangerously with prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
	   Two studies published this week in The Lancet medical journal found that St.
John's wort dulls the effectiveness of both the HIV medicine indinavir and the
transplant drug cyclosporin, used to suppress transplant patients' immune
systems so their bodies don't reject the new organs.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration took note of the studies, cautioning
health care providers about using St. John's wort with the medications. In its
advisory Thursday, the FDA said it was working with drug manufacturers to ensure
that labeling of the medications be revised "to highlight the potential for drug
interactions with St. Johns wort."
</P>
<P>
	   Although both studies involved few participants, independent experts say the
way they were conducted and the strength of the results render the findings
significant.
</P>
<P>
	   In one study, the level of medicine in the bloodstream when St. John's wort
was taken dropped dramatically enough for patients to begin to reject their
transplanted hearts.
</P>
<P>
	   The other showed that St. John's wort depressed the effectiveness of a drug
used to treat HIV patients.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a cautionary note," said Dr. Fred Valentine, professor of medicine
at New York University Medical Center, who was not connected with either study.
"These (herbal remedies) really aren't necessarily benign compounds."
</P>
<P>
	   St. John's wort is widely used in Germany as a treatment for depression and
anxiety. Some U.S. physicians have started recommending it to patients and
report that the herb has shown effectiveness in stemming depression.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is definitely a potential problem with St. John's wort that is only
recently becoming apparent," said Mark Blumenthal, executive director of the
American Botanical Council in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   This information "is coming out as the herb increases in popularity and is
being used by millions of people in combination with over-the-counter or
prescription medications," Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, CVS Corp., the second-largest drugstore chain in the United
States, said it had started asking customers to list the herbal supplements they
use -- in addition to their prescription drugs -- in an effort to avoid
potentially dangerous drug interactions.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the new studies in The Lancet, Stephen Piscitelli and other
researchers at the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md., gave eight HIV-negative volunteers indinavir, a class of HIV drug
called a protease inhibitor, three times a day.
</P>
<P>
	   On the experiment's third day, St. John's wort tablets were added and the
volunteers continued taking both pills for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Blood tests were taken the day before the volunteers started taking the herb
and at the experiment's end, to see if the concentration of the HIV medicine in
their blood changed by adding St. John's wort.
</P>
<P>
	   The blood concentration of indinavir immediately before another dose was due
was an average of 81 percent lower when St. John's wort was added than when the
drug was taken alone, the researchers said. Overall, levels of the HIV medicine
in the blood dropped 57 percent when taken with St. John's wort.
</P>
<P>
	   "When blood levels get so low, it leads to resistance and treatment
failure," Piscitelli said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is very important for HIV patients. St. John's wort is a commonly used
product in the HIV population," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the second study, scientists from University Hospital in Zurich,
Switzerland, reported that two heart transplant patients were hospitalized with
heart trouble three weeks after starting to take St. John's wort to alleviate
depression.
</P>
<P>
	   The scientists found the herb had lowered the level of the
rejection-fighting drug cyclosporin. When the patients stopped taking St. John's
wort, the problem ended, the researchers said.

<P>
    HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week generally higher
Friday, with the key index closing at a record high in Hong Kong over rumors of
a possible takeover battle for the territory's largest telecommunications
company.
</P>
<P>
	   In Japan, financial markets were closed for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 535.13 points, or 3.2 percent, to close at 17,380.30 after reaching an
all-time intraday high of 17,653.65. The index's previous closing high of
17,369.63 was set on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares rose on a report that Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa plans to form a
group to bid for 54 percent of Hong Kong's Cable and Wireless HKT, which is
controlled by Britain's Cable and Wireless PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   Hutchison's parent company, Cheung Kong Holdings, denied the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The reported deal would challenge Singapore Telecommunication's plan to
merge with Hong Kong's Cable and Wireless to create a phone giant worth nearly
U.S. dlrs 60 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post, quoting unidentified sources, said that Hutchison Whampoa was
talking to firms such as local Internet company Pacific Century CyberWorks and
British mobile telephone company Vodafone AirTouch about joining the group.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Cable and Wireless HKT rallied 23 percent and Pacific Century rose
5.3 percent before trading in both was suspended at midday Friday.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Rise 0.3 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans spent more carefully in January pushing up
retail sales by 0.3 percent as they trimmed purchases of furniture and food but
bought more cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Total retail sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $262.2 billion last month
and followed a huge and bigger than previously estimated 1.7 percent gain in
December, the Commerce Department said today.
</P>
<P>
	   January's performance was weaker than the 0.6 percent gain many analysts
were forecasting and marked the slowest pace since a 0.3 percent gain in
October.
</P>
<P>
	   The record-breaking U.S. economy pulled the nation's unemployment rate down
to a 30-year low in January. That, along with low inflation, stock market gains
and rising incomes, has made consumers feel wealthy and in the buying mood.
</P>
<P>
	   But harsh weather last month that forced some stores to close and kept some
shoppers away from the malls probably contributed to the moderation in sales
from their recent frenzied pace, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer spending has been a locomotive of the speeding economy and drove up
retail sales by 8.9 percent for all of last year, the fastest pace since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates by a quarter of a percentage
point last week, the fourth increase since June, in an effort to slow the
red-hot economy and keep inflation from escalating. Higher interest rates make
it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow.
</P>
<P>
	   Many economists predict the Fed will raise interest rates again in March,
out of the concern that the economy continues to grow at rapid pace that
probably can't be sustained without triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, sales at furniture and furnishing stores fell 0.4 percent,
following a 1.8 percent gain the month before.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales at food stores dropped by a big 2.2 percent in January after a
whopping 3.2 percent increase in December. At bars and restaurants, sales fell
by 0.2 percent in January, and at drug stores, sales were down by 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But sales of new cars and trucks at automobile dealerships rose by a strong
2.3 percent last month following a 1.4 percent rise in December. The auto
industry reported a record 17 million cars and light trucks sold in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   And, sales at hardware and clothing stores were each up by 0.7 percent in
January, while sales at department stores were up by 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   However, excluding the volatile autos category, retail sales fell 0.3
percent in January, much weaker than the 0.5 percent increase many analysts were
anticipating. That was the first decline in non-auto sales since a 0.1 percent
drop in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales at gasoline stations rose 0.4 percent as prices at the pump were down
for a good part of January.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the nation's retailers last week reported surprisingly strong sales
in January, helping stores finish their fiscal year -- which runs from February
through January -- with the biggest gains since 1984. The better-than-expected
January sales came despite bad winter weather.

Negotiations between the airline and a pilots union resumed
Thursday, a day before a deadline that would allow the airline's

announced yesterday covers all MD-80, MD-90, DC-9 and 717 series

	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. reported profits that
met analysts reduced expectations. Revenue increased 31 percent,
which represented a slowdown for Dell, largely because of chip
supply problem and a post-Y2K sales slowdown. To deliver robust
growth in the future, Dell -- known for pioneering direct sales of
personal computers -- will give new attention to providing
Internet-related customer services and products, said Dell vice
chairman Kevin Rollins. He pointed to an announcement earlier this
week that the company was forming a sales division dedicated to the
needs of large dot-com companies and other high-tech firms as
evidence of the initiative. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell said
selling online is only part of the company's plans to utilize the

yesterday. De Borchgrave declined to name the other party, but
acknowledged that a sale to an Internet company was a possibility.
``We're all thinking of clicks rather than bricks,'' he said. UPI

following a 1.8 percent gain the month before.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales at food stores dropped by a big 2.2 percent in January after a
whopping 3.2 percent increase in December. At bars and restaurants, sales fell
by 0.2 percent in January, and at drug stores, sales were down by 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But sales of new cars and trucks at automobile dealerships rose by a strong
2.3 percent last month following a 1.4 percent rise in December. The auto
industry reported a record 17 million cars and light trucks sold in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   And, sales at hardware and clothing stores were each up by 0.7 percent in
January, while sales at department stores were up by 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   However, excluding the volatile autos category, retail sales fell 0.3
percent in January, much weaker than the 0.5 percent increase many analysts were
anticipating. That was the first decline in non-auto sales since a 0.1 percent
drop in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales at gasoline stations rose 0.4 percent as prices at the pump were down
for a good part of January.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the nation's retailers last week reported surprisingly strong sales
in January, helping stores finish their fiscal year -- which runs from February
through January -- with the biggest gains since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Newsprint Maker Abitibi Buys Donohue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MONTREAL (AP) -- Abitibi-Consolidated Inc., the leading North American
newsprint maker, is buying the continent's third-biggest producer, Donohue Inc.
, for about $4 billion in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company would control about 35 percent of North American
newsprint production capacity, or double the capacity of the No. 2 producer
Bowater Inc. of Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe that this combination is far and away the best consolidation
opportunity in our industry," Abitibi president John Weaver said today in
announcing the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Donohue is one of the most efficient forest companies in North America.
Abitibi lost money last year due to lower paper prices and a restructuring that
included eliminating 10 percent of its jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Abitibi-Price generated more than $3 billion in revenue for the first nine
months of 1999 but hasn't reported full-year results yet. Donohue said its 1999
revenues were about $1.73 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of both Montreal-based newsprint giants had been halted Thursday on
the Toronto Stock Exchange amid speculation that the sale of Donohue was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement, Abitibi has agreed to pay cash and stock worth a
combined 42 Canadian dollars -- about $29 -- for each Donohue share, a 12.6
percent premium over Donohue's price of 37.30 Canadian dollars before trading
was halted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The offer includes 11 Canadian dollars a share in cash -- about $7.59 -- and
the rest in Abitibi stock.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Abitibi is assuming about $900 million in Donohue's debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal requires approval by regulators and Donohue shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   Quebecor Inc., a publishing and printing company based in Montreal, holds
about 12.7 percent of Donohue's outstanding Class A shares and 88.3 percent of
outstanding Class B shares and has agreed to sell all its holdings to Abitibi.
</P>
<P>
	   Michel Desbiens, president and chief executive of Donohue, will become
chairman of the merged company. Abitibi's Weaver will be CEO and president.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are very supportive of Abitibi-Consolidated's bid and are recommending
that our shareholders accept the offer for the strong value the new combined
entity will return to them," Desbiens said in the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said the companies have identified an estimated 250 million
Canadian dollars -- about $173 million -- in savings they can realize over two
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Weaver said no closings or sales of Donohue assets were anticipated, but
there was no immediate word on how jobs would be affected.
</P>
<P>
	   Donohue stock rose sharply last week after Quebecor chief executive Pierre
Karl Peladeau told investors he was not adverse to an asset sale to seek new
media acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say selling the Donohue stake makes sense for Quebecor. Its
subsidiary Quebecor Printing is the world's largest printer, and Quebecor also
owns Canada's second-largest daily newspaper chain, Sun Media Corp., along with
other publishing and electronic media interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Formed in 1997 with the merger of Abitibi-Price and Stone-Consolidated,
Abitibi-Consolidated operates 18 mills in North America and the United Kingdom.
It accounts for 21 percent of the North American newsprint market.

<HEADLINE> Strike Looms at Midwest Express Air  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Midwest Express Airlines canceled 15 flights in the face
of a strike deadline that could result in 320 pilots walking out tonight.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots could strike at 11:01 p.m. if no deal is reached through
negotiations with the National Mediation Board in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourteen of the 15 canceled flights were to either depart from or arrive in
Milwaukee's Mitchell International Airport, Midwest Express' hub, the airline
advised callers to its flight information telephone line today.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline, based in Oak Creek, canceled the flights Thursday so the planes
would not be away from their bases in Milwaukee; Omaha, Neb.; and Kansas City,
Mo., in the event of a strike, spokeswoman Lisa Bailey told the Milwaukee
Journal Sentinel. She did not immediately return calls today from The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 passengers held tickets on the flights, Bailey told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between the airline and the Air Line Pilots Association, which have
been going on for 19 months, resumed Tuesday. The contract would be the first
between the two.
</P>
<P>
	   Union officials have said the major unresolved issues are pensions, wages
and health insurance for retirees.
</P>
<P>
	   There was informational picketing this morning at the Milwaukee airport.
Picketing was also planned this evening at the Omaha airport if an agreement had
not been reached, union spokesman Hal Myers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Myers stressed it was not an indication of how the talks were going.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not a reaction to anything. ... Hopefully, we'll get an agreement
prior to the deadline. That's our goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 16-year-old airline employs nearly 2,800 people, with 80 percent of them
in Milwaukee. There are 130 Midwest Express flights per day.

<HEADLINE> Court Bars Listerine Competitor  </HEADLINE>
    By JEFFREY GOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A federal appeals panel agrees with the maker of
Listerine mouthwash that a smaller competitor can't call its breath freshener
BreathAsure because the product doesn't live up to its name.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said drug giant Warner-Lambert Co.,
which also makes Certs and Clorets, was likely to be harmed by a California
company's continued use of the product names BreathAsure and BreathAsure-D.
</P>
<P>
	   "The name falsely tells the consumer that he or she has assurance of fresher
breath when ingesting one of the defendant's capsules. That is not true," a
three-judge circuit panel ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision expands a 1998 federal court ruling that barred Breath Asure
Inc. from advertising its product as an "internal breath freshener" capsule or
even saying that the capsule works.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert, which wasn't seeking monetary damages, wasn't completely
satisfied with the decision. It appealed, contending the BreathAsure name was as
misleading as the company's advertising, which suggested that bad breath
originates in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
	   Breath Asure, of Westlake Village, Calif., is considering whether to appeal
the decision, said its executive vice president, Anthony Raissen.
</P>
<P>
	   Raissen noted that the company changed its advertising campaign after the
first ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you're David, and they're Goliath, you have to take a back seat
sometimes," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   BreathAsure and BreathAsure-D became widely known in the mid-1990s through a
national advertising campaign that featured actor George Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
	   Breath Asure is privately held and would not disclose sales figures, Raissen
said. Warner-Lambert lawyer Thomas C. Morrison said Thursday that BreathAsure
sales grew from near nothing in 1992 to $29 million by 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert's breath products are among the top sellers in their
categories. In 1999, Listerine had worldwide sales of $487 million; Certs $127
million; Clorets $193 million; and Dentyne $158 million, company spokesman Jason
Ford said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1998 trial, Warner-Lambert produced evidence that forced Breath Asure
to accept limits on its advertising claims.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau found that
no reliable scientific evidence supported Breath Asure's claims that its
capsules were effective, the appellate court noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Breath Asure agreed not to say its product provides users with clean breath,
cleans bad breath for hours, works with the digestive system, is "America's
number one selling breath freshener," among other statements.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge John W. Bissell had declined to bar the product name in
his 1998 ruling, finding that customers tended to buy BreathAsure along with
Warner-Lambert products, not a substitute.
</P>
<P>
	   But the 3rd Circuit said: "Although BreathAsure's ads never mentioned
Warner-Lambert's products by name, they implicitly told consumers to stop
'masking' bad breath with plaintiff's products and start 'attacking it at its
source."'

    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- It wasn't enough for Jamie Lee Curtis to simply
show up at Harvard to receive her Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year Award.
</P>
<P>
	   The actress also had to face Michael Myers, her nemesis from "Halloween,"
the horror film that made her famous.

<HEADLINE> Nazis Stole 600,000 Pieces of Art  </HEADLINE>
    By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Nazis stole 600,000 pieces of art in Germany and the
European lands they occupied during Hitler's 12 years in power, says the U.S.
government's top expert in plundered art from that era.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 200,000 works came from Germany itself, including paintings, sculpture,
objets d'art and tapestries, Jonathan Petropoulose testified Thursday to the
House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Petropoulose, research director on art for the Presidential Commission on
Holocaust Assets in the United States, estimated 100,000 objects came from
Western Europe and 300,000 from Eastern Europe and parts of the Soviet Union,
all occupied by German troops in the war.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronald S. Lauder, chairman of the art recovery program of the World Jewish
Congress, said the German government has agreed to take an active role with the
U.S. commission in trying to return stolen art. He emphasized the complexity of
that effort.
</P>
<P>
	   "In art restitution," he said, "there are no 'Swiss banks' that retained
assets in the face of survivors' pleas, there are no insurance companies that
demanded death certificates from the children of Jews who were gassed by the
Nazis."
</P>
<P>
	   Lauder, a former ambassador to Austria, noted that only last week the North
Carolina Museum of Art agreed to return a 500-year-old painting by Lucas Cranach
the Elder to a pair of aging sisters in Vienna. It had been stolen from their
granduncle 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Petropoulose, who teaches history at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont,
Calif., and has recently published a book on the art world of Nazi Germany, said
his estimates are based on research by himself and others, and the commission
will publish its report later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   He said 43 other governments also have commissions trying to find missing
art.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, now head of an
international commission on insurance money owed to Jewish families from
Nazi-era insurance policies, said a program will begin next week to get started
on the payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission will come out Tuesday with a toll-free phone number and other
details for families to claim payments never made after the policyholders were
killed in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
	   Eagleburger negotiated the program with Jewish representatives and five
European insurance companies that now have subsidiaries in the United States.
They are Assicurazioni Generali of Italy, Allianz of Germany, AXA of France, and
two companies from Switzerland: Winterthur, and Zurich.
</P>
<P>
	   He said there are more insurance companies that operated during the era that
should participate: Aegon, CGU, Gerling, Munich Re, Sorema, Royal &AMP; Sun
Alliance, Swiss Life and Prudential.
</P>
<P>
	   Eagleburger did not release the number of claims he thought there would be,
nor the total number of companies that have failed to pay Holocaust-era
policies. But others have previously put the number of claimants in the hundreds
thousands and the number of companies that may have not paid on policies at
about 20.

<HEADLINE> Veba Shareholders OK Viag Merger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Shareholders of the German utility Veba approved
a merger with rival energy concern Viag to create one of Europe's biggest
electricity suppliers.
</P>
<P>
	   They gave the green light with 90 percent of the vote late Thursday night at
a special shareholders' meeting in Duesseldorf. Viag shareholders will vote on
the merger Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Veba head Ulrich Hartmann said the goal of the merged company is to double
electricity sales to $14.9 billion within five years, as well as continue its
expansion into real estate and telecommunications, as well as other utilities
such as gas and water.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies also aim to become the world's biggest supplier of specialty
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
	   The supervisory boards of both companies approved the $14.6 billion deal in
September. It would not only catapult the two concerns to Germany's No. 1
electricity supplier, ahead of RWE, but it also would become No. 3 in Europe,
after Electricite de France and Enel of Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   German utilities have been under pressure to consolidate to compete better
in Europe's recently liberalized energy market.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened slightly lower today despite a new report
that showed retail sales in January were lower than expected, a sign of moderate
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was unchanged
at 10,643.63.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was down 14.66 at 4,470.97, and the broader

<P>
	   The technology stocks weighing down the Nasdaq this morning included Cisco
Systems, which was down 3 1/4 at 132 11/16, and Microsoft, down 3 1/4 at 102
3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors appeared to have little reaction to new Commerce Department data
that showed Americans spent selectively in January, pushing up retail sales by
just 0.3 percent as they bought less furniture and food but purchased more cars.
</P>
<P>
	   January's performance was weaker than the 0.6 percent rise many analysts
were forecasting and marked the slowest pace since a 0.3 percent increase in
October.
</P>
<P>
	   Since consumer spending accounts for the bulk of economic growth, the report
had been expected to calm some worries about interest rate increases this year.
The Federal Reserve has already raised rates four times since June, hoping to
slow the economy and prevent inflation from accelerating.

stocks, was up 1.07 to 543.28.

<HEADLINE> Memo Cites Paducah Exposure Risk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 1,600 tons of nuclear weapons parts are
scattered around a uranium enrichment complex in Kentucky, possibly posing a
risk of exposure to workers, according to excerpts of a memo published today.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington Post obtained the memo written by Raymond G. Carroll, a
senior manager at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant since 1992, that was sent
to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In it, Carroll said another plant official
told him he was worried about the bomb parts after hearing of their existence
from a Department of Energy official.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll said he was told DOE was investigating the matter but would not
voluntarily share their findings with the plant's managers. ``I find this
situation to be unconscionable,'' Carroll wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   DOE leases part of the complex to U.S. Enrichment Corp., which enriches
uranium for commercial nuclear power plant fuel. When the plant was operated by
the federal government, it also enriched uranium for nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC issued a statement today saying it has discussed the subject with DOE
officials and does not believe any of the materials are stored on its space.
</P>
<P>
	   ``USEC has been assured that DOE is not aware of any condition that creates
radiological hazards to USEC personnel at the site beyond those already known
and controlled,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll wrote that he learned about the bomb parts from radiation protection
manager Orville Cypret, a USEC employee. Carroll stated that Cypret said he
learned about the components from Dale Jackson, who previously managed the plant
for DOE.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll said Cypret told him the weapons components had been shipped to
Paducah since the 1950s. Although some parts were buried, others were in
aboveground storage shelters, Carroll stated. He said the components were not
labeled, in keeping with security policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Personnel could conceivably encounter highly enriched uranium or plutonium
(or even tritium) without ever knowing it,'' Carroll wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post quoted an unidentified DOE official who said the department is
investigating ``classified national security programs'' conducted at Paducah in
the past, along with the Justice and Defense departments.
</P>
<P>
	   Last summer, DOE acknowledged radioactive plutonium and neptunium had
entered the plant in uranium ``tails,'' recycled uranium metal from military
reactors that produced plutonium. But in his statement, Carroll said he was told
``large quantities'' of plutonium and highly enriched uranium had been brought
into the plant ``not just in reactor tails.''
</P>
<P>
	   Disclosure of Carroll's memo comes one day after DOE released a report that
found Paducah workers were exposed to high levels of radiation on the job
between 1952 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   DOE and NRC officials did not immediately return phone calls today from The
Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> NatWest Backing Royal Bank Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- National Westminster Bank PLC gave up its battle for
independence Friday, urging shareholders to accept a $35 billion takeover bid
from Royal Bank of Scotland PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger would create the second-largest bank in Britain in terms of asset
value, behind HSBC. NatWest's assets total $296 billion and The Royal Bank has
$142 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
	   NatWest said it had become clear that a majority of its shareholders would
accept Royal Bank's offer by the deadline of 1 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The board considers that it would not be in shareholders' interests to
remain as a minority in a company that was no longer independent. Accordingly,
the board now advises those shareholders who have not done so to accept the
offer by The Royal Bank of Scotland," NatWest Group said in an announcement to
the Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Shareholders had not warmed to a rival bid by the Bank of Scotland, which
had moved first against NatWest with a hostile bid in September. The Bank of
Scotland's chief executive, criticized NatWest as an underperforming giant which
required aggressive new management.
</P>
<P>
	   Royal Bank made its first offer in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the two bids were very close in value.
</P>
<P>
	   But the battle effectively ended on Tuesday, when The Royal Bank won support
from Schroders, the second-largest shareholder in NatWest, and No. 3 shareholder
Mercury Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
	   The Royal Bank, whose largest shareholder is a Spanish bank, Banco Santander
Central Hispano, would hold 37.8 percent of the combined group, with NatWest
shareholders controlling the remaining 62.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Royal Bank has said it expected to cut 18,000 jobs in the combined
operation. NatWest announced it would cut 15,000 jobs as part of its campaign
for independence. It wasn't clear to what extent those two figures overlapped.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Burt conceded in a memo to staff that Bank of Scotland had lost
the battle -- though technically Bank of Scotland remains in the running until
the Monday deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   "You will have heard that we have lost our bid for Natwest. This saddens us,
but we are far from downhearted," Burt wrote.

<HEADLINE> Dell Shifting Focus to Internet  </HEADLINE>
    By CONNIE MABIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. reported profits that met analysts
reduced expectations. Revenue increased 31 percent, which represented a slowdown
for Dell, largely because of chip supply problem and a post-Y2K sales slowdown.
</P>
<P>
	   To deliver robust growth in the future, Dell -- known for pioneering direct
sales of personal computers -- will give new attention to providing
Internet-related customer services and products, said Dell vice chairman Kevin
Rollins. He pointed to an announcement earlier this week that the company was
forming a sales division dedicated to the needs of large dot-com companies and
other high-tech firms as evidence of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman and CEO Michael Dell said selling online is only part of the
company's plans to utilize the Internet in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "Customers are increasingly demanding the type of direct relationship we
pioneered in this industry, and the Internet is enhancing that preference," he
said. "Analysts estimate that U.S. companies alone will spend $200 billion
annually on their Internet infrastructures by 2003, a sizeable portion of which
will be for server and storage hardware. That trend plays directly to our
strength as the No. 2 and fastest-growing major provider of servers in the
United States and the world."
</P>
<P>
	   Dell's net income for the three months ended Jan. 28 was $436 million, or 16
cents a share, compared to $425 million, or 15 cents per share, a year ago, the
company reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The results include an investment gain equal to 1 cent per share, the
company said. Excluding that gain, Dell matched the revised analyst estimate of
15 cents per share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Round Rock, Texas-based Dell announced two weeks ago that earnings would not
meet expectations, because of problems getting computer chips and
slower-than-expected post Y2K sales. Analysts had been expecting earnings for
the quarter would be 21 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported revenue of about $6.8 billion for the fourth quarter,
up from $5.17 billion in prior-year period.
</P>
<P>
	   Online sales accounted for nearly 50 percent of revenue and averaged $40
million per day, up from $14 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Although revenue grew 38 percent in fiscal 1999 to $25.2 billion compared
the prior year, Dell shares have fallen about 30 percent from its 52-week high
of $54.31 1/4. This morning on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Dell was down about 80
cents per share at $38.
</P>
<P>
	   Barry Jaruzelski, an analyst with Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton in New York, said
Thursday he expects revenue growth at Dell will slow from its previous torrid
pace, but that doesn't mean stockholders should go rushing to unload their
shares.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody goes through some level of maturation," Jaruzelski said. "It was
not possible to keep up with that level of staggering growth, but it's still
staggering."
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that the one thing we can agree with is that it's probably not
logical for a company of our size to continue growing at 50 percent a year,"
Rollins said.

	   Retail Sales Rise 0.3 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans spent more carefully in January
pushing up retail sales by 0.3 percent as they trimmed purchases of
furniture and food but bought more cars. Total retail sales rose to
a seasonally adjusted $262.2 billion last month and followed a huge
and bigger than previously estimated 1.7 percent gain in December,
the Commerce Department said today. January's performance was
weaker than the 0.6 percent gain many analysts were forecasting and
marked the slowest pace since a 0.3 percent gain in October.

EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 68.57 at 10,575.06.
The Nasdaq composite index was down 54.12 at 4,431.51. Investors
appeared to have little reaction to new Commerce Department data

retail sales by just 0.3 percent as they bought less furniture and
food but purchased more cars.

	   Blast Damages Wall Street Windows
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- An explosive device went off in front of a Wall
Street office building early today, shattering windows and causing
one minor injury. Some sort of device exploded at 4:40 a.m. in
front of a building on the corner of Wall and Water streets, blocks
from the New York Stock Exchange in the city's Financial District.
Windows were blown out in the building, at 75 Wall St., and in
neighboring 95 Wall St. A spokesman for Barclays Bank said the
British company owned the building, but did not have any offices in
it. J.P. Morgan and Dresdner Bank are among the companies with
office space in the roughly 40-story building.

	   MONTREAL (AP) -- Abitibi-Consolidated Inc., the leading North
American newsprint maker, is buying the continent's third-biggest
producer, Donohue Inc. , for about $4 billion in cash and stock.
The combined company would control about 35 percent of North
American newsprint production capacity, or double the capacity of
the No. 2 producer Bowater Inc. of Greenville, S.C. Donohue is one
of the most efficient forest companies in North America. Abitibi
lost money last year because of lower paper prices and a
restructuring that included eliminating 10 percent of its jobs.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The nation's airlines are under a federal

planes were found to have equipment damage similar to that on
Alaska Flight 261. The Federal Aviation Administration order
announced yesterday covers all MD-80, MD-90, DC-9 and 717 series
jetliners -- about 1,100 planes or one-fifth of the nation's

now in its third day, while union members say it is taking a toll
on the aerospace giant. Members of the Society of Professional
Engineering Employees in Aerospace walked off the job Wednesday
after contract negotiations with a federal mediator broke down. The
Federal Aviation Administration has suspended authority delegated

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Unnerved by a rash of hacker attacks on the
world's leading Web sites, big Internet companies rushed to
strengthen their computer systems yesterday in a high-tech game of
cat-and-mouse with the phantom perpetrators. Taking advantage of an
apparent lull in major disruptions, big Web companies and
government agencies stepped up training of technicians in detecting
unusual activity. Others installed advanced software filters to
detect and block delivery of suspicious electronic data. No major
new outages surfaced yesterday, though related disruptions emerged
after the three-day spree that briefly downed the popular Yahoo!
destination, eBay's auction site, ETrade's online brokerage, the
ZDNet technology news site and others.

<P>
	   HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week generally
higher today, with the key index closing at a record high in Hong
Kong over rumors of a possible takeover battle for the territory's
largest telecommunications company. Shares rose on a report that
Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa plans to form a group to bid for 54
percent of Hong Kong's Cable and Wireless HKT, which is controlled
by Britain's Cable and Wireless PLC. Hutchison's parent company,
Cheung Kong Holdings, denied the report. The Hang Seng Index, the
Hong Kong market's key indicator of blue chips, rose 535.13 points,
or 3.2 percent, to close at 17,380.30 after reaching an all-time
intraday high of 17,653.65. The Taipei market's main Taipei
Weighted Stock Price Index rose 71 points, or 0.70 percent, to
10,128.67, its highest closing level since April 6, 1990, when the

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Down. Wjeat Jogjer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean prices declined in early dealings today on the
Chicago Board of Trade on an improved outlook for crops in South America. Grains
were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasts for rain this weekend in key soybean-growing regions of Brazil and
Argentina pressured soybean futures. February is a key month for moisture in the
region, and repeated showers have reduced concerns about drought damage.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans' decline was expected to be limited by today's slightly bullish
supply-and-demand report issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn was marginally lower in early trading after the USDA reported an
increase in corn stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat continued to be buoyed by dry weather in the southern Plains states
and by declining world wheat stocks.

fell  1/4 cent to $2.25 1/4 a bushel; March oats fell  1/4 cent to $1.10 a

<P>
	   January's performance was weaker than the 0.6 percent rise many analysts

	   Since consumer spending accounts for the bulk of economic growth, the report

<HEADLINE> International Custody Fights on Rise  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE KOIDIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Like the father of Elian Gonzalez, Steve Fenton knows
what it's like to fight to get a child back from a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
	   Fenton's estranged wife took their 6-year-old son to southern Mexico for
Christmas one year and called to say they weren't coming back.
</P>
<P>
	   After more than a year of battling in U.S. courts and the State Department,
he went to Mexico, grabbed the boy and got on a plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was the most dramatic experience I ever went through in my life,'' says
Fenton, a 40-year-old building contractor from the San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
	   Fenton is among thousands of American parents whose spouses have fled with
their children to distant lands. In many cases, the parents have found it
impossible to retrieve their children even though they have international law on
their side.
</P>
<P>
	   Accompanied by six parents with cases similar to Fenton's, Rep. Nick Lampson
discussed the issue this week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Lampson, D-Texas, said Elian's highly publicized case provides an
opportunity to raise awareness about the estimated 10,000 American children who
have been taken abroad by one parent without the consent of the other.
</P>
<P>
	   Fenton's case differs from that of Cuban Juan Miguel Gonzalez -- the father
of 6-year-old Elian -- because Fenton's son should have been returned under
terms of the 1980 Hague Convention treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   The international agreement among 54 countries established procedures for
returning abducted children. Cuba is not among the signatories, but Mexico is --
and the State Department says it is one of the most serious violators of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   While the United States has honored at least 80 percent of Mexican return
requests in recent years, Mexico has honored about 3 percent of U.S. requests,
according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a
Virginia-based nonprofit group partially funded by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Mexican Embassy called the figures ``outrageously
exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Antonio Zabalgoitia cited statistics showing both countries had about a
50 percent return rate last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think an accusation of Mexico being noncompliant with the Hague
Convention stands,'' he said. ``I think if we judge by results, we actually have
an outstanding performance.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added that Mexico has adjusted its legal system to better comply with the
Hague regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   By early next month, the General Accounting Office -- the investigative arm
of Congress -- is expected to release a report on the U.S. government's response
to international parental child abductions.
</P>
<P>
	   Lampson said legislation is needed to help American parents who are victims
in international abduction cases, though he doesn't yet have any specific
proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates for parents like Fenton say problems in getting children back from
Mexico include judges uneducated about the Hague treaty, a lack of officials who
can look for children and a lack of money that prevents some authorities from
even getting a working fax machine.
</P>
<P>
	   Any improvements in the way such situations are handled would be welcome
news to Fenton, who chronicled his experience in a three-part series that ran
last year in El Paso Inc., a weekly newspaper published by his older brother,
Tom.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Fenton's wife, a native of Mexico, left with their son in December
1992, they had joint custody.
</P>
<P>
	   After she called the next month to say she wasn't coming back, Fenton filed
for and was awarded custody of his son, Stephen. He also sought help from the
State Department, citing the Hague treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   For several months, he was told that authorities in Jalapa, Mexico, would
act on the petition and his son would be returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, he said he received explanations -- the boy wasn't home when agents
arrived; a local order granted custody to his wife; taking the boy would violate
the mother's constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Fenton gave up on the legal process. He paid $51,000 to a man who arranged a
``snatchback'' in April 1994. Risking arrest by Mexican authorities, Fenton went
to Mexico, took Stephen off a school bus and brought him home.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after they returned, Fenton put Stephen in counseling to help him
cope with the ordeal.

<HEADLINE> Gene Therapy AIDS Exposure Probed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration is investigating whether
a gene therapy experiment could have accidentally exposed young cancer patients
to the AIDS virus -- but stressed today that suggestions of contamination are
preliminary.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital learned that
independent testing of samples of the gene-based medicine might be contaminated
with HIV or the hepatitis C virus, The Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Jude notified the FDA on Feb. 4 of the problem, and mailed samples to
the federal agency for more thorough testing that began Thursday, an FDA
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said today.
</P>
<P>
	   These types of initial tests often give false results, so the FDA's tests
are important to clear up whether the gene-based medicine actually was
contaminated, the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
	   It could take up two weeks to prove whether the cancer patients were
actually exposed to the dangerous viruses, the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, officials at St. Jude in Memphis and Baylor College of Medicine
in Houston, which also participated in the study, began notifying families of
the possible problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA has suspended the study at both locations, and is investigating
whether the study was performed correctly, including whether researchers
notified the government quickly enough when they saw signs of possible
contamination.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement today, St. Jude said: "There is no evidence that any of the
children who were treated were harmed in any way by the vaccine."
</P>
<P>
	   The Memphis hospital said the possible level of contamination was so small
"that even if it represented biologically active virus particles, the risk to
the patients would be extremely low."
</P>
<P>
	   The gene therapy given to more than two dozen young cancer patients was
administered in a special virus called adenovirus. The question is whether,
during manufacturing, this adenovirus somehow became contaminated with HIV or
hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
	   Claire Bassett, a spokeswoman for Baylor, said Thursday night that the
contamination evidence had come from St. Jude, and that there had been no
contamination found in the therapy given to the six children treated at Baylor.
Two of the children treated at Baylor have since died of cancer, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything that took place that the FDA has a concern about did take place
at Memphis," Bassett said.
</P>
<P>
	   Laura Bowman, the study's principal investigator at St. Jude, was quoted by
the Post as saying that all the volunteer cancer patients had been near death
and only a handful of the 20 patients she treated are alive today, the rest
having died from their cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Institutes of Health was already investigating St. Jude for its
handling of patient deaths in a different study, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cancer patients suffered from neuroblastoma, a brain cancer that is the
second most common childhood malignancy. The experimental therapy involved
removing a patient's own tumor cells and inserting an immune system gene with a
gene-altered virus. The modified cells were put back in the patient to galvanize
the immune system to fight the cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowman said she discovered last fall that the two most recent volunteers --
a child and a teen-ager treated a year ago -- received viruses that had been
processed incorrectly and could have been contaminated.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she could find no evidence that the original batch of cells from
1995 used to grow the viruses had been properly screened for contamination. In
November, she sent cells from the original batch for testing at an outside lab,
which sent back results that twice showed the presence of DNA from HIV and HCV.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she decided to contact the FDA last week when further test results
were slow to arrive.
</P>
<P>
	   Malcolm Brenner, who initiated the study while at St. Jude and continued the
work at Baylor, told the Post he doubted the initial test results, but if the
contamination was real it could have been caused by HIV-infected blood in the
laboratory being accidentally splashed on the viruses.
</P>
<P>
	   The surviving volunteers would probably only need AIDS testing if further
tests confirm the contamination, Bowman said.

<P>
    MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Midwest Express Airlines canceled 15 flights in the face
of a strike deadline that could result in 320 pilots walking out tonight.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots could strike at 11:01 p.m. if no deal is reached through
negotiations with the National Mediation Board in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourteen of the 15 canceled flights were to either depart from or arrive in
Milwaukee's Mitchell International Airport, Midwest Express' hub, the airline
advised callers to its flight information telephone line today.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline, based in Oak Creek, canceled the flights Thursday so the planes
would not be away from their bases in Milwaukee; Omaha, Neb.; and Kansas City,
Mo., in the event of a strike, spokeswoman Lisa Bailey told the Milwaukee
Journal Sentinel. She did not immediately return calls today from The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 passengers held tickets on the flights, Bailey told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between the airline and the Air Line Pilots Association, which have
been going on for 19 months, resumed Tuesday and were continuing today. The
contract would be the first between the two.
</P>
<P>
	   Union officials have said the major unresolved issues are pensions, wages
and health insurance for retirees.
</P>
<P>
	   There was informational picketing this morning at the Milwaukee airport.

<HEADLINE> German Inflation Highest Since 1997  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German inflation rose to 1.6 percent last year
from 0.9 percent in 1998, the federal statistics bureau reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the highest annual inflation since prices rose 2.0 percent in 1997,
and the report rekindled fears that prices are rising too fast.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the 1999 figure came in slightly below government forecasts of a 1.7
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
	   News about climbing inflation comes just a week after the European Central
Bank raised interest rates to try and check higher prices in the 11 countries
using Europe's common currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   The ECB manipulates the interest rate in an effort to keep inflation below 2
percent in the 11 countries that adopted the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   Raising interest rates tends to cool off inflation. But higher interest
rates could also stifle the fragile recovery of the beleaguered European economy
by making it more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   German finance minister Hans Eichel has predicted that inflation in Germany
would hover between 1 percent and 1.5 percent this year, and level out after an
early spike attributed to increased oil prices.

<HEADLINE> White House Room Named for Brady  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Surrounded by President Clinton and a phalanx of press
secretaries, James Brady returned to the White House today to see its press
briefing room renamed in his honor.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady, the press secretary who was severely wounded during an assassination
attempt on President Reagan in 1981, recalled saying that he missed the White
House press corps when he attended a ribbon cutting ceremony 18 years ago in the
same room that now bears his name.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, actually I said I miss SOME of you,'' Brady said. ``Today, I still
miss SOME of you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before posing for photographers, Brady glanced back stiffly from his
wheelchair to see Clinton lift a dark velvet drape and reveal a large bronze
plaque with a White House insignia that read ``James S. Brady Press Briefing
Room.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton praised Brady for turning his own suffering into a crusade against
gun violence that has made the nation a safer place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jim Brady is living proof that you can't kill courage, that it takes more
than a cheap handgun to destroy a strong spirit,'' Clinton said. ``His ready
smile and sense of humor had to overcome despair that none of us can fully
understand, and pain that many of us never really experienced.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also on hand for today's ceremony were Joe Lockhart, the current press
secretary, and former spokesmen Mike McCurry, Larry Speakes, Jerald terHorst and
Pierre Salinger. Brady said he felt compelled to share the honor with his
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Only those who have served in this position know what a tough job it is,''
Brady said. ``It makes being between a rock and a hard place seem like heaven.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton joked that Brady deserves credit for making the press corps
``abandon decades of tradition and actually raise their hands when they wanted
to ask a question.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Joe and I also thought about enacting another one of Jim's ideas, that he
and President Reagan advocated: hinging the floor to give deserving reporters
immediate, involuntary access to the swimming pool below,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The briefing room, normally chocked with photographic gear, newspapers and
idle TV cameras, was cleared of clutter and given new carpet and a fresh coat of
paint for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady's picture has hung in the briefing room since Nov. 9, 1981, when the
area was reopened after a three-month renovation. On that day, Reagan and his
wife, Nancy, came to the briefing room to join Brady at a ribbon-cutting
ceremony. Brady was still recovering from injuries suffered in the March 30,
1981, shooting outside the Washington Hilton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady and his wife, Sarah, have joined Clinton on many occasions to press
for tougher gun controls. The most prominent measure was the Brady law, which
established a five-day waiting period and background checks on handgun
purchasers.
</P>
<P>
	   Sarah Brady is the chairwoman of Handgun Control, which bills itself as the
nation's largest citizen's gun control lobbying organization.

<HEADLINE> Conductor Quits Oslo Philharmonic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Renowned violinist Mariss Jansons said Friday he was
quitting as musical director of the Oslo Philharmonic after 20 years to protest
poor conditions, notably bad acoustics at the city-owned Oslo Concert House.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hard for me to understand why no one here in the city cares about us
when we have respect and acknowledgment around the world," the Norwegian news
agency NTB quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Jansons, who has been musical director since 1979, the Oslo
Philharmonic became what many see as a world class orchestra, with frequent
international tours. He said he would still conduct concerts already scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   The Latvian-born Jansons said he has complained about the Oslo Concert House
for two decades without anything being done about it.
</P>
<P>
	   "The whole time I hoped conditions would improve, but now I simply can't
stand it anymore," Jansons, 56, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to his duties in Oslo, Jansons was named music director of the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in the United States in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   He has been associate principal conductor of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic
Orchestra in Russia since 1973, and was principal guest conductor of the London
Philharmonic Orchestra in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Parts May Be Buried in Ky.  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 1,600 tons of nuclear weapons hardware may be
buried on a 3,000-acre Energy Department site in Kentucky, posing new safety
risks, according to a letter sent to federal regulators by a senior health
safety official.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources familiar with the issue said today that the concerns were raised by
the official after he had learned of the buried weapons parts only recently,
although some of the material dates back to the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
	   The official, Raymond G. Carroll, a senior manager of health and safety
programs at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, declined to comment when
reached at his office. The plant is operated and leased by a private company,
but the 3,000-acre site belongs to the government and is the focus of major
environmental cleanup activities left over from Cold War uranium processing
activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources who have seen Carroll's memo to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
said that the official had raised concerns of potential safety risks after being
told that 1,600 tons of ``special nuclear related hardware'' had been dumped at
the site and was the focus of a classified investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not making any comments,'' said Carroll, an employee of U.S.
Enrichment Corp. (USEC), the private company that operates the uranium
enrichment plant in Paducah.
</P>
<P>
	   Other sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the nuclear weapons
hardware apparently is located within a 750-acre fenced-in area within the
3,000-acre site.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, the Energy Department confirmed the existence of ``an
underground classified storage site at Paducah'' that is being examined by the
department, the Pentagon and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   One government source said the reference referred to weapons components but
declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Energy Department with the DOD and Justice are looking at classified
national security programs conducted in the past at Paducah. That includes
reviewing materials and quantities involved,'' said the DOE statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The concerns raised by Carroll were first reported in today's Washington
Post, which said it had obtained a copy of the memo written by Carroll to the
NRC.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a source familiar with the case, Carroll had wanted to raise
the issue with the NRC because of concern that the weapons material could pose
yet another danger to workers at the gaseous diffusion plant.
</P>
<P>
	   NRC spokeswoman Sue Gagner said she was aware a letter concerning the
Paducah site was being sent to the agency, but that it had not yet been
received.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Post, Carroll wrote the letter after being told by a
superior that he had been told by a senior Energy Department official at the
Paducah facility about the nuclear weapons hardware being at the site.
</P>
<P>
	   While DOE had been investigating the matter, government officials did not
inform workers or management of USEC of details about what had been found.
Officials of USEC learned of the material only recently, although exactly when
could not immediately be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I find this situation to be unconscionable,'' Carroll wrote in the letter,
according to the Post.
</P>
<P>
	   DOE leases part of the complex to USEC, a private company that had been sold
by the government two years ago. USEC is the country's only processor of uranium
for commercial nuclear power plant fuel. When the plant was operated by the
federal government, it also enriched uranium for nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC issued a statement today saying it has discussed the subject with DOE
officials and does not believe any of the materials are stored on its space -- a
250-acre complex of mostly buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``USEC has been assured that DOE is not aware of any condition that creates
radiological hazards to USEC personnel at the site beyond those already known
and controlled,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll reportedly learned about the bomb parts from USEC radiation
protection manager Orville Cypret, who had learned about the components from
Dale Jackson, a senior DOE official at the plant site.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Post, Cypret told Carroll that while some of the weapons
components were buried, others were in above-ground storage shelters, and that
some of the material was not labeled, in keeping with Cold War-era security
policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Personnel could conceivably encounter highly enriched uranium or plutonium
(or even tritium) without ever knowing it,'' Carroll wrote, according to the
Post.
</P>
<P>
	   The Paducah plant has been the focus of an investigation concerning the
exposure of plant workers to radioactive plutonium and neptunium during the Cold
War years. The material was mixed with recycled uranium metal from military
reactors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Energy Department on Thursday, released a report that found Paducah
workers were exposed to high levels of radiation on the job between 1952 and
1990 at the uranium processing plants.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower today despite a new report that showed
retail sales in January were lower than expected. Analysts said stock investors
had little reaction to this sign of moderate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 49.64 at
10,593.99, with Microsoft suffering the biggest point drop.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was down 35.41 at 4,450.22, and the broader
market index, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, slipped 9.62 to 1,407.21.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, especially computer and software companies, were broadly
lower. Microsoft was down 4 59/64 at 100 5/64, Cisco Systems, was down 3 13/16
at 132 1/8, and Hewlett Packard was 2 1/2 lower at 123 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we are getting is some very, very long overdue profit taking in the
superstars in the technology and Intenet sectors," said Alfred E. Goldman, chief
market strategist, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. "The question is whether or not this
is going to be a half-a-day phenomenon, or a week- or two-week pullback."
</P>
<P>
	   While stock investors appeared to shrug off the Commerce Department's retail
sales data, the bond traders liked the news that Americans spent selectively in
January, pushing sales up by just 0.3 percent as they bought less furniture and
food but purchased more cars.
</P>
<P>
	   January's performance was weaker than the 0.6 percent rise many analysts
forecast and marked the slowest pace since a 0.3 percent increase in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Since consumer spending accounts for the bulk of economic growth, the report
had been expected to calm some worries about interest rate increases this year.
The Federal Reserve has already raised rates four times since June, hoping to
slow the economy and prevent inflation from accelerating.
</P>
<P>
	   "That is certainly a longer-term positive" report, said Goldman.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of smaller company
stocks, gave up its gains of the morning and was down 0.33 to 541.88.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining stocks slightly outnumbered advancing stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange, where volume totaled 404.08 million shares, slightly lower than the
466.80 million shares the same time Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Swap Deadline Extended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Mannesmann AG said Friday its chief executive
will get a $30 million severance package after the German wireless company is
acquired by Britain's Vodafone AirTouch PLC in a record $180 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
	   Klaus Esser, who hammered out the deal last week after refusing Vodafone's
overtures for more than two months, is expected to step down from the merged
company after a five-month transition period.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, a French newspaper reported that France Telecom is planning to
bid for Orange PLC, a British mobile phone company that was being acquired by
Mannesmann, but will likely be put back up for sale due to the Vodafone merger.
</P>
<P>
	   "The acquisition would perfectly complement our investment in (British cable
operator) NTL," Jean-Louis Vinciguerra, France Telecom's vice president for
finance told Les Echos daily in an interview published Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone has conceded from the outset of its takeover bid for Mannesmann
that it would need to sell off Orange to allay concerns that one company would
flex too much muscle in Britain's mobile phone market.
</P>
<P>
	   Vinciguerra asserted that France Telecom would be aggressive in its bid amid
the high-flying price tags for companies in the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
	   France Telecom said last year it would invest $5.5 billion in NTL in an
effort to expand its foothold in Britain's consolidating cable market. The
investment makes the French operator NTL's biggest shareholder, with a stake of
about 25 percent.

actors get, the one where you're on stage and you can't remember any of your
lines.
</P>
<P>
	   No, what makes Beatty wake up in a cold sweat is the dream that he is
starring in a play whose outcome is unknown to him.
</P>
<P>
	   "To me, acting is storytelling," he explains. "How can you tell a story when
you don't how it ends?"
</P>
<P>
	   Feeling this way makes for tough going as a regular on a TV series,
especially one as open-ended as "Homicide: Life on the Street." For six years,
this celebrated crime drama never stopped evolving, never stopped experimenting
as it lurched from one ratings-challenged season to the next.
</P>
<P>
	   No wonder Beatty, who played crusty Detective Stanley Bolander in the
Baltimore police Homicide Unit, left in 1995, after three seasons. "I couldn't
hack it."
</P>
<P>
	   But now he's back, reprising "Big Man" Bolander for what appears to truly be
the end of the "Homicide" story. Closure. Curtain.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, at least. Even after being canceled last season, "Homicide" has
cheated death yet again with a new, two-hour feature (maybe -- who knows? -- the
first in a series).
</P>
<P>
	   As a fitting prelude to this film, Court TV (which airs reruns of "Homicide"
weeknights at 9 p.m. EST) will present the series' final two episodes Sunday
from 6 to 8 p.m. EST. Then the stirring, mostly satisfying "Homicide: The Movie"
premieres on NBC at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   When invited to take part, "I kind of wanted to say no," admits Beatty,
speaking from his home north of Los Angeles. "But my agent, God bless her, let
me know that a refusal would be completely without charm."
</P>
<P>
	   He wasn't alone. Joining Beatty is every other "Homicide" alumnus, some two
dozen members of what became a revolving-door ensemble during the series' seven
seasons. Returnees even include Jon Polito (whose character, Detective Steve
Crosetti, was written out as a suicide after the second season) and Daniel
Baldwin (who until 1995 played Detective Beau Felton, killed in the line of
duty).
</P>
<P>
	   What accounts for this impressive show of unity? On the narrative level --
natch -- a crime.
</P>
<P>
	   As the film begins, Lt. Al Giardello, who for much of the series was the
towering, respected shift commander, is running for mayor of Baltimore. But at
an outdoor rally, he's gunned down.
</P>
<P>
	   Everyone wants to help catch the shooter. Up pops Bolander, bored to death
with retirement and his salt-free diet. Here is Detective Kay Howard (played by
the long-departed Melissa Leo), over from the Fugitive Squad. Here, after two
years' absence, is Frank Pembleton (Andre Braugher), an unsurpassed detective
who left the department emotionally shattered and has since become a college
prof.
</P>
<P>
	   With all present and accounted for, the gunman remains on the loose as
Giardello's life hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
	   From his home in Baltimore, Yaphet Kotto, who plays Giardello, recalls when
"Homicide" creator Tom Fontana phoned last summer to say he planned to write
another script, that "Homicide" was coming back. "I said, 'Great!'
</P>
<P>
	   "But when I began reading the script," confides Kotto, "I felt a fist
connect with my stomach. I told myself, 'I don't want to read any more, just let
me turn to the last page."'
</P>
<P>
	   Giardello and his fate are at the heart of the story. But equally important,
as it turns out, is the plight of Tim Bayliss.
</P>
<P>
	   Detective Bayliss had joined the squad as something of an innocent when the
series began, then matured as a cop under the tutelage of Pembleton, his
partner. Along the way, he embarked upon a twisting, turning personal journey.
Bisexuality. Buddhism. Then an all-consuming bitterness.
</P>
<P>
	   In the series' final episode, Bayliss took an abrupt leave of absence,
taking with him his demons and a dreadful secret. But he, too, rushes back to
help. Then, the crime solved, he unburdens himself on his former partner in the
film's most powerful scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Pembleton had explained that he quit the force because he couldn't
bear to hear another criminal's confession.
</P>
<P>
	   "Time for one more confession, Frank," Tim tells him now.
</P>
<P>
	   In truth, Bayliss' sabbatical was a device for writing him out of the
series. Even if "Homicide" had been renewed for this season, Kyle Secor meant to
leave.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Secor couldn't resist being part of the film. And part of the reunion.
"I wanted to see what it would be like for all the characters to relate anew,"
he says from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   So many "Homicide" regulars had fallen away through the years -- "and in
some cases when they left we WANTED them to leave," notes Secor with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had people who were committed to doing the best work possible," he says.
"When you have that, you have an awful lot of creative tension. When you showed
up on the set in the early days, you almost didn't even have to act, there was
so much (crap) happening." He laughs again.
</P>
<P>
	   With everyone back in the fold for the movie, "there obviously was knowledge
of all the history that we shared," Secor says. "But there was also this
incredible feeling. From what I could see, everyone just loved being around each
other.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was like -- what's the word for when everything is forgiven?
Absolution?"
</P>
<P>
	   Now, for a viewer to miss the film would be unforgivable.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Reviews Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is studying whether racial minorities
unfairly get more federal death sentences than white offenders and whether it
should suspend executions until the results are in.
</P>
<P>
	   So far the review, ordered by Attorney General Janet Reno two months ago
with no public announcement, is not a moratorium on executions like that
declared recently by Illinois Gov. George Ryan in his state, Deputy Attorney
General Eric Holder said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   But the White House says President Clinton is considering a Democratic
senator's request for a suspension of federal death penalties pending the
outcome of a study like the one Reno ordered.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure that the system is as fair as it can be,'' Holder
told a news conference. ``It's a historical study of the federal system with an
emphasis on finding out whether or not there are inappropriate racial
disparities'' in the federal capital punishment system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The study was ordered by the attorney general, I'd say almost out of an
abundance of caution,'' said Holder, who is leading the racial disparity review.
``We don't have anything to our knowledge that gives us reason to believe that
there is a disparity within the system. But we want to make sure that is so.''
</P>
<P>
	   Holder said the study would not prevent the Bureau of Prisons from setting
an execution date for any of the 21 people on the federal death row at the U.S.
penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. Two-thirds of those prisoners are minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   With appeals under way, no dates have been set for their executions.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno established an elaborate Justice Department review system for deciding
whether to seek death penalties, including private hearings for defendants'
lawyers. But the final decision belongs to her.
</P>
<P>
	   Though she personally opposes the death penalty, Reno has authorized federal
prosecutors to seek death penalties in 149 cases, out of 517 reviewed under her
procedure.
</P>
<P>
	   The last federal execution was in 1963. In 1972, The Supreme Court ruled the
death penalty had been unfairly applied. State and federal procedures were
revised, so the high court restored the death penalty on the federal level in
1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., introduced legislation that would allow
death row inmates to introduce new DNA evidence in an attempt to prove their
innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People of good conscience can and will disagree on the morality of the
death penalty,'' said Leahy. ``But I am confident that we should all be able to
agree that a system that may sentence one innocent person to death for every
seven it executes has no place in a civilized society.''
</P>
<P>
	   Leahy was joined at the news conference by Kirk Bloodsworth, who after nine
years in prison was the first capital-murder defendant freed as a result of DNA
testing, and Clyde Charles who spent 18 years in prison before DNA testing led
to proof of his innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 4, Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president is concerned
about the issues raised by Illinois' decision and will consider putting federal
executions on hold.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension request came in a letter from Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and
is being studied by the White House counsel, Lockhart said. He added there's no
guarantee Clinton will act soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Feingold based his request on Ryan's halt of executions in Illinois until
authorities determine whether the death penalty is administered fairly. Since
1977, Illinois has executed 12 prisoners. But 13 Illinois death row inmates have
been exonerated since 1987 through appeals, DNA evidence or, in a few cases,
persistent investigation by college journalism students.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationally, 85 people have been freed from death row since 1973, according
to the Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Feingold asked that Clinton suspend federal executions and have Reno
thoroughly review how the federal death penalty has been used.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before the federal government executes anyone, the Justice Department
should be absolutely certain that innocents have not been condemned to death,''
Feingold wrote.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Exec To Get $30M Package  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Mannesmann AG said Friday its chief executive
will get a $30 million severance package after the German wireless company is
acquired by Britain's Vodafone AirTouch PLC in a record $180 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
	   Klaus Esser, who hammered out the deal last week after refusing Vodafone's
overtures for more than two months, is expected to step down from the merged
company after a five-month transition period.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, a French newspaper reported that France Telecom is planning to
bid for Orange PLC, a British mobile phone company that was being acquired by
Mannesmann, but will likely be put back up for sale due to the Vodafone merger.
</P>
<P>
	   "The acquisition would perfectly complement our investment in (British cable
operator) NTL," Jean-Louis Vinciguerra, France Telecom's vice president for
finance told Les Echos daily in an interview published Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone has conceded from the outset of its takeover bid for Mannesmann
that it would need to sell off Orange to allay concerns that one company would
flex too much muscle in Britain's mobile phone market.
</P>
<P>
	   Vinciguerra asserted that France Telecom would be aggressive in its bid amid
the high-flying price tags for companies in the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
	   France Telecom said last year it would invest $5.5 billion in NTL in an
effort to expand its foothold in Britain's consolidating cable market. The
investment makes the French operator NTL's biggest shareholder, with a stake of
about 25 percent.

<HEADLINE> New MRI Scans Reveal Strokes  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Super-sharp scanning machines are giving doctors a clear
new window into the brains of stroke victims, revealing strokes that are missed
three-quarters of the time by older scanners.
</P>
<P>
	   The device is a kind of souped-up MRI machine that can pinpoint spots of
dying tissue deep within the brain during the first hours of a stroke, when a
blood clot somewhere in the head is choking off the oxygen supply.
</P>
<P>
	   Until recently, diagnosing strokes was a leisurely affair, since doctors
could do almost nothing for them. That changed about three years ago, when they
learned that the clot-dissolving medicine TPA can reverse a stroke, just as it
does a heart attack, if given within the first few hours of symptoms.
</P>
<P>
	   Suddenly, doctors want better tools to make on-the-spot decisions about
care. This made the new MRI machines a major topic of discussion Friday at a
meeting in New Orleans of the American Stroke Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "The question is, is it really worth the effort?" said Dr. David C. Tong of
Stanford University. "There is no doubt you can see a lot more stuff. But does
seeing all that actually make a difference?"
</P>
<P>
	   The answer from Tong's research and other work at the conference seems to be
yes. They say the new machines, while expensive, offer information that helps
doctors make more intelligent decisions for victims of strokes, which hit an
estimated 700,000 Americans annually.
</P>
<P>
	   The new technology comes in two varieties: Diffusion-weighted imaging shows
exactly which brain tissue is already dead. Perfusion-weighted imaging shows the
parts of the brain that are still alive but starved of blood. Both work by
measuring how easily water flows through the brain.
</P>
<P>
	   Standard magnetic resonance imaging machines that many hospitals already own
can be upgraded to take the new scans for roughly $500,000. New MRIs now come
with the new capabilities built in, and they cost between $1 million and $3
million. The pictures themselves take just a few minutes and cost the same as
ordinary MRI scans, roughly $1,000 to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hospitals are getting this technology as they upgrade their scanners,"
which they do about very five years, said Dr. Alison Elizabeth Baird of Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Candice J. Perkins of Syracuse University-New York Stony Brook reviewed
the results of the new scans on 118 stroke patients. During the critical first
six hours, the scans revealed strokes that would have been missed three-quarters
of the time by CT scans, now the standard method of checking stroke patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Many strokes are apparent by symptoms alone, such as paralysis and slurred
speech, and doctors use this to guide treatment. But Perkins said the new scans
have prompted doctors to give TPA when otherwise they would not.
</P>
<P>
	   Strokes are more likely to show up on CT scans as time passes. However,
Perkins' work found that even a day later, one-third of strokes can be seen only
on the new MRI scans.
</P>
<P>
	   Tong looked at how the new scans affected treatment decisions at the
Stanford Stroke Center. He reviewed 39 cases and found that in one-third, the
new information prompted major changes in the way they were treated. The scans
were especially useful in revealing strokes that arise from blood clots
originating in the heart, since these strokes are treated with different drugs
than other kinds of strokes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ordinarily, doctors give CT scans first before administering TPA. The CT
scans are necessary to show whether strokes might actually result from broken
blood vessels inside the head. Giving TPA to such patients makes their condition
worse, not better.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Gottfried Schlaug, also of Boston's Beth Israel, said the new machines
have allowed his hospital to abandon this routine CT scanning, since the MRIs
can accurately reveal bleeding.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Newsprint Makers To Merge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MONTREAL (AP) -- Two major Canadian newsprint makers, Abitibi-Consolidated
Inc. and Donohue Inc., are merging in a $4 billion cash-and-stock deal to create
a massive player that would control 35 percent of the market in North America.
</P>
<P>
	   When Abitibi-Consolidated, the largest newsprint maker on the continent,
completes its takeover of No. 3 Donohue the combined business will have double
the capacity of the No. 2 manufacturer, Bowater Inc. of Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Publishing analysts said the latest industry consolidation could strengthen
the hand of producers in their efforts to raise prices for newsprint, which is
used by newspapers. Prices have slipped recently, but analysts said price
increases did not seem imminent.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had consolidation before, and that alone doesn't drive prices," said
Michael Beebe, a publishing analyst with Goldman Sachs. Newsprint producers
"will have increased power to influence the marketplace, but I don't think it
permanently shifts newsprint pricing power from the hands of the publishers to
the hands of the producers."
</P>
<P>
	   Donohue is one of the most efficient forest companies in North America.
Abitibi lost money last year due to lower newsprint prices and a restructuring
that included eliminating 10 percent of its jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Michel Desbiens, president and chief executive of Donohue, will become
chairman of the merged company. Abitibi president John Weaver will be CEO and
president.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies have identified about $173 million in savings they can realize
over two years. Weaver said no closings or sales of Donohue assets were
anticipated, but there was no immediate word on how jobs would be affected.
</P>
<P>
	   Formed in 1997 with the merger of Abitibi-Price and Stone-Consolidated,
Abitibi-Consolidated operates 18 mills in North America and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
	   Abitibi-Price generated more than $3 billion in revenue for the first nine
months of 1999 but hasn't reported full-year results yet. Donohue said its 1999
revenues were about $1.73 billion.

<HEADLINE> Cars Get Towed When Clinton Visits  </HEADLINE>
   By DEB RIECHMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The president is coming to town. Do you know where your
car is?
</P>
<P>
	   Vacant vehicles can hide bombs and snipers. So before President Clinton
moves about a city he's visiting, police often post ``no parking'' signs and tow
hundreds of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
	   The president is protected, but drivers left playing hide-and-seek with
their cars often are annoyed.
</P>
<P>
	   Drivers in Philadelphia and San Francisco beware. Clinton is scheduled to
visit in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   In Chappaqua, N.Y., a handful of homeowners can no longer park on the street
in their cul-de-sac where the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton bought a
house. New Yorkers to the south know all too well what happens when they park in
presidential no-parking zones.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was crazy. People had to go to work. Nobody knew where their cars
were,'' said Ilene Marchese of Brooklyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Her family's two cars were among 157 vehicles towed one night last year when
Clinton was in the neighborhood to attend a political fund-raiser. The next
morning, people trying to get to work were looking for their cars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was impossible. People were screaming,'' she said. ``This is Brooklyn.
It doesn't take much to set people off, but I think it was so inconsiderate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton attends a fund-raiser in New Jersey. Twenty-five cars are ticketed
and towed. Clinton goes to his wife's birthday celebration at the Ford Center
for Performing Arts in Manhattan. Police post ``no parking'' signs on dozens of
blocks and tow cars whose owners ignore the warning.
</P>
<P>
	   Drivers in Washington are the most frequent victims. Local police say they
tow about 1,000 vehicles a year to secure streets so Clinton can make speeches,
have lunch or catch a basketball game.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are pretty understanding; complaints are rare,'' said Chaun Yount,
a spokeswoman for the Secret Service. ``We want to inconvenience the public as
little as possible, but we have to balance that with our security needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sometimes there's even a perquisite. This week, when Clinton attended a
fund-raiser in Georgetown, plows were dispatched to clear ice and snow from
parking spots on the street. ``I guess they didn't want anybody slipping and
sliding around,'' said Valerie Burden, who moved two cars to make way for
Clinton. ``For those of us without driveways, it was great.''
</P>
<P>
	   When people park in presidential no-parking zones, some cities' police
departments tow cars to a nearby block. In other cities, cars are taken to
impoundment lots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We post the signs. For the most part, people get the idea. If they choose
to park there, we tow them. Well, we relocate them -- to the nearest available,
legal parking spot,'' said New York City Police Lt. Dennis Cirillo.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House sometimes gives the police short notice.
</P>
<P>
	   Aubrey Dirkes walked out of his Washington apartment one morning last year
to learn that Clinton was having breakfast at a nearby hotel. ``The entire
street of cars was gone -- maybe 10 or 15 cars,'' Dirkes said. ``I looked for
`no parking' signs. They weren't there.''
</P>
<P>
	   A police officer told him he'd just taken them down.
</P>
<P>
	   Baltimore Police Maj. John McEntee Jr. said the city tries to get signs
posted three days in advance. Atlanta Police Lt. Pete Andresen said officers
often go back to make sure signs are still in place. The earlier the signs go
up, the fewer cars towed, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   When Clinton attended a fund-raiser at a private home in Elizabeth, N.J., 25
motorists who didn't move their cars were given $25 tickets and had to retrieve
their vehicles from an impound lot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm sure nobody was happy about it,'' said Elizabeth Police Capt. Mark
Kurdyla.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Lesniak, who hosted the fund-raiser, said the towing was necessary.
``There could have been a car with a bomb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The practice didn't start with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in 1992, about 90 cars were towed from around the University of Chicago
when President Bush visited.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharazard Washington parked her light blue Mustang in an area later
blanketed with ``no parking'' signs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's important for our leaders to be secure, but I thought it was
really crummy for them to put up the signs after the cars were already parked
there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington said she sent her $25 parking ticket to the university president
with a note that said: ``You should take care of this.''
</P>
<P>
	   He did.

    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Elizabeth Taylor will be the third recipient of the
Marian Anderson Award, which honors artists who work to benefit humanity.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor was chosen because of her work on behalf of AIDS awareness, research
and patient care, Mayor John F. Street said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This quintessential movie star took the spotlight, which has illuminated
her acting career throughout her life, and bravely turned it on the battle
against AIDS following the death of her close friend Rock Hudson," Street said.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor is to accept the award in person during special programs June 25 and
26 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The first two recipients of the award,
Harry Belafonte and Gregory Peck, are among the celebrities scheduled to pay
tribute to Taylor at the ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
	   The award is named after the late opera singer and Philadelphia native who
was the first black performer to sing at the White House.

<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man who police say has been harassing Brooke Shields
for 15 years, including sending nude photos of himself to her, pleaded innocent
to stalking and weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Ronald Bailey, 41, entered his plea Thursday. He has two prior
convictions involving Shields, one for trespassing at her New Jersey home in
1985 and another for making a terrorist threat against her in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   His attorney, Lisa Polansky, said during a hearing last month her client has
made some "statements that are somewhat bizarre and crude" but doesn't pose a
clear threat to the actress.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey was arrested Jan. 10 after detectives said they saw him pull a
handgun out of his pocket while looking at his reflection outside a downtown
building. Sheriff's Detective Merrill Ladenheim testified last month that Bailey
had two letters he was about to mail to Shields.

<HEADLINE> Space mapping project will help Cornell geologists studying Andes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - High resolution radar images from the space shuttle
Endeavour mission will do more than provide an unprecedented 3-D map of the
world. It will help Cornell University scientists unlock some of the secrets of
Andes Mountains' geology, one researcher said.
<P>
	   "There are parts of the Andes that have never been topographically mapped
because of cloud cover, especially parts of the eastern side of the range," said
Bryan Isacks, chairman of Cornell's Department of Geological Sciences and
director of its Institute for the Study of the Continents. Not even satellites
have been able to penetrate the cover, Isacks said.
</P>
<P>
	   Isacks is one of six Cornell faculty members working on a 20-year-old
topography study in the Andes in collaboration with several Latin American
scientists.
</P>
<P>
	   The Endeavour lifted off Friday on a mission to map up to 80 percent of the
Earth's surface using a new high resolution radar antennae.
</P>
<P>
	   The radar will resolve details as small as 30 meters across, said an
enthusiastic Isacks. Except for limited areas, existing maps of many remote
mountainous regions such as the Andes, whether from radar or conventional
ground-based mapping, have a resolution of only about 1 kilometer, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As important as the images are to scientists, Isacks and his colleagues are
equally interested in the raw data used to generate the detailed topographic
maps.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not just looking at a color picture of topography. That's what you
get at the end, but there's a lot of analysis before that. It will answer basic
questions about how the world works," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the Cornell work will focus on the Altiplano, a huge plateau
surrounded by higher peaks that spreads through northern Argentina, western
Bolivia and southern Peru. The two-mile high plateau is some 188 miles wide and
625 miles long that is home to Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake in the
world.
</P>
<P>
	   "How this thing got raised up that way is still a fairly big mystery,"
Isacks said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a general way, geologists know how the Andes mountain range formed.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the floor of the southeastern Pacific Ocean rests on a single huge
slab of the Earth's lithosphere, the outer skin comprising the crust and the
uppermost mantle, called the Nazca plate that is floating on semimolten magma.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 200 million years ago, the eastern edge of the Nazca plate began
shoving its way under the western edge of the South American plate, which makes
up the continent itself and part of the South Atlantic Ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
	   The land above was lifted and squeezed. The crust folded and began thrusting
up mountains so sharply that there is a drop of about 40,000 feet from the
western edge of the Andes to the Peru-Chile trench in the Pacific Ocean, a
distance of only 200 miles. A chain of volcanoes erupted along the mountain
range.
</P>
<P>
	   Understanding more about the region's geology might help scientists predict
and prepare for quakes and eruptions, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new information also could provide more understanding about the
hydrology of the Amazon River system by giving scientists more information about
the topography of its upper headwaters.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will fill in huge gaping areas that we don't know about," Isacks said.

<HEADLINE> AmerGen says it might pay more for Nine Mile nuclear plants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - State regulators are eager to hear from a
Pennsylvania-based company, which now says it might be willing to pay more than
the $163 million it originally offered to buy the Nine Mile Point nuclear
plants.
<P>
	   The state Public Service Commission plans to reconvene settlement
negotiations Wednesday at which AmerGen Energy Co., Niagara Mohawk and the
plants' other owners and other interested parties will discuss the proposed
sale.
</P>
<P>
	   Those negotiations broke off Jan. 26 after the participants reached an
impasse. But in a letter calling for resumption of talks, PSC lawyer Kevin Land
said "exploratory discussions" with AmerGen during the past two weeks led
regulators to believe further talks would be fruitful.
</P>
<P>
	   "It appears to us that the potential for AmerGen to add value to the
transactions exists, and we would like to explore this possibility with the
parties," Lang wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   AmerGen officials would not discuss their bargaining position but said they
were confident they will win approval for the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think this is a good sign," AmerGen spokesman Bill Jones said of the
renewed talks. "We're confident that in the end we'll own and operate the
plants."
</P>
<P>
	   AmerGen, a joint venture of PECO Energy and British Energy, agreed in June
to pay $163 million to acquire the 31-year-old Nine Mile Unit 1 plant and a 59
percent stake in the newer, bigger Unit 2. The two sister reactors are located
on Lake Ontario 45 miles north of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   The principal sellers, Niagara Mohawk and New York State Electric &AMP; Gas,
agreed in turn to transfer their decommissioning funds to AmerGen and to buy
power from the nuclear plants at potentially above-market prices for several
years.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Rochester Gas &AMP; Electric, a co-owner of Unit 2, matched AmerGen
in a counteroffer by exercising a legal right-of-first-refusal.
</P>
<P>
	   PSC staffers have sharply criticized the proposed deal, saying it would
leave utility ratepayers to continue paying off nuclear construction costs for
at least a decade after the plants change hands.
</P>
<P>
	   Niagara Mohawk has estimated that its ratepayers would owe $1.8 billion for
past nuclear investments not covered by the sale, plus a return on the utility's
investment that could raise the total to $3 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
	   PSC staffers grew increasingly dissatisfied with the AmerGen deal as it
became clear that other companies were interested in the Nine Mile Point plants
and they suggested that AmerGen's proposal might be rejected in favor of a
competitive auction.
</P>
<P>
	   Another likely bidder would be Entergy Corp., a New Orleans-based company
that is negotiating to buy the James A. FitzPatrick and Indian Point nuclear
plants from the New York Power Authority. FitzPatrick also is located at Nine
Mile Point. Power authority officials have said they would not sell their two
plants for less than $400 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy also has brokered a tentative deal with RG&AMP;E to lease the Nine Mile
plants and operate them if RG&AMP;E succeeds in buying them.
</P>
<P>
	   A new potential buyer - Constellation Nuclear Group, a sister company to
Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. - also recently told the PSC it would be
interested in bidding on the Nine Mile plants if AmerGen's deal is rejected.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 99.59; Nasdaq Down 48.18  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today despite a new report that showed
retail sales in January were lower than expected. Analysts said stock investors
had little reaction to this sign of moderate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 99.59 at
10,544.04, with Microsoft suffering the biggest point drop.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was down 48.18 at 4,437.45, and the broader
market index, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, slipped 16.31 to 1,400.52.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, especially computer and software companies, were broadly
lower. Microsoft was down 5 9/16 at 100 7/16, Cisco Systems, was down 5 13/16 at
130 1/8, and Hewlett Packard was 4 1/16 lower at 121 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we are getting is some very, very long overdue profit taking in the
superstars in the technology and Internet sectors," said Alfred E. Goldman,
chief market strategist, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. "The question is whether or
not this is going to be a half-a-day phenomenon, or a week- or two-week
pullback."
</P>
<P>
	   In recent sessions, technology stocks have regained the strength they
exhibited in late 1999, when the tech-laden Nasdaq sped past every other market
indicator to finish the year with an 85.6 percent gain. Technology is playing
such a dominant role in the market that when those shares hit a rare patch of
trouble, the broader market tumbles as well.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the case today, as blue-chips like Merck, down 2 5/8 at 66 3/8, and
DuPont, down 2 1/32 at 51 11/16, fell.
</P>
<P>
	   While stock investors appeared to shrug off the Commerce Department's retail
sales data, the bond traders liked the news that Americans spent selectively in
January, pushing sales up by just 0.3 percent as they bought less furniture and
food but purchased more cars.
</P>
<P>
	   January's performance was weaker than the 0.6 percent rise many analysts
forecast and marked the slowest pace since a 0.3 percent increase in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Since consumer spending accounts for the bulk of economic growth, the report
had been expected to calm some worries about interest rate increases this year.
The Federal Reserve has already raised rates four times since June, hoping to
slow the economy and prevent inflation from accelerating.
</P>
<P>
	   "That is certainly a longer-term positive" report, said Goldman. The report
helped push yields on the 30-year Treasury bond from 6.43 percent late Thursday
to 6.28 percent today.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of smaller company
stocks, gave up its gains of the morning and was down 1.70 to 540.51.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks by a 4-to-3 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 670.84 million shares, compared with
701.46 million shares at the same time Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Rise 0.3 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans ratcheted back on their spending splurges last
month, allowing retail sales to rise by 0.3 percent. But economists didn't view
that as a sign of real moderation, saying harsh weather that kept some people
home and other factors masked the true strength of sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The modest increase in January followed two straight months of buying binges
that catapulted sales in November and December by a bigger-than-previously
thought 1.3 percent and 1.7 percent respectively, the Commerce Department said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, consumers spent selectively. They trimmed purchases at food,
drug and furniture stores as well as at bars and restaurants. But they bought
more cars, clothing and hardware.
</P>
<P>
	   "Are households tapped out? No way," said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff
Economic Advisors. "The consumer is happy, flush and ready to spend and they
will continue to do so."
</P>
<P>
	   Economists believed January's overall sales were dampened mainly by two
temporary factors: the bad weather and the lingering effects of the Y2K computer
date changeover. Specifically, people had stockpiled food and drug store-type
items in December, had plenty left over and thus reduced their spending on such
items in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding those effects, "underlying consumer momentum remains very strong,"
said Merrill Lynch economist Gerald Cohen.
</P>
<P>
	   To wit: the $262.2 billion in seasonally adjusted total retail sales rang up
last month is 9.6 percent higher than the sales reported for the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Given that, many economists said they expect the Federal Reserve to boost
interest rates by another quarter of a percentage point in March to slow down
the red-hot economy and keep inflation under control. Last week, the Fed bumped
up rates for the fourth time since June, a move that raised borrowing costs for
consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street had a mixed view of the report. The Dow Jones was down more than
78 points and the Nasdaq was down more than 30 points in afternoon trading. But
the bond market gained ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity,
continues to be the locomotive of the speeding economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Although many economists were expecting retail sales to rise by 0.6 percent
in January, they believed the weaker-than-expected performance was a fluke
caused by temporary factors. Because of that, they believe the government's
report next month is likely to reveal that January's sales were actually
stronger than originally thought and also will show strong February sales.
</P>
<P>
	   A big 2.2 percent decline in sales at food stores in January helped hold
back the growth of overall retail sales. Food sales surged in December by 3.2
percent as some consumers hoarded food in anticipation of the Y2K date change,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug stores sales fell last month by 0.9 percent, following a strong 1.8
percent showing in December as some people stockpiled for Y2K, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, furniture stores' sales dropped by 0.4 percent and bars and
restaurants saw sales decline by 0.2 percent in January. Economists blamed those
declines on the bad weather.
</P>
<P>
	   But sales of new cars and trucks soared by 2.3 percent last month after a
1.4 percent rise in December.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that reflects the ongoing strength of the economy combined with
sales efforts and incentive offered by dealers," said Paul Taylor, economist for
the National Automobile Dealers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   With plentiful jobs, rising incomes and stock market gains, Americans are in
a position to spend briskly, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   And despite the bad weather, sales at hardware and clothing stores each went
up by a solid 0.7 percent in January, while sales at department and chain stores
rose by a brisk 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's major chain stores last week reported surprisingly strong sales
in January, helping stores finish their fiscal year -- which runs from February
through January -- with the biggest gains since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding the volatile automobile category, however, overall retail sales
fell 0.3 percent in January, much weaker than the 0.5 percent increase many
analysts were anticipating. That was the first decline in non-auto sales since a
0.1 percent drop in December 1997.

<HEADLINE> Senator makes brief stop for Republican fund-raiser, uphill battle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - John McCain came through New Jersey Friday to drum
up presidential support in a state that has already planted most of its
Republican politicians behind his primary opponent, Texas Gov. George Bush.
<P>
	   "We've got an insurgency campaign going on here," McCain said after arriving
at a private hangar at Newark International Airport. "All the generals and
admirals, with the exception of a few brave souls, are on the Bush campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Executive James Treffinger and state Sen. William Schluter were
the only state politicians to greet the Arizona senator at his arrival Friday
morning. Both said they believe in his campaign finance reform stance and his
straight-shooting, anti-establishment attitude.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's what the country needs," Schluter said. "He's not afraid to say
something ... that might not be politically correct. He says it."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who planned to spend the day campaigning in New York before
returning to New Jersey for a fund-raiser in Bedminster, has a lot of catching
up to do in fund-rasing in the Garden State. He raised $295,633 here in 1999,
including a $1,000 donation from New York Giants owner Wellington T. Mara. That
compares to nearly $1.5 million raised by Bush. McCain expected to raise
$150,000 Friday night at the $500-a-head fund-raiser at the Fiddlers Elbow
Country Club in Bedminster.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's state campaign director, lobbyist Tom Wilson, acknowledged the
senator had an uphill fight before New Jersey's June 6 primary, but said
McCain's victory in the New Hampshire primary should influence
independent-minded New Jerseyans.
</P>
<P>
	   "Voters still have to vote and they're the ones who decide this," Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Endorsements by establishment figures are obviously good for raising
money," McCain said of the sparse support among his party's politicians here.
"But they really don't mean much when it really counts."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain reiterated his criticism of pork-barrel spending while defending his
opposition to about $17 million allocated in federal funding to rebuild New
Jersey beaches and $1.5 million to research cancer cases in Toms River.
</P>
<P>
	   "They may be virtuous projects, but they should go through the normal
legislative process," he said. "I'm not trying to get to the head of the line.
I'm not trying to seek special favors."

<HEADLINE> Identity and funding at stake as U.S. redefines 'metropolitan'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Nobody can take away its proud slogan - "Furniture
Capital of the World" - but some residents of High Point, N.C., worry the
federal government is trying to erase the city's identity.
<P>
	   "No! No! No! Please do not group High Point, N.C., with Greensboro, N.C.!"
Donna Machen wrote to the Metropolitan Area Standards Review Committee. "Last
year the Greensboro Chamber of Commerce published that THEY were the Furniture
Capital of the World. How dare them."
</P>
<P>
	   Across the country, regional rivalries are flaring over preliminary
recommendations by the committee that is redefining metropolitan areas for
Census 2000. Some of the suggested changes would figuratively wipe some places
off the map - including much of New Jersey - as they are absorbed into larger
"megapolitan" areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The outcome will have wide-ranging implications. The government's definition
of core metropolitan areas influences the distribution of federal funds,
decisions by corporations about where to locate - even lists of "best places to
live."
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of federal government programs are based on the metropolitan
statistical information," said Robert "Punky" Beauchamp, chairman of the Grand
Forks-East Grand Forks Metropolitan Planning Organization. "If you're not part
of that, you're just swept aside."
</P>
<P>
	   Grand Forks, N.D., and East Grand Forks, Minn., now constitute one metro
area spanning the Red River, called the Grand Forks metropolitan area. Under the
committee's recommendations, Grand Forks would be its own metropolitan area and
East Grand Forks would be left out entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   Other communities fear being swallowed up by neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   High Point, which gets equal billing in the current
"Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High Point" metro area, would be wrapped into
Greensboro, while several Massachusetts cities would be gobbled up by an
enlarged Boston area.
</P>
<P>
	   Some communities see a long-awaited chance to assert themselves. The
committee was flooded with hundreds of e-mails and form letters urging
metropolitan status for Schuylkill County in eastern Pennsylvania, which is
recovering from the decline of the coal industry.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee is to forward its final suggestions to the Office of
Management and Budget, which will issue new guidelines before April 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal Bureau of the Budget, predecessor of the OMB, first defined
metropolitan areas in 1949. Every decade since, the federal government has
prepared for a census by re-evaluating the definitions.
</P>
<P>
	   If implemented, the committee's recommendations would be the most sweeping
yet. The very phrase "metropolitan area" would be dropped, replaced by
"core-based statistical area." There would be three such areas, in descending
order: "megapolitan," "macropolitan" and "micropolitan."
</P>
<P>
	   Committee chairman James D. Fitzsimmons said the proposed standards are
easier to explain and do a better job of noting population shifts in the past
half-century.
</P>
<P>
	   "The whole point is to produce a set of standards that allow federal
statistics to be reported in a way that squares with reality," said Fitzsimmons,
an assistant chief in the Census Bureau's population division.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee filled two thick binders with suggestions and criticisms
received during a public comment process that closed Dec. 30. The comments are
now under review by the committee, which includes representatives of federal
agencies that track transportation, labor, health and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
	   Only after the new standards are approved will the federal government set
new boundaries and names for the areas. But publication of the proposed
standards allowed some areas to predict the local impact.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey business interests are upset that their state, now divided into
nine primary metropolitan areas, would be wrapped into a New York City
"megapolitan area" and a Philadelphia "megapolitan area." Nassau and Suffolk
counties on Long Island also would become part of the New York City area.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey hospitals support the change, saying they would receive an extra
$200 million per year under federal reimbursement formulas.
</P>
<P>
	   But New Jersey Chamber of Commerce President Joan Verplanck said the change
would codify the impression that New Jersey is merely an extension of New York
and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   In Massachusetts, the mill towns of Lawrence and Haverhill, 25 miles north
of Boston, now form their own metropolitan area. But because of commuting
patterns - a major factor under the proposed new standards - they would become
part of the Boston megapolitan area.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have media, we have cultural and historic (attractions), making us a
separate metropolitan area. That would be eliminated because of the travel along
one road - I-93," lamented Gaylord Burke, who promotes Lawrence and Haverhill as
executive director of the Merrimack Valley Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Conversely, some people in two fast-growing but economically ailing areas in
south Texas - Brownsville-Harlingen and McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, each now
comprising its own metropolitan area - are urging the committee to combine them.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Summers, president of the Rio Grande Valley Partnership, said the
combined population exceeds 1 million, satisfying a requirement of making it a
"megapolitan" area. That designation, he said, might bring attention from
corporate site-hunters and more funding from the federal government, perhaps
enough for a new airport.
</P>
<P>
	   A different mood prevails in High Point and Greensboro. Both city councils
passed resolutions opposing the idea of wrapping High Point into a Greensboro
metro area.
</P>
<P>
	   "Please leave it alone," Robert Blakely of Greensboro wrote to the
committee, "and spend our tax dollars on something much more productive."

	   Retail Sales Rise 0.3 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans spent selectively in January,
pushing up retail sales by just 0.3 percent as they trimmed
purchases of furniture and food but bought more cars. Total retail
sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $262.2 billion last month and
followed a huge and bigger-than-previously estimated 1.7 percent
gain in December, the Commerce Department said today. January's
performance was weaker than the 0.6 percent rise many analysts were
forecasting. Some of the slowdown in sales was attributed to bad
weather that kept people away from stores in some areas. percent

	   Nuke Parts May Be Buried in Ky.
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 1,600 tons of nuclear weapons
hardware may be buried on a 3,000-acre Energy Department site in
Kentucky, posing new safety risks, according to a letter sent to
federal regulators by a senior health safety official. Sources
familiar with the issue said today that the concerns were raised by
the official after he had learned of the buried weapons parts only
recently, although some of the material dates back to the 1950s.
The official, Raymond G. Carroll, a senior manager of health and
safety programs at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, declined to
comment when reached at his office. The plant is operated and
leased by a private company, but the 3,000-acre site belongs to the
government and is the focus of major environmental cleanup
activities left over from Cold War uranium processing activities.

<HEADLINE> Truckers slow down traffic to protest low rates, high fuel prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) - Hundreds of truckers slowed traffic to a crawl
outside cargo companies' doors at this port Friday to protest what they called
inadequate compensation for the rising cost of diesel fuel.
<P>
	   "Everything's been going up, except our rates," said Manny Flores, a
23-year-old driver for USA Trucking in Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
	   About 300 drivers, one holding an American flag out the window of his truck,
tied up traffic from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. in Port Elizabeth, then chanted in
Spanish in a parking lot to demand higher fuel surcharges from trucking
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies pay drivers a fee per container they unload at the port, but
drivers said the fee is not enough to make up for the 119 percent increase in
diesel fuel prices over the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "A month ago, $1.10, $1.20 (a gallon for fuel)," said Marlon Soza, 31, of
Jersey City. "Now we're paying $2.28."
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's protest followed a similar one in Elizabeth on Thursday, where
truckers formed human blockades to surround other truckers who were still
working. About 100 trucks slowly circled around the Statehouse in Trenton on
Thursday to ask Gov. Christie Whitman to do something about the steep increases
in fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   No arrests were immediately reported after the protest, said Allen Morrison,
spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Ships continued to
load and unload cargo and the port was not severely affected, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Flores disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is costing them millions of dollars right now," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Samuel Cunninghame, executive director of the New Jersey Motor Truck
Association, which represents trucking companies, said companies have raised
drivers' rates from 3 percent to 12 percent since diesel fuel prices have risen.
</P>
<P>
	   "The companies have passed on whatever percentage increase their shippers
have allowed them," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the spike in fuel prices was "too much, too soon," making it
difficult for anyone in the business to make a decent profit.
</P>
<P>
	   The truckers also complained on Friday of the time they have to wait before
they are allowed to unload their cargo.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes you stand four, five hours. Nobody pays for that," said Flavio
Rosa, 38, of Kearny. "I work for free."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the International Longshoremen's Association didn't
immediately return a telephone message Friday.

<HEADLINE> Pilots Punished for Refusing Vaccine  </HEADLINE>
   By AMY FORLITI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- At least 12 of the 34 pilots in the Indiana Air
National Guard in Fort Wayne are barred from flying for refusing an anthrax
vaccination required for an upcoming mission overseas, pilots say.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the 122nd Fighter Wing, which is scheduled to be sent to the
Middle East in April, have until Sunday to begin the 18-month series of six
shots. The vaccination program had been voluntary until now.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody is worried about safety,'' said Capt. Bruce Everett, a
commercial pilot barred from flying for the Guard in January for refusing the
vaccine. ``I don't know if it's unsafe. All I know is that there hasn't been
enough research to prove that it is safe.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon has ordered all of its 2.4 million active and reserve personnel
be inoculated against anthrax, a deadly germ that can be used in biological
warfare.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 to 300 people have refused the vaccine so far, according to the
Pentagon. Several men and women have been prosecuted, and many reservists have
quit because of the shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Twelve pilots now barred from flying at Fort Wayne plan to resign or
transfer to avoid inoculation, said Everett, Lt. Col. Tom Heemstra and two other

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Down 250  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks extended their losses today as investors sold
technology shares to lock in recent gains. The urge to take profits distracted
investors from a new report that showed retail sales in January were lower than
expected, suggesting moderate economic growth and a cooling of inflationary
pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 181.50 to 10,462.13, with Microsoft suffering the
biggest point drop. Shortly afterward, it was down 250.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was down 80.97 at 4,404.66, and the broader
market index, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, fell 25.63 to 1,391.20.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, especially computer and software companies, were broadly
lower. Microsoft was down 5 13/16 at 100 3/16, Cisco Systems was down 5 1/2 at
130 7/16, and Hewlett Packard was 4 11/16 lower at 121 3/16.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we are getting is some very, very long overdue profit taking in the
superstars in the technology and Internet sectors," said Alfred E. Goldman,
chief market strategist, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. "The question is whether or
not this is going to be a half-a-day phenomenon, or a week- or two-week
pullback."
</P>
<P>
	   In recent sessions, technology stocks have regained the strength they
exhibited in late 1999, when the tech-laden Nasdaq sped past every other market
indicator to finish the year with an 85.6 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest run set up the sector for a bout of profit-taking, analysts said.
Still, technology is playing such a dominant role in the market that when those
shares hit a rare patch of trouble, the broader market tumbles as well.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the case today, as blue-chips like Merck, down 3 7/8 at 65 1/8, and
DuPont, down 2 13/16 at 50 7/8, fell.
</P>
<P>
	   While stock investors appeared to shrug off the Commerce Department's retail
sales data, bond traders liked the news that Americans spent selectively in
January, pushing sales up by just 0.3 percent as they bought less furniture and
food but purchased more cars.
</P>
<P>
	   January's performance was weaker than the 0.6 percent rise many analysts
forecast and marked the slowest pace since a 0.3 percent increase in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Since consumer spending accounts for the bulk of economic growth, the report
calmed some worries about interest rate increases this year. The Federal Reserve
has already raised rates four times since June, hoping to slow the economy and
prevent inflation from accelerating.
</P>
<P>
	   "That is certainly a longer-term positive" report, said Goldman. The report
helped push yields on the 30-year Treasury bond from 6.34 percent at Thursday's
quarterly auction to 6.28 percent today.
</P>
<P>
	   Selected financial shares also gained. J.P. Morgan was up 1 5/16 at 115
5/16.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of smaller company
stocks, gave up its gains of the morning and was down 4.97 to 537.24.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks by nearly a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 809.50 million shares,
compared with 833.78 million shares at the same time Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Extreme Sports Dominate Gear Market  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Ankle-high skateboarding shoes have replaced Nike high-tops
and cargo pants with extra pockets have supplanted baggy shorts emblazoned with
Michael Jordan's silhouette this year at the Super Show, the nation's biggest
sporting goods trade show.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry, once dominated by Nike and its stable of basketball-shooting,
football-tossing, baseball-smashing superstars, is being taken over by dozens of
smaller companies endorsed by skateboarders, stunt bike riders and even rock
stars.
</P>
<P>
	   With kids more interested in shoes worn on MTV than those worn in the NBA,
and many youngsters preferring the X Games to the World Series, industry giants
that focus on traditional sports are slumping.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are selling lifestyle," said Charles Kim, vice president of marketing
and product development for bicycle maker Royce Union. "People want to feel
cool, and the extreme sports are it right now."
</P>
<P>
	   The Hauppauge, N.Y., company -- the nation's seventh-biggest domestic bike
maker and one of a few to turn a profit last year -- showcases flashy bikes with
shock absorbers, knobby tires and steel tubes extending from each wheel to
enable riders to do handstands.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is really here to stay," said the 28-year-old Kim, who admitted he was
promoted to the executive level because of his ability to react to youth trends.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the small companies credit their recent success in part to the X
Games, the ESPN-owned competition that features everything from skateboarding to
sky surfing to street luge. NBC has its own version called the Gravity Games,
and some sports such as snowboarding are also included in the Olympics, adding
even more legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as Jordan sold high-tops to youngsters who couldn't make a layup, the X
Games are selling extreme gear to some customers who don't know a frontside 180
ollie from an elephant glide, both tricks done by skateboarders or snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
	   "This market is absolutely on fire, and it's all the X Games driving it
right now," said Variflex president Steve Muellner, displaying his California
company's skateboards, helmets and kneepads, all adorned with the logo of the X
Games.
</P>
<P>
	   Muellner said his company only received the license to use the logo last
May, and then only put it on two helmets last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those two helmets accounted for 5 percent of our total sales," said
Muellner, whose company had sales of $39 million last year.
</P>
<P>
	   While the little guys cash in, the big companies have struggled, despite the
booming economy.
</P>
<P>
	   According Sporting Goods Manufacturers' Association president John Riddle,
the industry -- which includes equipment, apparel and shoes -- increased from
$44.7 billion in 1997 to $45.7 billion in 1998, with sales actually declining in
several areas.
</P>
<P>
	   He predicts sales will top $48 billion this year, with the hip image of
extreme sports pulling in consumers otherwise uninterested in physical activity.
</P>
<P>
	   Riddle said major manufacturers such as Wilson and Nike have been slow to
react to the extreme trend, just as many shoe companies were slow to adapt to
the trend of wearing hiking boots as fashion statements.
</P>
<P>
	   Nike is still considered one of the best at gauging market change, even
signing several extreme athletes to its roster and featuring snowboarding in a
recent ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Beaverton, Ore., stock hit a 52-week low earlier this week after it
announced that earnings would be lower than expected for the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Riddle says the demand for different kinds of equipment, apparel and shoes
has turned many consumers to alternate sources.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dawn Leonetti, a spokeswoman for Nike's ACG division, which makes
outdoor-oriented shoes and apparel, said that the company doesn't perceive
itself as being behind in extreme sports.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've made it a point to show that we're not going to bulldog our way in
there and buy everybody out," Leonetti said. "We just want to be a part of it.
There's room for everybody."

<HEADLINE> Mayor: Wall Street explosion not linked to terrorists  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A homemade device which a police official said was
"similar to a pipe bomb" exploded just off Wall Street early Friday, breaking
windows in two office buildings and slightly injuring one person.
<P>
	   "At this point it is not viewed as a terrorist act," said Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. "They have no evidence to support that classification." He added that
no one had claimed responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani said that the explosion "could have killed people," and that four
postal workers were about 30 feet away when the device went off. One was treated
for ringing in the ears.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were looking for a man seen in the area at the time of the explosion.
He was described as weighing 200 pounds and wearing a tan three-quarters length
jacket, possibly with a corduroy collar. A $10,000 reward was being offered by
the city for information leading to the arrest and conviction of a suspect or
suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   First Deputy Commissioner Patrick Kelleher said the device was a metal
container containing black powder and cardboard. No nails or other sharp
instruments were found inside it, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It could be classified as similar to a pipe bomb," said Kelleher. Police
Commissioner Howard Safir is on vacation this week in Utah and was not available
for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelleher said the four postal workers passed the device, realized it could
be dangerous and started running. "Had they been a few steps behind where they
were, we could have had a much more significant tragedy."
</P>
<P>
	   The device blew up at 4:40 a.m. Friday in front of an office building owned
by Barclays Bank on the corner of Wall and Water streets, just blocks from the
New York Stock Exchange in the city's Financial District. Windows were blown out
in the building, at 75 Wall St., and in neighboring 95 Wall St.
</P>
<P>
	   In November 1997, a similar incident occurred outside an office tower owned
by Merrill Lynch at 222 Broadway, also in the Wall Street area. A small homemade
bomb exploded shortly before 6 a.m., shattering glass but injuring no one.
Police said there was no apparent connection to Friday's incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Dennis Theodore was working the overnight shift at World Co. LLC, one block
from the blast.
</P>
<P>
	   "The windows shook. The whole building shook," Theodore said. "I thought it
was in my building, or right outside my building. That's how loud it was."
</P>
<P>
	   He went outside to investigate and found "smoke all over the place. ... It
was very scary."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Barclays Bank said the company owned the building, but did
not have any offices in it. J.P. Morgan and Dresdner Bank are among the
companies with office space in the roughly 40-story building. Barclays released
a brief statement saying there was very minor damage done to the building.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE broker Joseph Muscarella of Navesink, N.J., said the area offered a
high-profile location for anyone seeking to draw attention.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just a shame that you have to live like this," he said. "But it's just
a part and parcel of what we do. ...Whenever anyone wants to protest anything,
they come to the exchange."
</P>
<P>
	   Some who worked in the area gathered outside on Friday morning, drinking
coffee and chatting on cellular phones, but few seemed worried.
</P>
<P>
	   "I figure if they were actually going to blow something up, they'd aim a
little farther down Wall Street," at the stock exchange, said a man who works in
the building and who identified himself only as Jamie. "I'm kind of surprised
they picked this building."
</P>
<P>
	   Sheikh Drammeh, who works for a finance company across the street, still
views Wall Street as "the best" place to work. "A million bombs will not change
my view about Wall Street and New York City in general."
</P>
<P>
	   The explosion did not affect subway service to the area, though some streets
were closed in the early morning hours. Workers were let inside the two affected
buildings through alternate entrances beginning at about 8:15 a.m. The NYSE also
opened at its usual time.

<HEADLINE> FDA Investigates Gene Experiment  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration is trying to determine
if children dying from cancer might have been accidentally exposed to the AIDS
virus in a gene therapy experiment.
</P>
<P>
	   Suggestions that the children were exposed to HIV are highly preliminary,
FDA officials stressed Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the FDA called initial contamination testing of the gene-based
medicine so tenuous that it would not have alarmed the children's families by
telling them until confirmatory tests now under way settle the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston notified families this week, in anticipation of newspaper
reports of the FDA probe.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA has suspended the gene therapy study while investigating whether
researchers followed federal safety regulations, including whether they alerted
the government quickly enough to the possible contamination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no evidence that any of the children who were treated were harmed
in any way,'' St. Jude hospital said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers were hunting gene therapy for neuroblastoma, a nervous system
cancer. Babies often survive it, but neuroblastoma is highly lethal when it
strikes older children. If patients relapse after initial treatment, most die
quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Jude hospital studied 20 relapsed children. Two received the batch of
gene-based medicine suspected of possible contamination, the hospital said.
Sixteen of the children have died from their cancers, the hospital said.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been no sign of contamination in the gene-based medicine given to
six children at Baylor, said spokeswoman Claire Bassett. Two of those children
have died of their cancers.
</P>
<P>
	   The worry over possible contamination arose when St. Jude researchers
realized cells used to grow some of the medicine several years ago might not
have undergone proper quality testing. So an outside lab tested samples and
found signs of low-level HIV and hepatitis C contamination.
</P>
<P>
	   Those initial tests often give false results, and might even mistake the
``adenovirus'' used to administer gene therapy for other infectious viruses,
said FDA officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, this testing is so tenuous that when blood donations undergo it,
donors are never told they might have HIV until better tests confirm it.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA began strict confirmatory testing Thursday. It hopes to know within
two weeks whether the children's therapy was contaminated.

<HEADLINE> Denmark's Prince Begins Expedition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark set off Friday
on an Arctic expedition that will take him across 2,170 miles of northern
Greenland's coldest, darkest regions.
</P>
<P>
	   The six-man expedition left Qaanaaq, 930 miles south of the North Pole, a
few days later than planned because some members of the team fell ill with the
flu, Danish TV2 reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Frederik, 31, is a member of the Frogman Corps, an elite navy unit, and has
received training in survival and Arctic skills. He and the rest of the team
spent the past month in Qaanaaq, adjusting to the environment, testing and
packing equipment, and training the 39 sledge dogs.
</P>
<P>
	   The expedition members built the three sleds using traditional Inuit
techniques.
</P>
<P>
	   Before them lies four months of dog-sled trekking along the coast to
Greenland's northernmost point, then down the east coast to the town of
Ittoqqortoormiit.
</P>
<P>
	   February and March are the coldest months of the year in the region and the
team can expect temperatures of 58 degrees below zero, blizzards and encounters
with polar bears. During the first weeks they will travel with only the moon and
stars for light, since the polar night lasts until the end of February.
</P>
<P>
	   The team is bringing high-tech equipment and members plan to publish a daily
diary and pictures on the Internet directly from Greenland, the world's largest
island and a semiautonomous Danish territory.
</P>
<P>
	   The trek, expected to be completed in mid-June, is to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the Sirius Patrol, the navy unit that monitors the northern
fringes of the island.
</P>
<P>
	   The expedition includes the prince, four former members of the Sirius Patrol
and a cameraman who will produce footage for television shows to be broadcast
later.

<HEADLINE> White House Room Named for Brady  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Grievously wounded in an assassination attempt 19 years
ago, one-time presidential press secretary James Brady returned to applause at
the White House and was saluted Friday as ``living proof that you can't kill
courage.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton led the testimonials as the White House press briefing
room -- the often televised site of presidential statements and the daily
grillings of the press secretary -- was named in honor of Brady, who was
President Reagan's chief spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Still wheelchair bound and bearing the scars of his wounds, Brady now
travels the nation on behalf of the National Head Injury Foundation and as an
advocate for gun control. He was shot March 30, 1981, outside the Washington
Hilton Hotel in a failed assassination attempt against Reagan.
</P>
<P>
	   Overcoming pain and despair in his long recovery, Brady ``could have chosen
to live his life out in private regret but instead he chose a public embrace,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Former press secretaries from the Kennedy, Ford, Reagan and Clinton
administrations came back to honor their colleague. They laughed when Brady
recalled returning to the briefing room in 1981, months after the shooting, and
saying to reporters, ``I miss SOME of you.'' Brady paused and added, ``Today, I
still miss SOME of you.'' He spoke slowly, reading from a script with help from
his wife, Sarah.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady said it's tough to serve both the president and the press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It makes being between a rock and a hard place seem like heaven,'' he
said. Pointing out that the briefing room sits atop an old swimming pool, Brady
said he had planned to install a trap door to dispose of unwelcome inquisitors.
</P>
<P>
	   The usually cluttered briefing room was spruced up with a fresh coat of
paint and new carpeting. A special ramp was installed for Brady's wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea of naming the room after Brady came from Joe Lockhart, Clinton's
spokesman. Lockhart said he was asked in a recent interview who his hero was.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought of all the great people in America who had done wonderful things
but that I wasn't particularly connected to,'' Lockhart said. ``And then it hit
me that there was someone who had sat in the very office that I was sitting in
who fit that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton praised Brady for turning his own suffering into a crusade against
gun violence that has made the nation a safer place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jim Brady is living proof that you can't kill courage, that it takes more
than a cheap handgun to destroy a strong spirit,'' Clinton said. ``His ready
smile and sense of humor had to overcome despair that none of us can fully
understand, and pain that many of us never really experienced.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said Brady deserves credit for making the press corps ``abandon
decades of tradition and actually raise their hands when they wanted to ask a
question.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Joe and I also thought about enacting another one of Jim's ideas that he
and President Reagan advocated: hinging the floor to give deserving reporters
immediate, involuntary access to the swimming pool below,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady's picture has hung in the briefing room since Nov. 9, 1981, when the
area was reopened after a three-month renovation. On that day, Reagan and his
wife, Nancy, came to the briefing room to join Brady at a ribbon-cutting
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady and his wife have joined Clinton on many occasions to press for
tougher gun controls. The most prominent measure was the Brady law, which
established a five-day waiting period and background checks on handgun
purchasers.

<HEADLINE> Antismoking Ads Upset Tobacco Cos.  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The biggest antismoking campaign ever is under way with
teens helping shape its edgy messages and tobacco companies picking up the tab.
But Philip Morris, the biggest cigarette maker, is fuming over what it has seen
so far.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads, which are part of a $1.5 billion five-year campaign, portray
tobacco as a killer and question the truthfulness of tobacco executives.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are very disappointed with the campaign," said Philip Morris spokesman
Brendan McCormick, adding the maker of Marlboros was examining "all of our
options."
</P>
<P>
	   The first two commercials in the campaign began running earlier this week
and a Web site is in operation.
</P>
<P>
	   In one ad, two young people enter a tobacco company office building where
they plan to deliver a lie detector to marketing executives to help them "tell
the truth" about tobacco's addictiveness. They never get past the security guard
and are escorted out.
</P>
<P>
	   The commercial was shot in Philip Morris' lobby in New York. But the company
is never identified in the ad.
</P>
<P>
	   In another ad that parodies a soft drink commercial, three young people take
a bungee jump off a bridge to retrieve cans of fictional Splode soda.
</P>
<P>
	   The first two jumpers each grab a can and take a drink as they are yanked
back up to the bridge. But the third jumper's soda can explodes when he opens it
and he vanishes in a burst of flame as his companions recoil.
</P>
<P>
	   These words then appear on the screen: "Only one product actually kills a
third of the people who use it. Tobacco."
</P>
<P>
	   Both ads end with the campaign's logo -- "Truth."
</P>
<P>
	   The Web site associated with the campaign, www.thetruth.com, lists the major
tobacco companies and contrasts the industry's past statements about the health
effects of smoking with what the site operators say the industry knew.
</P>
<P>
	   The tobacco companies are paying for the campaign as part of their $200
billion-plus settlement in 1998 of state claims for defraying the costs of
treating sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the pact that removed a huge legal threat to the industry, the
companies are paying $1.5 billion over five years to a fund "for public
education and advertising regarding the addictiveness, health effects and social
costs related to the use of tobacco products." The American Legacy Foundation
was set up to run the program.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheryl Healton, chief executive of the foundation, said $185 million will be
spent through June on advertising, the Internet site, community activities and
other programs designed to discourage youngsters ages 12 to 17 from starting
smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is the largest countermarketing campaign in public health in this
country," she said, adding that it is bigger than the federal government's
massive antidrug effort. Officials there said they spent $155 million on
antidrug advertising and communications last year.
</P>
<P>
	   It also outpaces the donated commercial time and ad space for the largest
public service campaigns on crime prevention ($128 million in 1998) and drunken
driving ($111 million), according to the Advertising Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Healton said the antismoking campaign was developed by nine advertising, PR
and research agencies led by Arnold Communications of Boston. None handle
tobacco accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   One hundred teens from across the country were brought in last fall to
suggest approaches for the campaign and Healton said the teens are consulted
regularly about how to proceed. She said the foundation felt teens know best
what messages will be most effective with their peers.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the biggest problems when grownups take over the ads is that they
can have the opposite effect," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Philip Morris is unhappy with the campaign, citing the "Lie Detector" ad
and the content of the Internet site.
</P>
<P>
	   McCormick said the settlement agreement prohibits using the education fund

	   "We think their campaign is inconsistent with the purpose of the American
Legacy Foundation, which is to educate the public on tobacco-related health
issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bill Furmanski, spokesman for the foundation, said the admakers had
"gone out of their way not to identify any individual or specific company" in
the ads.
</P>
<P>
	   McCormick declined to say what options the company feels it has in the
matter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legacy Foundation hopes to run the ads on as many as 16 broadcast and
cable networks. Healton said the broadcast networks CBS and ABC have not yet
cleared them, but said she was confident of eventually getting approval.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
   By ZEINA KARAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah guerrillas killed a seventh Israeli
soldier Friday and seriously wounded another. Israel retaliated with a 13th day
of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss appealed for American and French
intervention. He singled out the United States, but also called on the
international community ``to shoulder their responsibilities (in deterring
Israel) in the name of right and justice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel responded to Hezbollah's fatal rocket and mortar attack on an Israeli
army base with repeated airstrikes Friday, firing missiles from helicopter
gunships and fighter jets at guerrilla hideouts and routes. At least 12 missiles
were fired.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed the airstrikes and the Israeli
casualties. An announcement said Sgt. Zachi Yitah, 19, was killed and another
soldier was seriously wounded when a missile hit a combat trench.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he would retaliate in his own time
with ``very harsh strikes in Lebanon,'' but reaffirmed a pledge to withdraw
troops by July.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah said the operation proved ``the
enemy's complete impotence in the face of the prowess of resistance fighters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli soldiers have patrolled a strip inside southern Lebanon since 1985
in an effort to curb cross-border guerrilla raids on its communities. Hezbollah
is the main guerrilla group trying to oust Israeli troops from Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Israeli military officials said that Israel would no longer
abide by a code of engagement which restricted firing toward civilian areas and
said they would strike back hard against any attacks on their soldiers.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- EPA Administrator Carol Browner was given an award Friday
from the American Lung Association, which singled her out ``for her leadership
in the fight for clean air.''
</P>
<P>
	   Browner was cited for issuing a string of new air pollution control measures
including tougher emission requirements on automobiles, more stringent air
quality standards that attack smog, and cuts in interstate pollution from
coal-burning power plants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A true champion for clean air ... under her leadership the EPA has taken
the toughest actions in a generation to safeguard public health from the threats
posed by air pollution,'' said Ernest Franc, the association's president.
</P>
<P>
	   Browner has been head of the Environmental Protection Agency for seven
years, longer than any of her predecessors.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry groups have criticized Browner's air initiatives, arguing that in
some cases they are not based on good science. Her regulations calling for ozone
and soot standards are in limbo because of court challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   Another regulation aimed at reducing interstate pollution fro coal-burning
power plants also has been blocked, at last temporarily, by a the courts.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Woos Voters in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
   By ANGUS SHAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Zimbabwe's justice minister told voters Friday that
if they approve constitutional revisions in a vote this weekend they will be
more likely to receive land from descendants of white settlers.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa said on state television that the
handover of white-owned land to landless blacks had been hindered since
independence from Britain in 1980 by constitutional guarantees that handovers
must include compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed constitutional revisions, up for a vote Saturday and Sunday,
would give President Robert Mugabe's government legal powers to take land
without paying for it.
</P>
<P>
	   The main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, and the
National Constitutional Assembly, a coalition of human rights, church, civic and
lawyers groups, oppose the revisions.
</P>
<P>
	   They say the draft, in which Mugabe retains most of his powers, ignores
demands by Zimbabweans canvassed by a state-appointed Constitutional Commission
to abolish the presidency. Many Zimbabweans said they wanted an end to Mugabe's
two decades in power and for day-to-day affairs to be run by a prime minister
answerable to elected lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   In a nationwide television and radio broadcast Thursday night, Mugabe
repeated demands that Britain pay compensation to white landowners whose
ancestors took land from blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   He described the descendants of British ``robbers'' of land as ``no better
than that robber because you have acquired stolen goods. Your possession is not
proper.''
</P>
<P>
	   Britain used to channel funds to the Zimbabwean government to buy out white
farmers, but halted it after complaining that the ruling party's program was
mismanaged, riddled with corruption and had lost sight of its aim to alleviate
poverty and land hunger.
</P>
<P>
	   As campaigning wound down Friday, opponents of the revisions handed out
flyers on street corners and sent messages to mobile phone and e-mail
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The hour is at hand. Why use a three letter word when two letters will do?
Vote 'no','' said one message.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first open show of organized opposition in years.
</P>
<P>
	   Results of an opinion poll released Friday forecast a close race. Of nearly
7,000 voters, the poll showed that 42 percent favored the draft and 37 percent
said they opposed it, said the Harare-based Public Opinion Institute. No margin
of error was given for the poll.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Looks to Social Security  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fresh from their victory on tax cuts for married couples,
House Republicans are turning to legislation that would lift the outside
earnings limit on Social Security for people aged 65-70.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just as it is absurd for our government to penalize couples for getting
married, it is also absurd for our government to penalize seniors for getting
jobs,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Friday. ``The time has come
to give our working seniors a break.''
</P>
<P>
	   Current law penalizes thousands of senior citizens by $1 in Social Security
benefits for every $3 they earn over $17,000. Thousands of others are
discouraged from working or work only part of the year to avoid the cap,
advocates for the elderly say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They don't understand why we have a public policy that takes away all of
their extra money,'' said John Rother, director of public policy for AARP.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP leaders are working on a bill to repeal or at least greatly raise the
limit. A repeal bill introduced by Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, would cost roughly
$24 billion over 10 years, which would come from the projected budget surplus,
congressional aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   A House Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security is scheduled to hold
a hearing on the issue Tuesday. Its chairman, Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla.,
estimated that 400,000 working older Americans are affected each year.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the 10-year, $182 billion tax cut the House passed this week for
married couples, ending the Social Security earnings limit is popular among
Democrats and Republicans. It also appeals to the key elderly constituency, one
of the main voter battlegrounds as the two parties wrestle for control of the
House in this year's elections.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has spoken frequently about the need to eliminate the
earnings limit, but White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president would
not endorse a ``piecemeal'' approach to Social Security, which faces insolvency
as the baby boom generation retires.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to have a debate about Social Security that doesn't
involve solvency,'' Lockhart said. ``That is where this debate starts, and
that's where the debate ends, as far as we're concerned.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Democrats on Capitol Hill watched a fourth of their number join majority
Republicans to send the GOP ``marriage penalty'' tax cut to the Senate. They
don't look forward to another fight over an issue many of them are on record as
supporting.
</P>
<P>
	   A Democratic aide said while the party must be careful to avoid ignoring the
White House, the faithful will work to find an acceptable alternative to the GOP
bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings limit, which ends after a person reaches age 70, is scheduled
under current law to rise to $25,000 in 2001 and to $30,000 in 2002, where it
will remain unless changes are made. The GOP also is eyeing for action a
separate earnings test that reduces Social Security benefits by $1 for every $2
of income above $10,080 for people under age 65.

<HEADLINE> Mayor finally says he's running  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Not that it surprised anyone, but New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani finally stated outright on Friday that he is running
for the U.S. Senate.
<P>
	   After a stump speech on the porch of the clapboard house that serves as
Westchester County Republican headquarters, Giuliani was asked if he was an
official candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know what an official candidate is," he said. "I am very interested
in running. I am running. Look what I'm doing, I'm not walking. ... Give me a
break, I'm running."
</P>
<P>
	   Though Giuliani has long been campaigning and was the obvious Republican
candidate to oppose Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton, until Friday he had not
said, "I'm running."
</P>
<P>
	   Last Sunday, while making the rounds of political talk shows, he found
various ways to avoid it, coming closest when he said "Looks that way" when a
questioner asked if he planned to run.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also said Sunday, "There's always doubt."
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, said Friday that the mayor's
statement "should not be construed as his official announcement."
</P>
<P>
	   'This may be the first time he's said those words but he's said that kind of
thing before," Teitelbaum said. "No decision has been made on an official
announcement and there may not be one."
</P>
<P>
	   But the Westchester GOP was impressed. "Maybe we'll put up a plaque," said
county Chairman Jim Cavanaugh. He said the mayor told lunch companions after his
statement that he didn't want to make "a Hollywood-style announcement."
</P>
<P>
	   "By kind of slipping it in like that, that seems how he wants to do it,"
Cavanaugh said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton campaign spokeswoman Karen Dunn said, "We welcome the mayor to the
race. Maybe now he will start talking about what he would do as a United States
senator."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton made her formal announcement Sunday, in a college gymnasium packed
with thousands of supporters and bedecked with red, white and blue posters.
Giuliani's statement Friday came before about 150 people, many of them local
Republican officials, on the porch, the snow-covered lawn and sidewalk outside
the house on Mamaroneck Avenue.
</P>
<P>
	   His speech was interrupted by the sirens of the White Plains Fire
Department, heading out on a call.
</P>
<P>
	   "Looks like they have good response time here," he joked.
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech, the mayor poked fun at Clinton's househunting in Westchester.
</P>
<P>
	   When he walked to the microphones to chants of "Rudy, Rudy," he said, "I
don't know what all the fuss is about. I'm just hanging around here looking for
a house."
</P>
<P>
	   He also suggested that if Clinton loses the race, she might leave the new
home in Chappaqua that served to establish her residency.
</P>
<P>
	   "Around Jan. 1 I'm going to need a place to live and I understand there may
be a house on the market around here," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he accepted Clinton as a New York resident, he hesitated and said,
"OK. You figure it out. You figure out if she's really a resident."
</P>
<P>
	   He repeatedly emphasized his New York roots, telling the crowd, "I come from
New York like you do."
</P>
<P>
	   "We're New Yorkers, after all," he said. "We want to fight for New York."
</P>
<P>
	   He also hit a popular Westchester voting issue when he told the audience,
"You are some of the most overtaxed citizens in the United States."
</P>
<P>
	   And he said Westchester is "an important county for me in part because
Westchester is a place that has a lot of people that know the work I've done as
mayor of New York City."

<HEADLINE> French Director Roger Vadim Dies  </HEADLINE>
   By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- Film director Roger Vadim, who pursued beauty both in film and
in life, romancing some of the world's most sought-after actresses -- including
Brigitte Bardot, Jane Fonda and Catherine Deneuve-- died Friday after a long
struggle with cancer. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You wouldn't ask Rodin to make an ugly sculpture, or me to make a film
with an ugly woman,'' Vadim once said of his devotion to female beauty in such
classics as ``And God Created Woman.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's my style, that's my nature.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tributes poured in for the filmmaker, who won renown both for his rich
career and his headline-grabbing love life. He counted Bardot and Fonda among
his five wives, and had a child with Deneuve, his companion between marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement issued by her office in Atlanta, Fonda said she had visited
Vadim in the hospital last week and was ``saddened by Roger's death ... He will
be missed.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Apart from an original and important body of work, which sometimes rocked
minds, he was more than anyone else, the filmmaker of life, of passion for life,
of liberty,'' French President Jacques Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He hatched new talents and knew how to create myths, aided by some of the
greatest actresses of the past few decades.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among them was French siren Bardot, who won instant fame in the 1956 ``And
God Created Woman,'' the story of a young married woman's quest for sexual
freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   The scene of a nubile young Bardot dancing barefoot on a table remains one
of the most titillating scenes in French cinema.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was really nothing shocking in what Brigitte did, what was
provocative was her natural sensuality,'' Vadim told The Associated Press in
1988.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wanted to show a normal young girl whose only difference was that she
behaved in the way a boy might, without any sense of guilt on a moral or sexual
level,'' Vadim said.
</P>
<P>
	   The film defined the content and set the tone for many of Vadim's movies,
including the 1968 ``Barbarella,'' an avant-garde sci-fi romp starring his new
wife, Fonda.
</P>
<P>
	   Vadim also earned praise as a producer, writer and theater director in a
career that spanned half a century. His most recent work included several
made-for-television mini-series. His films were sometimes superficial in
content, but always technically strong and full of visual elegance.
</P>
<P>
	   Mostly, though, his films were known for their beautiful women.
</P>
<P>
	   Vadim cast 26 movies with leading ladies ranging from the elegant Deneuve to
earthy Angie Dickinson and intellectual Jeanne Moreau and Susan Sarandon. In
1988, he did a remake of ``And God Created Woman'' starring Rebecca DeMornay.
</P>
<P>
	   French theater director and former actor Robert Hossein starred in some of
Vadim's films and was his friend for over 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When he spoke of eroticism, he knew what he was talking about, he
suggested it rather than showing the kinds of disgusting things we see today,''
he told France's LCI television.
</P>
<P>
	   Vadim was born Roger Vladimir Plemiannikov on Jan. 26, 1928, in Paris, the
son of a diplomat. He met Bardot when she was 15. He was behind her early career
as a fashion model and later introduced her to the cinema.
</P>
<P>
	   They married in 1952 when she was only 18. He was 24. After divorcing Bardot
in 1957, he married actress Annette Stroyberg with whom he had his first child,
Nathalie.
</P>
<P>
	   Vadim then lived with Deneuve, with whom he had his second child, Christian,
now a French actor. Deneuve starred in Vadim's 1962 ``Vice and Virtue.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1967 he married Fonda and together they had a daughter, Vanessa. Eight
years later he married Catherine Schneider with whom he had his fourth child,
Vania.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990 he wedded for the fifth time, marrying actress Marie-Christine
Barrault. They were still married when he died.
</P>
<P>
	   Vadim's other films include ``Les Bijoutiers du Clair de Lune'' (The Night
Heaven Fell) (1958), ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' (Dangerous Liaisons) (1959),
``Et Mourir de Plaisir'' (Blood and Roses) (1960) and ``The Hot Touch'' (1981) .
</P>
<P>
	   Vadim also wrote several books including his autobiography, ``D'Une Etoile a
l'Autre'' (From One Star to the Next), in which he described his marriages to
Bardot and Fonda.
</P>
<P>
	   His is survived by his wife and his four children. Funeral arrangements were
pending.

<HEADLINE> Court declines to quash subpoena of reporter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - A Commonwealth Court judge declined to intervene
Friday in the case of a reporter who was subpoenaed by the state Ethics
Commission to testify about an alleged confidentiality breach by an Easton
mayoral candidate.
<P>
	   Judge Eunice Ross said procedural rules barred her from hearing arguments on
whether the subpoena of Jimmy Miller, a reporter for The Express-Times of
Easton, was valid until he had refused to honor it first. The subpoena orders
Miller to appear before the commission Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sorry we have to do this," Ross said as she made her ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission is investigating what Pat Vulcano Jr. did to publicize an
ethics complaint he made against Easton Mayor Tom Goldsmith last year. In
October, the commission questioned Miller about Vulcano's actions and warned the
newspaper not to print details of the probe, saying it could be subjected to
criminal penalties for violating the commission's confidentiality rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The Express-Times ran a story Oct. 10 outlining the Ethics Commission
investigation, as well as the commission's warnings to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   At the hearing, Express-Times lawyer Richard Robinson argued that the court
should intervene now because he had already advised Miller to ignore the order.
</P>
<P>
	   "My request is that the motion not necessarily be denied at this point,
because we'll be back here and I'll be arguing the merits of the motion anyway,"
Robinson said. "We might as well listen to the arguments now."
</P>
<P>
	   After the ruling, Miller said he would disobey the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems kind of ridiculous that we have to do this all over again," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   John Contino, the commission's executive director, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Vulcano, the Democratic challenger for mayor, filed an ethics complaint last
May that accused Goldsmith, the Republican incumbent, of misusing his office for
campaign purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ethics Commission investigators said Vulcano, who was unsuccessful in his
mayoral bid, breached their confidentiality rules when he gave copies of his
complaint to Miller. The Express-Times broke the same rules by printing a story
about the investigation, commission investigators said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the hearing Friday, the commission moved to seal the court's record
on Miller's case and to close Friday's hearing to the public, citing
confidentiality concerns with its ethics investigation of Vulcano.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross declined to close the hearing but agreed to seal the record.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Keegan, editor of The Express-Times, said the commission's actions
constitute an abuse of state power. After Friday's hearing, commission officials
told the newspaper's attorney that they intended to subpoena another
Express-Times reporter related to a story published last August, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman had announced at a public meeting that she planned to file an ethics
complaint and the newspaper reported it, Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I take it as a threat," Keegan said of the commission's action. "This
proves beyond a doubt that the Ethics Commission's only purpose is harassment.
</P>
<P>
	   "How this criminal statute (Contino is) citing ever made it into law is
beyond my comprehension," he said. "We're going to challenge it and we're going
to eliminate it. At the least, we're certainly going to defy it."
</P>
<P>
	   Contino refused to discuss whether the commission planned another subpoena.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Ends Down 218.42  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today, pushing the Dow Jones industrial
average into what some market watchers consider a correction, as investors
dumped technology shares to collect profits from their recent rally. The drop
came despite a report of a welcome slowdown in retail sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 218.42 to 10,425.21. The blue-chip
index is now 11 percent below its Jan. 14 record. Some analysts consider a drop
of at least 10 percent a correction, which signifies a reversal of a market
trend but doesn't necessarily mark a long-term change.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index also fell
sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 36.36 to 1,380.47, and the Nasdaq composite
index fell 90.23 to 4,395.40.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.02 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.05 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.49 to 535.72.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft, which dealt the sharpest blow to the three major indexes, tumbled
after the Gartner Group, an information technology consulting company, said many
companies are likely to experience problems installing Microsoft's new Windows
2000 software. The long-delayed release of Windows 2000 is scheduled for release
next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond Microsoft, the technology sector dropped as investors took profits
from some of the largest, most widely held stocks. Cisco Systems and Hewlett
Packard were among the losers.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we are getting is some very, very long overdue profit taking in the
superstars in the technology and Internet sectors," said Alfred E. Goldman,
chief market strategist, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. "The question is whether or
not this is going to be a half-a-day phenomenon, or a week- or two-week
pullback."
</P>
<P>
	   In recent sessions, technology stocks have regained the strength they
exhibited in late 1999, when the tech-laden Nasdaq sped past every other market
indicator to finish the year with an 85.6 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest run set up the sector for today's bout of profit-taking, analysts
said. Technology is playing such a dominant role in the market that when those
shares hit a rare patch of trouble, the broader market tumbles as well.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the case today, as blue-chips like Merck and DuPont fell, unable to
attract any of the investors fleeing the technology group.
</P>
<P>
	   The selloff came despite the Commerce Department's retail sales data, which
showed that Americans spent selectively in January, pushing sales up by just 0.3
percent as they bought less furniture and food but purchased more cars.
</P>
<P>
	   January's performance was weaker than the 0.6 percent rise many analysts
forecast and marked the slowest pace since a 0.3 percent increase in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Since consumer spending accounts for the bulk of economic growth, the report
calmed some worries about interest rate increases this year. The Federal Reserve
has already raised rates four times since June, hoping to slow the economy and
prevent inflation from accelerating.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet analysts were cautious, noting that at least some of the slowdown came
from one-time factors. Most notably, Americans who stockpiled groceries and
other goods in December in preparation for Year 2000 found little reason to shop
in January.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is nothing in this report that will change the Fed's view on the
economy," said Mark Vitner, economist at First Union Securities.

<HEADLINE> Prominent Lawyer Killed in Tijuana  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Attackers with automatic rifles shot and killed one of
Tijuana's most prominent attorneys, his wife, 24-year-old son and a security
guard, Mexican newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodolfo Gallardo Hernandez and the others were shot outside his family's
Tijuana house Wednesday night, the state attorney general's office said,
according to reports in several newspapers. The gunmen fired at least 50
bullets, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tijuana has been wracked by drug-related violence for several years and is
the base for Mexico's most violent narcotics cartel. The city of about 1 million
people recorded about 300 murders last year, and it has seen 62 killings so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the slayings appear to be drug-related executions. But there was no
apparent motive in the killing of Gallardo, who was the former head of two local
bar associations and a prominent political figure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What has happened goes beyond indignation. It is intolerable,'' Tijuana
Mayor Francisco Vega was quoted as saying by a newspaper in the border city,
Frontera.
</P>
<P>
	   State police are in charge of murder cases and federal police have
jurisdiction over drug cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Frontera reported that early last year, Gallardo, accompanied by police, had
served an eviction notice on a house in the area and that police found more than
a ton of marijuana there.
</P>
<P>
	   In April 1999, the newspaper said, an explosive device powerful enough to
destroy three houses was found at Gallardo's house and removed by Mexican
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Baja California Deputy Attorney General Olga Guadalupe Jimenez told
reporters that officials believe four to six attackers took part in the
shooting, firing at the attorney and his wife, Marta Delgado, from both sides of
their car.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney's son, Rodolfo Gallardo Delgado, 24, was shot to death in his
car when he came out of the family's house after hearing the shots, Jimenez
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also killed was Fernando Alcala, the personal security guard for the
Canadian consul in Tijuana. The honorary consul, Roberto Encinas, was a neighbor
of the Gallardos, the Mexico City daily Reforma reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Reforma said the Emilio Rabasa College of attorneys, which Gallardo once
headed, had recorded the murders of 20 Tijuana attorneys in the past five years,
including five killings in the past year. None of the cases has been solved.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Prices Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices fell sharply Friday on a
mix of weekend profit-taking and reaction to weather and
supply-demand reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn dived on concerns that the U.S. Department of Agriculture
will increase its estimate of China's corn sales before the
marketing year ends. The USDA figure released Friday, 8 million
tons, was deemed low by traders, and China is thought to be
enjoying continuing strong sales as it dominates the Southeast
Asian and South Korean markets.
</P>
<P>
	   High Chinese exports could signal that U.S. sales are being cut
into, although there has been no sign of a falloff thus far.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans gave up most of their big gains from Thursday in a
technical pullback. Prices also were pressured by forecasts for
showers in South America this weekend and more wet weather ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat prices dipped less severely on light profit-taking by
funds and caution among traders over a Feb. 20 Chinese trade
delegation visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.69 1/2 a bushel; March
corn fell 3 3/4 cents to $2.21 3/4 a bushel; March oats fell 1 1/4 cent to
$1.09 a bushel; March soybeans fell 7 3/4 cents to $5.05 1/4 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef and pork futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   April live cattle fell .28 cent to 71.02 cents a pound; March
feeder cattle rose .25 cent to 83.52 cents a pound; April lean hogs
rose .30 cent to 59.40 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell 1.52
cent to 88.25 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> EU Gives Austrian Cold Shoulder  </HEADLINE>
   By CRISTIANA PEREIRA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- An Austrian minister felt the chill of her
country's political isolation Friday when she was snubbed by her European Union
colleagues in the first meeting since 14 EU member states reduced diplomatic
ties with Vienna.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU ministers turned a cold shoulder to Elisabeth Sickl to drive home
their displeasure at Joerg Haider's anti-immigration Freedom Party, which gained
seats a week ago in Austria's coalition government despite Haider's previously
expressed sympathy with aspects of Nazism.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials canceled a welcome ceremony and the traditional photograph, as
well as cultural events on the fringes of the labor and social affairs meeting.
Sickl appeared disoriented when she entered the building and had to find her own
way to the meeting room.
</P>
<P>
	   She acknowledged the atmosphere was ``a bit cool'' and said Portuguese Labor
Minister Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues was the only minister who spoke to her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a lot of prejudice going on,'' Sickl told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Some ministers delivered pointed and lengthy criticism of racist policies
until Ferro Rodrigues intervened to remind participants to limit remarks to the
agenda, a Portuguese official said, on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The French and Belgian ministers walked out when Sickl rose to speak.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a symbolic and political gesture,'' French Labor Minister Martine
Aubry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Belgian Minister Laurette Onkelinx said her country wanted EU treaties
altered to permit the expulsion of countries that had far-right parties in
government.
</P>
<P>
	   German Minister Walter Riester took a more moderate line. ``She said nothing
I could criticize,'' he said of Sickl's speech, which focused on the need to
uphold democratic values.
</P>
<P>
	   British Minister Alistair Darling did not take his place at the official
lunch next to Sickl and ate in an area separate from the other delegates. None
of the other delegates spoke to her.
</P>
<P>
	   Sickl appeared unruffled and insisted she would continue to attend EU
meetings. ``I knew it was important to come. The only possibility of resolving
conflicts is through dialogue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Austria, the country's foreign minister, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, insisted
she could see cracks in the wall of opposition despite the chilly reception in
Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that two countries (France and Belgium) stand at the very
front,'' she said in an interview for publication Saturday in the newspaper Neue
Volksblatt. ``The others are going along with them out of solidarity but many of
them are not happy about that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Austria's 14 EU partners froze individual diplomatic relations with Austria
after the Freedom Party joined Austria's government. The sanctions also include
refusing to back Austrian officials running for posts in international
organizations and downgrading contacts with Austrian ambassadors in EU capitals.
However, Austria can take part in multilateral EU meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   Several thousand Austrians rallied against their government in major cities
Friday, urging the world not to condemn the whole country because Haider party
shares power.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
   By ZEINA KARAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah guerrillas killed a seventh Israeli
soldier Friday and seriously wounded another. Israel retaliated with a 13th day
of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss appealed for American and French
intervention. He singled out the United States, but also called on the
international community ``to shoulder their responsibilities (in deterring
Israel) in the name of right and justice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel responded to Hezbollah's fatal rocket and mortar attack on an Israeli
army base with repeated airstrikes Friday, firing missiles from helicopter
gunships and fighter jets at guerrilla hideouts and routes. At least 12 missiles
were fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli jets returned later in the evening and fired two more missiles at
suspected guerrilla hideouts in Jabal al-Daher on the edge of an
Israeli-occupied border zone in south Lebanon, Lebanese security officials in
the region said. The area was earlier targeted with four missiles. No casualties
were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed the airstrikes and the Israeli
casualties. An announcement said Sgt. Zachi Yitah, 19, was killed and another
soldier was seriously wounded when a missile hit a combat trench.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he would retaliate further in his own
time with ``very harsh strikes in Lebanon,'' but reaffirmed a pledge to withdraw
troops by July.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the leader of Hezbollah vowed more attacks with the aim of driving
Israeli forces out of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bombing of infrastructure in Lebanon will not protect the (Israeli)
occupation troops. Rather, it will expose them to more painful strikes,''
Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah told a delegation from Egypt's Al-Ahram
newspaper led by its editor, Ibrahim Nafie, Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(Hezbollah) attacks will continue with the same momentum and strength
until the (Israeli) enemy is defeated and forced to withdraw unconditionally
from Lebanon,'' Nasrallah added, according to a Hezbollah statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah said in a statement that Friday's
operation proved ``the enemy's complete impotence in the face of the prowess of
resistance fighters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli soldiers have patrolled a strip inside southern Lebanon since 1985
in an effort to curb cross-border guerrilla raids on its communities. Hezbollah
is the main guerrilla group trying to oust Israeli troops from Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Israeli military officials said that Israel would no longer
abide by a code of engagement which restricted firing toward civilian areas and
said they would strike back hard against any attacks on their soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Cost of U.S. Embassies Debated  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators told the Clinton administration Friday that
spending $100 million to build a U.S. diplomatic mission is just too extravagant
for the American people to swallow.
</P>
<P>
	   Granted, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings told Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
at a budget hearing that security must be upgraded to counter terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   But singling out Pristina, the capital of Serbia's Kosovo province, Hollings
said a need to bolster security was being used as an excuse to tear down and
rebuild -- for $90 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Costs are even higher elsewhere, Hollings told Albright, as she squirmed a
bit in the Senate Budget Committee witness chair.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't keep spending $100 million on embassies, because that cuts into
my credibility when I try to get what we need,'' said Hollings, a defender of
most foreign spending as essential.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it is accurate ... that we are spending in some cases $100 million on
embassies, most people in America, and I know my constituents, would think
that's extravagant. That's too much,'' Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That absolutely needs to be reviewed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And yet, Conrad told Albright, he had been in embassies in his travels
abroad that he found in very bad condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., who kicked off the debate, said he has visited
many U.S. embassies and has been on occasion embarrassed at their condition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are threadbare places, often, and we're the greatest country in the
world,'' Smith said. ``And for crying out loud, some of these places are a bunch
of trailers pushed together because the facilities are so woefully inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright took a neutral position.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're looking very much at how to right-size our embassies,'' she said.
``Some of them are too big, and some of them are too small. Some of them have
very fancy places, and some of them have trailers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright told the committee the State Department is seeking $1 billion for
security improvements -- $500 million to build secure embassies, $200 million
for security around the embassies and $328 million for various upgrading moves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our diplomats are on the front line,'' she said. ``I think many of them
have, unfortunately, died as a result of being out there in places that are very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, Albright testified, diplomats ``are people that need to be
respected.''

<HEADLINE> Mayor and police: Wall Street explosion most likely not linked to  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A homemade device which a police official said was
"similar to a pipe bomb" exploded just off Wall Street early Friday, breaking
windows in two office buildings and slightly injuring one person.
<P>
	   "There was nothing to point us to an act of terrorism," said First Deputy
Commissioner Patrick Kelleher. Earlier in the day, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also
said the incident did not look terrorist-related.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are exploring all leads, including potential disgruntled employees, or
someone who may have had something against the building," Kelleher said. The
35-story building is located at 75 Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   No one had claimed responsibility for it and police believe the explosion
was the act of one man, now wanted by investigators for questioning. An
eyewitness told police he saw the man in the area of the building, perhaps
kneeling down, just minutes before the explosion, Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police hope the building's security cameras will provide a picture of the
person responsible, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The man was described as weighing 200 to 225 pounds, between 5 feet 10
inches and 6 feet tall, with short hair, a light complexion, and a bushy
mustache. He was wearing a tan three-quarters length jacket, with a corduroy
collar and cuffs. The man also had a toolbox and possibly was wearing a
knapsack, Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
	   An $11,000 reward was being offered by the city and Crime Stoppers for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of a suspect or suspects. The
sketch was being circulated in the building in hopes of finding out if one of
the tenants was the target, Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The explosion "could have killed people," and that four postal workers - on
their way to work - were about 30 feet away when the device went off, Giuliani
said. One was treated for ringing in the ears.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelleher said the device - still being examined - was a metal rectangular
container similar to a military ammunition canister.
</P>
<P>
	   "It had cardboard inside it, and black powder was stuffed inside the
cardboard," he said. No nails or other fragments were found inside, and the
device had a "low level force," Kelleher added.
</P>
<P>
	   "It could be classified as similar to a pipe bomb," he said. Police
Commissioner Howard Safir is on vacation this week in Utah and was not available
for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelleher said the four postal workers passed the device, realized it could
be dangerous and started running.
</P>
<P>
	   "Had they been a few steps behind where they were, we could have had a much
more significant tragedy," Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
	   The device blew up at 4:41 a.m. Friday in front of an office building owned
by Barclays Bank on the corner of Wall and Water streets, just blocks from the
New York Stock Exchange in the city's Financial District. Windows were blown out
in the building, and at neighboring 95 Wall St.
</P>
<P>
	   In November 1997, a similar incident occurred outside an office tower owned
by Merrill Lynch at 222 Broadway, also in the Wall Street area. A small homemade
bomb exploded shortly before 6 a.m., shattering glass but injuring no one.
</P>
<P>
	   In December 1997, an explosive device exploded in front of Planet Hollywood
at 140 W. 57th St. in midtown Manhattan around 6 a.m. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelleher said so far, police do not see a link between the three incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   Dennis Theodore was working the overnight shift at World Co. LLC, one block
from the blast.
</P>
<P>
	   "The windows shook. The whole building shook," Theodore said. "I thought it
was in my building, or right outside my building. That's how loud it was."
</P>
<P>
	   He went outside to investigate and found "smoke all over the place. ... It
was very scary."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Barclays Bank said the company owned the building, but did
not have any offices in it. J.P. Morgan and Dresdner Bank are among the
companies with office space in the roughly 40-story building. Barclays released
a brief statement saying there was very minor damage done to the building.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE broker Joseph Muscarella of Navesink, N.J., said the area offered a
high-profile location for anyone seeking to draw attention.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just a shame that you have to live like this," he said. "But it's just
a part and parcel of what we do. ...Whenever anyone wants to protest anything,
they come to the exchange."
</P>
<P>
	   Some who worked in the area gathered outside on Friday morning, drinking
coffee and chatting on cellular phones, but few seemed worried.
</P>
<P>
	   "I figure if they were actually going to blow something up, they'd aim a
little farther down Wall Street," at the stock exchange, said a man who works in
the building and who identified himself only as Jamie. "I'm kind of surprised
they picked this building."
</P>
<P>
	   Sheikh Drammeh, who works for a finance company across the street, still
views Wall Street as "the best" place to work. "A million bombs will not change
my view about Wall Street and New York City in general."
</P>
<P>
	   The explosion did not affect subway service to the area, though some streets
were closed in the early morning hours. Workers were let inside the two affected
buildings through alternate entrances beginning at about 8:15 a.m. The NYSE also
opened at its usual time.

<HEADLINE> Is it Too Easy Win on Millionaire?  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Think the questions on "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" are
too easy? You try them, says the show's best-known winner.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're only easy if you know them," said John Carpenter, the Connecticut
man who became the first of two million-dollar winners last November on ABC's
hit game show.
</P>
<P>
	   The British insurer responsible for paying out the show's top prizes
disagrees. Goshawk Syndicate filed suit in Britain's High Court of Justice to
get out of its contract, worried it would have to pay too much unless the show
asked harder questions and selected dumber contestants.
</P>
<P>
	   "Millionaire" host Regis Philbin said the company was "chicken."
</P>
<P>
	   "Can you believe this?" Philbin said on "Live with Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee"
Friday. "This is what insurance is all about. It's a risk. You can't take the
risk, don't insure the show to begin with."
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Davies, executive producer of "Millionaire," declined to talk about
the lawsuit on Friday. But last month, he vigorously defended the show's
questions.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to answer every single question," he said. "The questions might be
easy within their category, but there is such a broad range, it is almost
impossible for anybody on a regular basis to be able to go through all the
questions in any given stack."
</P>
<P>
	   To win $1 million, a contestant must answer 15 multiple-choice questions in
a row correctly.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's much easier to play the game sitting in an easy chair at home than
sitting across from Regis in the studio," said Doug Van Gundy, a West Virginia
man who won $250,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The multiple-choice questions are frequently easy in the early rounds. One
contestant was asked which condiment is also known as a Latin dance, correctly
choosing salsa over the other options: mustard, mayonnaise and relish.
</P>
<P>
	   They get harder as the stakes grow higher. The first million-dollar winner
won by correctly identifying the U.S. president to appear on the TV show
"Laugh-In" (Richard Nixon). The second had to know the distance between the
Earth and the sun (93 million miles).
</P>
<P>
	   Goshawk's policy required it to pay prizes of $500,000 or $1 million.
Goshawk's responsibility didn't kick in until a $1.5 million deductible was met,
and there was a ceiling of $5 million. The "Millionaire" production company,
Buena Vista Entertainment Inc., was responsible for all smaller prizes.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the game shows that were rushed onto the air in the wake of ABC's
success, Fox's "Greed" and NBC's "Twenty-One," don't have outside insurers.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox looked into a policy but determined it was too expensive and decided to
pay the prize money itself, said Mike Darnell, executive vice president of
alternative programming at Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   An insurance policy is common for contests, including game shows, where big
prize money is offered, said Steve Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance
Information Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   There is some danger that a show's public image could be affected by the
knowledge that some outside agency is involved, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes it takes some of the allure away," Goldstein said. "Part of the
reason people like the show is that they believe the network is paying out the
money. I did have people say to me, 'I didn't know they had insurance."'
</P>
<P>
	   Fox's Darnell said it's obvious the "Millionaire" questions are easy -- but
only to a point.
</P>
<P>
	   "When they get past the first five or six questions, it gets pretty
difficult," he said.

<HEADLINE> Fire department proposes $80,000 fine for chained high school  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Newark fire officials have proposed an $80,000 fine
because 16 doors at Barringer High School were found to be chained shut during
school hours, despite warnings that locked doors violated the state fire code.
<P>
	   "We're going to meet with them. If the problem is mitigated, there could be
an adjustment," city Fire Director Stanley Kossup said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The code provides fines of $5,000 per door. The inspection that found 16
chained doors was conducted in November, and subsequent inspections still found
chained doors at the 1,600-student school.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a fire did occur, there could be a disaster," Kossup said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barringer Principal Alan Alvarez told The Star-Ledger of Newark that doors
are not chained unless they are broken.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know historically, for security in urban schools, the doors are chained,"
Alvarez told the newspaper in Friday's editions. Unchained doors put "a burden
on our staff to make sure no intruders have entered the building."
</P>
<P>
	   Alvarez and district officials could not be reached for comment Friday
because schools were closed for a state holiday.

<HEADLINE> Millionaire: Is it Too Easy to Win?  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Think the questions on "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" are
too easy? You try them, says the show's best-known winner.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're only easy if you know them," said John Carpenter, the Connecticut
man who became the first of two million-dollar winners last November on ABC's
hit game show.
</P>
<P>
	   The British insurer responsible for paying out the show's top prizes
disagrees. Goshawk Syndicate filed suit in Britain's High Court of Justice to
get out of its contract, worried it would have to pay too much unless the show
asked harder questions and selected dumber contestants.
</P>
<P>
	   "Millionaire" host Regis Philbin said the company was "chicken."
</P>
<P>
	   "Can you believe this?" Philbin said on "Live with Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee"
Friday. "This is what insurance is all about. It's a risk. You can't take the
risk, don't insure the show to begin with."
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Davies, executive producer of "Millionaire," declined to talk about
the lawsuit on Friday. But last month, he vigorously defended the show's
questions.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to answer every single question," he said. "The questions might be
easy within their category, but there is such a broad range, it is almost
impossible for anybody on a regular basis to be able to go through all the
questions in any given stack."
</P>
<P>
	   To win $1 million, a contestant must answer 15 multiple-choice questions in
a row correctly.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's much easier to play the game sitting in an easy chair at home than
sitting across from Regis in the studio," said Doug Van Gundy, a West Virginia
man who won $250,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The multiple-choice questions are frequently easy in the early rounds. One
contestant was asked which condiment is also known as a Latin dance, correctly
choosing salsa over the other options: mustard, mayonnaise and relish.
</P>
<P>
	   They get harder as the stakes grow higher. The first million-dollar winner
won by correctly identifying the U.S. president to appear on the TV show
"Laugh-In" (Richard Nixon). The second had to know the distance between the
Earth and the sun (93 million miles).
</P>
<P>
	   Goshawk's policy required it to pay prizes of $500,000 or $1 million.
Goshawk's responsibility didn't kick in until a $1.5 million deductible was met,
and there was a ceiling of $5 million. The "Millionaire" production company,
Buena Vista Entertainment Inc., was responsible for all smaller prizes.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the game shows that were rushed onto the air in the wake of ABC's
success, Fox's "Greed" and NBC's "Twenty-One," don't have outside insurers.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox looked into a policy but determined it was too expensive and decided to
pay the prize money itself, said Mike Darnell, executive vice president of
alternative programming at Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   An insurance policy is common for contests, including game shows, where big
prize money is offered, said Steve Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance
Information Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   There is some danger that a show's public image could be affected by the
knowledge that some outside agency is involved, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes it takes some of the allure away," Goldstein said. "Part of the
reason people like the show is that they believe the network is paying out the
money. I did have people say to me, 'I didn't know they had insurance."'
</P>
<P>
	   Fox's Darnell said it's obvious the "Millionaire" questions are easy -- but
only to a point.
</P>
<P>
	   "When they get past the first five or six questions, it gets pretty
difficult," he said.

<HEADLINE> After-Hours Trading Said Expensive  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Individual investors who trade stocks outside the
traditional market hours are apparently paying a steep price to play in an arena
once open only to large professional investors.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, a new study says it can be twice as expensive to trade after-hours.
</P>
<P>
	   However, operators of electronic trading networks and online brokers who
serve after-hours traders argue that it's premature to draw conclusions on the
extended sessions, arguing that the study doesn't take into account the influx
of individual investors that occurred last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, conducted by University of Rochester, N.Y., professors Michael
Barclay and Terrence Hendershott, looked at after-hours trading patterns from
Jan. 1, 1999 to June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found that "the after-hours market is significantly more expensive
than the normal trading day market," Barclay said.
</P>
<P>
	   The higher price tag for trading outside the normal 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
session stems from so-called bid-ask spread costs, or the fees paid to middlemen
brokers who complete stock trades for investors, he explained.
</P>
<P>
	   Barclay said bid-ask costs during extended hours sessions are typically
about twice -- and sometimes two-and-a-half times -- as high as during regular
trading hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's how the costs escalate:
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft was trading at around $102 Friday morning. An investor seeking to
buy shares of Microsoft might typically bid $102.12 1/2 for the stock, but
actually pay $102.25. The 12 1/2 cent difference -- known as the spread -- goes
to the broker who completed the trade.
</P>
<P>
	   During extended sessions, however, trading volume is much thinner, so it's
more difficult to find matches for buy and sell orders, Barclay explained.
Consequently, the cost of matching buyers and sellers is higher, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the normal trading session "volume is less so it's less likely that
someone else wants to buy at the same time you want to sell," Barclay said.
</P>
<P>
	   After-hours volume has increased since last fall, when a handful of
computerized trading systems, known as electronic communications networks, or
ECNs, began allowing individual investors access to the extended hours sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to last summer, after-hours trading was open only to large
professional investors. That has some questioning the validity of the study.
</P>
<P>
	   Carolyn Chin, a spokeswoman for MarketXT, an after-hours ECN that caters
exclusively to small investors, said the study's findings are incomplete because
the research was completed before small investors had access to extended
sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Chin noted that most ECNs are trying to increase trading volume
by aligning themselves with online brokerage companies, which funnel investors
to the ECNs, and market making firms, whose role in the stock trading process is
to create active markets.
</P>
<P>
	   MarketXT, for example, was acquired earlier this week by online brokerage
Tradescape.com. And the ECN aligned itself early on with Madoff Securities, one
of the largest market makers in Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   But Barclay said the recent influx of small investors into the extended
sessions has barely affected volume levels. The sessions, he said, are still
dominated by the big players.
</P>
<P>
	   But that will change, said Tony Kafeiti, online supervisor at Castle Online,
a Freeport, N.Y., discount brokerage firm that processes its customers'
after-hours trades on ECNs.
</P>
<P>
	   "After hours trading is just starting to gain popularity. As you get a
larger number of investors, you'll get tighter spreads" and trading costs will
fall, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Kafeiti noted that a number of popular ECNs have announced plans to begin
trading some of the most actively traded stocks listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, which should attract additional investors to the after-hours markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Small investors have so far used ECNs primarily to trade stocks listed on
the computerized Nasdaq stock market.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept Won't Investigate Group  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has turned down a request by
Republican senators to investigate the activities of a group that promotes the
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Keeney said in a letter that the
department found no voter intimidation involved in efforts by Americans United
for Separation of Church and State to warn churches they were jeopardizing their
tax status by participating in Christian Coalition voter registration drives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For that reason, we declined to initiate a criminal investigation,''
Keeney wrote to Americans United executive director Barry Lynn last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the Christian Coalition and its political cronies thought they could
harass and bully Americans United into dropping its efforts to educate churches
about the perils of partisan political activity, they were wrong,'' Lynn said in
a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Last July, six Senate Republicans, including Sens. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Paul Coverdell of Georgia, asked Attorney
General Janet Reno to launch a criminal investigation into whether Americans
United had violated citizens' rights to vote by ``intimidating people of faith
into not participating in the political process.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sessions had no immediate comment on the Justice Department decision but
``thinks Americans United is one of the most aggressively left-wing
organizations in America,'' his spokesman John Cox said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sessions ``is offended by their suggestion that churches may lose their
tax-exempt status by allowing the Christian Coalition to conduct voter
registration drives,'' Cox added.
</P>
<P>
	   The request to Reno was linked to Americans United's advice to churches that
they could lose their tax-exempt status if they distributed biased voter guides
to their congregations. The group in particular warned of voter guides prepared
by the Christian Coalition, which had lost its request for tax-exempt status
after the Internal Revenue Service concluded that some of its activities were
too partisan.

<HEADLINE> Midwest Express Strike Threat Looms  </HEADLINE>
    By SHAUN TANDON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Midwest Express Airlines canceled more than a dozen
weekend flights and pilots picketed Friday as a deadline loomed for negotiators
to reach a contract to avoid a strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the Midwest Express Center in downtown Milwaukee, about 30 of the
airline's pilots held an informational picket, marching in a circle with signs
reading, "Contract or strike on February 12."
</P>
<P>
	   The union held a similar protest Friday at Mitchell International Airport,
the airline's hub. Midwest Express has 130 daily flights to 31 cities, including
Boston, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Air Line Pilots Association has been negotiating with Midwest Express
for 19 months to establish a contract -- the first between the two. The
airline's 320 pilots were free to strike if no deal was reached by 11:01 p.m.
CST Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In preparation for the strike, the airline canceled 15 flights scheduled for
Friday evening and Saturday morning. The 200 affected passengers were put on
other flights, said airline spokeswoman Lisa Bailey. A decision on flights later
Saturday and Sunday had not been made, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Mediation Board, which was holding talks between the union and
the airline in Washington, asked both sides not to discuss the negotiations
publicly.
</P>
<P>
	   According to fliers the demonstrating pilots passed out, final talks hinge
on wages, and pension and health insurance for retirees.
</P>
<P>
	   The union says the average salary for a five-year veteran pilot at Midwest
Express is $86,000, compared with an industry average of $145,000.
</P>
<P>
	   As for retirement benefits, the union says the airline would give retirees
less than 40 percent of their preretirement income, compared to 58 percent at
comparable airlines. The union also wants the airline to guarantee insurance for
retired pilots.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey declined comment Friday on the union's statements because of the news
blackout.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline said in the event of a strike, passengers would either be put on
other carriers, receive full refunds for their tickets or be allowed to book
tickets on future Midwest Express flights.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not too concerned today. My larger concern is getting back," said Peter
Voss of Milwaukee, who left Friday for a week in New York. "But if there's a
strike, I'm sure the airline will put us on comparable flights."

</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today, pushing the Dow Jones
industrial average into what some market watchers consider a
correction, as investors dumped technology shares to collect
profits from their recent rally. The drop came despite a report of
a welcome slowdown in retail sales. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 218.42 to 10,425.21. The blue-chip index is now 11
percent below its Jan. 14 record. Some analysts consider a drop of
at least 10 percent a correction, which signifies a reversal of a
market trend but doesn't necessarily mark a long-term change. The

sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $262.2 billion last month and
followed a huge and bigger-than-previously estimated 1.7 percent
gain in December, the Commerce Department said today. January's

</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investigators have determined that a
University of California computer was used as a middleman in this
week's attack on the CNN Internet site, the university said today.
But they are still looking for where the attack originated. ``There
is no indication that the attack came from anyone in the
university,'' said Kevin Schmidt, network programmer at the
university's Santa Barbara campus. FBI and Justice Department
officials had no comment on the role of the computers at UC-Santa
Barbara. Schmidt said a desktop computer in a research lab at the
Santa Barbara campus was electronically broken into by a hacker
sometime before Tuesday night's attack on the cable television
network's computer Web site.

three days of attacks against some of the biggest sites on the Web.
He will simply list a second e-mail address in case one doesn't
work in the future. Other users and Internet analysts echoed that
sentiment. Even sites that had problems said they didn't notice any

	   Microsoft's Windows 2000 To Debut

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Windows 2000, Microsoft's new corporate
operating system, will have its debut next week with all the glitz
and the glamor that accompanied the introduction of Windows 98 two
years ago. But the similarities between the two systems are much
less than the names would have you believe. Windows 2000 is a
successor to Windows NT 4.0 and designed for companies that have
large networks of computers and need to run complex business
operations on or off the Internet. Windows 98, meanwhile is
consumer-oriented and much easier to install and use. While some
individuals will choose to upgrade to Windows 2000 for its
additional security features and laptop computer compatibility,
it's not for everyone, analysts say. Microsoft's stock was down 6

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not a Online Security Risk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like former CIA Director John Deutch, who lost security
clearances after revelations that he kept secret files on an unsecured home
computer, President Clinton is a workaholic.
</P>

	   Clinton, too, is known to burn midnight oil working at home. But White House

he is ``computer challenged,'' poses an online security risk.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Rise 0.3 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans ratcheted back on their spending splurges last
month, allowing retail sales to rise by 0.3 percent. But economists didn't view
that as a sign of real moderation, saying harsh weather that kept some people
home and other factors masked the true strength of sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Wall Street suffered a huge selloff Friday as investors focused
on what they considered disturbing news that Microsoft's new Windows 2000
software may be difficult for many companies to install. The Dow Jones plunged
218.42 points to close at 10,425.21, putting the index 11 percent below its Jan.
14 record. The Nasdaq also fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   The modest increase in January's retail sales followed two straight months
of buying binges that catapulted sales in November and December by a
bigger-than-previously thought 1.3 percent and 1.7 percent respectively, the
Commerce Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, consumers spent selectively. They trimmed purchases at food,
drug and furniture stores as well as at bars and restaurants. But they bought
more cars, clothing and hardware.
</P>
<P>
	   "Are households tapped out? No way," said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff
Economic Advisors. "The consumer is happy, flush and ready to spend and they
will continue to do so."
</P>
<P>
	   Economists believed January's overall sales were dampened mainly by two
temporary factors: the bad weather and the lingering effects of the Y2K computer
date changeover. Specifically, people had stockpiled food and drug store-type
items in December, had plenty left over and thus reduced their spending on such
items in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding those effects, "underlying consumer momentum remains very strong,"
said Merrill Lynch economist Gerald Cohen.
</P>
<P>
	   To wit: the $262.2 billion in seasonally adjusted total retail sales rang up
last month is 9.6 percent higher than the sales reported for the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Given that, many economists said they expect the Federal Reserve to boost
interest rates by another quarter of a percentage point in March to slow down
the red-hot economy and keep inflation under control. Last week, the Fed bumped
up rates for the fourth time since June, a move that raised borrowing costs for
consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity,
continues to be the locomotive of the speeding economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Although many economists were expecting retail sales to rise by 0.6 percent
in January, they believed the weaker-than-expected performance was a fluke
caused by temporary factors. Moreover, they believe the government's report next
month is likely to reveal that January's sales were actually stronger than
originally thought and also will show strong February sales.
</P>
<P>
	   A big 2.2 percent decline in sales at food stores in January helped hold
back the growth of overall retail sales. Food sales surged in December by 3.2
percent as some consumers hoarded groceries in anticipation of the Y2K date
change, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug stores sales fell last month by 0.9 percent, following a strong 1.8
percent showing in December as some people stockpiled for Y2K, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, furniture stores' sales dropped by 0.4 percent and bars and
restaurants saw sales decline by 0.2 percent in January. Economists blamed those
declines on the bad weather.
</P>
<P>
	   But sales of new cars and trucks soared by 2.3 percent last month after a
1.4 percent rise in December.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that reflects the ongoing strength of the economy combined with
sales efforts and incentives offered by dealers," said Paul Taylor, economist
for the National Automobile Dealers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   With plentiful jobs, rising incomes and stock market gains, Americans are in
a position to spend briskly, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   And despite the bad weather, sales at hardware and clothing stores each went
up by a solid 0.7 percent in January, while sales at department and chain stores
rose by a brisk 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's major chain stores last week reported surprisingly strong sales
in January, helping stores finish their fiscal year -- which runs from February
through January -- with the biggest gains since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding the volatile automobile category, however, overall retail sales
fell 0.3 percent in January, much weaker than the 0.5 percent increase many
analysts were anticipating. That was the first decline in non-auto sales since a
0.1 percent drop in December 1997.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Fall Limits Dollar Gains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar inched higher against the yen but its gains were
held back by a selloff on Wall Street, which crimped demand for dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 108.99 Japanese yen, up
from 108.95 yen late Thursday. The euro was quoted at 98.69 cents, up from 98.62
cents late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar has been on a strong streak against the yen and euro in recent
sessions, but the currency struggled Friday amid a downturn in the stock market.
The 218-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average was led by technology
shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, currency trading was relatively quiet. A report showing a welcome
slowdown in the growth of retail spending in January did little to dispel
concerns that the Federal Reserve may still raise interest rates again this year
to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6261 Swiss francs, down from
1.6292, and 1.4506 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4490. The British pound fell to
$1.5921 from $1.6090.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Friday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9824 German marks, down from 1.9832; 6.6487
French francs, down from 6.6514; and 1,962.57 Italian lire, down from 1,963.36.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Parts May Be Buried in Ky.  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal nuclear regulators are investigating the possible
burial of as much as 1,600 tons of nuclear weapons hardware on a 3,000-acre
Energy Department site in Kentucky, and whether the material poses a health risk
to workers there.
</P>
<P>
	   The Energy Department would confirm only that ``an underground classified
storage site'' at the facility near Paducah, Ky., was being investigated by the
department, Pentagon and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   But a memorandum by a senior health and safety specialist at the Paducah
Gaseous Diffusion Plant, located on the site, asks the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission to investigate whether the material poses new health risks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am ... deeply concerned for the safety of personnel working (at the
plant),'' wrote Raymond C. Carroll, the health and safety specialist who works
for the U.S. Enrichment Corp., which operates the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, who has worked at the plant since 1992, said in the memo that he
had learned of the nuclear weapons hardware being on site only on Jan. 13 from
his supervisor, who had learned of it only by chance recently.
</P>
<P>
	   The weapons material is believed to be within a 750-acre fenced-in part of
the site, but outside a smaller area that is leased by USEC and contains the
uranium processing plant. Still, Carroll said in his memo he was concerned of
possible worker exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some sanity needs to be put back into the system and personnel safety
needs to have commensurate emphasis with national security,'' Carroll wrote in
the memo, a copy of which was obtained Friday by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 57, who has been in nuclear health safety work for 30 years,
declined to discuss the memo or circumstances surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not making any comments,'' he said when reached at his office at the
Paducah plant.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC, the private company the processes uranium for use in commercial
nuclear power plants, said in a statement that ``based on information available
we are aware of nothing that adversely impacts our employees.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the Energy Department issued a report acknowledging that
workers at the plant during the Cold War years were exposed to high levels of
radiation and toxic chemicals, including plutonium mixed with some of the
uranium.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has said it wants to compensate the families of
workers who became ill and has sought $21.8 million to expand medical monitoring
and speed up cleanup of radioactive waste and pollution stemming from the
uranium processing.
</P>
<P>
	   The report made no mention of nuclear weapons components.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll said in the memo that the Energy Department was withholding this
information for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Contents of the memo were reported Friday by The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Friday, the department said: ``The Energy Department with the
DOD and Justice are looking at classified national security programs conducted
in the past at Paducah. That includes reviewing materials and quantities
involved.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to Carroll, USEC officials learned of DOE's investigation into the
presence of nuclear warhead parts only recently when a Justice Department
investigator let it slip.
</P>
<P>
	   Orville Cypret, the plant's radiation protection manger, then was told at
the Jan. 13 meeting by Dale Jackson, the DOE's acting site manager, that about
1,600 tons of ``nuclear weapons components'' had been buried at the site.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson also told Cypret that large quantities of plutonium and highly
enriched uranium, not previously known to have been there, had been brought to
the site over the years. Jackson said some of the material was still there,
although he could not give any locations, information about specific
radioisotopes or specific quantities.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Jackson nor Cypret returned telephone calls to their offices Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the situation ``unconscionable,'' Carroll wrote: ``I do not believe
that national security and site safety are mutually exclusive goals. Therefore,
I believe this situation warrants a serious investigation.''

<HEADLINE> Veteran pawnbroker: "Cash for gold" shops make me look good  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Martin Wood has seen it all. He's pawned most
of it.
<P>
	   The busted gamblers, poor young mothers and down-on-their-luck street people
flock to the blinking red-and-green neon "Wood's Money to Loan" sign on Atlantic
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
	   Offering diamonds, watches, guitars and televisions, they come for cash. For
diapers, for the rent, for the blackjack tables.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm the banker to the poor," he says. "At one time, I figured I'd retire at
60. But I have a good time, I work hard. They're going to have to carry me out
of here."
</P>
<P>
	   Wood, 64, is no casino-era Johnny-come-lately, like the merchants in the
tiny "cash for gold" shops around the corner on Pacific Avenue. He is a
second-generation pawnbroker who runs the store his father opened in 1927.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the legitimate business," says one of Wood's customers. "He's an
honorable guy. I wouldn't go anywhere else."
</P>
<P>
	   The "cash for gold" stores deal only in jewelry, stay open into the wee
hours of the morning, buy from desperate gamblers and - according to indictments
announced Thursday - accept stolen merchandise and gouge customers by charging
interest of up to 500 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Wood charges 3 percent interest monthly. He closes at 5 p.m. every day. And
to his regulars, he is more than a pawnbroker. He is part banker, part jeweler,
part confidante, part friend.
</P>
<P>
	   A waitress whose gambling habit has forced her to become a regular at Wood's
chats with him amicably, then breaks into tears at one point as he chastises her
about the need to save money for her son's education. "You don't want him
waiting tables, too, do you?" he says.
</P>
<P>
	   "How's it feel not to be in the news?" says another customer, referring to
the day's newspaper story about the indictments against the cash for gold
stores. "Good. How you doing? Tell your mom I was asking for her," he tells her.
</P>
<P>
	   The dusty, heavily fortified two-room store looks like an unsuccessful music
shop with a collection of jewelry in it. Six guitars line one wall, along with a
trombone, a few VCRs and two vintage rifles with bayonets attached.
</P>
<P>
	   Beneath them are glass cases with all manner of expensive watches, 14K gold
necklaces, costume jewelry. "It's what people never came back to get," he says.
Now it's for sale.
</P>
<P>
	   With his graying German shepherd, Samson, at his side ("He has a good bark.
And good teeth," Wood says), the silver-haired man with the gold-rimmed
eyeglasses does his business standing behind 1 1/2-inch bulletproof glass.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall-mounted videocameras capture everything on videotape. And just in case,
there's a panic button he can push to alert his security company and police.
</P>
<P>
	   But he says he's only been robbed once in 40 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   Not that all his customers are happy.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, a woman pleaded with him to let her pay the interest on a
hospitalized friend's jewelry so the items would remain in hock past the
four-month deadline for reclamation. Wood said no, the friend would have to come
in herself or send a notarized letter. Rules are rules. The woman left in a
huff.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't take any crap from anybody," he says after she walks out, setting
off the automatic door buzzer yet again. "I have a lot of friends - on both
sides of the economy - who look out for me."
</P>
<P>
	   He estimates that 65 percent of his business is gamblers. Superstitious ones
sometimes hock jewelry as soon as they get to town, even though they already
have money to gamble. Why? They think his money is lucky money.
</P>
<P>
	   To most, it's just money. And that's fine, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "Each person who comes through that door is different. Everybody's got a
different story. It's never boring. I'm comfortable. I could have quit by now.
But if I stayed home, without this, I'd have a divorce on my hands," Wood says.
</P>
<P>
	   Some things he just won't accept as collateral. Like glass eyes, false teeth
and anything else he doesn't think would sell if the owner failed to reclaim it.
</P>
<P>
	   One time, a man came in wanting to borrow money and leave his prosthetic
right arm as collateral. No dice.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told him no, we need left arms," Wood said.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Landslide Kills Mother; Son  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEXANDAR S. DRAGICEVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZENICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Frightened into action by an approaching
landslide, a Bosnian mother bolted to save her 3-year-old son but both were
swept away by the wall of mud, neighbors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Emina Okan, her son Edvin, and her mother died Thursday night when the huge
avalanche buried several homes and pushed a dozen others down a steep slope in a
suburb of the central Bosnian town of Zenica.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She managed to break loose and run toward her house to save her 3-year-old
baby inside,'' said Ramiz Delic, 24, who witnessed the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I saw earth swallowing her in front of my eyes before she made it to her
house,'' he said. ``I have never seen anything so terrible in my life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Emina's uncle, Munir Jasarevic, 45, stood by crying as miners pulled her
body from the mud. They laid her on a stretcher and covered her body with a
blanket.
</P>
<P>
	   Four people were still missing Friday. Coal miners, police and firemen
worked frantically to find survivors in the masses of mud and rubble, but rescue
officials were pessimistic. Some 400 people were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is unlikely that any of those trapped survived this,'' said Enes Zec,
head of the rescue mission. He said the slide was probably caused by a surge of
underground water that had been collecting in the area for some time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People were jumping out of the windows,'' said Smail Mujezinovic, whose
family of four was still trapped under the debris Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We heard this noise, and I saw fire, probably from electric cables being
torn apart. There was dust all around and it sounded like the whole place was
disintegrating,'' he said, tears running down his cheek.
</P>
<P>
	   Ilija Matkovic, 65, was leaving the area at dawn Friday with his wife Zora,
each carrying one bag. Their home was left hanging at the edge of the crater.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is all I have,'' she said. ``It all fits into one bag.''

<HEADLINE> Orange Juice Soars; Cocoa Sinks  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Orange juice prices soared 5 percent Friday on the Board of Trade of the
City of New York after Florida's orange crop, by far the nation's biggest, was
forecast as smaller than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, cocoa futures sank to a 27-year low and palladium set a
record high.
</P>
<P>
	   The OJ trading pit was unusually hectic after the U.S. Department of
Agriculture revived a lackluster market by estimating Florida's strong 2000
orange crop at 219 million boxes -- fewer than market-watchers had anticipated.
Its projected yield-per-box was down to 1.54 gallons from 1.57 gallons, helping
to spur a speculative buying spree.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationwide, the orange crop was pegged at 288.7 million boxes, also
unchanged from January.
</P>
<P>
	   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures for March delivery rose 3.90 cents
to 87.30 cents a pound, the highest they've been in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Ernie Thomas, citrus specialist for Merrill Lynch in Winter Park, Fla., said
the market was just waiting for a reason to buy after seeing the price sink from
well up in the 90-cents-a-pound range to below 80 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market was obviously oversold," he said. "The estimate this morning was
the catalyst to get it going."
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa plummeted briefly to $750 per ton, lowest since 1973, amid continuing
huge production by Ivory Coast, the world's No. 1 supplier of cocoa beans. A
USDA attache raised his estimate of the African nation's coming crop.
</P>
<P>
	   May cocoa settled down $11 at $794 a ton on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Palladium rocketed higher on the increasing tightness of the world market
and the dearth of exports from Russia, the No. 1 producer of the metal used to
make catalytic converters for cars.
</P>
<P>
	   March palladium rose $18.85 to settle at $598.85 an ounce on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after hitting $600 for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Judge considers whether to release dorm fire inspection records  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A state judge could rule next week on whether to
release records on fire inspections at Seton Hall University that are now part
of a grand jury investigation into a fatal fire at a school dormitory.
<P>
	   South Orange, whose fire officials inspected the dormitory, and the Essex
County prosecutor's office, which is heading the investigation, have refused to
let reporters from two newspapers see the records.
</P>
<P>
	   The Record of Hackensack and The Star-Ledger of Newark sued, claiming that
the state's Right to Know Law and Common Law mandate that the records be open to
inspection are being violated.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutor's office asserted an exception for investigations in
progress, and South Orange said the documents are not public because the fire
code does not require inspection reports to be prepared.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspapers, noting the records were compiled before the fire, maintain
that their disclosure would not hurt the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   At a hearing Thursday, Executive Assistant Prosecutor Hillary Brunell asked
Superior Court Judge Joseph A. Falcone to seal the records for 90 days so
investigators could interview witnesses without possible media interference.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not yet known how the records will affect the investigation, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer for The Record, Thomas J. Cafferty, said the public should know
whether dormitories complied with fire codes. Anyone could see the records if
Falcone releases them, Cafferty said.
</P>
<P>
	   Falcone said he hoped to make a ruling at a hearing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm trying to balance this as best I can," Falcone said. "The quicker we
get this resolved, the better."
</P>
<P>
	   A grand jury convened by the prosecutor's office subpoenaed the records the
day after the Jan. 19 fire at Boland Hall that killed three freshmen.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the four students who remained hospitalized on Friday, one was in
critical condition and two were in satisfactory condition at Saint Barnabas
Medical Center in Livingston. At the request of her family, University Hospital
declined to release any information on Dana Christmas, hospital spokesman Rogers
Ramsey said. She had been critically injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The Record is seeking all dormitory inspection reports since Jan. 1, 1998.
The Star-Ledger requested South Orange records for the past 15 years on fires
and fire alarms at the university, as well as reports on inspections and fire
drills in that period.

<HEADLINE> State assemblyman charged with burglarizing aide's home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GENESEO, N.Y. (AP) - After spending two weeks in a psychiatric ward, a
state assemblyman surrendered to police Friday and was charged with burglarizing
a female aide's home last fall.
<P>
	   Jerry Johnson, 57, a four-term Republican whose district extends across
Livingston, Monroe and Allegany counties in western New York, was arraigned on a
charge of second-degree burglary, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of
five to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson pleaded innocent and was freed on $10,000 bail. The judge ordered
him to stay away from the woman and her husband, who live near this village 35
miles south of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
	   Flanked by relatives outside Geneseo Town Court, a solemn Johnson declined
to answer questions. But his attorney made it clear Johnson has neither
considered taking a leave of absence nor resigning from his post "at this time."
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson, who is divorced and has three daughters, was first elected in his
mostly rural district in 1992 and is up for re-election in November. He is a
ranking minority member of the mental health committee in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "He is on medication and we continue to receive medical care," his attorney,
John Parrinello, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson booked into Bry Lin Hospitals, a psychiatric center in Buffalo, Jan.
27 with the approval of Livingston County Sheriff John York, a personal friend.
York drove him to the courthouse Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation began in December when the woman, who was not identified,
told police her pocketbook had been stolen from her car. Authorities turned up
evidence that Johnson had entered her house without permission Oct. 22 and
placed a telephone call, York said, adding further charges could be filed soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has been treated the same as anybody else ... in a similar type of
investigation," the sheriff said. "It is very difficult. He's been a long-time
friend. But it's also been very difficult for the victim."
</P>
<P>
	   A Rochester television station, ABC affiliate WOKR-TV, reported the woman
alleged Johnson stalked her, made harassing phone calls and broke into her home
to steal her underwear. York declined to elaborate on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   After serving in the U.S. Air Force, Johnson worked his way up the ranks at
Genesee and Wyoming Railroad to become president and general manager in 1977. He
began his political career in 1972, serving on the education board, as a town
councilman and then as town supervisor in the village of Nunda for seven years.

<HEADLINE> Truckers slow down traffic to protest low rates, high fuel prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) - Hundreds of truckers slowed traffic to a crawl
outside cargo companies' doors at this port Friday to protest what they called
inadequate compensation for the rising cost of diesel fuel.
<P>
	   "Everything's been going up, except our rates," said Manny Flores, a
23-year-old driver for USA Trucking in Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
	   About 300 drivers, one holding an American flag out the window of his truck,
tied up traffic from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. in Port Elizabeth, then chanted in
Spanish in a parking lot to demand higher fuel surcharges from trucking
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies pay drivers a fee per container they unload at the port, but
drivers said the fee is not enough to make up for the 119 percent increase in
diesel fuel prices over the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "A month ago, $1.10, $1.20 (a gallon for fuel)," said Marlon Soza, 31, of
Jersey City. "Now we're paying $2.28."
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's protest followed a similar one in Elizabeth on Thursday, where
truckers formed human blockades to surround other truckers who were still
working. About 100 trucks slowly circled around the Statehouse in Trenton on
Thursday to ask Gov. Christie Whitman to do something about the steep increases
in fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   One trucker was arrested Friday following a fight with another trucker, said
Allen Morrison, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Ships continued to load and unload cargo and the port was not severely affected,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Flores disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is costing them millions of dollars right now," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Samuel Cunninghame, executive director of the New Jersey Motor Truck
Association, which represents trucking companies, said companies have raised
drivers' rates from 3 percent to 12 percent since diesel fuel prices have risen.
</P>
<P>
	   "The companies have passed on whatever percentage increase their shippers
have allowed them," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the spike in fuel prices was "too much, too soon," making it
difficult for anyone in the business to make a decent profit.
</P>
<P>
	   The truckers also complained on Friday of the time they have to wait before
they are allowed to unload their cargo.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes you stand four, five hours. Nobody pays for that," said Flavio
Rosa, 38, of Kearny. "I work for free."
</P>
<P>
	   The port authority's director of port commerce, Lillian Borrone, said the
agency would work to bring the truckers together with marine terminal operators
to resolve issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "We respect the truckers' right to voice their concerns, but disrupting
activity at the port is not the way to go about it," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the International Longshoremen's Association didn't
immediately return a telephone message Friday.

<HEADLINE> Flooding Hits Botswana, Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
   By DEREK JAMES
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) -- Rain, normally a blessing in this desert nation,
came down in torrents Friday, washing away sections of the only railroad and
flooding a prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Five straight days of downpour have killed scores of people throughout
southern Africa, claiming lives in Botswana, South Africa and Mozambique. More
than 100,000 people were left homeless in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Floods toppled shacks and forced schools to close. Thousands of motorists
were stranded by destroyed roads and bridges. Water covered thousands of acres
of sorghum, corn and other crops throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
	   The flooding was the worst in memory in Botswana, a Texas-sized country of
1.5 million people where rain is so precious that the local currency is called
the ``pula,'' which means rain.
</P>
<P>
	   Botswana's only rail line was washed away in two places. Water trickled over
the walls of the reservoir in the capital, Gaborone, where about 135,000 people
live.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 500 prisoners were evacuated from the flooded Gaborone Central
Prison, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Floodwaters swept away at least three people in the village of Kopong, 20
miles northwest of Gaborone. They were presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
	   With rainfall totaling more than 8 inches, Botswana's government considered
declaring the country a disaster area.
</P>
<P>
	   Truck traffic came to a standstill along the country's north-south highway,
the main conduit for goods coming from South Africa to Zambia and parts beyond.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the region, the rains have left tens of thousands homeless and
prompted emergency appeals for aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the 74 killed so far -- three in Botswana, 32 in Mozambique and 39
in South Africa -- were children swept away by rivers that overflowed their
banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Mozambique's government appealed for $2.7 million for rescue operations and
immediate relief.
</P>
<P>
	   UNICEF was distributing fresh water and shipping drugs and other medical
supplies to Mozambique as part of a dlrs 400,000 campaign prevent a possible
outbreak of cholera, malaria and diarrhea. ``Our chief concern right now is the
threat of disease,'' said UNICEF's representative in Maputo, Mark Stirling.
</P>
<P>
	   South Africa sent four helicopters, which ``have already been deployed in
worst hit areas of southern and central Mozambique,'' said Mozambique's
Transport and Communications Minister Tomaz Salomao.
</P>
<P>
	   The city council of Mozambique's capital, Maputo, said it needs to resettle
homeless people from at least 25,000 plots on the city's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities are seeking inflatable dinghies for those at risk of drowning,
tents for the homeless and generators to provide electricity for shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Africa, about 100,000 have been left homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   The rain also washed out Saturday's planned cricket match between South
Africa and England. The sold-out match, which was to have been played in
Johannesburg, was postponed until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want to present our fans and millions of TV viewers with a
half-baked contest, where players are slipping and sliding all over the place,''
said South African cricket director Ali Bacher.

<HEADLINE> Moser: People Too Focused on Haider  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Austria's ambassador said Friday the Europeans are giving
a right-wing Austrian politician Joerg Haider more attention than he deserves
and should focus instead on the elected leadership in Vienna, which formulates
national policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Haider is not Austria, and Austria is not Haider,'' Ambassador Peter Moser
told a news conference. He noted that the Freedom Party leader is not himself a
part of the government.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Moser admitted that Haider's outspokenness can make life
difficult for Austrian envoys.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes we diplomats have to walk behind him and pick up the pieces,''
he said. ``We have a lot of work to do behind him.'' Haider has been under fire
throughout Europe for praising some aspects of Nazi Germany's rule.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union severed political contacts with Austria last week after
the Freedom Party assumed six Cabinet seats in a new government.
</P>
<P>
	   Moser's embassy also has been hit by the fallout. He said Hungarian-born
Austrian pianist Andras Schiff canceled a benefit performance at the embassy
because, as a Jew, ``he is really concerned and distressed by this present
situation.'' Moser said he agreed to the cancellation, but ``that really hurt us
deeply.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has said it will limit contacts with Austria and
will monitor developments carefully. U.S. Ambassador Kathryn Hall, summoned back
to Washington earlier this week, is to return to Vienna this weekend. But she
will be back in Washington in two weeks to update Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on developments.
</P>
<P>
	   After hearing about the Austrian government's plan earlier this week,
Albright said Wednesday she was encouraged. But Thursday, U.S. Ambassador David
Johnson told a meeting of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe
that the United States is uneasy about Haider's statements ``expressing sympathy
for the Nazis and minimizing, even excusing, the tragedy of the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moser criticized the EU's decision to cut political ties with Austria as
``unjust and unfair'' and asking whether it constitutes a ``new European rule to
prescribe party programs'' to member nations.
</P>
<P>
	   But Moser said it was outrageous to call Haider a neo-Nazi.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Neo-Nazism is a crime,'' he said. The outcome of the election that brought
the Freedom Party to power doesn't mean its supporters are closer to ``neo-Nazi
thought.''
</P>
<P>
	   Voters in Carinthia province, who elected Haider governor last year, were
attracted by his nationalistic appeals because of a deeply rooted fear of
foreign encroachment, Moser said. Haider is continuing to serve as Carinthia's
governor.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Steel Industry  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton granted relief to the U.S. steel
industry on Friday in two major cases where steelmakers had sought government
action against a flood of foreign steel.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House announced that Clinton had decided to grant import relief
for U.S. steel wire rod manufacturers and makers of U.S. line pipe.
</P>
<P>
	   Decisions in the two cases had been delayed for months as a debate waged
inside the administration over whether to grant the industry petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters argued that in an election year the administration had to act to
protect the domestic industry and its workers while opponents charged the
actions would send the signal that America was erecting protectionist trade
barriers.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the latest announcements, Japan has given notice that it will
bring cases against the United States before the World Trade Organization
arguing that U.S. actions so far to impose penalty tariffs on imports of various
types of steel from Japan and other countries violated WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration argued that Clinton had no choice but to act under U.S.
trade laws to protect the domestic industry. Last September, 101 senators and
representatives had written Clinton urging favorable decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The action that the president has announced represents a clear statement
of the administration's commitment both to the vigorous enforcement of U.S.
trade laws and to the application of international trade rules,'' presidential
spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   In the announcement, the White House said that Clinton had imposed higher
tariffs on steel wire rod exceeding specific levels for a period of three years.
</P>
<P>
	   The tariff will be an additional 10 percent on imports of steel rod that
exceed 1.58 million tons in the first year with the level of imports allowed to
increase by 2 percent a year in the second and third years while the tariff
penalty will drop by 2.5 percentage points a year.
</P>
<P>
	   For line pipe, the president imposed an additional 19 percent tariff
although the first 9,000 tons of steel from each supplier country will be exempt
from the higher tariff each year. The penalty tariff will drop to 15 percent in
the second year and 11 percent in the third year.
</P>
<P>
	   While the surge of various steel shipments has subsided somewhat, the
administration remains under heavy pressure to do more to reverse a widening
U.S. trade deficit, which remains the major flaw in an otherwise stellar U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton acted following rulings by the U.S. International Trade Commissions
which found that increased imports of both wire rod and line pipe threatened
serious injury to the two U.S. industries.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the House had voted by a lopsided margin of 289-141 to sharply
limit steel imports to levels that existed before 1998, when the Asian financial
crisis triggered a flood of cheap steel imports into the United States. The
measure did not win passage in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Asylum Claims May Drag On  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Britain has staked out a tough line against Afghans seeking
asylum after a hijacking, but it could be months before a final decision.
Afghanistan warned Friday that the hijackers could face death if they returned.
</P>
<P>
	   After a standoff ended early Thursday at London's Stansted airport, 74 of
the freed hostages -- almost half -- requested asylum. Police have arrested 22
people who will likely face trial in Britain. The rest are still considering
their options.
</P>
<P>
	   Some British tabloids on Friday were incensed over speculation that some of
the Afghans might have used the hijacking to win asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No Entry'' proclaimed one London tabloid, objecting to the prospective
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sun branded their temporary shelter near Stansted airport as ``the Kabul
Hilton.'' The tabloid wrote: ``I watched in astonishment yesterday as a swish
Hilton Hotel was turned into a four-star refugee camp for a bedraggled bunch of
Afghan asylum seekers.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Welcome to your Home Cheat Home,'' said a Daily Star headline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hi, Jack! Where's the four-star hotel?'' said The Mirror.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jack'' refers to Home Secretary Jack Straw, who promised to review
personally every asylum application and send the hostages home or to another
country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if their applications were rejected, they would have 12 days to file an
appeal and an indeterminate amount of time for a hearing, the Home Office
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the complex nature of human rights claims and the large number of
applicants, the process would likely continue for several months or even a year,
said Amnesty International spokesman Neil Durkin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although there's an understandable need to bring the hijackers to justice,
the home secretary must not risk sending innocent men, women and children back
to a terrible fate,'' said Durkin.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Gen. Rahmatullah Safi, European representative for the Taliban,
told BBC radio that in Afghanistan ``punishment will be according to the law of
Shariah, which is death.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil later said the death
penalty was not automatic for hijackers, and he encouraged the hostages to
return home. He has asked British authorities to deal with the hijackers in
``accordance with British law and international norms.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was not known if any of the hijackers have requested asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   A plane chartered by the Geneva-based International Organization for
Migration arrived in England on Friday to ferry passengers back to Afghanistan,
but the aircraft may not take off until next week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At the moment it looks like there are about 20 or so who have said they
want to fly home,'' said Diane Grammer, spokeswoman for the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees, Britain can refuse
asylum to people who have committed grave crimes. But under the European
Convention on Human rights, they may not be deported if there is a risk of them
being tortured or ill-treated in their home state.
</P>
<P>
	   All of those on board -- both hijackers and hostages -- were at risk should
they return to Afghanistan, said Nick Hardwick, chief executive of the Refugee
Council.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is absolutely no doubt their lives would be in danger,'' said
Hardwick. ``It is not just what the government would do but what the government
would incite others to do to them. ... The women risk their lives. The children
risk persecution and an unpleasant future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Britain has a sympathetic track record in dealing with Afghan claimants.
</P>
<P>
	   But Straw told the House of Commons that the fact that the passengers were
on an internal flight made it difficult to believe they intended to claim asylum
unless they were complicit in the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers had taken over the Ariana Boeing 727 jet early Sunday during
what should have been a short domestic flight from the Afghan capital of Kabul
to the northern town of Mazar-e-Sharif.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Ends Down 218.42  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Friday, pushing the Dow Jones
industrials into a possible correction, as investors sold technology shares to
collect the profits from their recent rally. As the selloff proceeded, Wall
Street ignored the government's report of a welcome slowdown in retail sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The blue-chip Dow fell 218.42 to 10,425.21 to finish the session 11 percent
below its Jan. 14 record high of 11,722.98. Some analysts consider a drop of at
least 10 percent a correction, which signifies a reversal of a market trend but
doesn't necessarily mark a long-term change.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week, the Dow slid 538.59, or 4.9 percent. It was the Dow's worst
weekly point drop since the week ended Oct. 15, 1999, when it lost 630.05.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 29.71 Friday to 1,387.12, and the Nasdaq
composite index fell 90.18 to 4,395.45.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft, which dealt the sharpest blow to the three major indexes, tumbled
6 1/16 to 99 15/16 amid concerns that many companies will experience problems
installing the company's new Windows 2000 software. The long-delayed release of
Windows 2000 is scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the concerns about Microsofit that flooded trading floors
Friday weren't new -- they first surfaced in a report by the Gartner Group, an
information technology consulting company. But they gave investors an excuse to
take profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other big high-tech decliners, Cisco Systems fell 5 to 130 15/1, and
Hewlett Packard fell 4 5/8 to 121 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   The semiconductor sector, one of the hottest in recent weeks, also stumbled.
Applied Materials fell 9 3/4 to 165 and Texas Instruments fell 7 3/8 to 137 5/8.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we are getting is some very, very long overdue profit-taking in the
superstars in the technology and Internet sectors," said Alfred E. Goldman,
chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "The question
is whether or not this is going to be a half-a-day phenomenon, or a week- or
two-week pullback."
</P>
<P>
	   In recent sessions, technology stocks have regained the strength they
exhibited in late 1999, when the tech-laden Nasdaq sped past every other market
indicator to finish the year with an 85.6 percent gain. The latest rally set up
the sector for Friday's profit-taking, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology is playing such a dominant role in the market that when those
shares hit a rare patch of trouble, the broader market tumbles as well. That was
the case Friday, as blue-chips like Merck and DuPont fell, unable to attract the
investors fleeing the technology group. Merck lost 3 3/4 to 65 1/4 and DuPont
fell 2 31/32 to 50 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   The selloff came despite the Commerce Department's retail sales data, which
showed Americans spent selectively in January, pushing sales up by just 0.3
percent as they bought less furniture and food but purchased more cars.
</P>
<P>
	   January's performance was weaker than the 0.6 percent rise many analysts
forecast and marked the slowest pace since a 0.3 percent increase in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Since consumer spending accounts for the bulk of economic growth, the report
calmed some worries about interest rate increases this year. The Federal Reserve

	   Yet analysts were cautious, noting that at least some of the slowdown came
from one-time factors. Most notably, Americans who stockpiled groceries and
other goods in December in preparation for Year 2000 found little reason to shop

<HEADLINE> Britain Suspends Belfast Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Britain resumed direct control over
Northern Ireland on Friday, stripping power from the province's new
Protestant-Catholic administration -- its best chance at self-rule -- in hopes
of preventing the coalition's collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   But within hours of the move, the British and Irish governments announced
that the Irish Republican Army had softened its traditional refusal to disarm.
They called this ``a development of real significance'' that could allow the
Belfast administration -- a key plank of the province's 1998 peace accord -- to
regain powers soon.
</P>
<P>
	   That hopeful news, following an agonizing week of behind-the-scenes
negotiations did not deter Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson from
revoking the Cabinet's substantial powers just 72 days after handing them over.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said that while taking such action was ``deeply disappointing,''
it was necessary to discourage the Cabinet's major Protestant party, the Ulster
Unionists, from resigning their posts.
</P>
<P>
	   The withdrawal of powers came despite a last-minute claim from Sinn Fein
leader Gerry Adams that the IRA had just offered the British government ``a new
and significant proposition to resolve the arms issue.'' He refused to say
whether the outlawed group had agreed to abide by the peace accord's May
deadline to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   While Mandelson said the offering was inadequate and came too late, he
emphasized that powers could be transferred back to Belfast once two key
questions are answered: ``Is there going to be weapons decommissioning by the
IRA, and if so, when?''
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists agreed in November to form the four-party Cabinet
alongside politicians from the IRA-linked Sinn Fein. But as part of that
American-brokered deal, the Irish Republican Army was supposed to start
disarming in response.
</P>
<P>
	   But the province's disarmament commission reported Jan. 31 that the IRA had
made no such commitments, triggering the crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson's resumption of authority took pressure off the Ulster Unionists,
which scheduled a party conference Saturday to debate whether to withdraw from
the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   That meeting will proceed, but Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble -- who
agreed to share power with Sinn Fein two months ago in hopes IRA disarmament
would follow -- now faces less risk of being forced to resign as Cabinet leader.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it was extremely sad, but also necessary, for the government to
return powers to London,'' Trimble said. ``The reality is that we took a big
risk in accepting Sinn Fein on a trial basis, and we were assured that the IRA
would take similarly big risks in return. Once it became clear they would not,
our position became impossible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble said he spoke to Adams an hour before the Sinn Fein leader issued
his statement claiming a breakthrough -- a statement issued just minutes before
Mandelson's own announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mr. Adams told me nothing new was on offer,'' Trimble said. ``His
subsequent statement appears to be an orchestrated attempt to shift blame for
this crisis from where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
	   The British, Irish and U.S. governments consider Trimble's political
survival essential for the Cabinet to work. It includes the province's major
Catholic party, the pacifist Social Democratic and Labor Party or SDLP, and the
hard-line Protestants of the Democratic Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Stripping the Cabinet's powers allows it to remain intact on paper. Were the
Ulster Unionists to resign, it would collapse. A new election would have to be
held in Northern Ireland in which Trimble's hard-line Protestant opponents would
be likely to gain strength and make any new Cabinet even harder to form.
</P>
<P>
	   But SDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon, the senior Catholic in the Cabinet,
said Mandelson had only made matters worse by suspending their powers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who could imagine that securing IRA decommissioning will be any less
difficult now?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the province had a measure of self-rule was in 1974, when a
power-sharing Cabinet collapsed under the combined weight of Protestant protests
and IRA violence.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Starts 'Soft Money' Account  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER LOVEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert has joined a growing number
of congressional leaders with state-based political funds that allow them to
raise money unencumbered by Watergate-era federal limits on the size and source
of donations.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the Illinois Republican formed his nonfederal committee in his home
state, he can raise six-figure contributions from wealthy individuals and
corporations and use the money to boost Republicans at the state and federal
candidates around the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Illinois law requires only disclosure, but unlike federal law it does not
ban corporate donations or limit how much individuals or political action
committees can donate.
</P>
<P>
	   Details were unavailable on who has contributed to Hastert's fund since its
December launch, or how he is spending the money. No report had been filed yet
with the State Board of Elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert spokesman John McGovern said the KOMPAC State Victory Fund -- named
for the Keep Our Majority federal political action committee that Hastert also
controls -- has raised about $100,000 so far.
</P>
<P>
	   In congressional races, money Hastert raises through his new committee,
similar to the huge amounts of ``soft money'' raised by the national political
parties, can be used only for issue advertising, get-out-the-vote campaigns and
other party efforts short of advocating a specific candidate's election. Such
efforts often are designed to support parties while coming as close as possible
to helping candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   But on the state level, the money can be funneled to individual legislative
candidates. This is especially important now, since the parties in charge will
control the redrawing of district boundaries after this year's census.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll use it wherever we can,'' McGovern said. ``The fund will allow us to
participate in state races, and it will also help us contribute to state party
organizations which have an interest in get-out-the-vote efforts and
redistricting programs.''
</P>
<P>
	   The committee is chaired by Samuel Skinner, former chief of staff to
President Bush. The treasurer is Jane Mattoon, who holds the same post for his
federal leadership PAC. She is the wife of Daniel Mattoon, a former BellSouth
lobbyist whom Hastert recently installed as the top staff aide for the House
Republicans' campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
	   At least a dozen other lawmakers also are raising money outside federal
limits, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.

<HEADLINE> Music of 'On a Clear Day...' Soars  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL KUCHWARA AP Drama Critic
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In his autobiography, Alan Jay Lerner makes only fleeting
reference to his "On a Clear Day You Can See Forever," a musical he says was
"modestly received" when it opened on Broadway in 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   Judging from the concert version playing through the weekend at City Center
Encores!, you can see why. A glorious score, with rich, melodic music by Burton
Lane, sprightly lyrics by Lerner and a book by Lerner that is as bizarre as it
gets in the world of American musical comedy.
</P>
<P>
	   Lerner, best known for "My Fair Lady" and "Camelot," had a special interest
in extrasensory perception and reincarnation. Both filter through "Clear Day,"
the story of Daisy Gamble, a neurotic, present-day young woman from New Jersey
who learns she once had a life in 18th-century England as someone named Melinda
Welles.
</P>
<P>
	   Daisy is a bit of a kook. She knows when the phone will ring, finds lost
objects even before people know they are missing and makes flowers grow just by
talking to them.
</P>
<P>
	   The psychiatrist who discovers her double life falls in love, or so Daisy
believes, with her 18th-century self and not her present-day persona. Much
consternation, including a bit of time-traveling back to merry old England,
ensues before shrink and patient fall into each other's arms. Characters come,
go, reappear and then vanish without much effect on the plot.
</P>
<P>
	   In the original, the delightful Barbara Harris played Daisy. Here, the
casting is equally felicitous. If anything, this "Clear Day" proves most
definitely that Kristin Chenoweth can carry a show. Chenoweth's Daisy is a
kittenish charmer, a sweet and sexy slip of a girl. The performer can sing
sweetly AND be funny at the same time.
</P>
<P>
	   She curls comfortably around "What Did I Have That I Don't Have," a song
that has become a minor Broadway torch classic. And she gets the humor out of
"Hurry! It's Lovely Up Here" and "On the S.S. Bernard Cohn," two songs that
contain some of Lerner's wittiest lyrics.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Friedman would not seem to be a natural choice for the role of the
psychiatrist, played originally by John Cullum. More of a character actor than a
singer, Friedman nevertheless does a credible job with the ubiquitous title tune
and "Come Back to Me."
</P>
<P>
	   The evening's most robust voice belongs to Brent Barrett, playing Daisy's
18th-century love. He booms out "She Wasn't You," surely one of Lane's loveliest
-- and most forgotten -- melodies.
</P>
<P>
	   And the ever-stalwart Coffee Club Orchestra, under the direction of Rob
Fisher, does full justice to Lane's score. In the end, you realize that it is
the music that makes even the most oddball story soar.

<HEADLINE> FDA Investigates Gene Experiment  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration is trying to determine
if a small group of children dying from cancer might have been accidentally
exposed to the AIDS virus in a gene therapy experiment.
</P>
<P>
	   Suggestions that the children were exposed to HIV are highly questionable,
FDA officials stressed Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the FDA called initial contamination testing of the gene-based
medicine so tenuous that it would not have alarmed the children's families by
telling them until confirmatory tests now under way settle the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston said they had to notify families this week before newspaper
reports of the probe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It may all be a false alarm,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a physician,
after speaking with FDA and St. Jude's researchers.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA has suspended the gene therapy study while investigating whether
researchers followed federal safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   But St. Jude's lead researcher Dr. Laura Bowman said FDA officials have not
told her they suspect any violations, and said she regretted frightening parents
without evidence that any children were harmed. ``To induce that kind of grief
when it may be a lab error I think is unconscionable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers were hunting gene therapy for neuroblastoma, a nervous system
cancer. Babies often survive it, but neuroblastoma is highly lethal when it
strikes older children. If patients relapse after initial treatment, most die
quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Jude's gave the gene therapy to 19 relapsed children, 15 of whom have
died from their cancer. Only two received the batch of gene-based medicine
suspected of possible contamination, and they are among the cancer fatalities,
the hospital said. One of the four cancer survivors, however, has opted for
precautionary HIV testing.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been no sign of contamination in the gene-based medicine given to
six children at Baylor, said spokeswoman Claire Bassett. Two of those children
have died of their cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The concern arose when Bowman realized cells used to grow some of the
medicine used at St. Jude's might not have undergone proper quality testing. So
an outside lab tested samples and found signs of low-level HIV and hepatitis C
contamination.
</P>
<P>
	   Those initial tests often give false results, and might even mistake the
``adenovirus'' used to administer gene therapy for other infectious viruses,
said FDA officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, this testing is so tenuous that when blood donations undergo it,
donors are never told they might have HIV until better tests confirm it.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA began strict confirmatory testing Thursday. It hopes to know within
two weeks whether the children's therapy was contaminated.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Risks Lawsuit From Party  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- A German lawmaker said Friday that the Christian Democrats
could be fined at least $28 million for campaign funding irregularities -- a
threat that has the party weighing whether to sue former Chancellor Helmut Kohl
for damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Dieter Wiefelspuetz, a legislator for the governing Social Democrats, said
the estimated fine is required under German law as punishment for illegal
contributions the Christian Democrats say they have discovered in a review of
their books for the past 11 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Parliament president Wolfgang Thierse was expected to announce the fine
Tuesday in reaction to the Christian Democrats' campaign funding scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiefelspuetz, in an interview published Friday in the Frankfurter Rundschau
newspaper, said the fine could be spread over several years. Thierse ``will be
very careful not to strangle any party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, one prominent Christian Democrat said the party may sue the man at
the center of the scandal -- Kohl, its former chairman -- for damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian Wulff, Lower Saxony governor and party vice chairman, said late
Thursday that Christian Democrat leaders agree that any lawsuit against Kohl
would have to be endorsed by a party convention in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl, who led Germany for 16 years, touched off the scandal in December by
disclosing that he solicited up to $1 million in anonymous donations in the
1990s and illegally kept them off his party's books.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, revelations of secret accounts and large cash transfers have
grown.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hesse state, which includes Frankfurt, a Christian Democratic governor
caught up in the scandal said Friday that he would ride out the furor despite
new calls for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   State premier Roland Koch braced for a special meeting Saturday of the
allied Free Democratic Party, whose state legislators were under pressure from
national leaders and local party activists to withdraw support for Koch and
possibly force new elections.
</P>
<P>
	   But Koch insisted the year-old conservative coalition has a firm legislative
majority and is ``determined to pursue the mandate voters gave it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``And as long as that's the case, we will have me as premier,'' he told
German public radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch's reputation has been tainted since he admitted Tuesday that he
declared $750,000 in campaign funds as a loan even though he knew it had come
from a state party slush fund.
</P>
<P>
	   National leaders accused the state branch Friday of damaging the party's
credibility and insisted that their Hesse lawmakers force a vote to oust Koch.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to start over,'' Free Democrat chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt said on
ARD television. ``So I hope that our Hesse friends do the wise thing and review
their stand.''

<HEADLINE> Millstone 2 nuclear plant shut down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WATERFORD, Conn. (AP) - The Millstone Two nuclear power plant was shut
down Friday after two control rods slipped out of position and fell into the
core of the nuclear reactor.
<P>
	   No one was injured, and the incident at about 1:45 p.m. caused no release of
radiation to the public, plant spokeswoman Sandra Bazinet said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was monitoring the plant. An agency
spokesman said a similar problem involving one of the same rods shut the plant
down in September.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not a common occurrence, but it does happen," said NRC spokesman Neil
Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
	   The control rods are part of a bundle of 73 rods that are suspended over the
core. The rods are used to control and stop a nuclear reaction.
</P>
<P>
	   Usually, the whole bundle of rods is released into the core together.
</P>
<P>
	   While workers were performing routine tests of the rods, where the rods are
moved slightly in and out, one rod slipped out of position and fell into the
core, Bazinet said.
</P>
<P>
	   Workers immediately reduced the plant's power output and were investigating
what caused the rod to slip when another rod fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, the workers immediately shut the plant down manually, Bazinet said,
and all the rods were moved into the core.
</P>
<P>
	   "At that point, two rods are going to have an effect on how power is
generated. The safest thing is to shut down the plant and see what's happening,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the shutdown, the plant maintained normal temperature and pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   The plant will remain shut down until the cause of the incident is
determined. The incident had nothing to do with the cause for the shutdown of
the plant in late January, Bazinet said.
</P>
<P>
	   In that incident, the plant was idled after the system that supplies water
to generate electricity in the plant malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, one rod fell into the core of Millstone 2. The plant was shut
down and the problem was fixed, Bazinet said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheehan said the September incident was caused by an electrical ground in
the wire that holds the rod in place when it is not in the core. The ground was
corrected and no other grounds were found, but one of the rods that fell Friday
was the same rod that fell in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheehan said the plant needed to be shut down because having two rods in the
core could cause an imbalanced reaction.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything seems to have worked as it was supposed to once they began to
shut it down," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise, Inflation Fears Subside  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Friday after a government report said
consumers have moderated their hot shopping pace of recent months, suggesting
inflationary pressures may be easing.
</P>
<P>
	   A big sell off in stocks also contributed to strong demand for bonds, a
traditional haven for money pulled out of stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond rose  3/4 point, or $7.50 per $1,000 in face
value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, fell to 6.26
percent from 6.34 percent at Thursday's quarterly auction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department reported early Friday that retail sales rose by just
0.3 percent in January, below analysts' expectations and down from considerably
higher levels the prior two months that coincided with the holiday shopping
season.
</P>
<P>
	   The drop could be from higher interest rates that the Federal Reserve
imposed in recent months. But some economists cautioned it could also be due to
harsh weather that kept some people home and out of the mall in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Also encouraging traders to buy bonds was a broad decline on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 218.42 Friday to 10,425.21 and now is down
11 percent from its January record.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities rose 1/16 to 3/16 point Friday,
while intermediate maturities rose  1/4 point to 9/16 point, according to the
Bridge Telerate news service.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Tuesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.63
percent, with the discount falling 0.02 percentage point from Thursday to 5.47
percent. Six-month yields were 5.95 percent as the discount remained unchanged
at 5.70 percent. One-year yields finished at 6.15 percent, with the discount
falling 0.02 percentage point to 5.80 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, fell
to 5.68 3/4 percent from Thursday's 5.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds rose 3/32 point to 92. The yield was
6.25 percent, down from 6.26 percent Thursday.

<HEADLINE> WTO Panel Rules Against Canada  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    GENEVA (AP) -- Canadian import rules which give preferential treatment to
U.S. vehicles are illegal, according to a World Trade Organization panel report
circulated Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-member panel said the Canadian government should change its laws
to bring them into conformity with international standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada said it would appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   An interim version of the 419-page report was widely leaked when it was
distributed to parties involved in the dispute -- Canada, Japan and the European
Union -- before Christmas. The final version was circulated to all WTO members
on Friday and will be considered by the body's Dispute Settlement Body.
</P>
<P>
	   Under its 1965 auto pact with the United States, Canada allows vehicles from
big U.S. manufacturers like Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler to enter
the country free of charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan and the European Union complained to the WTO that the imposition of a
6.1 percent tariff on imports from other countries violated fair trade rules and
put them at an unfair disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel upheld the complaints. It also found that the Canadian requirement
that U.S. auto makers build at least as many cars in Canada as they sell worked
in practice as an illegal export subsidy which should be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadian government said the finding was flawed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe there are compelling legal grounds to appeal aspects of the
(WTO) panel report," Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   "An appeal is important in order to seek to clarify the reasoning and the
scope of the panel's findings."
</P>
<P>
	   At least one automaker supported the decision. Yoshio Nakatani, chief
executive of Toyota Canada Inc. described the decision as good for Canada
because it makes clear the country must abide by its global trade obligations.
</P>
<P>
	   "The WTO has sent a clear message that Canada needs to treat all automakers
equally," said Nakatani.
</P>
<P>
	   In Brussels the European Commission said it "welcomes the fact that as a
result of the finding in the report, all discriminatory aspects of the scheme
... have been condemned."

<HEADLINE> Clinton calls for tax cuts for families with kids in college or  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BROOKVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - Targeting her politics to aid the "sandwich
generation," Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday told college students and parents
she wants to cut taxes for families putting children through school and caring
for elderly loved ones.
<P>
	   "Higher education is not a luxury," she told about 200 students, parents,
and university employees at the C.W. Post campus of Long Island University in
Brookville. Families "are staying up late at night and trying to figure out how
to get that money that's needed and how to pay it back, and it's a huge burden
on so many families."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton supports a tuition tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for
families, which she said would amount to a $2,800 yearly savings for some. And
to help with the care of older family members, she also proposed a $3,000 tax
credit to help pay for long-term care of ailing relatives. She said the latter
proposal would help 158,000 New York families.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that 80 percent of New York students go on to some form of higher
education, Clinton said it's more crucial than ever to make sure each child with
the talent and drive to attend college can do so.
</P>
<P>
	   And the rising cost "is one issue that comes up from one end of the state to
the next," she said. Because the cost of college tuition has doubled in the last
20 years, parents start worrying about paying for it at the beginning of a
child's life.
</P>
<P>
	   "As I said on Sunday, when I announced my campaign, I may be new to the
neighborhood, but I'm not new to your concerns. And as a parent of a child who
is currently in college, I am certainly not new to the concerns of paying for
college," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamilia Dalla, who was on a panel with Clinton, said she returned to college
later in life along with her children thanks in part to federal aid.
</P>
<P>
	   "I used to tell my husband I wished that the tuition could be tax
deductible," she said. "I never thought something would come out of what I'm
saying."
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton was careful to note that the entire burden of the cost of paying
for college should not be on the government, and that scholarships, loans and
work-study programs should continue to play an important part.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has to be a whole package," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Friday, Clinton attended a rally in her honor of about 600 people at
Adelphi University, in Garden City. She took questions from students in the
audience there and again touched on her proposal for making college tuition tax
deductible. She also promised her support for afternoon and weekend programs to
keep teen-agers off the street.

<HEADLINE> Russia Pushes South in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
   By YURI BAGROV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DUBA-YURT, Russia (AP) -- Waves of Russian warplanes and helicopter gunships
roared over the gorges of southern Chechnya on Friday, attacking thousands of
rebels based in the snowy mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said his fighters are launching a
guerrilla war throughout the republic, including areas that Russian forces have
occupied for months, Russia's NTV television reported Friday. Rebels this week
already ambushed two military trains.
</P>
<P>
	   First deputy chief of the Russian General Staff Col. Gen. Valery Manilov
dismissed Maskhadov's announcement as a ``bluff,'' telling reporters that rebels
lack the resources to wage a guerrilla war. But he said the Russian military
must be ``vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Three cars carrying members of the Kremlin's provisional Chechnya
administration were ambushed Friday near Kurchaloi, 20 miles southeast of
Grozny, but there were no casualties, the Interfax news agency reported, citing
Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops are trying to root out the rebels who remain in Grozny, the
Chechen capital, after thousands of fighters fled the city last week. The
international watchdog Human Rights Watch charges the ``mop-up'' campaign has
included the summary execution of civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   The group said it had confirmed that at least 38 civilians have been
executed after Russian troops took control of Grozny. The Parliamentary Assembly
of the Council of Europe -- the continent's main human rights organization --
issued a statement Friday urging the Russian government to investigate the
reports and prevent future violence against civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   A refugee from Grozny, Moltkhan Khashiyeva, said her brother Khamid was
executed by the Russians, and that his body was found on a street among scores
of other civilian corpses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were so many bodies, and among them there wasn't one rebel fighter.
Not one terrorist. Just innocent civilians who lived there and were waiting for
the return of normal life,'' Khashiyeva said in the Russian republic of
Ingushetia, next to Chechnya, where her brother was buried Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Manilov denied the Human Rights Watch report, saying the group had used
rebel ``disinformation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, a spokesman at a Russian military base in Mozdok, near Chechnya,
indicated that Russian troops were treating all Chechens as potential enemies,
and said that several Russian military units have been attacked by guerrillas
posing as civilians, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By day they behave more or less well, and at night they take up arms,''
the military spokesman, Yevgeny Zherebtsov, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian trucks and armored personnel carriers rumbled up muddy roads into
the southern foothills Friday, as Russia was moving forces closer to the
mountains where an estimated 7,000 rebels are believed to have sought shelter in
the foggy and forbidding slopes.
</P>
<P>
	   Manilov claimed that the Russians have sealed off the Argun and Vedeno
gorges, where rebels have many of their bases and supply routes. Interior
Ministry troops were strengthening their hold on strategic heights near
Duba-Yurt, which overlooks the Argun gorge and aircraft bombarded the village of
Yaryshmardy, five miles south of Duba-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Indicating the difficulty Russia faces in prying the rebels from their
mountain bases, the military has been using increasingly heavy bombs -- most
recently 1 1/2 ton bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   There is ``no alternative, as it is very hard to get at rebels in the
mountain caves and hideouts,'' air force chief Col. Gen. Anatoly Kornukov said
Friday, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, head of the Russian general staff, claimed late
Friday that federal forces controlled all significant communities in the
mountains except for Shatoi, a town of 12,000, the news agency Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent troops into Chechnya in September after Chechen-based Islamic
militants twice invaded the neighboring region of Dagestan. Authorities also
claim Chechen rebels are tied to apartment bombings that killed about 300 people
in Russia in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Manilov said Friday that 1,175 Russian servicemen were killed and 3,544
injured since the start of the operation in Chechnya. But many observers have
said the toll appears to be far higher.

<HEADLINE> Moser: People Too Focused on Haider  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Austria's ambassador said Friday the Europeans are giving
a right-wing Austrian politician Joerg Haider more attention than he deserves
and should focus instead on the elected leadership in Vienna, which formulates
national policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Haider is not Austria, and Austria is not Haider,'' Ambassador Peter Moser
told a news conference. He noted that the Freedom Party leader is not himself a
part of the government.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Moser admitted that Haider's outspokenness can make life
difficult for Austrian envoys.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes we diplomats have to walk behind him and pick up the pieces,''
he said. ``We have a lot of work to do behind him.'' Haider has been under fire
throughout Europe for praising some aspects of Nazi Germany's rule.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union severed political contacts with Austria last week after
the Freedom Party assumed six Cabinet seats in a new government.
</P>
<P>
	   Moser's embassy also has been hit by the fallout. He said Hungarian-born
Austrian pianist Andras Schiff canceled a benefit performance at the embassy
because, as a Jew, ``he is really concerned and distressed by this present
situation.'' Moser said he agreed to the cancellation, but ``that really hurt us
deeply.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has said it will limit contacts with Austria and
will monitor developments carefully. U.S. Ambassador Kathryn Hall, summoned back
to Washington earlier this week, is to return to Vienna this weekend. But she
will be back in Washington in two weeks to update Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on developments.
</P>
<P>
	   After hearing about the Austrian government's plan earlier this week,
Albright said Wednesday she was encouraged. But Thursday, U.S. Ambassador David
Johnson told a meeting of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe
that the United States is uneasy about Haider's statements ``expressing sympathy
for the Nazis and minimizing, even excusing, the tragedy of the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moser criticized the EU's decision to cut political ties with Austria as
``unjust and unfair'' and asked whether it constitutes a ``new European rule to
prescribe party programs'' to member nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Moser said it was outrageous to call Haider a neo-Nazi.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Neo-Nazism is a crime,'' he said. The outcome of the election that brought
the Freedom Party to power doesn't mean its supporters are closer to ``neo-Nazi
thought.''
</P>
<P>
	   Voters in Carinthia province, who elected Haider governor last year, were
attracted by his nationalistic appeals because of a deeply rooted fear of
foreign encroachment, Moser said. Haider is continuing to serve as Carinthia's
governor.

as a family physician in the Washington area for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The location of the wedding has not been disclosed because the couple wants
a private, family celebration.

<HEADLINE> Russia OKs Deal With Western Banks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Russia reached a long-delayed deal with Western
banks Friday to ease the crushing burden of nearly $32 billion in Soviet-era
debt.
</P>
<P>
	   About a third of the debt -- $10.6 billion of principal that Russia owes the
banks -- will be written off under the agreement with the so-called London Club
of private creditors, said Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov after the latest
two-day round of talks in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, most debt repayment has been extended over 30 years, both sides
said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the deal, Russia will offer to exchange part of the loans for new
30-year Russian Federation Eurobonds.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has been a pariah among investors since it defaulted on Treasury debt
worth some $40 billion in August 1998, setting off a subsequent spiral of
default on around $103 billion of outstanding Soviet obligations.
</P>
<P>
	   But government officials have hinted that they might try to tap Western
credit markets again as early as 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's debt restructuring agreement could help pave the way, but much will
depend on Russia's talks with the Paris Club of official creditors on
restructuring $40 billion of Soviet-era debt. Talks are likely to take place
later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   It's also unclear whether the International Monetary Fund will resume a $4.5
billion loan package to Russia.

<HEADLINE> Lockhart Blasts Iran in Baha'i Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration criticized Iran on Friday for
sentencing to death three Baha'i men who the White House said were condemned
because of their religious faith.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton was deeply troubled by the sentences given Sirus
Zabihi-Moghaddam, Hedayet Kashefi-Najafabadi and Manuchehr Khulusi, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In all three cases, it is clear that the individuals were arrested,
charged and sentenced to death solely because of their religious beliefs,''
Lockhart said. ``Executing people for the practice of their religious faith is
contrary to the most fundamental human rights principles.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Baha'is draw their religious principles from the Muslim, Christian and
Jewish faiths. They are considered heretics by many Muslims, including Iran's
fundamentalist Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran is among seven countries identified by the State Department last year
as engaging in ``particularly severe'' violations of religious freedoms. It has
implemented policies to eradicate the faith through imprisoning Baha'i
adherents, confiscating and desecrating their holy places and denying them the
right to assemble.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said the United States will monitor Iran's treatment of its Baha'i
minority for signs of persecution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``President Clinton continues to hold the Iranian government responsible for
the safety of the Baha'i community of Iran and strongly urges that these
executions not be carried out,'' Lockhart said. ``We condemn Iranian government
persecution of all minority faiths.''

<HEADLINE> Canadian Newsprint Makers To Merge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MONTREAL (AP) -- Two major Canadian newsprint makers, Abitibi-Consolidated
Inc. and Donohue Inc., are merging in a $4 billion cash-and-stock deal to create
a massive player that would control 35 percent of the market in North America.
</P>
<P>
	   When Abitibi-Consolidated, the largest newsprint maker on the continent,
completes its takeover of No. 3 Donohue the combined business will have double
the capacity of the No. 2 manufacturer, Bowater Inc. of Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Publishing analysts said the latest industry consolidation could strengthen
the hand of producers in their efforts to raise prices for newsprint, which is
used by newspapers. Prices have slipped recently, but analysts said price
increases did not seem imminent.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had consolidation before, and that alone doesn't drive prices," said
Michael Beebe, a publishing analyst with Goldman Sachs. Newsprint producers
"will have increased power to influence the marketplace, but I don't think it
permanently shifts newsprint pricing power from the hands of the publishers to
the hands of the producers."
</P>
<P>
	   Donohue is one of the most efficient forest companies in North America.
Abitibi lost money last year due to lower newsprint prices and a restructuring
that included eliminating 10 percent of its jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Michel Desbiens, president and chief executive of Donohue, will become
chairman of the merged company, according to the merger agreement announced
Friday. Abitibi president John Weaver will be CEO and president.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies have identified about $173 million in savings they can realize
over two years. Weaver said no closings or sales of Donohue assets were
anticipated, but there was no immediate word on how jobs would be affected.
</P>
<P>
	   Formed in 1997 with the merger of Abitibi-Price and Stone-Consolidated,
Abitibi-Consolidated operates 18 mills in North America and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
	   Abitibi-Price generated more than $3 billion in revenue for the first nine
months of 1999 but hasn't reported full-year results yet. Donohue said its 1999
revenues were about $1.73 billion.

<HEADLINE> Bankruptcy Spurs Cone Shortage Fears  </HEADLINE>
    By ROBERT IMRIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- The bankruptcy of a Wisconsin company that made 1.3
billion ice cream cones last year -- more than half of those produced in the
United States -- is raising fears of a possible cone shortage at ice cream shops
this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Ace Baking Co., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December and halted
production. Jim Lepore, chief financial officer for Ace Baking, said he believe
his company's assets will be sold in a bankruptcy auction later this month and
that production would resume, avoiding a summer cone crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   But one competitor said a shortage will likely occur even if that happens.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew that Ace was struggling, but we never expected this," said Joe
George, president and chief executive officer of the Joy Cone Co. in Hermitage,
Pa. "You can count on there being a cone shortage this summer."
</P>
<P>
	   Cheryl Boden, owner of Baskin-Robbins in Wauwatosa, a suburb of Milwaukee,
said she already has run out of waffle cones and was making her own, but she had
plenty of sugar cones and regular cones.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not running around totally panicked yet. We are still serving
cones," she said. "I think everybody is worried."
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers may pay more for ice cream cones because Ace Baking's problems
could drive up costs for the cones, said Peter Blain, the company's bankruptcy
attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Ace's Eat-It-All brand cones, made at plants in Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas,
are used by such by national chains as Baskin-Robbins, Dairy Queen and
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
	   Blain said more than 20 companies are interested in a Feb. 29 bankruptcy
auction of Ace Baking's assets and he was confident of a sale. "It is my
expectation there will be sufficient cone production to meet summer demand," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ace Baking, based in Green Bay, has more than $5 million worth of cones on
inventory in various warehouses, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Ruland, a spokeswoman for the International Ice Cream Association,
said she expected other suppliers would meet the demand for cones.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumption of ice cream in the winter months is 40 percent less than during
the hot days of summer, giving cone suppliers "a little bit of time to crank
into action," she said. "We have had a pretty good history of suppliers to the
industry responding to the demand."
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Ochs, purchasing and systems manager for International Dairy Queen
headquartered in Minneapolis, said, "We really are fine for cones. Our system
needs are covered for the year 2000 and beyond."
</P>
<P>
	   Ace Baking's bankruptcy, in which it listed liabilities of about $40
million, is rooted in its 1997 merger with another cone producer, the Sweetheart
Cup Co., Lepore said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
   By ZEINA KARAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah guerrillas killed a seventh Israeli
soldier Friday and seriously wounded another. Israel retaliated with a 13th day
of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss appealed for American and French to help
halt the Israeli campaign. He called on the international community ``to
shoulder their responsibilities (in deterring Israel) in the name of right and
justice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Clinton administration urged Syria, the powerbroker in
Lebanon, to help deter violence by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel responded to Hezbollah's fatal rocket and mortar attack on an Israeli
army base with repeated airstrikes Friday, firing missiles from helicopter
gunships and fighter jets at guerrilla hideouts and routes. At least 12 missiles
were fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli jets returned later in the evening and fired two more missiles at
suspected guerrilla hideouts in Jabal al-Daher on the edge of an
Israeli-occupied border zone in south Lebanon, Lebanese security officials in
the region said. The area was earlier targeted with four missiles. No casualties
were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed the airstrikes and the Israeli
casualties. An announcement said Sgt. Zachi Yitah, 19, was killed and another
soldier was seriously wounded when a missile hit a combat trench.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he would retaliate further in his own
time with ``very harsh strikes in Lebanon,'' but reaffirmed a pledge to withdraw
troops by July.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the leader of Hezbollah vowed more attacks with the aim of driving
Israeli forces out of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bombing of infrastructure in Lebanon will not protect the (Israeli)
occupation troops. Rather, it will expose them to more painful strikes,''
Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah told a delegation from Egypt's Al-Ahram
newspaper led by its editor, Ibrahim Nafie, Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(Hezbollah) attacks will continue with the same momentum and strength
until the (Israeli) enemy is defeated and forced to withdraw unconditionally
from Lebanon,'' Nasrallah added, according to a Hezbollah statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah said in a statement that Friday's
operation proved ``the enemy's complete impotence in the face of the prowess of
resistance fighters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, the U.S. government leaned on Syria to stop the attacks. In
past border conflicts, the administration has called for restraint on all sides.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton is not taking a neutral stance, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said. ``We expect Syria to be more effective in their influence and we
expect restraint.''
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also said Syria should do more to curb
Hezbollah's attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli soldiers have patrolled a strip inside southern Lebanon since 1985
in an effort to curb cross-border guerrilla raids on its communities. Hezbollah
is the main guerrilla group trying to oust Israeli troops from Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Israeli military officials said that Israel would no longer
abide by a code of engagement which restricted firing toward civilian areas and
said they would strike back hard against any attacks on their soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Hershey Distribution Problems Linger  </HEADLINE>
    By HOPE YEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Hershey chocolates appear to be in plentiful supply
for Valentine's Day despite some lingering distribution problems that hurt
Halloween and Christmas sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The holiday is the fourth-busiest time of year for the nation's largest
candymaker -- after the back-to-school season, Halloween and Christmas -- and
Hershey seems to be rebounding after numerous delivery delays last summer,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've gotten a lot of shipments out already and have done so without many
of the problems they faced back during Halloween and Christmas," said Andrew
Lazar, an analyst with New York-based Lehman Brothers. "They're certainly making
progress."
</P>
<P>
	   Hershey said last week it had made steady improvements since problems with a
new $112 million automation system hampered deliveries and inflated operating
costs last year. The delays forced the company to lower projected earnings for
the last two quarters as major retailers such as Wal-Mart reported continuing
problems with receiving Hershey orders.
</P>
<P>
	   Hershey last week acknowledged it had "not yet fully returned to historical
customer service levels," although it expected to recover as a new 1.2 million
square-foot distribution center opened this spring. Company spokesman John Long
declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart spokeswoman Jessica Moser, who reported delivery troubles for her
2,450-store chain through Christmas, also declined to comment on whether
Wal-Mart was seeing lingering problems for Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had a long-standing relationship with Hershey, and we don't have any
plans for that to change," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Terry Bivens, a Bear Stearns analyst, said the test for Hershey is whether
it can fill orders efficiently during busy chocolate-selling seasons such as
Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think they've largely turned a corner," Bivens said. "But in February,
it's still a little too early to get a handle on how they're doing ... If they
have a bad season, it would hurt their earnings."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Steel Industry  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton granted relief to the U.S. steel
industry on Friday in two major cases where steelmakers had sought government
action against a flood of foreign steel.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House announced that Clinton had decided to grant import relief
for U.S. steel wire rod manufacturers and makers of U.S. line pipe.
</P>
<P>
	   Decisions in the two cases had been delayed for months as a debate waged
inside the administration over whether to grant the industry petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters argued that in an election year the administration had to act to
protect the domestic industry and its workers while opponents charged the
actions would send the signal that America was erecting protectionist trade
barriers.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the latest announcements, Japan has given notice that it will
bring cases against the United States before the World Trade Organization
arguing that U.S. actions so far to impose penalty tariffs on imports of various
types of steel from Japan and other countries violated WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 4,000 U.S. workers employed making steel rod and 1,000 American
workers making steel line pipe.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea, one of Asian countries hardest hit by the currency crisis, is
the largest foreign supplier of steel line pipe to the United States, accounting
for half of overall imports of line pipe.
</P>
<P>
	   Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, Ukraine and Germany are among the biggest
suppliers of wire rod that will be subjected to the penalty tariffs.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration argued that Clinton had no choice but to act under U.S.
trade laws to protect the domestic industry. Last September, 101 senators and
representatives had written Clinton urging favorable decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The action that the president has announced represents a clear statement
of the administration's commitment both to the vigorous enforcement of U.S.
trade laws and to the application of international trade rules,'' presidential
spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   In the announcement, the White House said that Clinton had imposed higher
tariffs on steel wire rod exceeding specific levels for a period of three years.
</P>
<P>
	   The tariff will be an additional 10 percent on imports of steel rod that
exceed 1.58 million tons in the first year with the level of imports allowed to
increase by 2 percent a year in the second and third years while the tariff
penalty will drop by 2.5 percentage points a year.
</P>
<P>
	   For line pipe, the president imposed an additional 19 percent tariff
although the first 9,000 tons of steel from each supplier country will be exempt
from the higher tariff each year. The penalty tariff will drop to 15 percent in
the second year and 11 percent in the third year.
</P>
<P>
	   While the surge of various steel shipments has subsided somewhat, the
administration remains under heavy pressure to do more to reverse a widening
U.S. trade deficit, which remains the major flaw in an otherwise stellar U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton acted following rulings by the U.S. International Trade Commissions
which found that increased imports of both wire rod and line pipe threatened
serious injury to the two U.S. industries.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the House had voted by a lopsided margin of 289-141 to sharply
limit steel imports to levels that existed before 1998, when the Asian financial
crisis triggered a flood of cheap steel imports into the United States. The
measure did not win passage in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> EU Gives Austrian Cold Shoulder  </HEADLINE>
   By CRISTIANA PEREIRA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- An Austrian minister felt the chill of her
country's political isolation Friday when she was snubbed by her European Union
colleagues in the first meeting since 14 EU member states reduced diplomatic
ties with Vienna.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU ministers turned a cold shoulder to Social Minister Elisabeth Sickl
to drive home their displeasure at Joerg Haider's anti-immigration Freedom
Party, which gained seats a week ago in Austria's coalition government despite
Haider's previously expressed sympathy with aspects of Nazism.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials canceled a welcome ceremony and the traditional photograph, as
well as cultural events on the fringes of the labor and social affairs meeting.
Sickl appeared disoriented when she entered the building and had to find her own
way to the meeting room.
</P>
<P>
	   She acknowledged the atmosphere was ``a bit cool'' and said Portuguese Labor
Minister Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues was the only minister who spoke to her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a lot of prejudice going on,'' Sickl told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Some ministers delivered pointed and lengthy criticism of racist policies
until Ferro Rodrigues intervened to remind participants to limit remarks to the
agenda, a Portuguese official said, on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The French and Belgian ministers walked out when Sickl rose to speak.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a symbolic and political gesture,'' French Labor Minister Martine
Aubry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Belgian Minister Laurette Onkelinx said her country wanted EU treaties
altered to permit the expulsion of countries that had far-right parties in
government.
</P>
<P>
	   German Minister Walter Riester took a more moderate line. ``She said nothing
I could criticize,'' he said of Sickl's speech, which focused on the need to
uphold democratic values.
</P>
<P>
	   British Minister Alistair Darling did not take his place at the official
lunch next to Sickl and ate in an area separate from the other delegates. None
of the other delegates spoke to her.
</P>
<P>
	   Sickl appeared unruffled and insisted she would continue to attend EU
meetings. ``I knew it was important to come. The only possibility of resolving
conflicts is through dialogue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Austria, the country's foreign minister, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, insisted
she could see cracks in the wall of opposition despite the chilly reception in
Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that two countries (France and Belgium) stand at the very
front,'' she said in an interview for publication Saturday in the newspaper Neue
Volksblatt. ``The others are going along with them out of solidarity but many of
them are not happy about that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Austria's 14 EU partners froze individual diplomatic relations with Austria
after the Freedom Party joined Austria's government. The sanctions also include
refusing to back Austrian officials running for posts in international
organizations and downgrading contacts with Austrian ambassadors in EU capitals.
However, Austria can take part in multilateral EU meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   Several thousand Austrians rallied against their government in major cities
Friday, urging the world not to condemn the whole country because Haider party
shares power.

<HEADLINE> Chairman Blocks Dominican Rep Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the House International Relations
Committee blocked more than $8 million in aid Friday to pressure the Dominican
Republic into extraditing a man to face a murder charge in the chairman's
district.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Rep. Benjamin Gilman invoked a rarely used authority to interdict
foreign aid in order to get back the suspect in a decade-old murder case in
Gilman's New York district.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a tradition that allows heads of any one of four congressional
committees to put a hold on administration changes in foreign aid distribution,
Gilman informed Secretary of State Madeleine Albright he was stopping nearly all
assistance to the Caribbean country until it extradites Carlos Daniel Grullone
for a New York trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilman's office announced the decision late Friday. There was no immediate
reaction from the State Department or from the Dominican Republic's government.
</P>
<P>
	   Grullone, 36, is wanted in the Oct. 16, 1991, death of his wife, Yolina
Arcenia Camacho, at a hotel where she worked in Tarrytown, N.Y. Police say he
shot her several times in front of five witnesses. He fled to the Dominican
Republic, his home country, and was jailed there for six months before being
released because of an error over the amount of his bail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We in Washington must honor the need of Yolina's children to see justice
done in this case,'' Gilman said. Her two children, Dahiana, now 14, and
Richard, 10, are staying with her mother in Tarrytown.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright had informed Gilman's committee last week of plans to redirect
previously planned spending and give $3 million for the Dominican Republic to
strengthen human rights, $2 million for democratic initiatives, $1.65 million to
increase productivity of poor people, $1.3 million for strengthening civil
society and $1.6 million for AIDS prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Albright, Gilman said he was invoking his authority as
International Relations Committee chairman to put a hold on all but the AIDS
money. Under informal agreements, each of the chairmen of House and Senate
foreign affairs committees and foreign operations appropriations subcommittees
has the power to reject changes in foreign spending plans of the administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government of the Dominican Republic's apparent callous disregard for
the anguish of these children is contemptible,'' Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarrytown Detective Sgt. Gene Buonanno, who has been pursuing Grullone's
extradition for nearly a decade, said the children want to visit relatives in
their homeland but cannot because their father is free there.
</P>
<P>
	   In a telephone interview Friday, Buonanno said he investigated the murder
and has pursued Grullone ever since. The man, he said, fled the scene after
shooting his wife during an argument in front of witnesses and was arrested two
months later in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
	   Reacting to Gilman's action, the detective said, ``This is what we've been
looking for. We need help. This man committed murder here eight years ago, and
we haven't been able to get him back.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said prosecutors have tried to have Grullone extradited, and his children
have written to Dominican President Leonel Fernandez asking for their father's
extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominican authorities have cited technicalities in refusing to send Grullone
back to New York for trial, Buonanno said.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Asylum Claims May Drag On  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Britain has staked out a tough line against Afghans seeking
asylum after a hijacking, but it could be months before a final decision.
Afghanistan warned Friday that the hijackers could face death if they returned.
</P>
<P>
	   After a standoff ended early Thursday at London's Stansted airport, 74 of
the freed hostages -- almost half -- requested asylum. Police have arrested 22
people who will likely face trial in Britain. The rest are still considering
their options.
</P>
<P>
	   Some British tabloids on Friday were incensed over speculation that some of
the Afghans might have used the hijacking to win asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No Entry'' proclaimed The Express of London, objecting to the prospective
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sun branded their temporary shelter near Stansted airport as ``the Kabul
Hilton.'' The tabloid wrote: ``I watched in astonishment yesterday as a swish
Hilton Hotel was turned into a four-star refugee camp for a bedraggled bunch of
Afghan asylum seekers.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Welcome to your Home Cheat Home,'' said a Daily Star headline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hi, Jack! Where's the four-star hotel?'' said The Mirror.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jack'' refers to Home Secretary Jack Straw, who promised to review
personally every asylum application and send the hostages home or to another
country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if their applications were rejected, they would have 12 days to file an
appeal and an indeterminate amount of time for a hearing, the Home Office
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the complex nature of human rights claims and the large number of
applicants, the process would likely continue for several months or even a year,
said Amnesty International spokesman Neil Durkin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although there's an understandable need to bring the hijackers to justice,
the home secretary must not risk sending innocent men, women and children back
to a terrible fate,'' said Durkin.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Gen. Rahmatullah Safi, European representative for the Taliban,
told BBC radio that in Afghanistan ``punishment will be according to the law of
Shariah, which is death.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil later said the death
penalty was not automatic for hijackers, and he encouraged the hostages to
return home. He has asked British authorities to deal with the hijackers in
``accordance with British law and international norms.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was not known if any of the hijackers have requested asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   A plane chartered by the Geneva-based International Organization for
Migration arrived in England on Friday to ferry passengers back to Afghanistan,
but the aircraft may not take off until next week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At the moment it looks like there are about 20 or so who have said they
want to fly home,'' said Diane Grammer, spokeswoman for the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees, Britain can refuse
asylum to people who have committed grave crimes. But under the European
Convention on Human rights, they may not be deported if there is a risk of them
being tortured or ill-treated in their home state.
</P>
<P>
	   All of those on board -- both hijackers and hostages -- were at risk should
they return to Afghanistan, said Nick Hardwick, chief executive of the Refugee
Council.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is absolutely no doubt their lives would be in danger,'' said
Hardwick. ``It is not just what the government would do but what the government
would incite others to do to them. ... The women risk their lives. The children
risk persecution and an unpleasant future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Britain has a sympathetic track record in dealing with Afghan claimants.
</P>
<P>
	   But Straw told the House of Commons that the fact that the passengers were
on an internal flight made it difficult to believe they intended to claim asylum
unless they were complicit in the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers had taken over the Ariana Boeing 727 jet early Sunday during
what should have been a short domestic flight from the Afghan capital of Kabul
to the northern town of Mazar-e-Sharif.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Parts May Be Buried in Ky.  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal nuclear regulators are investigating the possible
burial of as much as 1,600 tons of nuclear weapons hardware on a 3,000-acre
Energy Department site in Kentucky, and whether the material poses a health risk
to workers there.
</P>
<P>
	   The Energy Department would confirm only that ``an underground classified
storage site'' at the facility near Paducah, Ky., was being investigated by the
department, Pentagon and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   But a memorandum by a senior health and safety specialist at the Paducah
Gaseous Diffusion Plant, located on the site, asks the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission to investigate whether the material poses new health risks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am ... deeply concerned for the safety of personnel working (at the
plant),'' wrote Raymond C. Carroll, the health and safety specialist who works
for the U.S. Enrichment Corp., which operates the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, who has worked at the plant since 1992, said in the memo that he
had learned of the nuclear weapons hardware being on site only on Jan. 13 from
his supervisor, who had learned of it only by chance recently.
</P>
<P>
	   The weapons material is believed to be within a 750-acre fenced-in part of
the site, but outside a smaller area that is leased by USEC and contains the
uranium processing plant. Still, Carroll said in his memo he was concerned of
possible worker exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some sanity needs to be put back into the system and personnel safety
needs to have commensurate emphasis with national security,'' Carroll wrote in
the memo, a copy of which was obtained Friday by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 57, who has been in nuclear health safety work for 30 years,
declined to discuss the memo or circumstances surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not making any comments,'' he said when reached at his office at the
Paducah plant.
</P>
<P>
	   It's unclear what kind of weapon components might be buried at the site.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Paducah facility in the 1970s and 80s was charged with disassembling
so-called secondary components of a variety of bombs and warheads, said one
source familiar with the plant's activities over the years.
</P>
<P>
	   While some gold and other precious metals were set aside, leftover materials
were supposed to be buried in classified disposal areas on the 3,000-acre site,
this source said. Depending on the weapon design, the secondary triggers, which
set off the primary explosion, could contain some plutonium, highly enriched
uranium, tritium, and other radioactive material, said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC, the private company the processes uranium for use in commercial
nuclear power plants, said in a statement that ``based on information available
we are aware of nothing that adversely impacts our employees.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the Energy Department issued a report acknowledging that
workers at the plant during the Cold War years were exposed to high levels of
radiation and toxic chemicals, including plutonium mixed with some of the
uranium.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has said it wants to compensate the families of
workers who became ill and has sought $21.8 million to expand medical monitoring
and speed up cleanup of radioactive waste and pollution stemming from the
uranium processing.
</P>
<P>
	   The report made no mention of nuclear weapons components.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll said in the memo that the Energy Department was withholding this
information for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Contents of the memo were reported Friday by The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Friday, the department said: ``The Energy Department with the
DOD and Justice are looking at classified national security programs conducted
in the past at Paducah. That includes reviewing materials and quantities
involved.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to Carroll, USEC officials learned of DOE's investigation into the
presence of nuclear warhead parts only recently when a Justice Department
investigator let it slip.
</P>
<P>
	   Orville Cypret, the plant's radiation protection manger, then was told at
the Jan. 13 meeting by Dale Jackson, the DOE's acting site manager, that about
1,600 tons of ``nuclear weapons components'' had been buried at the site.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson also told Cypret that large quantities of plutonium and highly
enriched uranium, not previously known to have been there, had been brought to
the site over the years. Jackson said some of the material was still there,
although he could not give any locations, information about specific
radioisotopes or specific quantities.

<HEADLINE> Flooding Hits Botswana, Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
   By DEREK JAMES
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) -- Rain, normally a blessing in this desert nation,
came down in torrents Friday, washing away sections of the only railroad and
flooding a prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Five straight days of downpour have killed scores of people throughout
southern Africa, claiming lives in Botswana, South Africa and Mozambique. More
than 100,000 people were left homeless in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Floods toppled shacks and forced schools to close. Thousands of motorists
were stranded by destroyed roads and bridges. Water covered thousands of acres
of sorghum, corn and other crops throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
	   The flooding was the worst in memory in Botswana, a Texas-sized country of
1.5 million people where rain is so precious that the local currency is called
the ``pula,'' which means rain.
</P>
<P>
	   Botswana's only rail line was washed away in two places. Water trickled over
the walls of the reservoir in the capital, Gaborone, where about 135,000 people
live.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 500 prisoners were evacuated from the flooded Gaborone Central
Prison, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Floodwaters swept away at least three people in the village of Kopong, 20
miles northwest of Gaborone. They were presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
	   With rainfall totaling more than 8 inches, Botswana's government considered
declaring the country a disaster area.
</P>
<P>
	   Truck traffic came to a standstill along the country's north-south highway,
the main conduit for goods coming from South Africa to Zambia and parts beyond.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the region, the rains have left tens of thousands homeless and
prompted emergency appeals for aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the 74 killed so far -- three in Botswana, 32 in Mozambique and 39
in South Africa -- were children swept away by rivers that overflowed their
banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Mozambique's government appealed for $2.7 million for rescue operations and
immediate relief.
</P>
<P>
	   UNICEF was distributing fresh water and shipping drugs and other medical
supplies to Mozambique as part of a $400,000 campaign to prevent a possible
outbreak of cholera, malaria and diarrhea. ``Our chief concern right now is the
threat of disease,'' said UNICEF's representative in Maputo, Mark Stirling.
</P>
<P>
	   South Africa sent four helicopters, which ``have already been deployed in
worst hit areas of southern and central Mozambique,'' said Mozambique's
Transport and Communications Minister Tomaz Salomao.
</P>
<P>
	   The city council of Mozambique's capital, Maputo, said it needs to resettle
homeless people from at least 25,000 plots on the city's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities are seeking inflatable dinghies for those at risk of drowning,
tents for the homeless and generators to provide electricity for shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Africa, about 100,000 have been left homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   The rain also washed out Saturday's planned cricket match between South
Africa and England. The sold-out match, which was to have been played in
Johannesburg, was postponed until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want to present our fans and millions of TV viewers with a
half-baked contest, where players are slipping and sliding all over the place,''
said South African cricket director Ali Bacher.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Steel Industry  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton granted relief to the U.S. steel
industry on Friday in two major cases where steelmakers had sought government
action against a flood of foreign steel.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House announced that Clinton had decided to grant import relief
for U.S. steel wire rod manufacturers and makers of U.S. line pipe.
</P>
<P>
	   Decisions in the two cases had been delayed for months as a debate waged
inside the administration over whether to grant the industry petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters argued that in an election year the administration had to act to
protect the domestic industry and its workers while opponents charged the
actions would send the signal that America was erecting protectionist trade
barriers.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the latest announcements, Japan has given notice that it will
bring cases against the United States before the World Trade Organization
arguing that U.S. actions so far to impose penalty tariffs on imports of various
types of steel from Japan and other countries violated WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's decision was immediately hailed by the steel industry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today's announcement by the president sends a strong message to our
foreign trading partners that import surges which lead to serious injury to the
industry and its workers will not be tolerated,'' said Roger Schagrin, an
attorney for eight U.S. steel welded pipe producers and the United Steelworkers,
who brought one of the cases.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 4,000 U.S. workers employed making steel rod and 1,000 American
workers making steel line pipe, which is used in the construction of oil and
natural gas pipelines.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea, one of Asian countries hardest hit by the currency crisis, is
the largest foreign supplier of steel line pipe to the United States, accounting
for half of overall imports of line pipe.
</P>
<P>
	   Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, Ukraine and Germany are among the biggest
suppliers of wire rod that will be subjected to the penalty tariffs.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration argued that Clinton had no choice but to act under U.S.
trade laws to protect the domestic industry. Last September, 101 senators and
representatives had written Clinton urging favorable decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The action that the president has announced represents a clear statement
of the administration's commitment both to the vigorous enforcement of U.S.
trade laws and to the application of international trade rules,'' presidential
spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   In the announcement, the White House said that Clinton had imposed higher
tariffs on steel wire rod exceeding specific levels for a period of three years.
</P>
<P>
	   The tariff will be an additional 10 percent on imports of steel rod that
exceed 1.58 million tons in the first year with the level of imports allowed to
increase by 2 percent a year in the second and third years while the tariff
penalty will drop by 2.5 percentage points a year.
</P>
<P>
	   For line pipe, the president imposed an additional 19 percent tariff
although the first 9,000 tons of steel from each supplier country will be exempt
from the higher tariff each year. The penalty tariff will drop to 15 percent in
the second year and 11 percent in the third year.
</P>
<P>
	   While the surge of various steel shipments has subsided somewhat, the
administration remains under heavy pressure to do more to reverse a widening
U.S. trade deficit, which remains the major flaw in an otherwise stellar U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton acted following rulings by the U.S. International Trade Commissions
which found that increased imports of both wire rod and line pipe threatened
serious injury to the two U.S. industries.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the House had voted by a lopsided margin of 289-141 to sharply
limit steel imports to levels that existed before 1998, when the Asian financial
crisis triggered a flood of cheap steel imports into the United States. The
measure did not win passage in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> More Jets Found With Tail Problems  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW FORDAHL AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Government-mandated inspections found at least three
jetliners Friday with the same tail wing problem that has become the focus of
the investigation into last week's crash of an Alaska Airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of six aircraft, including the plane that crashed Jan. 31, had
unusual metal shavings in their tail wing assemblies, the National
Transportation Safety Board said.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest cases were uncovered after the Federal Aviation Administration
ordered inspections of all MD-80 and similar aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB sent investigators to check the aircraft, but officials would not
name the airlines. An FAA spokesman also refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have initial, unconfirmed reports that we need to verify before we
release any information,'' said Paul Takemoto, an FAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspections affect about 1,200 planes, including MD-80s, MD-90s, Boeing
717s and DC-9s. The first part of the inspections must be completed by Monday,
but the FAA is giving airlines 30 days to perform a more detailed check.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines canceled a dozen flights Friday to repeat inspections made
before the FAA isused its order, said spokesman Jack Evans. Other airlines
reported no major schedule disruptions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're talking a dozen flights out of 500 or so we launch daily, so overall
impact is still very small,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines Flight 261's pilots discussed problems with the horizontal
stabilizer after taking off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San Francisco and
Seattle. The plane crashed off Southern California Jan. 31, killing all 88
people aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   Crash investigators are focusing on a part that moves the stabilizer, a
40-foot tail-mounted wing that controls the up-and-down pitch of the aircraft's
nose during flight.
</P>
<P>
	   A 2-foot-long, rod-like jackscrew that drives the stabilizer was recovered
and found to be entwined with metal shavings believed to have come from an
8-inch gimbal nut that was later retrieved from the Pacific and found to have
damaged threads, NTSB investigators said.
</P>
<P>
	   It remained unclear whether the damage occurred before the crash or was the
result of the plane's impact with the ocean. Metal experts were examining the
pieces.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Regrets IRA Action  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday he is disappointed by the
Irish Republican Army's refusal to disarm, which has stalled momentum toward
peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   Saying he regrets that the IRA did not give ``a more timely commitment on
arms decommissioning,'' Clinton reminded both Protestants and Catholics that
voters in Northern Ireland chose to begin the peace process through the Good
Friday accord in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton called the peace pact ``a commitment which reflects the wishes of
the vast majority of people both in Ireland and in Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
	   His statement was issued at the White House hours after Britain resumed
direct control over Northern Ireland, stripping power from the province's new
Protestant-Catholic administration. Britain said it is trying to prevent the
coalition's collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and his envoy, George Mitchell, have been heavily involved in the
peace negotiations, and Clinton had earlier held out hope that the two sides
could avoid a suspension of the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I urge all the parties to build on that progress, remain engaged and carry
through on their responsibilities to work together,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Methodists Drop Gay Wedding Case  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The United Methodist church decided Friday not to
bring charges against 68 ministers who blessed a lesbian wedding to protest
their church's ban on gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   Church investigators decided the charges were not serious enough to merit a
trial under United Methodist law. If the pastors had been convicted of breaking
church law, they could have faced punishment as severe as dismissal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No further steps or actions will be pursued,'' said Bishop Melvin Talbert
of the church's California-Northern Nevada Conference. He acknowledged, however:
``This decision will not resolve the tension within the community.''
</P>
<P>
	   The lead defendant was the Rev. Don Fado of St. Mark's United Methodist
Church in Sacramento, who performed the January 1999 wedding of church members
Ellie Charlton, 64, and Jeanne Barnett, 69.
</P>
<P>
	   Fado said he had been willing to go to trial if it would ``knock down a
barrier in someone's ministry,'' but was relieved by the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got other things to do with our money than bring our own to trial
for an act of conscience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ceremony was attended by 1,500 guests and a total of 92 Methodist
ministers. Only 68 were named in a formal complaint because the rest were
outside the jurisdiction of the California-Northern Nevada Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Fado compared the ceremony to an act of civil disobedience, which his church
has supported for civil rights and anti-war causes, and said he sought a church
trial to force the church to face the needs of gay members.
</P>
<P>
	   At a hearing before seven church investigators last week, Charlton said that
before the wedding ceremony, she and Barnett lived in two social groups, the gay
community and the church, that viewed each other with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now we share our church life with the gay community and share our gay life
with the church,'' she told the panel. ``It was very stressful being in two
different closets. Now we're not in any closet.''
</P>
<P>
	   The decision not to pursue charges Friday drew an immediate protest from the
Rev. Greg Smith of the Hope United Methodist Church in Sacramento. Smith said he
is considering the leaving the church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today's decision effectively ended the rule of discipline,'' Smith said.
``We now follow our own individual conscience as far as I can see.''
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said he would ask the Methodists' national ruling body to affirm its
ban on gay marriages and make it clear that ministers who disobey it will be
punished, or to let those who disagree with Friday's ruling leave the church
with dignity.

<P>
	   It remained unclear whether the damage occurred before the crash or was the

</P>
<P>
	   Boeing engineers said that some wear inside the nut is normal, but typical
use should leave a residue of fine dust, not the long, curly strings found in
the three Alaska jetliners.
</P>
<P>
	   During the first inspection, which must be completed by Monday, mechanics
are examining the condition of the jackscrew, lubrication and the stops that
prevent the stabilizer from moving at too steep an angle. It takes about 3 1/2
hours to finish the check, Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
	   The second phase of the order involves examining how snugly the jackscrew
fits into the nut. Airlines have 30 days to complete the inspections, which can
take six hours on each plane.
</P>
<P>
	   During voluntary inspections early this week, Alaska mechanics in Portland,
Ore., and Seattle found two MD-80s with similar shavings in the horizontal
stabilizer assemblies, prompting the FAA's nationwide mandatory inspection
order.
</P>
<P>
	   An Associated Press review of maintenance records from 1990 through 1999
found no reports of stripped gimbal nuts in the jetliners covered in the order.
</P>
<P>
	   American Airlines, which flies more MD-80s and MD-90s than any other
carrier, reported no disruptions. The airline has 284 planes affected by the
order.
</P>
<P>
	   US Airways, which had checked half its fleet of MD-80s and DC-9s, also
reported no problems. Remaining inspections were expected to be completed at
night so that they would have no effect on the airline's schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   TWA mechanics were inspecting 130 aircraft and reported no abnormalities,
spokesman Jim Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The components being inspected are of a type and design that has been used
in DC-9 and MD-80 aircraft for more than 30 years,'' he said. ``This stabilizer
control system has proven to be a reliable design and TWA has not in the past
encountered any significant or systemic problems with the design or the
system.''
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Applebaum, 52, of Los Angeles said he had no qualms shortly before he
boarded an Alaska Airlines flight to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They won't let them get off the ground if there's a problem,'' he said.
``It's safer to fly than it is to drive a car, especially in L.A.''

<HEADLINE> Boston Highway Project Drags On  </HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE MILLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- The Big Dig is becoming the Bottomless Pit.
</P>
<P>
	   Planners originally estimated that building an underground connection from
the Massachusetts Turnpike to Boston's interstates would cost a few billion
dollars. Now the cost has ballooned to at least $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-mile project, which for a while was considered the largest public
works effort in the world, started in 1993 and was supposed to be done in 2001.
But the completion date is now maybe five years down the road.
</P>
<P>
	   And to pay for the most recent overruns, state officials are now planning to
double tolls, slash funding for other road projects and take back a promise to
eliminate regular driver's license renewals in favor of lifetime licenses. And
that won't even fill half of the gap.
</P>
<P>
	   Every day, the project soaks up $3 million as 4,000 workers dig away. For
years, critics have cautioned that the state would have trouble paying for it.
Now the critics are getting a chance to say ``I told you so.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, it was revealed that the Big Dig, officially known as the Central
Artery Project, would cost $1.4 billion more than the previous estimate, partly
because of problems tunneling under the channel that separates central Boston
from its South Boston neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   And the overruns could be even higher, according to a report issued Thursday
by Kenneth Mead, the U.S. Transportation Department's inspector general. He
chastised state and federal transportation officials for ``an alarming lapse in
oversight.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jeremy Crockford, a spokesman for the Big Dig, defended the project, saying
oversight has been excellent. ``We are making certain that we have the resources
we need to complete this job right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into whether state
transportation officials misled investors by failing to disclose the cost
overruns before a $200 million bond issue in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, James J. Kerasiotes,
knew of the overruns in October but did not disclose them until last week, The
Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the state's administration and finance secretary, Andrew Natsios,
said bond rating agencies were indeed told of possible overruns in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Paul Cellucci has suggested he might go to the federal government to
seek more financial help on the Big Dig. Sen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts
Democrat, said the state is highly unlikely to get it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Big Dig was dreamed up because the Massachusetts Turnpike ends in Boston
and the old elevated highway that links it to interstates is too narrow, causing
huge traffic tie-ups and an accident rate four times the national average for
urban highways.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal of the Big Dig is a wider, underground expressway. In the meantime,
it's become an old joke in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   After Lawyer Milloy of football's New England Patriots signed with the team
Thursday for six more seasons, he quipped, ``The biggest reason I remained a
Patriot was to see if the Big Dig would ever get done.''
</P>
<P>
	   Boston College student Matthew Houtsma might have aptly summed up the city's
frustration with the project. ``I don't know,'' he said Friday, ``if it's worth
the money or the time.''

<HEADLINE> Leaders Ask For Elian's Return  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Religious leaders visiting from Illinois called Friday for
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The group also asked for an end to U.S. trade sanctions against the
communist island, which they said cause unnecessary suffering for the Cuban
people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Illinois Council of Churches and the Chicago Religious Leadership
Network on Latin America have been in Havana for the past week, attending
services at numerous Cuban churches and meeting with Cuban professionals,
academics and officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The 16-member delegation of Protestants and Catholics also met with Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He told us to tell the American people: 'I miss him. I love him. I want
him to be back by my side as soon as possible,''' said the Rev. David Allen
Anderson, head of the Illinois council.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson said that he promised Gonzalez that he would personally call
Attorney General Janet Reno after he returned to the United States on Monday to
ask that Elian be repatriated with his father as quickly as possible, but in the
meantime be removed from the home of the child's paternal great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez, who is fighting to keep him in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Miguel Gonzalez wrote Reno earlier this week asking that the child be
moved to the home of another great-uncle in Miami, Manolo Gonzalez, who favors
the boy's repatriation with this father.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father told the attorney general he was worried about how the
constant media attention and constant visits by Cuban American politicians to
Lazaro Gonalez's home were affecting his child.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued off Florida's coast on Nov. 25 after his mother and 10
others were lost at sea during a journey from Cuba to the United States. The
child was temporarily placed with Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Justice Department said this week that it is reviewing that
request, as well as whether alcohol-related driving violations or other actions
by Elian Gonzalez' relatives in Miami warrant moving the 6-year-old boy to a
different, temporary custodian.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government continued pressing for Elian's return on Friday,
holding the latest of dozens of government organized rallies held almost daily.
President Fidel Castro and Elian's Cuban family attended the gathering sponsored
by the Federation of Cuban Women.
</P>
<P>
	   At their news conference earlier in the day, the Illinois church leaders
also called for an end to the 38-year-old trade embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The sanctions were imposed in 1962 at the height of the Cold War to punish,
as well as press for a change in the Communist government of Fidel Castro, who
remains in power today.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been increasing attempts by U.S. lawmakers for a partial lifting
of the restrictions on American sales of medicine and food to the communist
island, but they have failed to gain full congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the sanctions say that lifting the embargo will only help
Castro.

<P>
   NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- A high school senior accused of hacking into his
school's computer system and posting a threat to ``make Columbine look like a
joke'' has been charged with a felony.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew DeCarlo, 17, could receive three to five years in prison if convicted
of aggravated computer tampering. He was released on $100,000 bond Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at Naperville North High School in Chicago's west suburbs were
ordered locked in their classrooms Thursday as word of the message spread. By
noon, police said, they had traced the message to DeCarlo, and students were
sent home early.
</P>
<P>
	   Principal John Lorenz said DeCarlo confessed to posting the message Tuesday
on an internal school computer system and meant it as a joke to be seen only by
the computer engineer who resets the system each night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He indicated he knew it was poor judgment, and he was sorry that he did
it,'' Lorenz said.

<HEADLINE> S.C. GOP Short 300 Polling Places  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM DAVENPORT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A week before the Feb. 19 GOP presidential primary,
the South Carolina Republican Party still is 300 polling places short of being
able to open every voting location, a shortfall that is putting the contest in
legal jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican officials have lined up more than 5,000 volunteers to help man at
least 1,445 polling places and promised on Friday to find enough people to open
the other sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Two Democrats who filed the court challenge say the GOP's plans violate the
Voting Rights Act because many precincts that might not open are in
predominantly black areas.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the Republicans must defend the party's primary against a federal
court challenge that seeks to block the voting. The U.S. Justice Department also
is involved, with the prospect it could invalidate the results after the votes
are tallied.
</P>
<P>
	   At stake are 37 GOP convention delegates in a hard-fought contest between
Arizona Sen. John McCain and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that the Voting Rights Act does not apply,'' state Republican
Chairman Henry McMaster said. South Carolina's primaries are run by the
political parties, not the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have asked for approval to run the primary with any proposed
changes in polling places, a process known as ``preclearance.''
</P>
<P>
	   The government has at least two months to consider that. Should it
eventually deny the request, any election results would be voided, Justice
spokeswoman Christine DeBartolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-judge U.S. District Court panel will preside over Monday's court
hearing on the lawsuit filed by state Rep. Todd Rutherford and Jim Fitts, both
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   If the judges block the primary, the GOP plans to challenge the Democrats'
plans for caucuses on March 9, said J. Sam Daniels, the state Republican Party's
executive director.

<HEADLINE> Group: Peru Unprepared in Elections  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The Carter Center said Friday that Peru does not meet
international standards for fair elections and demanded that President Alberto
Fujimori's government take immediate steps to ensure a clean vote in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Peruvian officials ``must take a series of immediate actions that will
guarantee a completely informed decision by voters when the ballot is cast,''
said former Costa Rica President Don Rodrigo Carazo, who led the delegation of
Carter Center observers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Carter Center, founded by former President Jimmy Carter, made its
conclusion in conjunction with the National Democratic Institute, another U.S.
based pro-democracy group, after a five-day visit at the invitation of
Fujimori's administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Fujimori responded that his government has already taken the necessary
measures to ensure clean elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is why, right now, there are no allegations of supposed
persecution,'' he said. ``These types of charges have all vanished. Even more,
the government has guaranteed the free movement of all candidates, without any
inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
	   The delegation's list of irregularities ranged from the abuse of public
assistance programs to garner votes to government manipulation of the media to
limit air time and press coverage of opposition candidates and views critical of
the president.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin welcomed the
recommendation and said prompt action along those lines would help broaden and
deepen democracy in Peru.
</P>
<P>
	   Fujimori's foes accuse his government of waging a systematic, illegal
campaign of harassment to discredit and intimidate leading opposition candidates
and election watchdog groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid charges that pro-government media are conspiring to deny air time to
the opposition, the National Elections Board on Thursday told radio and
television executives that they must broadcast political ads of all candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Fujimori, who was first elected in 1990 and won a landslide reelection in
1995, has a wide lead in most election polls.
</P>
<P>
	   His opponents say his bid for a third consecutive term violates the
constitution.

<HEADLINE> Citrus Canker Emergency Declared  </HEADLINE>
   By JACKIE HALLIFAX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency in
several counties on Friday to free money to eradicate citrus canker before it
wipes out the state's $8 billion fruit industry.
</P>
<P>
	   A speedier timetable to stamp out the disease in Miami-Dade and Broward
counties, where the infestation is concentrated, will cost about $110 million
and require burning a million additional citrus trees, said Agriculture
Commissioner Bob Crawford.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot ... permit the disease to fester any longer,'' he said. ``If we
don't do it, the scientists assure me that it's all over and we've lost, and
it'll spread throughout the state and next we'll lose our citrus industry and
people will lose their backyard trees as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   The emergency declaration by Bush allows a $35 million withdrawal from the
state's rainy-day fund to fight the disease. Florida officials hope the federal
government will cover some of the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   Canker-infected trees show lesions on the leaves, stems and fruit. The
disease causes the fruit to fall prematurely and ultimately can kill the tree.
Burning exposed trees is the only way to prevent its spread.
</P>
<P>
	   Growers consider canker the primary threat to their industry and support the
eradication plan, according to Ron Hamel, executive vice president of Gulf
Citrus Growers Association, which represents 160 growers in southwest Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The sooner the better as far as we're concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state already has lost 200,000 residential trees and 300,000 trees in
commercial groves to the disease. The plan announced Friday increases the range
in which exposed or infected trees must be cut and the number of crews working
to cut and burn the infected trees.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush declared a state of emergency in Miami-Dade, Broward, Collier, Hendry,
Hillsborough and Manatee counties.

<HEADLINE> Officer dies after shooting inside police headquarters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GLASTONBURY, Conn. (AP) -A town police officer was fatally shot Friday
inside police headquarters.
<P>
	   Officer Thomas M. Gadarowski, 45, was the only person involved in the
shooting, said Sgt. Jay Kehoe, a police spokesman. Kehoe refused to say if
police were treating the incident as an accident or a suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   Gadarowski, who lived in Glastonbury, was a 17-year veteran of the
department. He had also served as a police officer in Portland, Kehoe said. He
had a wife and two children, ages 6 and 10.
</P>
<P>
	   "The entire department is mourning the loss of a fine police officer," Kehoe
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting occurred at about 3 p.m. in a nonpublic area of the department,
during a shift change. Kehoe said he was not sure if Gadarowski was coming on or
off duty at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Gadarowski was rushed by ambulance to Hartford Hospital with a police
escort. He died a short time later.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Police Major Crime Squad was called in to investigate the
shooting. An autopsy was scheduled for Saturday at the medical examiner's office
in Farmington.
</P>
<P>
	   Off-duty officers and several residents of this town of 29,000 congregated
at the police department Friday night in an effort to get more information.
Grief counselors were called in to help the department's 55 officers and 24
civilian employees deal with the loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Taylor, 17, stood outside the station with three other members of the
Glastonbury Police Explorers. He said he stopped by to see if he had worked with
the officer involved.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know most of the cops here," he said. "When something like this happens,
you don't know what to think."
</P>
<P>
	   Gadarowski received nine commendations for exemplary performance during his
years on the Glastonbury force. He also served with the Air National Guard's
103rd Fighter Wing in East Granby.
</P>
<P>
	   Funeral arrangements were incomplete Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Iraq May Allow Arms Inspectors In  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Even though Iraq's vice president said his country
will not allow U.N. arms inspectors back into the country, members of the
Security Council think Baghdad may change its mind.
</P>
<P>
	   Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's foreign affairs deputy, left open the possibility of
compromise on Friday -- if the council engages Iraq in a discussion of its
concerns about the new inspection regime.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Compromise will only be done when the council itself gets engaged with
Iraq in a discussion,'' he told CNN. ``It has not happened yet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under U.N. resolutions, economic sanctions against Iraq cannot be lifted
until inspectors report that Baghdad is free of its weapons of mass destruction.
Hamdoon said Iraq can live with sanctions ``forever.''
</P>
<P>
	   But some council members believe Iraq will eventually accept the return of
inspectors. U.N. Ambassador Peter Van Walsum of the Netherlands said Thursday he
believes the Iraqis will change their minds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have to say `yes' ... and if they don't react, then we'll just have
to wait. But I cannot imagine that that is `no' forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraqi leaders have repeatedly said they won't deal with a new Iraq policy
adopted by the council on Dec. 17, whose primary aim is to return weapons
inspectors for the first time since December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan's remarks Thursday were the most negative
to date.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There shall be no return of the so-called inspection teams. We reject the
infiltration by spies using such cover,'' the official Iraqi News Agency quoted
Ramadan as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council never expected Iraq to roll out the welcome mat for new
inspectors, so there was little surprise at the vice president's remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's one attempt,'' Malaysia's U.N. ambassador Agam Hasmy said. ``We
have to make more attempts. All those who can speak to Iraq will have to
speak.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Dec. 17 resolution creates a new U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission which will be headed by Hans Blix, former director-general
of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Blix is expected to assume the post on March 1 and has 45 days to organize
and staff the commission and dispatch inspectors to determine Iraq's remaining
disarmament tasks.
</P>
<P>
	   The council will consider suspending sanctions for renewable 120-day periods
if inspectors report that Iraq has cooperated ``in all respects'' and shown
progress towards answering the outstanding disarmament questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Malaysia's Hasmy stressed that ``there's no quick solution.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need patience and need to engage Iraq as we have been saying in the
council,'' he said. ``I still believe that the secretary-general can play a role
here to try to bridge the gap.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Kofi Annan may not be anxious to intervene again in an Iraqi standoff.
Iraq reneged on a February 1998 agreement Annan negotiated in Baghdad to allow
unfettered weapons inspections.

<HEADLINE> Fearing backlash, McCain drops negative ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - In an abrupt change of strategy, Sen. John McCain
pulled ads attacking George W. Bush off the air Friday after advisers determined
the commercials were compromising his campaign as a self-styled political
outsider.
<P>
	   A week away from this state's critical Republican primary, McCain urged Bush
to follow suit and pledge to run strictly positive ads. "We can't be involved in
these kind of campaign activities," the Arizona senator said in the latest
exchange between two candidates trying to portray each other as negative
campaigners.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush quickly rejected the proposal, suggesting that McCain's decision was an
act of politics, not principle.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's an old Washington trick. It's a bait-and-switch trick. He runs ads
for 18 days defining me for something I'm not, and then all of a sudden says,
'OK, let's all be quiet.' I'm going to make sure that the people understand
exactly what I believe and exactly where I stand," Bush said between campaign
stops in Charleston.
</P>
<P>
	   The fracas began in the New Hampshire primary campaign, when a McCain ad
suggested that Bush would damage Social Security. Bush fired back with an ad
saying the Arizona senator distorted the truth in his spot. That prompted two
hard-hitting McCain ads that compared Bush and his truth-telling to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   As the South Carolina campaign heated up, the Texas governor's ad campaign
has all but called McCain a hypocrite for denouncing special interests while
seeking political donations from them.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope that he will recognize the damage that this kind of thing does to
the electorate," McCain said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   After a surge of momentum generated by his landslide New Hampshire victory,
McCain's own polling showed his progress slowed because of negative ads by both
campaigns. The surveys did not pick up major slippage but confirmed the
suspicion of some advisers that McCain's ads - particularly ones linking Bush to
Clinton - tarnished his clean-scrubbed political image.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls from Tuesday's Delaware primary showed about one quarter of the
Republican voters said McCain had made unfair attacks on his rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   The primary concern in McCain's camp, however, was voter turnout. His
advisers fear that the campaign's nasty tone is alienating independent and
Democratic voters who are the cornerstone of his campaign. Regardless of who
voters blame for the negative turn of events, McCain stands to lose the most if
the atmosphere suppresses turnout, his advisers concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question that a negative war is going to lower turnout. We want
more people to come," said campaign manager Rick Davis. "The more people who
show up the better off we are."
</P>
<P>
	   Not easing up, Bush unveiled a new ad Friday that accused the Arizonan of
going "over the line" with the Clinton comparison. "Disagree with me, fine, but
do not challenge my integrity," the Texas governor says in the ad.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's advisers say they plan to air another ad this weekend that is sharply
critical of the Arizonan. Though they may be forced to tone down upcoming ads in
response to McCain's challenge, aides said they do not plan to abandon their
strategy to redefine McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   "This guy runs two weeks of negative ads comparing us to Bill Clinton and
now he wants ease up? This is a guy who will say one thing and do another," said
Bush strategist Karl Rove. "He's bowing to the negative consequences of accusing
us of being like President Clinton."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain strategist Mike Murphy said his candidate was forced to attack after
Bush went negative, and was returning to his positive instincts. "We had to
punch back to let our supporters know we're not like Bill Bradley," Murphy said,
referring to the Democratic candidate who was slow to respond to Al Gore's
criticisms.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's new ad, called "Courage," highlights his Vietnam war record and
battle to reform campaign laws in the Senate. It's a return to the message that
helped McCain win New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's staff debated most of the week whether to air the positive ad alone
or in combination with a new hard-hitting spot criticizing Bush's tax plan.
</P>
<P>
	   They also had considered holding a news conference Friday to unveil an ad
blasting Bush for allowing a surrogate to criticize McCain's record on veteran's
affairs. That ad, however, was produced mainly for the consumption of news media
because the campaign never planned to spend much money airing it, aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's top advisers, including Murphy and Davis, had tentatively decided
to recommend a change in strategy Thursday, when a woman stood up in a McCain
event and emotionally accused Bush's campaign of making negative calls to South
Carolina Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain denounced Bush's campaign. The decision was sealed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The senator has good instincts," Davis said. "He knew we couldn't go
negative after that."

<HEADLINE> Mom Given Drug Loses Kids Custody  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A woman who was given a common sedative during
labor lost custody of her newborn son and three other children for three months
when the baby failed a drug test.
</P>
<P>
	   Orange County child welfare officials say they only learned in January that
the barbiturate found in Noel Lujan's son was prescribed by a doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime Lujan, 25, could not feed her child without supervision by
one of her parents. She contends she lost her job because of absences to attend
a required drug treatment program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was horrible,'' she said this week as she cradled her baby, Daniel, at
her parents' home. ``The whole three months, they were telling me I was a drug
addict, that I was in denial.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lujan, who is unmarried, arrived at a hospital emergency room on Oct. 18.
Dr. Charles Moniak said he authorized her to receive Seconal, often used to calm
women in labor.
</P>
<P>
	   After Lujan gave birth, a social worker told her Daniel had tested positive
for drugs and she could not take him home.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniel and Lujan's other children, ages 2, 5 and 6, were put in her parents'
temporary custody, although Lujan was allowed to stay at their home.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor who prescribed the Seconal said he was not contacted ``before
they took those babies away.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If this is an honest error, then we are sincerely sorry,'' said Michael
Riley, director of the county's Children and Family Services agency. ``It is not
a perfect system.''

<HEADLINE> More Jets Found With Tail Problems  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW FORDAHL AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Government-mandated inspections found at least three
jetliners Friday with the same tail wing problem that has become the focus of
the investigation into last week's crash of an Alaska Airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of six aircraft, including the plane that crashed Jan. 31, had
unusual metal shavings in their tail wing assemblies, the National
Transportation Safety Board said.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest cases were uncovered after the Federal Aviation Administration
ordered inspections of all MD-80 and similar aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB sent investigators to check the aircraft, but officials would not
name the airlines. An FAA spokesman also refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have initial, unconfirmed reports that we need to verify before we
release any information,'' said Paul Takemoto, an FAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspections affect about 1,200 planes, including MD-80s, MD-90s, Boeing
717s and DC-9s. The first part of the inspections must be completed by Monday,
but the FAA is giving airlines 30 days to perform a more detailed check.
</P>
<P>
	   Two airlines reported irregularities found during the inspections, but it
was not clear whether the NTSB included them in its statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Delta Air Lines mechanics found two MD-90s with a gritty residue below the
horizontal stabilizer and took the aircraft out of service at least until
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're continuing to look at the planes and analyzing the residue, but we
strongly suspect we'll have these planes back in service tomorrow,'' said Clay
McConnell, a Delta spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest Airlines pulled a DC-9 from service after unspecified
irregularities were found in the tail wing assembly. The section has been
removed for further analysis and the plane was expected to fly again Saturday, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines canceled a dozen flights Friday to repeat inspections made
before the FAA issued its order, said spokesman Jack Evans. Other airlines
reported no major schedule disruptions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're talking a dozen flights out of 500 or so we launch daily so overall
impact is still very small,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines Flight 261's pilots discussed problems with the horizontal
stabilizer after taking off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San Francisco and
Seattle. The plane crashed off Southern California Jan. 31, killing all 88
people aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   Crash investigators are focusing on a part that moves the stabilizer, a
40-foot tail-mounted wing that controls the up-and-down pitch of the aircraft's
nose during flight.
</P>
<P>
	   A 2-foot-long, rod-like jackscrew that drives the stabilizer was recovered
and found to be entwined with metal shavings believed to have come from an
8-inch gimbal nut that was later retrieved from the Pacific and found to have
damaged threads, NTSB investigators said.
</P>
<P>
	   It remained unclear whether the damage occurred before the crash or was the
result of the plane's impact with the ocean. Metal experts were examining the
pieces.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing engineers said that some wear inside the nut is normal, but typical
use should leave a residue of fine dust, not the long, curly strings found in
the three Alaska jetliners.
</P>
<P>
	   During the first inspection, which must be completed by Monday, mechanics
are examining the condition of the jackscrew, lubrication and the stops that
prevent the stabilizer from moving at too steep an angle. It takes about 3 1/2
hours to finish the check, Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
	   The second phase of the order involves examining how snugly the jackscrew
fits into the nut. Airlines have 30 days to complete the inspections, which can
take six hours on each plane.
</P>
<P>
	   During voluntary inspections early this week, Alaska mechanics in Portland,
Ore., and Seattle found two MD-80s with similar shavings in the horizontal
stabilizer assemblies, prompting the FAA's nationwide mandatory inspection
order.
</P>
<P>
	   An Associated Press review of maintenance records from 1990 through 1999
found no reports of stripped gimbal nuts in the jetliners covered in the order.
</P>
<P>
	   American Airlines, which flies more MD-80s and MD-90s than any other
carrier, reported no disruptions. The airline has 284 planes affected by the
order.
</P>
<P>
	   US Airways, which had checked half its fleet of MD-80s and DC-9s, also
reported no problems. Remaining inspections were expected to be completed at
night so that they would have no effect on the airline's schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   TWA mechanics were inspecting 130 aircraft and reported no abnormalities,
spokesman Jim Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This stabilizer control system has proven to be a reliable design and TWA
has not in the past encountered any significant or systemic problems with the
design or the system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Applebaum, 52, of Los Angeles said he had no qualms shortly before he
boarded an Alaska Airlines flight to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They won't let them get off the ground if there's a problem,'' he said.
``It's safer to fly than it is to drive a car, especially in L.A.''

   WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- A big beast. A big auction. A big bust.
</P>
<P>
	   An online auction for a 25-foot-tall, 40-foot long Tyrannosaurus rex
skeleton ended after three weeks Thursday, with no bidders.
</P>
<P>
	   The opening price was $5.8 million. Organizers had hoped multiple bidders
would drive the price much higher, said Brian Payea, a spokesman for Lycos Inc.,
which hosted the auction.
</P>
<P>

Friday. ``I can't put myself in the shoes of someone who'd be spending $6
million.''
</P>

million at a traditional Sotheby's auction on behalf of the Chicago Field Museum
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Britain Suspends Belfast Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Britain resumed direct control over
Northern Ireland on Friday, stripping power from the province's new
Protestant-Catholic administration -- its best chance at self-rule -- in hopes
of preventing the coalition's collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   But within hours of the move, the British and Irish governments announced
that the Irish Republican Army had softened its traditional refusal to disarm.
They called this ``a development of real significance'' that could allow the
Belfast administration -- a key plank of the province's 1998 peace accord -- to
regain powers soon.
</P>
<P>
	   That hopeful news, following an agonizing week of behind-the-scenes
negotiations did not deter Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson from
revoking the Cabinet's substantial powers just 72 days after handing them over.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said that while taking such action was ``deeply disappointing,''
it was necessary to discourage the Cabinet's major Protestant party, the Ulster
Unionists, from resigning their posts.
</P>
<P>
	   The withdrawal of powers came despite a last-minute claim from Sinn Fein
leader Gerry Adams that the IRA had just offered the British government ``a new
and significant proposition to resolve the arms issue.'' He refused to say
whether the outlawed group had agreed to abide by the peace accord's May
deadline to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, President Clinton said he was disappointed by the IRA's
refusal to disarm and said he regrets the group did not give ``a more timely
commitment on arms decommissioning.''
</P>
<P>
	   While Mandelson said the offering was inadequate and came too late, he
emphasized that powers could be transferred back to Belfast once two key
questions are answered: ``Is there going to be weapons decommissioning by the
IRA, and if so, when?''
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists agreed in November to form the four-party Cabinet
alongside politicians from the IRA-linked Sinn Fein. But as part of that
American-brokered deal, the Irish Republican Army was supposed to start
disarming in response.
</P>
<P>
	   The province's disarmament commission reported Jan. 31 that the IRA had made
no such commitments, triggering the crisis. But the commission issued a second
report late Friday saying that its latest discussions with the IRA had produced
``the real prospect of an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   It said the IRA's designated negotiator ``indicated to us today the context
in which the IRA will initiate a comprehensive process to put arms beyond use,
in a manner as to ensure maximum public confidence.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson's resumption of authority took pressure off the Ulster Unionists,
which scheduled a party conference Saturday to debate whether to withdraw from
the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   That meeting will proceed, but Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble -- who
agreed to share power with Sinn Fein two months ago in hopes IRA disarmament
would follow -- now faces less risk of being forced to resign as Cabinet leader.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it was extremely sad, but also necessary, for the government to
return powers to London,'' Trimble said. ``The reality is that we took a big
risk in accepting Sinn Fein on a trial basis, and we were assured that the IRA
would take similarly big risks in return.''
</P>
<P>
	   The British, Irish and U.S. governments consider Trimble's political
survival essential for the Cabinet to work. It includes the province's major
Catholic party, the pacifist Social Democratic and Labor Party or SDLP, and the
hard-line Protestants of the Democratic Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Stripping the Cabinet's powers allows it to remain intact on paper. Were the
Ulster Unionists to resign, it would collapse. A new election would have to be
held in Northern Ireland in which Trimble's hard-line Protestant opponents would
be likely to gain strength and make any new Cabinet even harder to form.
</P>
<P>
	   But SDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon, the senior Catholic in the Cabinet,
said Mandelson had only made matters worse by suspending their powers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who could imagine that securing IRA decommissioning will be any less
difficult now?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the province had a measure of self-rule was in 1974, when a
power-sharing Cabinet collapsed under the combined weight of Protestant protests
and IRA violence.

<HEADLINE> Actress Moreau Gets Lifetime Award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- After 50 years in the film business, French actress Jeanne
Moreau says the only way to go forward is to ``have a little humility.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moreau, 72, received a Golden Bear award for lifetime achievement at the
Berlin Film Festival Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My first reaction is to feel a little embarrassed,'' she said before the
honor was given.
</P>
<P>
	   Moreau began her film career in 1949 and worked with many leading directors,
including Francois Truffaut in ``Jules and Jim'' and Orson Welles in ``Chimes at
Midnight.''
</P>
<P>
	   She continued to act in films through the 1990s while branching out to
direct films and even music videos.
</P>
<P>
	   The 50th annual Berlin festival, which runs through Feb. 20, is showing a
retrospective of her work, including a special screening of the 1966 Tony
Richardson adaptation of Jean Genet's ``Mademoiselle.''

<HEADLINE> Platter Returned to Authorities  </HEADLINE>
   By VERENA DOBNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A pure gold platter on which ancient Sicilians once offered
food to Greek gods was returned to Italian authorities Friday, concluding a
16-year odyssey spanning two continents.
</P>
<P>
	   The phiale, a foot-wide, hand-carved platter inscribed in Greek, was
excavated illegally during construction work near Palermo about 1984 and
spirited out of the country. A five-year investigation led to its return.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference, Giorgio Radicati, the Italian consul general in New
York, balanced the shimmering platter on his fingers as it would have been
presented to the gods in about 450 B.C., when Sicily was ruled by Greece.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The gods have a long memory, but so do the carabinieri'' -- or Italian
police, said U.S. Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly, praising Italian
investigators who helped trace the journey of the archeological masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
	   The phiale was sold to a Sicilian art collector and then spirited out of
Italy in 1991 to a dealer in Zurich, Switzerland. Later that year, Manhattan
collector Michael Steinhardt, a former Wall Street financier, bought the antique
for about $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   It arrived at Kennedy Airport, hand-carried on a flight from Geneva by a
Manhattan dealer who acted as intermediary. A customs form gave the phiale's
country of origin as Switzerland and its value at $250,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is one of the most important cases to ever confront the museum
world,'' said federal prosecutor Mary Jo White.
</P>
<P>
	   Her office and the U.S. Customs Service had filed a forfeiture complaint and
a Manhattan judge ordered the artifact repatriated. Last July, an appeals court
upheld the ruling. Steinhardt, the collector, sought a Supreme Court appeal, but
the nation's highest court declined to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The treasure was packed for a flight to Rome, accompanied by an entourage
including an Italian magistrate and a major of the carabinieri. It will be sent
to a Sicilian museum.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- Fueled by dry vegetation, wildfires have burned hundreds
of acres in Georgia, damaging at least two homes and causing several accidents
along a smoky rural highway.
</P>
<P>
	   In one accident, a 48-year-old woman was killed when her car struck the rear
of a tractor-trailer on the smoke-shrouded highway. The highway was closed for
portions of Wednesday and Thursday and closely watched on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   For a while, troopers escorted groups of cars through the area in only one
direction at a time.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 200 wildfires had burned 1,248 acres this week. February is
traditionally the beginning of a three-month wildfire season in Georgia, but
Allen Dozier, chief of fire protection with the Georgia Forestry Commission in
Macon, said it could be worse this year, because the state is in the midst of a
two-year drought with no letup in sight.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty firefighters were battling a blaze in a swamp Friday, ``putting out
every single smoldering stump,'' Dozier said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Areas like that 20-acre swamp don't normally catch fire,'' he said.
``That's an indication of how dry it is.''

<HEADLINE> Officials Seek Calm in Kosovo City  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Struggling to restore control over
Kosovo's most volatile city, the head of the U.N. mission crossed into the Serb
area Friday to reassure the dwindling ethnic Albanian community of their safety
there.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of ethnic Albanians have fled across the
Ibar River to the Albanian-controlled south bank since an upsurge of violence
after a grenade attack on a U.N. relief agency bus killed two elderly Serbs last
week.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident triggered a wave of grenade attacks, shootings and clashes,
leaving at least eight ethnic Albanians dead and dozens of Serbs, ethnic
Albanians and French peacekeepers injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Additional troops have been sent here after complaints by U.N. police that
the French were slow to respond to the upsurge in violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernard Kouchner, the chief U.N. administrator for the province, said he
crossed into the Serb area and visited several ethnic Albanian families, trying
to assure them that U.N. police and NATO-led peacekeepers could guarantee their
safety if they remained in their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Kouchner said he visited an elderly couple who had been living in the Serb
part of the city for 25 years. He said they wept at the prospect of having to
leave.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I remember it was the same tears when I visited elderly Serbs in
Pristina,'' he said, referring to the Kosovo capital from which most Serbs have
been driven from their homes too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are suffering on both sides,'' Kouchner said. ``People are
suffering on the north side. They are looking desperate, and they believe they
have no future. And it's not true at all.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Geneva. the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported Friday that 650
ethnic Albanian families have registered with the United Nations after fleeing
from the Serb side of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Ron Redmond said the real number of Albanians who have fled was
probably much higher because many of those with relatives in the south side do
not bother to register.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the latest violence, about 4,500 ethnic Albanians were living among
an estimated 9,000 Serbs on the north side of the river, Redmond said. He said
that if the exodus continues, ``northern Mitrovica will soon be emptied of its
ethnic Albanian population.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations and NATO entered the province after the 78-day Western
air campaign last year forced Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt his
crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists and to enable nearly 900,000 Albanians
to return to the homes from which they were driven by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the arrival of about 50,000 NATO-led troops failed to halt reprisal
attacks by ethnic Albanians against Serbs, so the cycle of violence continues.

<HEADLINE> Regent University Studies Hip-Hop  </HEADLINE>
   By SONJA BARISIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Evangelical Christians at Regent University are
getting an earful of rap music this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The university founded by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson is sponsoring
a conference on ``The Hip-Hop Nation'' to try to help adults understand urban
youth culture and its appeal to suburban teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Churches don't get the rap thing,'' the Rev. Eugene Rivers III, the
conference's featured speaker, said Friday. ``They still don't get rock 'n' roll
50 years later. They still don't get Elvis Presley.''
</P>
<P>
	   If evangelical Christians want to understand and communicate with their
teens, they must try to understand hip-hop, said Rivers, founder of Boston's Ten
Point Coalition, which works to reduce youth violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rap and hip-hop are the voices of the post-civil rights generation, for
kids black and white,'' Rivers said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 people attended the conference's opening session Thursday night.
The conference ends Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're interested in how faith and culture interact,'' said organizer
Benson Fraser, who is teaching a class on hip-hop culture this semester. ``We
feel faith can help shape culture but often doesn't, especially in the arts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rivers said churches mistakenly condemn some hip-hop music as obscene
without understanding the reasons behind the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obscene lyrics are in more cases than not a product of obscene
circumstances,'' Rivers said. ``If I'm going to decry the obscenity of the
lyrics ... I must decry as vigorously the obscene conditions which provoked the
lyrics,'' such as poverty.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
   By ZEINA KARAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah guerrillas killed a seventh Israeli
soldier Friday and seriously wounded another. Israel retaliated with a 13th day
of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss appealed for American and French to help
halt the Israeli campaign. He called on the international community ``to
shoulder their responsibilities (in deterring Israel) in the name of right and
justice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Clinton administration urged Syria, the powerbroker in
Lebanon, to help deter violence by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel responded to Hezbollah's fatal rocket and mortar attack on an Israeli
army base with repeated airstrikes Friday, firing missiles from helicopter
gunships and fighter jets at guerrilla hideouts and routes. At least 12 missiles
were fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli jets returned later in the evening and fired two more missiles at
suspected guerrilla hideouts in Jabal al-Daher on the edge of an
Israeli-occupied border zone in south Lebanon, Lebanese security officials in
the region said. The area was earlier targeted with four missiles. No casualties
were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed the airstrikes and the Israeli
casualties. An announcement said Sgt. Zachi Yitah, 19, was killed and another
soldier was seriously wounded when a missile hit a combat trench.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he would retaliate further in his own
time with ``very harsh strikes in Lebanon,'' but reaffirmed a pledge to withdraw
troops by July.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the leader of Hezbollah vowed more attacks with the aim of driving
Israeli forces out of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bombing of infrastructure in Lebanon will not protect the (Israeli)
occupation troops. Rather, it will expose them to more painful strikes,''
Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah told a delegation from Egypt's Al-Ahram
newspaper led by its editor, Ibrahim Nafie, Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(Hezbollah) attacks will continue with the same momentum and strength
until the (Israeli) enemy is defeated and forced to withdraw unconditionally
from Lebanon,'' Nasrallah added, according to a Hezbollah statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah said in a statement that Friday's
operation proved ``the enemy's complete impotence in the face of the prowess of
resistance fighters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, the U.S. government leaned on Syria to stop the attacks. In
past border conflicts, the administration has called for restraint on all sides.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton is not taking a neutral stance, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said. ``We expect Syria to be more effective in their influence and we
expect restraint.''
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also said Syria should do more to curb
Hezbollah's attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli soldiers have patrolled a strip inside southern Lebanon since 1985
in an effort to curb cross-border guerrilla raids on its communities. Hezbollah
is the main guerrilla group trying to oust Israeli troops from Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Israeli military officials said that Israel would no longer
abide by a code of engagement which restricted firing toward civilian areas and
said they would strike back hard against any attacks on their soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, both Israel and Lebanon sent letters to Secretary-General Kofi
Annan accusing each other of escalating attacks and attempting to undermine
Middle East peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters were given to the Security Council on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoss accused Israel of stepping up its ``aggression'' and said the bombing
of the power stations broke an April 1996 understanding that forbids attacks on
or from civilian areas in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's Foreign Minister David Levy accused Hezbollah of violating the 1996
agreement by launching attacks from villages in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Israeli government has reiterated in every possible forum that the
escalation in Lebanon is liable to endanger the peace process. Yet despite this,
no restraining action has been undertaken, either by the Lebanese or the Syrian
governments,'' Levy said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Protester Sent to Prison  </HEADLINE>
   By ALISA BLACKWOOD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- The past caught up with antiwar activist Howard Mechanic on
Friday, long after the passions of the Vietnam era had cooled.
</P>
<P>
	   After nearly 30 years of lies, the former Scottsdale City Council candidate
known as Gary Tredway was revealed this week to be Mechanic, an activist who
skipped out on a five-year prison sentence for hurling a cherry bomb at
firefighters during an antiwar protest in 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   He began serving the sentence Friday after admitting his identity in federal
court. He had surrendered after a week of newspaper investigations unraveled his
past.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Attorney's office also charged him Friday with using a false social
security number to obtain an Arizona driver's license. The felony is punishable
by up to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   John Eichenauer said he was surprised that his friend of 15 years turned out
to be a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They say it takes awhile to know somebody,'' Eichenauer said. ``But
perhaps it's not necessary to know everything. We all have flaws, skeletons.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mechanic, 51, is one of a number of Vietnam War-era activists who went
underground in the 1970s, only to resurface after decades of relatively quiet
suburban life.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, authorities arrested an alleged member of the Symbionese
Liberation Army who is accused of placing bombs under two Los Angeles police
cars in 1975. Kathleen Soliah, who has yet to go to trial, was living under an
assumed name, married to a St. Paul, Minn., doctor and raising three children.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal authorities had been hunting for Mechanic since he fled his 1972
sentence stemming from a protest at Washington University in St. Louis, where he
had been a student. The demonstration came the day after four students at Kent
State University in Ohio were shot to death by National Guardsmen called in to
quell another antiwar demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   During the protest at Washington University, an ROTC building was set on
fire. The firefighters he was accused of throwing the cherry bomb at had come to
fight the blaze. No one was injured by the powerful firecracker.
</P>
<P>
	   Mechanic was charged under a 1968 anti-riot statute with obstructing and
interfering with law officers during a civil disorder.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously he was just one of the people who got in the way,'' said
Tredway's longtime friend Steve Brittle. ``It's the height of absurdity to take
a productive member of society and put him in jail.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mechanic was nearly successful in creating a new life for himself. But he
maintained his passion for social activism and an integrity that friends say
will be a huge loss to the community if he remains in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   As a local political activist, Mechanic often attended City Council
meetings, pushed for clean elections, tax breaks, environmental causes and
growth control in the Phoenix area. As Tredway, he began campaigning for a seat
on the City Council in suburban Scottsdale last year but bowed out of the race
this week, claiming he had leukemia.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, after Phoenix-area newspapers began investigating his past, he
admitted making up his identity and acknowledged he was not an orphan, had not
attended Franconia College and did not have leukemia.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 30 friends and local activists crowded the court Friday, passing a pad
of paper to collect names for a petition to have him pardoned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's an echo of a difficult time in our history,'' said Jim Driscoll, a
Vietnam War veteran and friend of Mechanic's. ``The sentence was way out of
proportion. He was a young man of conscience.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carter Revard was a professor at Washington University and was part of a
group that posted Mechanic's $10,000 bail 30 years ago before he fled. He said
he still sides with the student protesters who were prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel terribly sorry for him because I feel the United States government
and its agents persecuted, punished and did great harm to the life of a man who
was trying to do right,'' Revard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mechanic's sentence will be served in Arizona unless Missouri officials
decide to press flight charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Thomas Hoidal said he will ask for a reduction in
Mechanic's sentence and might push for a presidential pardon.
</P>
<P>
	   Mechanic's friends and community supporters said they're clinging to the
hope of a pardon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Talk about healing the wounds of the past,'' Brittle said. ``This is one
of them.''

<HEADLINE> Prominent Lawyer Killed in Tijuana  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Attackers with automatic rifles shot and killed one of
Tijuana's most prominent attorneys, his wife, 24-year-old son and a security
guard, Mexican newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodolfo Gallardo Hernandez, a former state civil judge, and the others were
shot outside his family's Tijuana house Wednesday night, the state attorney
general's office said, according to reports in several newspapers. The gunmen
fired at least 50 bullets, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tijuana has been wracked by drug-related violence for several years and is
the base for Mexico's most violent narcotics cartel. The city of about 1 million
people recorded about 300 murders last year, and it has seen 62 killings so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the slayings appear to be drug-related executions. But there was no
apparent motive in the killing of Gallardo, who was the former head of two local
bar associations and a prominent political figure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What has happened goes beyond indignation. It is intolerable,'' Tijuana
Mayor Francisco Vega was quoted as saying by a newspaper in the border city,
Frontera.
</P>
<P>
	   State police are in charge of murder cases and federal police have
jurisdiction over drug cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Frontera reported that early last year, Gallardo, accompanied by police, had
served an eviction notice on a house in the area and that police found more than
a ton of marijuana there.
</P>
<P>
	   In April 1999, the newspaper said, an explosive device powerful enough to
destroy three houses was found at Gallardo's house and removed by Mexican
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Baja California Deputy Attorney General Olga Guadalupe Jimenez told
reporters that officials believe four to six attackers took part in the
shooting, firing at the attorney and his wife, Marta Delgado, from both sides of
their car.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney's son, Rodolfo Gallardo Delgado, 24, was shot to death in his
car when he came out of the family's house after hearing the shots, Jimenez
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also killed was Fernando Alcala, the personal security guard for the
Canadian consul in Tijuana.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Ask For Elian's Return  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Religious leaders visiting from Illinois called Friday for
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The group also asked for an end to U.S. trade sanctions against the
communist island, which they said cause unnecessary suffering for the Cuban
people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Illinois Council of Churches and the Chicago Religious Leadership
Network on Latin America have been in Havana for the past week, attending
services at numerous Cuban churches and meeting with Cuban professionals,
academics and officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The 16-member delegation of Protestants and Catholics also met with Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He told us to tell the American people: 'I miss him. I love him. I want
him to be back by my side as soon as possible,''' said the Rev. David Allen
Anderson, head of the Illinois council.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson said that he promised Gonzalez that he would personally call
Attorney General Janet Reno after he returned to the United States on Monday to
ask that Elian be repatriated with his father as quickly as possible, but in the
meantime be removed from the home of the child's paternal great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez, who is fighting to keep him in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Miguel Gonzalez wrote Reno earlier this week asking that the child be
moved to the home of another great-uncle in Miami, Manolo Gonzalez, who favors
the boy's return to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father told the attorney general he was worried about how the
constant media attention and constant visits by Cuban American politicians to
Lazaro Gonalez's home were affecting his child.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most times I can't get to sleep,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said in an
interview with ``Dateline NBC,'' broadcast Friday night. ``This has been total
suffering, nightmares and bad dreams.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued off Florida's coast on Nov. 25 after his mother and 10
others were lost at sea during a journey from Cuba to the United States. The
child was temporarily placed with Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Justice Department said this week that it is reviewing that
request, as well as whether alcohol-related driving violations or other actions
by Elian Gonzalez' relatives in Miami warrant moving the 6-year-old boy to a
different, temporary custodian.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government continued pressing for Elian's return on Friday,
holding the latest of dozens of government organized rallies held almost daily.
President Fidel Castro and Elian's Cuban family attended the gathering sponsored
by the Federation of Cuban Women.
</P>
<P>
	   At their news conference earlier in the day, the Illinois church leaders
also called for an end to the 38-year-old trade embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The sanctions were imposed in 1962 at the height of the Cold War to punish,
as well as press for a change in the communist government of Fidel Castro, who
remains in power today.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been increasing attempts by U.S. lawmakers for a partial lifting
of the restrictions on American sales of medicine and food to the island, but
they have failed to gain full congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the sanctions say that lifting the embargo will only help
Castro.

<HEADLINE> Accused Harrison Knifer in Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England (AP) -- A man accused of stabbing former Beatle George
Harrison and injuring his wife, Olivia, was ordered Friday to remain in a medium
security psychiatric unit for another eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Abram, 33, from Liverpool, was originally admitted to the unit and
charged with the attempted murder of Harrison, 56, and his wife Olivia, 51, at
their home in Henley-on-Thames, west of London, Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison reportedly fought off his attacker and received slash injuries and
a one-inch stab wound that collapsed his right lung.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison's wife was scratched and bruised in the incident, which rekindled
memories of the murder of fellow Beatle John Lennon. Lennon was shot to death by
a deranged fan 19 years ago in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Abram did not appear at the Oxford Magistrates Court hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was adjourned until April 7 for medical reports to be prepared.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Joins Boeing Picket Line  </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Bill Bradley, hoping to boost his standing with organized
labor in the presidential race, joined a picket line Friday outside Boeing Co.
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, looking for some union support in Washington's Democratic precinct
caucuses on March 7, joined about 500 striking workers from the Society of
Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. At least 17,000 engineers and
technical workers walked out Wednesday in a contract dispute with the world's
largest airplane manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
	   The aerospace Machinists Union, whose members assemble the airplanes, has
endorsed Vice President Al Gore, but SPEEA will be making no endorsement for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, a Democrat, touted the American labor movement and specifically
embraced the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just wanted to let you know I'm on your side," he told the strikers as he
walked down the picket line, grasping hands and talking briefly with
individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   "Your cause is just. I'm with you," he told another striker.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the strike is in the finest American tradition of workers standing
up for better wages, benefits and respect. At the mention of the word "respect,"
the crowd erupted with cheers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley spoke fondly of the union presence in the small Missouri town where
he grew up and talked about being a shop steward for the Players Association
when he played for the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am the only presidential candidate in 2000 with a union pension, for
sure," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Motorists who spotted the strikers and Bradley honked their car horns as
they drove by and shouted out Bradley's name.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Almeida, president of the parent union, the International Federation of
Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO, said Bradley helped his cause by
coming but said many of his union members are divided on whether to support Gore
or Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their message is rather similar on labor issues."
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing officials estimate that about 75 percent of the 22,600 SPEEA-covered
employees were on strike. SPEEA's estimate is 95 percent.

<HEADLINE> More Jets Found With Tail Problems  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW FORDAHL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At least three more jetliners were found Friday with the
same tail wing problem that has become the focus of the investigation into last
week's crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of six aircraft, including the plane that crashed Jan. 31, had
unusual metal shavings in their tail wing assemblies, the National
Transportation Safety Board said.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest three cases were uncovered after the Federal Aviation
Administration ordered inspections of all MD-80 and similar aircraft. A day
earlier, Alaska Airlines grounded two planes discovered to have the same
problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB sent investigators to check the aircraft, but officials would not
name the airlines. An FAA spokesman also refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have initial, unconfirmed reports that we need to verify before we
release any information,'' said Paul Takemoto, an FAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation into the Jan. 31 crash is focusing on the horizontal
stabilizer because pilots reported trouble controlling the device before the
MD-83 plunged into the Pacific 10 miles off the coast of Port Hueneme. All 88
people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ventura County Medical Examiner's office has identified the remains of
35 of the passengers, a spokeswoman said Friday. The office has not received any
new remains since Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy reported it recovered significant pieces of wreckage from the ocean
Friday. Among them were large portions of the plane's left and right elevators,
which are part of the horizontal stabilizer system. They also found an 8-foot
section of the plane's outboard right stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA's inspection order affects about 1,200 planes, including MD-80s,
MD-90s, Boeing 717s and DC-9s. The first part of the inspections must be
completed by Monday, but the FAA is giving airlines 30 days to perform a more
detailed check.
</P>
<P>
	   Several airlines said mechanics uncovered irregularities during the
inspections, but it was not clear if those were among the ones covered in the
NTSB's statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental Airlines said a quarter-inch metal shaving was found in the tail
wing mechanism of an out-of-service MD-80 undergoing scheduled maintenance. The
problem was reported to the FAA, but all other inspections were uneventful, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines confirmed it pulled a third plane from service due to a
mechanical problem discovered during an inspection in Portland, Ore., but it
also was not clear whether it was related to the metal shavings found in other
planes.
</P>
<P>
	   Delta Air Lines mechanics found two MD-90s with a gritty residue below the
horizontal stabilizer and took the aircraft out of service at least until
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're continuing to look at the planes and analyzing the residue, but we
strongly suspect we'll have these planes back in service tomorrow,'' said Clay
McConnell, a Delta spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest Airlines pulled a DC-9 from service after unspecified
irregularities were found in the tail wing assembly. The section was removed for
further analysis and the plane was expected to fly again Saturday, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   American Airlines mechanics in Reno, Nev., discovered an MD-90's tail wing
assembly needed lubrication, but there was no evidence of unusual wear, said
spokesman John Hotard.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines canceled a dozen flights Friday as it repeated inspections
made before the FAA issued its order, said spokesman Jack Evans. Other airlines
reported no major schedule disruptions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're talking a dozen flights out of 500 or so we launch daily so overall
impact is still very small,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators probing the crash of Alaska Flight 261 are focusing on a part
that moves the stabilizer, a 40-foot tail-mounted wing that controls the
up-and-down pitch of the aircraft's nose during flight.
</P>
<P>
	   A 2-foot-long, rod-like jackscrew that drives the stabilizer was recovered
and found to be entwined with metal shavings believed to have come from an
8-inch gimbal nut that was later retrieved from the Pacific and found to have
damaged threads.
</P>
<P>
	   It remained unclear whether the damage occurred before the crash or was the
result of the plane's impact with the ocean. Metal experts were examining the
pieces.
</P>
<P>
	   An Associated Press review of maintenance records from 1990 through 1999
found no reports of stripped gimbal nuts in the jetliners covered in the order.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspections have prompted varying reactions from the flying public, with
some people saying they are avoiding MD-80s series planes until the situation is
resolved, while others have expressed few concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Applebaum, 52, of Los Angeles said he had no qualms shortly before he
boarded an Alaska Airlines flight to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They won't let them get off the ground if there's a problem,'' he said.
``It's safer to fly than it is to drive a car, especially in L.A.''

<HEADLINE> Primary Winner Vows To Heal Wounds  </HEADLINE>
   By ROSY RAMALES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) -- The man who won Mexico's first full-scale
presidential primary said Friday that divisions from that bitter election still
linger and vowed to heal the wounds during his campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am going to meet with (party members) so that the differences that have
remained'' can be narrowed, Francisco Labastida said in a radio broadcast here.
</P>
<P>
	   Labastida, a former interior secretary, won a Nov. 7 primary election for
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, defeating former Tabasco state Gov.
Roberto Madrazo after a bitter campaign in which Madrazo repeatedly called
Labastida ``a total failure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Madrazo later endorsed Labastida, who is favored in polls ahead of the July
2 election. But some bitterness remains among members of the party, known as the
PRI, which had been unaccustomed to public squabbling during its 71 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
	   During a rally before 8,000 supporters in the main plaza of this southern
Mexican state capital, Labastida repeated his call for ``all fractions of the
party'' to unite. He also promised to work as president to spread development to
Mexico's poor south as well as to the more-developed north.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Enough of a development concentrated in the north of Mexico, of a backward
south, of a south and southeast which have grave, unsatisfied demands and a
north which grows without attending to the needs of the south!'' Labastida said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the buses the party had chartered to bring supporters to the rally
crashed outside of the city, killing two people and injuring 12 others,
according to police.

<HEADLINE> 2 Convicted in AIDS Funding Case  </HEADLINE>
   By VILMA PEREZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A federal jury convicted two men Friday of
conspiring to steal $2.2 million in U.S. AIDS funding in a corruption scandal
that touched the highest levels of Puerto Rico's government.
</P>
<P>
	   Luis Dubon, 65, and Jorge Garib, 46, face up to five years in prison and
Garib could receive another five years for a perjury conviction related to
testimony he gave to a federal grand jury. Sentencing was set for May 11.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second federal trial in a scandal that has rocked Puerto Rico's
government and angered AIDS victims, advocates and their families -- and it
isn't over yet. Federal investigators still are looking into the affair, in
which funds meant to treat AIDS patients were diverted to political campaigns
and personal use.
</P>
<P>
	   Dubon, a prominent attorney, and Garib, an epidemiologist, were board
members of the San Juan AIDS Institute, which received about $15 million in U.S.
funding before it folded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   They were accused of personally embezzling $779,000 of $2.2 million stolen
from the institute, which was funded by the Ryan White Foundation, the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation and the U.S. Health Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Misuse of federal funds is an especially charged issue in this U.S.
territory, which pays no federal taxes but receives $11 billion annually from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, institute director Yamil Kouri and two administrators were
convicted and jailed. Kouri was sentenced to 14 years in prison and ordered to
pay back $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, a dozen institute officials have been indicted. Five have been
convicted, five pleaded guilty, one died and charges were dropped against the
other. In her closing arguments, prosecutor Maria Dominguez called the
institute's board of directors ``a den of thieves.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This case has shown that democracy in this (island) is up for sale,'' U.S.
Attorney Guillermo Gil said after the verdict. ``People ... bought democracy by
buying politicians.''
</P>
<P>
	   The verdicts ``brought justice for those patients who were denied
services,'' said AIDS activist Luis F. Colon.
</P>
<P>
	   Dubon and Garib denied the charges, and Garib's attorney, Howard Srebnick,
said he would appeal.

<HEADLINE> Senator makes brief stop for Republican fund-raiser, uphill battle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - John McCain came through New Jersey Friday to drum
up presidential support in a state that has already planted most of its
Republican politicians behind his primary opponent, Texas Gov. George Bush.
<P>
	   "We've got an insurgency campaign going on here," McCain said after arriving
at a private hangar at Newark International Airport. "All the generals and
admirals, with the exception of a few brave souls, are on the Bush campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Executive James Treffinger and state Sen. William Schluter were
the only state politicians to greet the Arizona senator at his arrival Friday
morning. Both said they believe in his campaign finance reform stance and his
straight-shooting, antiestablishment attitude.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's what the country needs," Schluter said. "He's not afraid to say
something ... that might not be politically correct. He says it."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who planned to spend the day campaigning in New York before
returning to New Jersey for a fund-raiser in Bedminster, has a lot of catching
up to do in fund-raising in the Garden State. He raised $295,633 here in 1999,
including a $1,000 donation from New York Giants owner Wellington T. Mara. That
compares to nearly $1.5 million raised by Bush. McCain raised at least $150,000
Friday night at the $500-a-head fund-raiser at the Fiddlers Elbow Country Club
in Bedminster.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's state campaign director, lobbyist Tom Wilson, said more than 500
people attended the cocktail reception.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain reiterated his decision to pull negative ads, saying he wants to run
a campaign that his children can be proud of, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
	   He ended his 15-minute speech by telling of a New Hampshire woman who
grabbed his hand and told him it is vitally important that the next president
tell the truth. McCain told the crowd he might not always say what they want to
hear, but he always will tell the truth, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson acknowledged the senator had an uphill fight before New Jersey's June
6 primary, but said McCain's victory in the New Hampshire primary should
influence independent-minded New Jerseyans.
</P>
<P>
	   "Voters still have to vote and they're the ones who decide this," Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Endorsements by establishment figures are obviously good for raising
money," McCain said of the sparse support among his party's politicians here.
"But they really don't mean much when it really counts."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain reiterated his criticism of pork-barrel spending while defending his
opposition to about $17 million allocated in federal funding to rebuild New
Jersey beaches and $1.5 million to research cancer cases in Toms River.
</P>
<P>
	   "They may be virtuous projects, but they should go through the normal
legislative process," he said. "I'm not trying to get to the head of the line.
I'm not trying to seek special favors."

<HEADLINE> Bush Huddles With Football Coaches  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush made a surprise appearance at a
meeting of South Carolina high school football coaches Friday to ask for their
support in the states' upcoming Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not here recruiting for the University of Texas,'' joked the governor
of Texas. ``I'm here recruiting for your vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush told the more than 500 members of the South Carolina Football Coaches
Association that he believed the discipline and teamwork they taught players on
the field was a good example for the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This society of ours needs to usher in a responsibility era,'' Bush said
as he addressed the coaches in a conference room overlooking the football field
at the University of South Carolina. ``And we need to teach everybody that we're
responsible for the decisions we can make, and it starts with having responsible
leadership, and that starts with having coaches that the players can look up
to.''
</P>
<P>
	   The annual meeting is aimed at teaching the coaches new drills and
leadership skills. While surprised by Bush's sudden appearance at the end of a
long day of meetings, the coaches gave him a standing ovation, and many stayed
around to shake his hand and ask for his autograph afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's fantastic,'' said Bart Miller, the offensive line coach at
Lexington High School. ``I got to hear (University of South Carolina head coach)
Lou Holtz and George Bush in the same day. It's fantastic, two good men, both
quality leaders.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush won the Iowa caucuses, the leadoff voting in the 2000 presidential
campaign. But his 18-point loss in the Feb. 1 primary to Arizona Sen. John
McCain raised doubts about his ability to win the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Both McCain and Bush are aggressively courting South Carolina voters in
advance of their Feb. 19 GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush stopped by the coaches' meeting after attending a rally for U.S. Rep.
Floyd Spence, R-S.C., who is seeking re-election.

<HEADLINE> Police Dislodge Indian Protesters  </HEADLINE>
   By VIVIAN SEQUERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Police used tear gas Friday to dislodge Indians
blocking a rural highway to protest a U.S. oil company's plans to drill on lands
the tribe considers sacred.
</P>
<P>
	   Police, however, denied charges by the 8,000-member U'wa nation that three
children died when some of the demonstrators were chased into a river.
</P>
<P>
	   The accusations were likely to inflame passions in Colombia and abroad
around the planned drilling by Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   The U'wa fears the violence plaguing many oil producing regions in Colombia,
where leftist guerrillas bomb oil pipelines and the government stations troops
to protect them.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Alfonso Arellano, the national police operations director, said the
protest outside the U'wa reserve near the eastern border with Venezuela was
dispersed without incident by 150 riot police sent from the capital, Bogota.
</P>
<P>
	   If there were any dead, let them ``show us'' the bodies, Arellano said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement faxed to The Associated Press, the U'wa said three children
died and others were injured or missing after a group of 450 protesters
``threw'' themselves into a river to escape the police. The statement gave no
details on how the children died or their identities.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombia's government last September granted Occidental the right to conduct
exploratory drilling a few miles outside the legal boundaries of the U'wa
reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   International environmental and Indian rights group are championing the U'wa
cause, which gained world attention in 1997 when the group threatened mass
suicide to discourage drilling.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. activists recently demanded that Vice President Al Gore sell stock in
Occidental he inherited from his father.

<HEADLINE> More Jets Found With Tail Problems  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW FORDAHL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At least three more jetliners were found Friday with the
same tail wing problem that has become the focus of the investigation into last
week's crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of six aircraft, including the plane that crashed Jan. 31, had
unusual metal shavings in their tail wing assemblies, the National
Transportation Safety Board said.
</P>
<P>
	   The planes grounded Friday belong to Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines,
the NTSB said. A day earlier, Alaska found two other jets with the same flaws,
prompting the Federal Aviation Administration to order the inspection of all
MD-80 and similar aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   FAA officials declined to comment on the NTSB's announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have initial, unconfirmed reports that we need to verify before we
release any information,'' said Paul Takemoto, an agency spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation into the Jan. 31 crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 is
focusing on the horizontal stabilizer because the pilots reported trouble
controlling the device before the MD-83 plunged into the Pacific. All 88 people
aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ventura County Medical Examiner's office has identified the remains of
35 of the passengers, a spokeswoman said Friday. The office has not received any
new remains since Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy reported it recovered significant pieces of wreckage from the ocean
Friday. Among them were large portions of the plane's left and right elevators,
which are part of the horizontal stabilizer system. Also found was an 8-foot
section of the plane's outboard right stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA's inspection order affects about 1,200 planes, including MD-80s,
MD-90s, Boeing 717s and DC-9s. The first part of the inspections must be
completed by Monday, but the FAA is giving airlines 30 days to perform a more
detailed check.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines confirmed it pulled a third plane from service due to a
mechanical problem discovered during an inspection in Portland, Ore., but the
carrier would not disclose whether the problem was related to metal shavings.
</P>
<P>
	   Delta Air Lines mechanics found two MD-90s with a gritty residue below the
horizontal stabilizer and took the aircraft out of service at least until
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're continuing to look at the planes and analyzing the residue, but we
strongly suspect we'll have these planes back in service tomorrow,'' said Clay
McConnell, a Delta spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Several other airlines reported finding irregularities during the
inspections.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental Airlines said a quarter-inch metal shaving was found in the tail
wing mechanism of an out-of-service MD-80 undergoing scheduled maintenance. The
problem was reported to the FAA, but all other inspections were uneventful, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest Airlines pulled a DC-9 from service after unspecified
irregularities were found in the tail wing assembly. The section was removed for
further analysis and the plane was expected to fly again Saturday, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   American Airlines mechanics in Reno, Nev., discovered an MD-90's tail wing
assembly needed lubrication, but there was no evidence of unusual wear, said
spokesman John Hotard.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines canceled a dozen flights Friday as it repeated inspections
made before the FAA issued its order, said spokesman Jack Evans. Other airlines
reported no major schedule disruptions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're talking a dozen flights out of 500 or so we launch daily so overall
impact is still very small,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators probing the crash of Alaska Flight 261 are focusing on a part
that moves the stabilizer, a 40-foot tail-mounted wing that controls the
up-and-down pitch of the aircraft's nose during flight.
</P>
<P>
	   A 2-foot-long, rod-like jackscrew that drives the stabilizer was recovered
and found to be entwined with metal shavings believed to have come from an
8-inch gimbal nut that was later retrieved from the Pacific and found to have
damaged threads.
</P>
<P>
	   It remained unclear whether the damage occurred before the crash or was the
result of the plane's impact with the ocean. Metal experts were examining the
pieces.
</P>
<P>
	   An Associated Press review of maintenance records from 1990 through 1999
found no reports of stripped gimbal nuts in the jetliners covered in the order.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspections have prompted varying reactions from the flying public, with
some people saying they are avoiding MD-80s series planes until the situation is
resolved, while others have expressed few concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Applebaum, 52, of Los Angeles said he had no qualms shortly before he
boarded an Alaska Airlines flight to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They won't let them get off the ground if there's a problem,'' he said.
``It's safer to fly than it is to drive a car, especially in L.A.''

<HEADLINE> Millstone 2 nuclear plant shut down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WATERFORD, Conn. (AP) - The Millstone Two nuclear power plant was shut
down Friday after two control rods slipped out of position and fell into the
core of the nuclear reactor.
<P>
	   No one was injured, and the incident at about 1:45 p.m. caused no release of
radiation to the public, plant spokeswoman Sandra Bazinet said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was monitoring the plant. An agency
spokesman said a similar problem involving one of the same rods shut the plant
down in September.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not a common occurrence, but it does happen," said NRC spokesman Neil
Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
	   The control rods are part of a bundle of 73 rods that are suspended over the
core. The rods are used to control and stop a nuclear reaction.
</P>
<P>
	   Usually, the whole bundle of rods is released into the core together.
</P>
<P>
	   While workers were performing routine tests of the rods, where the rods are
moved slightly in and out, one rod slipped out of position and fell into the
core, Bazinet said.
</P>
<P>
	   Workers immediately reduced the plant's power output and were investigating
what caused the rod to slip when another rod fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, the workers immediately shut the plant down manually, Bazinet said,
and all the rods were moved into the core.
</P>
<P>
	   "At that point, two rods are going to have an effect on how power is
generated. The safest thing is to shut down the plant and see what's happening,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the shutdown, the plant maintained normal temperature and pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   The plant will remain shut down until the cause of the incident is
determined. The incident had nothing to do with the cause for the shutdown of
the plant in late January, Bazinet said.
</P>
<P>
	   In that incident, the plant was idled after the system that supplies water
to generate electricity in the plant malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, one rod fell into the core of Millstone 2. The plant was shut
down and the problem was fixed, Bazinet said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheehan said the September incident was caused by an electrical ground in
the wire that holds the rod in place when it is not in the core. The ground was
corrected and no other grounds were found, but one of the rods that fell Friday
was the same rod that fell in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheehan said the plant needed to be shut down because having two rods in the
core could cause an imbalanced reaction.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything seems to have worked as it was supposed to once they began to
shut it down," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-nuclear groups used the incident to renew their call for the plant to
be shut down.
</P>
<P>
	   "Millstone Unit Two is the poster boy for an unreliable technology that
exposes the public to risk of grave harm on a daily basis,: said Joe Besade, a
member of the Connecticut Coalition Against Millstone. "It should not be allowed
to operate one more day."

<HEADLINE> McCain Gains Support; Still Trails  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain has about doubled his support among
Republicans since December, eating into a commanding lead by Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, according to two national polls released Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls from both CBS News and Fox News show McCain supported by nearly a
third of Republicans, with Bush slipping to slightly more than 50 percent. In
December, CBS found Bush led McCain 64-16, while Fox had the race at 65-14.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore continues to pull ahead from rival Bill Bradley, with about 64
percent of registered Democrats supporting the vice president, up from slightly
more than half of in December, according to CBS. Bradley, once supported by more
than a quarter of Democrats, has fallen to about 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other findings:
</P>
<P>
	   --In general election matchups, the CBS poll suggested Republicans would
beat Democrats in every combination. The closest races were with Gore being
defeated by Bush 47 percent to 43 percent and by McCain 44 percent to 42
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --For the favorable opinions of voters, the Fox poll found McCain gaining
and Bush falling back since December, leaving them about even. Twice as many
voters, about 32 percent, had unfavorable opinions of Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   --Fox found more than 10 percent said they had never heard of McCain,
compared with only 1 percent who didn't know Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   --In light of the recent endorsement of Bradley by Michael Jordan, the CBS
poll found that both blacks and whites chose Martin Luther King Jr. as the best
role model for today's black youth. Jordan came in third for both groups. While
King led among blacks with 14 percent, Jordan and Jesse Jackson had nearly as
much support.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS interviewed nearly 1,500 registered voters across the country and Fox
questioned 900 -- both polls have error margins of plus or minus 3 percentage
points. The Fox Republican results have an error margin of plus or minus 5.5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain may be gaining ground in the hearts of voters, but he has a long way
to go if he expects an avalanche of flowers and chocolates on Valentine's Day.
The Fox poll asked nearly 500 women which presidential candidate they would
choose as their valentine.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading the pack of potential presidential paramours, Gore was picked by
more than 1 in 5 women, but Bush was barely behind, with 19 percent choosing him
as their valentine-in-chief. With only 8 percent each, McCain and Bradley tied
for sixth place, trailing behind ``Are you kidding?''(17 percent), ``Not
sure''(15 percent) and ``Ugh!''(12 percent).

	   Hours after Luis Miquilena spoke, Chavez broke his silence on the conflict
and gave a nationally broadcast address in which he said he was ``pained'' by
the flurry of accusations among his supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The conflict is the first major feud among Chavez forces and threatens to
open a breach in his leftist Patriotic Pole coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Miquilena acknowledged to reporters that he recommended an insurance company
owned by his former business partner be considered for a contract with
Venezuela's political police. But he said he doesn't consider that to be
corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm corrupt because I recommended that an insurance company be included in
the bidding?'' Miquilena said. ``There's not a trace of a crime in making a call
to recommend.''
</P>
<P>
	   The accusations against him were leveled Thursday by Jesus Urdaneta, who as
a midlevel military officer helped Chavez lead a failed 1992 coup attempt and
who resigned recently as head of the political police after a conflict with
Chavez's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
	   During his comments, Chavez made an apparent effort to mend bridges with the
fellow coup leaders, saying he had recently invited two of them including
Urdaneta to join his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez also pledged full investigations into all the charges. ``I'm not
going to cover up anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last week, three of the former coup leaders have publicly criticized
Chavez, saying his self-proclaimed ``revolution'' aimed at cleaning up some of
the world's worst corruption is losing direction by selling out to the country's
corrupt oligarchy.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday Urdaneta presented to the national prosecutor what he said was
evidence of 46 cases of corruption committed during Chavez's first year in
office.

<HEADLINE> Judge: OK To Remove Life Support  </HEADLINE>
   By VICKIE CHACHERE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. PETERSBURG -- A judge on Friday granted a man's request to disconnect a
feeding tube that has been keeping his wife alive, despite claims by her parents
that she would not want life support removed.
</P>
<P>
	   Terri Schiavo, 36, lapsed into a coma 10 years ago. Her husband, Michael,
and others said she had declared before her illness that she would not have
wanted her life prolonged in such a condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge George Greer stayed the enforcement of his own ruling in order to
allow the woman's parents to appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Schiavo asked the court for permission to stop the feeding and
hydration efforts after doctors told him it was unlikely her condition would
improve.
</P>
<P>
	   In February 1990, Terri Schiavo collapsed after an inexplicable drop in
potassium brought on a heart attack; doctors said her brain was without oxygen
for five minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   She is now cared for at a local nursing home. Her husband visits her several
times a week, although he now is engaged to another woman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is happy for Terri,'' said George Felos, attorney for Michael Schiavo.
``This is what Terri wanted and her wishes have finally come through.''
</P>
<P>
	   Her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, told the judge that their daughter
responds when they visit her. And they argued there are other motives behind the
request: If widowed, Michael Schiavo stands to inherit $700,000 from a
malpractice settlement over his wife's condition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't even describe the emotions they are feeling,'' said Pamela
Campbell, the Schindler's attorney. ``She laughs, she cries, she looks at you.
If you came in and said, 'Hi Terri,' she'd look at you. You think in a
persistent vegetative state the person is asleep. Terri's not asleep.''
</P>
<P>
	   An attorney appointed by the court to give an impartial opinion also said
she should be kept alive, but Greer said the attorney's fact-gathering was
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
	   Greer concluded there is no evidence that Terri Schiavo will recover.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The medical evidence before this court conclusively establishes that she
has no hope of ever regaining consciousness and therefore capacity, and that
without a feeding tube she will die in seven to 14 days,'' he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Proposes More Same-Sex Rights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Gay and lesbian couples would have the same rights as
common-law heterosexual couples under changes to federal laws proposed Friday by
Canada's justice minister.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure, introduced by Justice Minister Anne McLellan, would alter 68
federal statutes, including the Pension Act and Income Tax Act, to provide
same-sex couples with increased benefits and obligations.
</P>
<P>
	   While the proposal avoided the issue of equating same-sex marriages with
heterosexual marriages, gay and lesbian advocates praised the proposal for
aiming to give same-sex couples recognition under the law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It all boils down to the right to have the same respect, the same
accountability and the same responsibility as any heterosexually based family
unit,'' said Patricia Maguire, 34, who lives with partner Marion Steele.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes, which require approval by Parliament, would allow same-sex
couples to claim their partners as dependents on income tax returns and collect
survivor benefits under the Canada Pension Plan if one partner dies.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK, N.Y. (AP) -- Rookie Jan Hlavac scored a career-high three goals
Friday night in the New York Rangers' 5-2 victory over the Boston Bruins.
</P>
<P>
	   Hlavac scored his last two 50 seconds apart in the third period as the
Rangers extended their eighth-place lead over the Bruins in the Eastern
Conference to four points.
</P>
<P>
	   Valeri Kamensky and Kim Johnsson also scored for New York, which had goalie
Mike Richter and left wing Adam Graves back in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
	   Richter, who stopped 22 shots, missed the last two games with a sprained
left knee, and Graves missed the last two because of the death of his son. Jaxon
Graves, born prematurely on Jan. 14 along with brother Logan, died Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
	   During a play stoppage with 8:27 left in the second period, an announcement
was made about Graves doing a charity signing and the crowd of 18,200 gave him a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
	   Ray Bourque and Andre Savage scored for the Bruins, who failed for the
second time in 13 games to earn a point.
</P>
<P>
	   Bourque opened the scoring at 2:01 of the first on a 10-foot back-hander
from the right side that slipped under the crossbar on the short side. The goal
gave Bourque 1,500 career points. Bourque is ninth on the NHL's career scoring
list with 393 goals and 1,107 assists.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rangers tied it at 14:12 when Alexandre Daigle, standing in the outer
left circle, fed a perfect cross-ice pass to Kamensky, who was cutting toward
the net. Kamensky tapped in the puck for his eighth goal of the season, and
first of his career against the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
	   Hlavac capitalized on Bourque's unforced turnover to put the Rangers ahead
2-1 at 17:17 on the power play. Bourque tried a weak clearing attempt, but it
was picked off by Petr Nedved. Nedved's shot hit the right post, the rebound
bounced to Hlavac at the left side, and he converted an easy tap in.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rangers took a 3-1 lead 80 seconds later when Johnsson beat Byron Dafoe
with a wrist shot from the left circle.
</P>
<P>
	   Savage beat Richter to the short side with a left circle slap shot at 16:25
of the second to get Boston to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
	   Hlavac gave New York some breathing room at 9:22 when Radek Dvorak drew a
delayed penalty by stick-handling past three Bruins players. On his stomach,
Dvorak passed to Hlavac, who one-timed the puck past Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
	   Hlavac completed the hat trick at 10:12 when he beat Dafoe on a rebound off
his own shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Dafoe made 30 saves for the Bruins.

<HEADLINE> Sharks 3, Thrashers 0  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Steve Shields, who has struggled since Mike Vernon was
traded by San Jose, stopped 25 shots for his third shutout of the season as the
Sharks blanked the Atlanta Thrashers 3-0 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The expansion Thrashers have lost four in a row and stretched their
season-long winless streak to 12 games (0-10-2). Atlanta has gone nearly a month
since its last victory, a 1-0 decision over Philadelphia on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephane Matteau and Patrick Marleau scored before the game was seven
minutes old, both taking advantage of mistakes by Thrashers goaltender Scott
Fankhouser. Owen Nolan added an open-netter with 1:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Shields is only 5-9-2 since the Sharks dealt Vernon, a two-time Stanley Cup
winner, to the Florida Panthers in a three-team deal Dec. 30. But Shields was
perfect against the low-scoring Thrashers, making several nice stops in the
opening period.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta endured its eighth shutout loss and remained tied with Montreal for
fewest goals in the league, 117.
</P>
<P>
	   Matteau scored at 1:08 of the first period, before many in the
standing-room-only crowd of 18,681 -- largest in Thrashers history -- had
reached their seats.
</P>
<P>
	   Fankhouser got things started by giving up a rebound right in front of the
net off a bad-angle shot from Todd Harvey. The Atlanta goalie then made a nice
save on Matteau's follow-up, but that rebound deflected off Atlanta's Denny
Lambert and into the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Marleau scored at 6:37 after Fankhouser went behind the net to stop the
puck, then inexplicably gave it up to San Jose's Alexander Korolyuk stationed in
the corner. Korolyuk fired a quick pass to Marleau, who scored on a high shot as
Fankhouser scrambled back into the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Fankhouser was solid the rest of the way, making 23 saves in all, but the
Thrashers' poor offense leaves little room for error. Atlanta was 0-for-6 on the
power play and hardly mustered a decent scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to bolster their offense, the Thrashers completed a four-player
deal with Calgary to acquire forward Hnat Domenichelli. He arrived in the middle
of the game and is expected to suit up for Saturday night's contest against
Chicago.

<TEXT>
<P>
    PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Todd Marchant and Roman Hamrlik scored in the third
period as the Edmonton Oilers rallied to a 2-2 tie with the Pittsburgh Penguins
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Straka tied a team record by scoring twice in seven seconds in the
first period for Pittsburgh, which had its four-game winning streak stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   Edmonton, which had a three-game winning streak ended, has gone to overtime
an NHL-high 23 times, including five of the last 10. The Oilers are 2-7-14 in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   The game turned when the Penguins lost starting goalie Jean-Sebastien Aubin
at 2:29 of the third period. He was struck in the chin by Ethan Moreau's
shoulder after making a save and had to be helped from the ice. Aubin stopped
all 14 shots he faced.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Barrasso, who replaced Aubin, was beaten on a short-handed 2-on-1.
Marchant scored off Mike Grier's pass at 5:09 for Edmonton's eighth short-handed
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oilers tied it on a power play at 11:54 of the third when Doug Weight
beat Robert Lang cleanly on a faceoff and Hamrlik rifled a shot past Barrasso
from the left point.
</P>
<P>
	   Straka scored his first goal at 4:20 of the first. He held the puck and had
the open net when Edmonton goalie Tommy Salo was knocked off his skates by
teammate Tom Poti during a scramble in front.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins won the ensuing faceoff and Straka split the defense to beat
Salo on a breakaway at 4:28 for his 14th goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Straka tied Pittsburgh's record for fastest two goals by an individual. The
mark was set by Wally Boyer, who scored two in eight seconds at Detroit against
Roy Edwards on March 5, 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   Straka was three seconds off the NHL record. Nels Stewart of the Montreal
Maroons scored twice in five seconds on Jan. 3, 1931, and Winnipeg's Deron Quint
matched Stewart's mark on Dec. 15, 1995, against Edmonton.

<P>
    KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Jason York, Radek Bonk and Shawn McEachern scored in
a span of less than three minutes in the third period as the Ottawa Senators
rallied to beat the Florida Panthers 5-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senators erased a 3-2 deficit as York, Bonk and McEachern scored in a
span of 2:49. Daniel Alfredsson and Chris Phillips also scored, and Joe Juneau
added two assists in Ottawa's first game since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
	   Pavel Bure had a goal and an assist, and Lance Pitlick and Rob Niedermayer
also scored for the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
	   After Florida took a 3-2 lead on third-period goals by Niedermayer and Bure,
a bad line change by the Panthers allowed York to skate in alone and beat Mike
Vernon with a high wrist shot at 14:21 to start the Senators' comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonk's centering pass deflected off the skate of Pitlick at 16:32, and
McEachern added his 20th of the season at 17:10 as Ottawa won for just the third
time in their last 10 (3-4-3) to climb within six points of Toronto for the
Northeast Division lead.
</P>
<P>
	   After Alfredsson's goal at 17:47 of the first and Phillips' goal at 9:57 of
the second gave the Senators' a 2-0 lead, Pitlick scored at 10:58 to bring
Florida within one.
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Tugnutt made 21 saves for the Senators, while Vernon stopped 22 shots in
the loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida center Viktor Kozlov, who extended his point streak to four games,
has five assists in his last three.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa forward Rob Zamuner returned to the lineup after missing 20 games
with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Senators owner Rod Bryden extended his self-imposed
deadline to increase season ticket sales and keep the team in Ottawa. The new
deadline is Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryden had hoped by Friday to have the Senators sell 1,500 new season
tickets and have 90 percent of present holders renew their subscriptions for
next year.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Third in Short Program  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Imagine, at 19 years of age, needing to hold off a youth
wave. Michelle Kwan doesn't have to imagine it.
</P>
<P>
	That challenge became very real Friday night when into a very ordinary national
championships skated two extraordinary kids, Sasha Cohen and Sarah Hughes.
</P>
<P>
	Not only did their performances in the women's short program lift the level of
skating in what has been a lackluster U.S. Figure Skating Championships, but
they surely woke up Kwan, who was third.
</P>
<P>
	``I do see the future and it's incredible,'' Kwan said. ``I can see the great
potential and where we're sitting at world standards and how the U.S. looks
against the world.''
</P>
<P>
	It will look awesome if these youngsters keep this up. They really didn't
expect to surge ahead of Kwan so soon.
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't really believe I could beat her, she's just so great,'' said
Cohen, who is 15 but looks, oh, maybe 9.
</P>
<P>
	``That's quite right,'' chimed in veteran coach John Nicks after Cohen's
brilliant, innovative routine to music by Vivaldi and Albanini earned her first
place from five of the nine judges.
</P>
<P>
	``We all knew coming into this competition our wonderful champion Michelle, who
has been supreme and is still best in the world, would be challenged by the
youth of America. It's been a tradition the American ladies champion never rests
easy on the throne. She will be challenged in the next year or two years. But
(there is) nothing like Michelle, your consistency in performance, and all these
young skaters understand it.''
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, 14, took the ice directly after Cohen drew a standing ovation. While
she wasn't quite so energetic, Hughes was a winner with three judges for her
flowing program to ``Serenade for Klara.''
</P>
<P>
	``She was solid, she was confident, I couldn't have asked for much more,''
coach Robin Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
	``It's not always easy to skate after a standing ovation, but I am very pleased
with myself,'' Hughes added.
</P>
<P>
	Kwan admitted she was too confident, too comfortable, and it showed. The
three-time champion, a heavy favorite entering the event, fell on the simplest
triple jump, a toe loop. There also wasn't a lot of spark to her presentation,
although it hardly was as uninspired as what had been seen from the men, pairs
and most of the ice dancers this week.
</P>
<P>
	``I felt so at ease,'' the two-time world champion said. ``I think that I
didn't take my time and rushed right into it.''
</P>
<P>
	Was she surprised to fall, particularly on the toe loop, which she hasn't
missed in four years?
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah. I thought, `What am I doing on the ice?' I haven't fallen on that in
forever.''
</P>
<P>
	Kwan still can win by finishing first in Saturday night's free skate. But could
anyone expect the Olympic silver medalist to need a rally to win? She even
fooled her coach, Frank Carroll, who knows Kwan better than anybody.
</P>
<P>
	``I thought she was dead-on,'' Carroll said. ``I thought she was going to be
fabulous.
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked about the fact you can't lose concentration for one single
second. ... That's what a short program is all about, not losing
concentration.''
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in white and looking like a ballerina in a music box, Cohen was magical
from the beginning of her first significant senior event. Combining unusual
strength for someone so small (4-foot-9, 79 pounds), she displayed marvelous
flexibility. From her triple lutz-double toe combination to a series of
exquisite, difficult spirals to a perfect triple flip, she wowed the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	And the judges.
</P>
<P>
	``That's the best short program she's skated in three years,'' Nicks said.
</P>
<P>
	Hughes didn't miss a thing, either. Her combination spins were especially
strong, but the overall program wasn't quite equal to Cohen's.
</P>
<P>
	Hughes is eligible for next month's world championships because she did well
enough internationally last year to qualify. Cohen must finish in the top three
at junior worlds wget into the world championships -- provided she makes the top
three at nationals on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	The United States will have three skaters at worlds, in Nice, France. It's
unfathomable that Kwan would not be one of them, but she certainly can't rest on
her laurels in the free skate.
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to see them skate and see the potential of where we are,'' Kwan
said.
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman won their first pairs title together
and showed that the United States isn't lagging all that far behind the rest of
the world. Ina, the first woman in 25 years to capture pairs gold with two
partners -- she won in 1997 and '98 with Jason Dungjen -- and Zimmerman had the
look of a Russian couple, and the scores to match.
</P>
<P>
	Skating to ``Phantom of the Opera,'' they were first with eight judges in
beating Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn. Both pairs will go to the worlds.
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight is the zenith of it so far for us,'' Zimmerman said.

Computer Attacks Traced to Colleges

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A computer and an Internet device used by vandals as

The vandals used a desktop computer at the University of California at Santa
Barbara and an Internet router -- a device that can amplify data traffic -- from
Stanford University, officials at both schools acknowledged. There was no
indication that anyone at either university was directly involved. In these
attacks, called "distributed denials of service," hackers secretly install
software tools on dozens or hundreds of powerful but insecure computers.

that Russian forces have occupied for months, Russia's NTV television reported
Friday. Russian troops are trying to root out the rebels who remain in Grozny,
the Chechen capital. The international watchdog Human Rights Watch charges the

Friday of his release from 27 years in prison under the apartheid state by
opening a museum honoring his extraordinary life. Hundreds of villagers traveled
for hours by foot or on horseback through the rolling hills of Eastern Cape
province to catch a glimpse of the man who came from their ranks to become an
international icon. The museum is the latest in a string of accolades heaped
upon the man regarded as the principal architect of South Africa's transition to
democracy.

<HEADLINE> Baby Panda Makes Public Debut  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE WILLIAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The first giant panda born in the United States by
artificial insemination made her public debut Friday -- and the 5-month-old
slept right through it.
</P>
<P>
	   Since her birth in August, zoo officials have sheltered Hua Mei and her
mother, Bai Yun, from zoo visitors to ensure they would bond without
distraction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Daddy, I can't see it!'' cried 2 1/2-year-old Jacob Herstein, who was
among the thousands of visitors Friday at the reopened panda exhibit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to go up there,'' he said, pointing to the tree branch where Hua
Mei was napping, with only her hindquarters visible.
</P>
<P>
	   The cub is the first giant panda born in the United States by artificial
insemination and the first to survive past four days. Four others were born at
the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., but they all died.
</P>
<P>
	   Bai Yun and the cub's father, Shi Shi, arrived at the San Diego Zoo in 1996
on a 12-year research loan from their native China. Scientists hope research on
breeding of captive pandas can help sustain the population in the wild, which is
estimated to be about 1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Don Lindburg, leader of the zoo's panda team, said the staff has been
``humbled'' by watching a pinkish, four-ounce baby grow to a black-and-white,
22-pound bundle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She's a healthy, energetic cub,'' he said. ``There's a huge luck factor in
that.''

<HEADLINE> Officer dies after shooting inside police headquarters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GLASTONBURY, Conn. (AP) -A town police officer was fatally shot Friday
inside police headquarters.
<P>
	   Officer Thomas M. Gadarowski, 45, was the only person involved in the
shooting, said Sgt. Jay Kehoe, a police spokesman. Kehoe refused to say if
police were treating the incident as an accident or a suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   Gadarowski, who lived in Glastonbury, was a 17-year veteran of the
department. He had also served as a police officer in Portland, Kehoe said. He
had a wife and two daughters, ages 6 and 10.
</P>
<P>
	   "The entire department is mourning the loss of a fine police officer," Kehoe
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting occurred at about 3 p.m. in a nonpublic area of the department,
during a shift change. Gadarowski was just coming on duty.
</P>
<P>
	   Gadarowski was rushed by ambulance to Hartford Hospital with a police
escort. He died a short time later.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Police Major Crime Squad was called in to investigate the
shooting. An autopsy was scheduled for Saturday at the medical examiner's office
in Farmington.
</P>
<P>
	   Off-duty officers and several residents of this town of 29,000 congregated
at the police department Friday night in an effort to get more information.
Grief counselors were called in to help the department's 55 officers and 24
civilian employees deal with the loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Taylor, 17, stood outside the station with three other members of the
Glastonbury Police Explorers. He said he stopped by to see if he had worked with
the officer involved.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know most of the cops here," he said. "When something like this happens,
you don't know what to think."
</P>
<P>
	   Gadarowski received nine commendations for exemplary performance during his
years on the Glastonbury force. He also served with the Air National Guard's
103rd Fighter Wing in East Granby.
</P>
<P>
	   Funeral arrangements were incomplete Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Wiranto Said Resigning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Indonesian security minister Wiranto, accused of
responsibility for the violence in East Timor, will resign, President
Abdurrahman Wahid said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid, in Bangkok for a U.N. trade meeting, said he would meet with Wiranto
after his return to Indonesia Saturday night and expects him to resign within
two days.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid, who has been traveling outside Indonesia for about two weeks, first
called for Wiranto's resignation on Jan. 31 after an Indonesian government
investigation blamed the general for the mayhem in East Timor last year when the
territory voted to break away from Indonesia in a U.N.-supervised ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid said Wiranto had not resigned already because the two had not had a
chance to meet face to face.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can expect the day after tomorrow, the announcement of his
resignation,'' Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
	   Any agreement for Wiranto to step down is expected to provide a safe exit
for him, while establishing Wahid's authority over the once all-powerful
military.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid had asked the general to quit the Cabinet over the recent bloodshed
and devastation in East Timor. However, Wahid also recently suggested he might
pardon Wiranto if he were convicted of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a trade-off could protect Indonesia's fragile democracy after decades
of authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Wait till the president returns on Sunday and all will be resolved,''
Wiranto said in an interview published Friday in Singapore's Straits Times
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, has refused to budge
from his Cabinet position, sparking fears of a coup attempt by the country's
powerful military.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the interview, Wiranto said Indonesia's military is loyal to the
president and will not stage a coup.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It never crossed my mind to seize power,'' Wiranto was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   When Wahid's foreign trip ends, he will have visited 18 cities in 16 days.
He had wanted to recruit foreign investment for his country, the world's
fourth-most populous nation, after its worst economic crisis in a generation.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, his trip was dominated by Indonesian government and U.N. reports
that accuse Wiranto's troops of backing militia gangs that terrorized East Timor
after its people voted overwhelming to end Indonesian rule last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto, a four-star general, was military commander at the time, but denies
responsibility for the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid said repeatedly while visiting European and Asian capitals that if
Wiranto refused to quit, he would be fired. Back in Jakarta, Wiranto defiantly
took part in Cabinet meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   A showdown previously seemed inevitable. But in recent days, Wahid has
tempered his resignation demands by praising Wiranto as an honest soldier who
had once thwarted a plot to murder him.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid took office last October as its first freely elected president in 44
years. Since taking office, he has reined in the power of the military by
replacing Wiranto as armed forces commander and insisting that he and other
generals in the Cabinet become civilians.

Computer Attacks Traced to Colleges

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A computer and an Internet device used by vandals as

The vandals used a desktop computer at the University of California at Santa
Barbara and an Internet router -- a device that can amplify data traffic -- from
Stanford University, officials at both schools acknowledged. There was no
indication that anyone at either university was directly involved. In these
attacks, called "distributed denials of service," hackers secretly install
software tools on dozens or hundreds of powerful but insecure computers.

fighters are launching a guerrilla war throughout the republic, including areas
that Russian forces have occupied for months, Russia's NTV television reported
Friday. Russian troops are trying to root out the rebels who remain in Grozny,

   Daniel Egan
</P>
<P>
	   GARRISON, N.Y. (AP) -- The Rev. Daniel Egan, whose pioneering work with drug
addicts and alcoholics earned him the nickname ``junkie priest,'' died Thursday.
He was 84.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1959, when he helped interns at Bellevue Hospital find a usable vein on a
drug addict, one asked him, ``What are you, a junkie priest?'' The nickname was
adopted by police officers and it became the title of his biography.
</P>
<P>
	   Egan became a licensed counselor in drug addiction and in 1960 entered the
field of rehabilitation full-time. He became a member of the White House
Conference on Drugs and opened one of New York's first rehab centers, Village
Haven, in Greenwich Village in 1962. Egan later founded a center for addicted
teen-age girls and helped Mother Teresa open a home for addicts in India.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1970s, he started programs and clinics for the sick and poor in the
West Indies.
</P>
<P>
	   Most recently he was making weekly trips to say Mass at a Bronx nursing home
for people with AIDS.
James R. Jack
</P>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- James R. ``Bud'' Jack, athletic director at the
University of Utah and a member of the U.S. Olympic Committee, died Wednesday.
He was 81.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack joined the USOC in 1965, serving two four-year terms as the NCAA
committee representative.
</P>
<P>
	   He was chairman of transportation for four Olympics -- Sapporo and Munich in
1972; and Innsbruck and Montreal in 1976. He was appointed chief of the U.S.
mission for the 1980 Moscow Summer Games, which the United States eventually
boycotted.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack was instrumental in formation of the Western Athletic Conference in
1962 and served on several conference committees, including chairing the radio
and television committee, until his retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack served as president of the National Association of Collegiate Directors
of Athletics in 1971-72. He was inducted into the association's hall of fame in
1977. In 1984, he received the James J. Corbett Award, the association's highest
honor.
Lord Kitchener
</P>
<P>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- Lord Kitchener, who rose from a country boy
with no musical training to become the ``Grand Master'' of calypso in Trinidad
and Tobago, died Friday. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Born Aldwyn Roberts, Lord Kitchener was different from the time he sang in
his first calypso tent at the age of 15 for 12 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   In an era when calypsonians assumed powerful monikers like the Roaring Lion,
the Mighty Killer and Mighty Sparrow, he called himself Lord Kitchener after the
British army officer who successfully waged a military campaign to win back the
Sudan in 1898. With the theme of fighting and defending being central to the
calypso idiom, the persona seemed to fit.
</P>
<P>
	   He dominated the calypso world in the 1960s and 1970s with tunes such as
``Mama dis is Mas'' and ``Rainorama'' -- a comic look at the hysteria created
among his countrymen when Carnival was delayed in 1973 because of an outbreak of
polio.
</P>
<P>
	   He composed the first calypso played by a steelband orchestra. ``The Beat of
the Steelband,'' in 1944, and was closely associated with the steelband movement
afterward.

<P>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Ji Pengfei, a former Chinese deputy premier and
foreign minister and a veteran of the 1949 revolution, died Thursday in Beijing.
He was 91.
</P>
<P>
	   Ji also was secretary-general of China's Cabinet, ambassador to East Germany
and a member of the national legislature. In 1972, he headed China's delegation
to the Vietnam Conference in Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   Ji joined Mao Tse-tung's legendary 1934-35 Long March into northwestern
China to escape the Nationalists. He later became director of the medical
department of the Communist Party's military committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Ji began a new career as a diplomat after the 1949 Communist victory. He led
delegations to Britain, France, Iran and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   As deputy foreign minister in the late 1960s, Ji weathered attacks by the
Red Guards, ultraradical forces incited by Mao that terrorized China during the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   He became foreign minister in 1972, and later held a series of senior party
and government posts. He was appointed deputy premier in 1979 and cabinet
secretary-general in 1980, his last known official appointment.
Ronnie Robertson
</P>
<P>
	   IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- Ronnie Robertson, a silver medalist in figure skating
at the Olympics, world and national championships in 1956, died Feb. 4. He was
62.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson fell into a coma due to pneumonia earlier this month. He had a
history of heart and lung problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson finished second at the 1956 Olympics in Cortina, Italy, and at the
world championships in 1955 and '56. He was a three-time medalist at the U.S.
championships and skated in a variety of ice shows.
</P>
<P>
	   He also worked with Olympic champions Brian Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi
early in their careers.
Roger Vadim
</P>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- Roger Vadim, the film director who pursued beauty both in film
and in life, romancing some of the world's most sought-after actresses --
including Brigitte Bardot, Jane Fonda and Catherine Deneuve-- died Friday of
cancer. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
	   He counted Bardot and Fonda among his five wives, and had a child with
Deneuve, his companion between marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them was French siren Bardot, who won instant fame in the 1956 ``And
God Created Woman.''
</P>
<P>
	   The film defined the content and set the tone for many of Vadim's movies,
including the 1968 ``Barbarella,'' an avant-garde sci-fi romp starring his new
wife, Fonda.
</P>
<P>
	   Vadim cast 26 movies with leading ladies ranging from the elegant Deneuve to
earthy Angie Dickinson and intellectual Jeanne Moreau and Susan Sarandon. In
1988, he did a remake of ``And God Created Woman'' starring Rebecca DeMornay.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1975, he married Catherine Schneider with whom he had his fourth child,
Vania.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990 he wedded for the fifth time, marrying actress Marie-Christine
Barrault. They were still married when he died.
</P>
<P>
	   Vadim's other films include ``Les Bijoutiers du Clair de Lune'' (The Night
Heaven Fell) (1958), ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' (Dangerous Liaisons) (1959),
``Et Mourir de Plaisir'' (Blood and Roses) (1960) and ``The Hot Touch'' (1981).
Lenore Kight Wingard
</P>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Lenore Kight Wingard, who won medals for the U.S. Olympic
swimming team in 1932 and 1936 and continued swimming into her 80s, died
Wednesday. She was 88.
</P>
<P>
	   Her career included competing before Adolf Hitler in the 1936 Olympics in
Berlin. She won gold and silver medals in the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles and a
bronze in the 1936 Games.
</P>
<P>
	   One of her best-known races was one she lost by one-tenth of a second, the
400-meter freestyle event in the '32 Games. She matched world champion Helene
Madison stroke for stroke until Madison won with a world-record time of 5
minutes, 28.5 seconds. Wingard, then Lenore Kight, finished in 5:28.6, also
better than Madison's world record of 5:31.0. Because of the close finish,
judges took 15 minutes to declare a winner.

<HEADLINE> Judge: OK To Remove Life Support  </HEADLINE>
   By VICKIE CHACHERE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- A judge on Friday granted a man's request to
disconnect a feeding tube that has been keeping his wife alive, despite claims
by her parents that she would not want life support removed.
</P>
<P>
	   Terri Schiavo, 36, lapsed into a coma 10 years ago. Her husband, Michael,
and others said she had declared before her illness that she would not have
wanted her life prolonged in such a condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge George Greer stayed the enforcement of his own ruling in order to
allow the woman's parents to appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Schiavo asked the court for permission to stop the feeding and
hydration efforts after doctors told him it was unlikely her condition would
improve.
</P>
<P>
	   In February 1990, Terri Schiavo collapsed after an inexplicable drop in
potassium brought on a heart attack; doctors said her brain was without oxygen
for five minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   She is now cared for at a local nursing home. Her husband visits her several
times a week, although he now is engaged to another woman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is happy for Terri,'' said George Felos, attorney for Michael Schiavo.
``This is what Terri wanted and her wishes have finally come through.''
</P>
<P>
	   Her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, told the judge that their daughter
responds when they visit her. And they argued there are other motives behind the
request: If widowed, Michael Schiavo stands to inherit $700,000 from a
malpractice settlement over his wife's condition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't even describe the emotions they are feeling,'' said Pamela
Campbell, the Schindler's attorney. ``She laughs, she cries, she looks at you.
If you came in and said, 'Hi Terri,' she'd look at you. You think in a
persistent vegetative state the person is asleep. Terri's not asleep.''
</P>
<P>
	   An attorney appointed by the court to give an impartial opinion also said
she should be kept alive, but Greer said the attorney's fact-gathering was
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
	   Greer concluded there is no evidence that Terri Schiavo will recover.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The medical evidence before this court conclusively establishes that she
has no hope of ever regaining consciousness and therefore capacity, and that
without a feeding tube she will die in seven to 14 days,'' he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Sharks 3, Thrashers 0  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Steve Shields, who has struggled since Mike Vernon was
traded by San Jose, stopped 24 shots for his third shutout of the season as the
Sharks blanked the Atlanta Thrashers 3-0 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The expansion Thrashers have lost four in a row and stretched their
season-long winless streak to 12 games (0-10-2). Atlanta has gone nearly a month
since its last victory, a 1-0 decision over Philadelphia on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephane Matteau and Patrick Marleau scored before the game was seven
minutes old, both taking advantage of mistakes by Thrashers goaltender Scott
Fankhouser. Owen Nolan added an open-netter with 1:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Shields is only 5-9-2 since the Sharks dealt Vernon, a two-time Stanley Cup
winner, to the Florida Panthers in a three-team deal Dec. 30. But Shields was
perfect against the low-scoring Thrashers, making several nice stops in the
opening period.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta endured its eighth shutout loss and remained tied with Montreal for
fewest goals in the league, 117.
</P>
<P>
	   Matteau scored at 1:08 of the first period, before many in the
standing-room-only crowd of 18,681 -- largest in Thrashers history -- had
reached their seats.
</P>
<P>
	   Fankhouser got things started by giving up a rebound right in front of the
net off a bad-angle shot from Todd Harvey. The Atlanta goalie then made a nice
save on Matteau's follow-up, but that rebound deflected off Atlanta's Denny
Lambert and into the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Marleau scored at 6:37 after Fankhouser went behind the net to stop the
puck, but lost control. San Jose's Alexander Korolyuk fired a shot that
deflected off Fankhouser and went to Marleau in front of the net. He buried a
high shot as the Atlanta goalie scrambled back into position.
</P>
<P>
	   Fankhouser was solid the rest of the way, making 23 saves in all, but the
Thrashers' poor offense leaves little room for error. Atlanta was 0-for-5 on the
power play and hardly mustered a decent scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to bolster their offense, the Thrashers completed a four-player
deal with Calgary to acquire forward Hnat Domenichelli. He arrived in the middle
of the game and is expected to suit up for Saturday night's contest against
Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Utah AD Bud Jack Dies at 81  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- James R. "Bud" Jack, athletic director at Utah from
1958-76 and a member of the U.S. Olympic Committee from 1965-81, has died at 81.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack died Wednesday of causes related to age and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack, a graduate of Granite High School and the University of Utah in 1938,
ushered in a women's collegiate athletic program at the university in 1975. He
also was instrumental in planning and raising money for the Special Events
Center, now the Huntsman Center, dedicated in 1969.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack joined the USOC in 1965, serving two four-year terms as the NCAA
committee representative.
</P>
<P>
	   He was chairman of transportation for four Olympics -- Sapporo and Munich in
1972 and Innsbruck and Montreal in 1976. He was appointed chief of the U.S.
Mission for the 1980 Moscow Summer Games, which the United States eventually
boycotted.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack also was chairman of transportation for the Pan Am Games in 1971 and
1975 and chairman of food and housing for the World University Games in 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack devoted almost three decades to Utah athletics. He was athletics ticket
and business manager from 1948-52 and assistant athletic director under Jack
Curtice from 1952-58.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack was instrumental in formation of the Western Athletic Conference in
1962 and was on several conference committees, including chairing the radio and
television committee, until his retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack was president of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of
Athletics in 1971-72. He was inducted into the association's hall of fame in
1977. In 1984, he received the James J. Corbett Award, the association's highest
honor.
</P>
<P>
	   He was inducted into the Utah Sports Foundation Hall of Fame in 1983 and
Utah's Crimson Club Hall of Fame in 1988. In 1990, he received an Emeritus
Alumni Association Merit of Honor from his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack, born May 6, 1918, was married to Ila Coon Jack for 48 years. She died
in 1993. He is survived by daughters Mrs. Mickey (Sharee) Gallivan and Wendy
Jack-Alvarado, and three grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Ina-Zimmerman Win U.S. Pairs  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Kyoko Ina grinned and gave a thumbs up as she and John
Zimmerman skated over to a fan holding a sign that read, ``Kyoko and John, Go
for the Gold.''
</P>
<P>
	Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
	In just their second season, Ina and Zimmerman showed a passion, unity and
beauty usually reserved for couples together far longer as they won their first
pairs title Friday night in the U.S. Figure Skating Championships.
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first really great one that we've had,'' Ina said. ``And the
months of work finally showed.''
</P>
<P>
	It is Ina's third title; she won the first two (1997-98) with Jason Dungjen.
She is the first female pairs skater to win titles with different partners since
Melissa Militano, who won with her brother, Mark, in 1973 and Johnny Johns in
1974 and '75.
</P>
<P>
	Skating to ``Phantom of the Opera,'' Ina and Zimmerman also made the crowd
forget -- if only for 4 1/2 minutes -- the desperate state of American pairs.
While almost everyone else crashed and bobbled their way around the ice, Ina and
Zimmerman seemed to float.
</P>
<P>
	They made difficult lifts look easy, with Zimmerman carrying Ina as if she were
a feather. Their twists were huge, with Ina soaring high above the ice yet
coming back down with the lightest of landings. Their jumps were grand and their
spins graceful.
</P>
<P>
	Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn, who finished second, were the only others to
make it through their program relatively cleanly, though she stepped out of
their throw triple salchow. They also had a small bobble on the landing of their
split triple twist.
</P>
<P>
	Tiffany and Johnnie Stiegler, in third place after the short program, were
simply disastrous and dropped to fifth. Larisa Spielberg and Craig Joeright had
a few problems, such as his stepping out of a double axel, but they attacked
their program with gusto and speed.
</P>
<P>
	Still, they had to wait for the Stieglers to skate to see if they'd finish
third.
</P>
<P>
	``That's more nervewracking than skating itself,'' Spielberg said.
</P>
<P>
	Though Ina and Zimmerman have been skating pairs for years, they didn't get
together until last season. They arrived for last year's nationals after only a
few months of training, and their unfamiliarity was glaringly evident. Though
they had the tricks, they were lacking that spark that makes pairs so beautiful.
</P>
<P>
	Not this year. Dressed in creamy gold costumes, they skated together as if they
knew each other's every move. Their side-by-side combination spins were so in
synch they looked like they were being pulled by the same thread.
</P>
<P>
	The slow middle section of their program was filled with romantic dance moves,
accented by a perfect throw triple loop jump. When she landed the loop -- which
has given her problems in the past -- Ina's face lit up.
</P>
<P>
	``After the loop, I was like, `Stay calm and stay connected somehow,''' she
said. ``Everyone always accused me of being too athletic and John not being too
artistic. But tonight we jelled.''
</P>
<P>
	As their music came to an end, the crowd rose to its feet and Zimmerman punched
his left fist in the air. Then he hugged her, holding her for several seconds as
they were showered with flowers and stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight,'' Zimmerman said, ``is the zenith of it so far for us.''

    PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- The Princeton women's basketball team was involved
in a traffic accident on the way to New Hampshire for a Friday night game
against Dartmouth. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The team's bus was traveling on I-95 in Connecticut on Thursday night when a
car and an 18-wheel truck bumped, sending the car in front of another 18-wheeler
that was in front of the bus. That truck slowed and the Princeton bus collided
with it.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was pretty scary right when it happened, but it was over pretty
quickly," said Jennifer Garrett of Princeton's Office of Athletic
Communications, who was on the bus. "After that, everybody was a little shaken
but pretty much OK."
</P>
<P>
	   The front end of the bus was tangled with the truck and the team waited
several hours for the vehicles to be separated. A replacement bus was sent from
New Jersey and the team arrived at their hotel in Hanover, N.H., at 7:15 a.m.
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Primary Winner Vows To Heal Wounds  </HEADLINE>
   By ROSY RAMALES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) -- The man who won Mexico's first full-scale
presidential primary said Friday that divisions from that bitter election still
linger and vowed to heal the wounds during his campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am going to meet with (party members) so that the differences that have
remained'' can be narrowed, Francisco Labastida said in a radio broadcast here.
</P>
<P>
	   Labastida, a former interior secretary, won a Nov. 7 primary election for
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, defeating former Tabasco state Gov.
Roberto Madrazo after a bitter campaign in which Madrazo repeatedly called
Labastida ``a total failure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Madrazo later endorsed Labastida, who is favored in polls ahead of the July
2 election. But some bitterness remains among members of the party, known as the
PRI, which had been unaccustomed to public squabbling during its 71 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
	   During a rally before 8,000 supporters in the main plaza of this southern
Mexican state capital, Labastida repeated his call for ``all fractions of the
party'' to unite. He also promised to work as president to spread development to
Mexico's poor south as well as to the more-developed north.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a Mexico City court fined Labastida and city mayoral hopeful
Jesus Silva Herzog $41 for defacing a public building in the Iztapalapa
neighborhood on the southeast side of the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The court cited press photos Tuesday showing Labastida and Silva, spray
paint in hand, writing ``Vote for Pancho'' and ``Vote for Chucho'' -- their
nicknames -- on a wall of the Renovacion sports club.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates did not appear in court, and eluded reporters seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The writing on the wall was painted over by party workers Wednesday, the
daily Reforma newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> South Elects Black Episcopal Bishop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Episcopalians in central North Carolina on Friday
made their diocese the first in the South to elect a black bishop when they
chose a Baltimore minister to lead their 33,000 members.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Michael Curry was elected from among six candidates at the annual
convention of the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina. He will be installed June
17, replacing the Rt. Rev. Robert Johnson Jr., who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
	   About 40 of the 500 delegates were black.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is both a joyous and a humbling experience,'' Curry said. ``I'm very
grateful and very thankful, and really looking forward to being part of the life
of the church in North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   In North Carolina, Curry will oversee 250 pastors, confirm new members and
participate in a rulemaking body within the national denomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Blacks have served in Southern dioceses as suffragan bishops, essentially
assistant bishops, but never as bishop.
</P>
<P>
	   There is tension in the national denomination over ordaining gay clergy and
sanctioning same-sex ceremonies, and the church will debate at its convention
this summer whether to officially establish the ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
	   Curry, who has led the St. James Church in Baltimore for 11 years, is
considered moderate to liberal.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Wiranto Said Resigning  </HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK MCDOWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Indonesian Security Minister Wiranto, accused of
allowing pro-Indonesia militias to devastate East Timor, will resign next week,
the country's president said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   President Abdurrahman Wahid, in Bangkok for a U.N. trade meeting, said he
would meet with Wiranto after his return to Indonesia Saturday night and expects
him to resign within two days.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid, who has been traveling outside Indonesia for about two weeks, first
called for Wiranto's resignation on Jan. 31 after an Indonesian government
investigation blamed the general for the mayhem in East Timor last year when the
territory voted to break away from Indonesia in a U.N.-supervised ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, has refused to budge
from his Cabinet position, sparking fears of a coup attempt by the country's
powerful military.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid said Wiranto had not resigned already because the two had not had a
chance to meet face to face.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can expect the day after tomorrow, the announcement of his
resignation,'' Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
	   Any agreement for Wiranto to step down is expected to provide a safe exit
for him, while establishing Wahid's authority over the once all-powerful
military.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid had asked the general to quit the Cabinet over the recent bloodshed
and devastation in East Timor. However, Wahid also recently suggested he might
pardon Wiranto if he were convicted of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a trade-off could protect Indonesia's fragile democracy after decades
of authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why he believed Wiranto would resign, Wahid said: ``Because of his
sense of patriotism, his sense of loyalty to the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid said he understood that Wiranto was concerned that he would have to
face questions in a court, and that his resignation might be seen as an
acknowledgement of guilt.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said it would be better for Indonesia if Wiranto steps down because
it would be sign that the country is serious about democratic reforms and
restoring stability.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His resignation will be seen by other countries as a sign we are serious,
that you can invest in Indonesia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto has continued to attend Cabinet meetings despite Wahid's calls for
him to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   But in an interview published Friday in Singapore's Straits Times newspaper,
Wiranto said Indonesia's military is loyal to the president and will not stage a
coup.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It never crossed my mind to seize power,'' Wiranto was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   When Wahid's foreign trip ends, he will have visited 18 cities in 16 days.
He had wanted to recruit foreign investment for his country, the world's
fourth-most populous nation, after its worst economic crisis in a generation.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, his trip was dominated by Indonesian government and U.N. reports
that accuse Wiranto's troops of backing militia gangs that terrorized East Timor
after its people voted overwhelming to end Indonesian rule last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto was military commander at the time, but denies responsibility for
the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid said repeatedly while visiting European and Asian capitals that if
Wiranto refused to quit, he would be fired. Back in Jakarta, Wiranto defiantly
took part in Cabinet meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   A showdown previously seemed inevitable. But in recent days, Wahid has
tempered his resignation demands by praising Wiranto as an honest soldier who
had once thwarted a plot to murder him.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid took office last October as its first freely elected president in 44
years. Since taking office, he has reined in the power of the military by
