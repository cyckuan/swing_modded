<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos on
Saturday issued a strong warning against political parties
planning to rig the results of next Monday's national elections,
saying that "no fraud or cheating from any side will be
tolerated."
</P>
<P>
"The Ramos administration is pledged to insure honest, orderly
and peaceful elections (HOPE)," said Ramos in a pre-election
statement.
</P>
<P>
Ramos directed all agencies and their personnel who have been
deputized by the Commission on Elections (Comelec), especially the
Armed Forces and the National Police, "to be strictly correct and
fair in performing their election duties."
</P>
<P>
"As president, I myself will see to it that such HOPE, which we
all share, is fulfilled, and that no fraud or cheating from any
side will be tolerated," Ramos stressed.
</P>
<P>
As he warned the poll cheaters, Ramos exhorted the electorate
to exercise their sovereign right to elect their next group of
political leaders freely, democratically and intelligently.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the citizenry to be vigilant on the day of voting
and the counting of votes to make sure that the electoral process
will be free of fraud and highly acceptable to the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, some 34 million registered Filipino voters will go
to the polls to vote a new president, as well as a new vice
president, 12 out of 24 senators, all 255 members of the House of
Representatives and thousands of local government officials.

<HEADLINE> Movie Whitewashing Japan's Aggression be Shown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A controversial Japanese film called
"Pride -- the Fatal Moment", which depicts Japan's aggression to
neighboring nations during World War Two as self-defending and
just, will be put on show later this month.
</P>
<P>
The film deals with the trial and last days of General Hideki
Tojo, Japan's wartime prime minister, who was executed as a war
criminal by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East
in November 1948.
</P>
<P>
Distorting historical facts, the movie portrays the
Asia-Pacific War Japan launched in early 1940s as the liberation
of Asian nations from the colonialism of European countries and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
It also depicts charges against Japanese troops of war crimes
as almost frame-ups with hearsay evidence and overstatement,
including the Nanjing Massacre in which about 300,000 people were
slaughtered by the Japanese army in the capital of China's Jiangsu
province in December 1937.
</P>
<P>
The movie reflects an opinion called the "historical view of
liberalism" which denies Japan's invasion of its neighbors on the
grounds that Japan would lose pride if it acknowledged the
aggression.
</P>
<P>
Isao Nakamura, president of Higashi-Nihon House Co. Ltd, the
main investor in the project, is a big supporter of the opinion.
</P>
<P>
The film, however, has come under attack from many Japanese
since previews were given last month.
</P>
<P>
A "Society to Criticize Pride -- the Fatal Movement", which was
set up on April 20, blasted the production, claiming that it
distorted history and betrayed the Japanese people's willingness
for peace.
</P>
<P>
"We can not keep silent over the movie as it has great
potential to influence to the public especially the young," the
society said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
China expressed outrage Saturday at the movie with Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao saying that making such a
film "is bound to be strongly condemned by people who face up to
history and love peace".
</P>
<P>
"Hideki Tojo was the chief criminal of the aggressive war. We
feel shocked and indignant over the fact that some people in Japan
produced such a movie to whitewash aggression and sing the praises
of Hideki Tojo." he said.

<HEADLINE> Paraguayan Campos of Beijing Guo'an Heads For World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Paraguayan international striker
Jorge Luis Campos of Beijing Guo'an became the first ever player
from the Chinese professional league to play the World Cup in
France this upcoming summer.
</P>
<P>
Campos has been selected in the 22-men Paraguay national squad
for the World Cup finals in June, which was announced on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Campos, last season's Player of the Year in China's first
division, would be the only player from the Chinese league in the
world primary soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
China did not qualify for the finals from the Asian zone.
</P>
<P>
Campos is a good message from the Chinese league and Guo'an to
the worldwide soccer, a club official said on Saturday after he
was informed of the news.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zuwu, vice manager of the club, said: "It (selection of
Campos) would help the world get to know the Chinese soccer, as
well as Guo'an."
</P>
<P>
"Chinese soccer had not been known by the world until dozens of
foreign players flowed in," said Yang on a telephone interview of
Xinhua. "China soccer gets more contact with the soccer world
following more international games, which results in the
improvement of our abroad introduced players."
</P>
<P>
The Paraguay Football Association (PFA) previously asked the
Chinese club to release Campos for a series of World Cup warm-up
matches, the Kirin Cup tournament in Tokyo through May 17-21 and
friendlies against the Netherlands, Romania and Belgium in June on
tour in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Yand said: "We had planned to keep Campos for league matches
against Vanguards Huandao on May 17 and Dalian Wanda on May 31,
but it is hard to get a nod from the PFA."
</P>
<P>
Campos is now in Chengdu, capital of the Sichuan Province,
preparing for match against Sichuan Quanxing on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He will fly to Japan to join the national team for the Kirin
Cup.
</P>
<P>
Campos, who came to Guo'an in the 1997-98 season from
Paraguayan domestic league, has extended his contract with the
club through this season.
</P>
<P>
"Campos is to play another full season for us," Yang said. "But
I'm not sure weather he will stay here after than."

<HEADLINE> Russia Warns Against Force in Solving Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Igor Ivanov, Russian first deputy
foreign minister, warned Saturday that any attempt to solve the
Kosovo issue by force might trigger even more bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Russia would reject any attempt to exercise force or to impose
economic sanctions, the minister, who is in charge of European
affairs, said in an interview with the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Russia appealed to all sides involved for extreme caution
because any wrong step might seriously harm Europe's stability,
said Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that constructive pressure must be exerted to bring
the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, an autonomous province of
Yugoslavia, and Yugoslav leaders to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
However, the international community should not be directly
involved in the process of talks, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
There was no reason to lift the arms embargo against Yugoslavia
yet since the situation in Kosovo had not seen any active change,
he said.

HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean female minister
Saturday criticized the new policy in the education ministry to
allow pregnant students and teachers to continue with training.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State in the vice-president's office Tsungirirayi
Hungwe said she did not agree with the circular sent out by the
ministry this year.
</P>
<P>
The circular authorized female students to continue with their
training even if they became pregnant in the duration of their
courses.
</P>
<P>
''I believe we should do one thing at a time. There is no way
one can be a student and a mother at the same time,'' she said as
she officiated at the graduation ceremony for over 400 students
at Mutare Teachers College in east Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
She cautioned female trainee teachers to refrain from falling
pregnant while still at college saying this would adversely
affect their performance during their training.
</P>
<P>
She also lashed out at teachers who indulged in sexual
relationships with pupils and said such teachers had no place in
the profession.
</P>
<P>
''This, in my view, is the worst offense a teacher can commit
in the profession,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Veterans Demand More Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Despite almost five billion
Zimbabwean Dollars (about 300 million U.S. Dollars) awarded in
monthly pensions, Zimbabwean war veterans Saturday used their
national congress as a forum to demand more benefits.
</P>
<P>
Addressing over 800 delegates to the Third Congress of
Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association, Chenjerai
Hunzvi, chairman of the association said that the former
fighters' demands had not been fully met.
</P>
<P>
Affirmative action was needed for the ex-combatants in areas
such as housing, education, health and business, Hunzvi told the
congress held in Umzingwane District of west Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"The acute shortage of housing for ex-combatants is well
known. Since the ministry concerned with housing is now one with
local government, we expect affirmative action toward allocation
of housing stands to our members throughout the country," the
Zimbabwe News Agency quoted Hunzvi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the veteran association complained that
although many of them desire to start income generating projects
in various parts of the country, there has not been much
affirmative action from local authorities in allocation.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government, through its department of war
veterans' affairs, should implement the provisions of the war
veterans' act, and schemes on projects in health and education
should be concretized, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hunzvi urged the department to recruit personnel for its
provincial offices through the association while its members are
demanding that they should be allowed to select the minister to
run the department.
</P>
<P>
Now, there are over 50,000 former fighters registered in the
country. They held demonstrations last year demanding more
benefits.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Exports Wheat to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has officially begun
exporting wheat to neighboring Afghanistan, and the first
consignment of 10,000 tons of wheat has already been despatched to
that country.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Minister for Food and Agriculture Abdus
Sattar Lalika Saturday in Peshawar, capital of the North West
Frontier Province, at the inauguration ceremony of wheat
despatches to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by the two countries last year,
Pakistan will export a total of 600,000 tons of wheat to
Afghanistan per annum.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government wanted to promote trade with
neighboring countries, said Lalika, adding that "It is our moral
obligation to enhance trade relations with the war-torn country of
Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
He said that trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan would
benefit the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the opening of legal export of wheat to Afghanistan
would also put an end to the menace of smuggling of wheat and
flour to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Afghanistan possess tremendous potential of
boosting bilateral trade, said Lalika. The trade potential of the
two countries needs exploitation to the maximum level and for this
purpose the Pakistani government was evolving a transparent
mechanism for bilateral trade, the Minister added.

HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Saturday assured war veterans that the government is seeking ways
through which the ex-fighters can be awarded all their benefits
as promised in the war veterans act.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said this in a written speech read on his behalf at the
opening of the Third Congress of Zimbabwe National Liberation War
Veterans Association by minister of state responsible for war
veterans affairs Witness Mangwende.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, patron of the veterans association, was unable to
attend the congress as he is at present in Cairo, Egypt, for the
G-15 summit.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding benefits for war veterans who have each
received a lump sum of 50,000 Zimbabwean Dollars (about 3,000
U.S. Dollars) in gratitude and are getting a monthly pension of
2,000 Zimbabwean Dollars (117 U.S. Dollars) include free
education, medical care, funeral expenses and loan benefit
schemes.
</P>
<P>
"While the government is taking all measures to reduce the
expenditure, it is only fair that those who brought about our
independence should be given serious consideration," the Zimbabwe
News Agency quoted the president as saying in his speech.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also commended the association for forming the Zimbabwe
Ex-combatants Foundation Investment Fund, saying their collective
approach proved that they had organized themselves as a
formidable force for economic empowerment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, chairman of the veterans association Chenjerai
Hunzvi said the former fighters' demands have not been fully met.
They demand more benefits such as housing, education, health and
business.

LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright indicated here Saturday she remains hopeful Israel would
attend the Middle East peace talks due to be held in Washington
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing after a Group of Eight ministerial
meeting, Albright refused to rule out the possibility of Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attending the Washington talks.
</P>
<P>
"I have not yet taken no for an answer. I am not without hope,"
said Albright who failed to broker an agreement between Israeli
and Palestinian leaders at a London peace meeting early this week.
</P>
<P>
She noted that U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross, who is in
Jerusalem, would have another meeting Saturday night with
Netanyahu in a fresh effort to keep the peace talks on track.
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful. I think we'll have to wait and see how this
proceeds," she added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that an Israeli government spokesman said
Friday that Netanyahu would not attend the Washington talks as
there was no enough time for Israel to close gaps with Washington
over a U.S. peace plan by Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Former United States
Attorney-General Ramsey Clark Saturday blamed the United
Nations-imposed economic sanction on Iraq for causing sufferings
to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here, Clark described the sanction
as "an act of genocide against the Iraqi people," asserting that
its continuation contravenes the international norms and treaties.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "the time is ripe" to lift the "unjust"
sanction in an effort to end the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the embargo on Iraq in 1990
after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Clark, who heads an 82-member U.S. humanitarian and human
rights delegation, arrived here Friday evening. His delegation,
the largest U.S. delegation visiting Iraq ever since the 1991
Gulf War, sent Iraq 4 million U.S. dollars worth of medicine and
medical appliances donated by Americans.
</P>
<P>
Clark said that hundreds of thousands of Americans, including
those with Islamic centers and churches, have been joining efforts
to collect medicine from all over the U.S. for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
He praised highly the activities of humanitarian organizations,
churches and Islamic centers aimed at ending the "unjust" sanction
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Clark opposed the U.S.-led Gulf War, which kicked the Iraqi
troops out of Kuwait. He has visited Baghdad several times after
the war and met with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein every time.

<HEADLINE> G7 Initiative on Harmful Tax Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) - A major new initiative to tackle
harmful tax competition was agreed by G7 Finance Minister at a
meeting here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement paves the way for more international exchange of
tax information to curb international tax evasion and avoidance
through tax havens and preferential tax regimes.
</P>
<P>
It reinforces the recommendations of the OECD Report for
curbing harmful tax competition and the complementary EU Code of
Conduct on business taxation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also commits the G7 to leading international
action on tax related crime by gathering more intelligence through
money laundering systems and providing for it to be shared
internationally by tax authorities.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the initiative, Gordon Brown, British Chancellor of
the Exchequer, said: "Our agreement today represents a major
breakthrough in tackling the growing problems caused by harmful
tax competition, and the tax evasion and avoidance it generates."
</P>
<P>
"This initiative paves the way for co-ordinated international
action to allow information to be passed to tax authorities, so
that honest citizens and business do not have to pay the price of
the activities of tax fraudsters," he added.

<HEADLINE> GCC Higher Committee to Discuss Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Higher Committee of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) will start a two-day meeting in Doha,
Qatar, Sunday to discuss military cooperation among the six member
states.
</P>
<P>
The committee assigned to implement joint defense decisions and
military cooperation among the states will discuss issues
concerning the force of the Peninsula Shield and the
implementation of the communication and cooperation network among
them, the GCC Secretariat said in a statement in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 8,000-strong Peninsula Desert Shield force is a GCC joint
armed force based in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Major General Faleh Abdallah Al-Shatti, GCC Assistant
Secretary General for Military Affairs, has said that the force is
now ready to rush to the help of any member country that is
threatened.
</P>
<P>
A GCC plan to raise the Peninsula Shield troops from 8,000 to
25,000 and to establish a joint early warning system has been
carried out since last year.
</P>
<P>
As to the integrated network to link up the commands of the
six Gulf states, Al-Shatti said last week that the execution of
the network would start in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
He said the network, which costs over 150 million U.S. dollars,
was designed to facilitate communication among supreme commands of
the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
The GCC which was founded in 1982 as a regional political,
economic and military body, groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.
</P>
<P>
The member countries' final aim is to strengthen the
capability of the joint forces that requires purchase of new
compatible radar, missiles and automated communications, command
and control air defense systems.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shatti said the member states have agreed to increase the
number of troops and acquiring highly-advanced weapons, adding
that a new camp for this force would be built in Hafr El-Batin,
northwest of Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> WB to Help Angola Remove Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will offer Angola
five million U.S. Dollars in demining and reconstruction, Angolan
Minister of Social Relief and resettlement Albino Malungo has
said.
</P>
<P>
Malungo left for the United States on Friday night to discuss
with the World Bank officials about the final details of the aid,
the Angolan News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The assistance provided by the World Bank will help remove the
mines across the war-ravaged country, said the Angolan minister.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Angolan government will receive 20 million U.S.
Dollars donated by 20 U.S. entrepreneurs, part of which will be
used in the reconstruction of war-damaged cities, like Catabola
and Camacupa in the central Bie Province and Cazombo in the
southeastern Moxico Province.
</P>
<P>
These U.S. business leaders paid a visit to Angola last week
to assess the situation of the mines scattered in the country and
the progress of the demining process so that they could provide
aid needed to help get rid of all the mines by 2010.
</P>
<P>
During his seven-day visit to the U.S., Malungo will meet with
the U.S. Senators and entrepreneurs who initiated the campaign
for clearing lethal mines in the world and attend a supper in
honor of 300 advocates for demining from countries on earth.
</P>
<P>
Angola is among the countries hardest hit by mines, with about
11 million laid in nearly 30 years of anti-colonialist war and
the civil war, according to the statistics released by the
related department of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
So far, up to 70,000 people have been wounded by mines planted
in the fields and along the roads in Angola, which pose great
threat to people's life and production. And from time to time,
there are reports about casualties in mine explosions in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Jordan: Washington Meetings in Support of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has said the proposed
Washington meetings on Israeli-Palestinian peace will be in favor
of the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
The sponsors of the meetings, namely U.S. and European leaders,
will "have a unified stand that they support the Palestinian
side," said Acting Information Minister Nasir Lawzi after a weekly
cabinet meeting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time that the U.S. and the European
leadership agree on this issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is important that the Washington talks between the
Palestinians and the Israelis will be held as scheduled on May 11
and "No party has the right to unilaterally reject attending the
talks," he added.
</P>
<P>
The talks will have no new topics, but stick to discussion of
what the U.S. raised before, said Nasri.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, the U.S. proposed for Israel to evacuate
from 13.1 percent of the occupied Palestinian land, but Israel
rejected it. The U.S. then mediated the meetings between both
sides in London, but still failed to persuade Israeli to accept
its proposal.
</P>
<P>
Washington meetings are widely thought as a continuation of
the U.S. efforts after London meetings to push forward the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiation which has been stalled for
more than a year due to Jewish settlement expansion in Arab East
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Officials Urged to Fight Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye has urged government leaders to play an
exemplary role in the country's anti-corruption war.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of executives from various regions of the
Tanzanian mainland Friday, Sumaye warned that the war against
corruption will not be successful unless the government leaders
are fully committed to the drive.
</P>
<P>
He ordered every regional and district commissioner to keep
his or her office clean, warning that the government will leave
no stones unturned to punish those corrupt elements.
</P>
<P>
"Go back and strive to ensure that all loopholes of corruption
are stemmed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the regional and district commissioners to behave
themselves and be strict with their subordinates so that the
latter can adhere to the laid down regulations and be responsible
for their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye also lashed out at some civil servants who drink liquor
during office hours. "If the nation would not respect work
discipline, the task of reviving economy would not be realized,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister acknowledged that corruption has yet to be
uprooted and still runs rampant among leaders despite the fact
that the government has made efforts to eradicate the vice.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on adverse effects of the El Nino rains, he urged
every regional and district commissioner to use all resources
available to restore the damaged facilities and services and go
all out to solve the food shortage problem.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the who have gained a lot from the rains
brought by El Nino sell part of their healthy livestocks so that
they will be able to buy food.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Launches Stamp to Fund Breast Cancer Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Postal Service launched on
Saturday the country's first stamp supporting the breast cancer
research program.
</P>
<P>
The 40-cent stamp will be deemed valid for postage at the
prevailing First-Class rate, currently 32 cents, with its net
proceeds above the cost of postage earmarked for research
organizations, the Service said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The move abides by a 1997 U.S. legislation which directed the
Postal Service to issue a semipostal stamp valid for postage,
costing an additional amount above the First-Class rate, not to
exceed 25 percent, and allowing for the recovery of reasonable
costs associated with the stamp.
</P>
<P>
The stamp will be issued nationwide in August in preparation
for the National Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October.
</P>
<P>
Breast cancer is considered the most commonly diagnosed cancer
among women in every major ethic group in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Experts say when breast cancer is diagnosed in stages I and II,
five-year survival rates are nearly 95 percent and there are
better options for breast-conserving surgery.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Kills 50 Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The remnants of the junta forces and
rebel allies have killed at least 50 people in northern Sierra
Leone in a fresh round of persecution of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The junta remnants and rebels, who were driven out of the
capital Freetown in mid-February, Friday also burnt down several
others in villages some 70 miles from Makeni, a major town in the
north of the war-ravaged country, according to a British
Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a local priest as saying that the people in
that area were persecuted because they firmly supported President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who was reinstated in March after the fall of
the junta.
</P>
<P>
The remnants of the junta forces and their rebel allies then
retreated to the northern and eastern parts of the country, where
the west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) has been carrying
our an operation to mop up them.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist activities of the junta forces at the border
areas have forced some 160,000 local residents to flee to
neighboring Guinea since March.
</P>
<P>
However, a commander of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF),
the rebel group which became allied to the junta shortly after
the ousting of Kabbah's government last May, denied the accused
killings, saying it was "complete propaganda."
</P>
<P>
The RUF commander also accused the Guinean intelligence of
acting against his armed group.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Guineans are working together with
ECOMOG and the Sierra Leonean civil defense group Kamajors to
fight his group.

<HEADLINE> Iran Encourages More Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official Saturday
assured a 40-member French business delegation of Iran's
preferential policies for foreign investment, expecting more
foreign capitals to be injected into the country's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Iran's High Council of the Free Trade Zones
Morteza Alviri told the French delegation that foreign banks are
allowed to do business in the Iranian free trade zones and to
exchange foreign currency at floating rate being traded at free
market, according to the Iranian official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investors doing business in the Iranian free trade
zones will enjoy a 15-year tax exemption and they are allowed to
transfer their capital and interests abroad with no limitation,
said Alviri, also presidential advisor on financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that foreign companies involved in business and
industry in the Iranian free trade zones will find lucrative
opportunities on the Iranian market and a market of 300 million
population in the Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
The French delegation, comprising representatives from 30
French companies, arrived here on Saturday on a four-day visit,
the first of its kind since 1991, to check the opportunity for
business cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Headed by former chief of the French National Center for
Employers Francois Perigot, the delegation came to Iran as the
United States is discussing whether to punish the French oil
company TOTAL, which in last September concluded a big deal of
2 billion U.S. dollars to develop an Iranian offshore gas field.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened to impose economic sanctions on TOTAL
and several other foreign companies for violating its 1996
Iran-Libya Sanction Act, a law which bans any investment of more
than 40 million dollars in Iran's energy sector by any foreign
company.
</P>
<P>
Due to the U.S. efforts to isolate Tehran and insecurity for
foreign investment in the country, Iran only attracted some 782
million dollars during the past two years, an Iranian official
announced last December.
</P>
<P>
However, more and more foreign economic delegations are coming
to Iran to seek opportunities for cooperation, after the moderate
President Mohammad Khatami came to power in last August.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Urges Upliftment of Poor, Unemployed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki Saturday called on leaders of all departments to help
eliminate a national emergency caused by the legacy of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Apartheid had left South Africa with a social disaster of immense
proportions, represented by the poor, starving and unemployed, Mbeki
said at an installation banquet of University of Durban-Westville
Vice-Chancellor Mapule Ramashala.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also attributed increasing victims of HIV/AIDS, rape and
physical abuse to the old and bad social system.
</P>
<P>
"This emergency impacts negatively on all of us and remains
the one factor which threatens the realization of the national
goal of a peaceful and prosperous society," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
The apartheid state had poured resources into its racist
project of the upliftment of, at best, 15 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
The democratic state had an obligation to spread virtually the
same volume of resource among 100 percent of the population, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Yet the expectation persists that the government will somehow
find it within its power rapidly to bridge the yawning gulf
between black and white by raising the standard of living of the
former to equal that attained by the latter, and that in a short
period of time," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
There could be no doubt about the need to devote more
resources to the task of redressing apartheid imbalances, the
deputy president added.

DAR ES SALAAM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Participants from 190
countries will attend an international tourism congress organized
by the Africa Travel Association (ATA) during May 18-23 in the
north Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
At the congress, participants will discuss key marketing
issues with the theme of "Africa: the Tourism Destination for the
Next Millennium," said Director of Tourism of Tanzanian Ministry
of Natural Resources and Tourism Saleh Pamba in here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa and Zanzibar President Dr. Salmin
Amour are expected to be present at the occasion, Pamba said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the preparatory committee Amant Macha said last
week that the ATA annual travel congress is usually attended by
the members of the association but since Tanzania is the host of
the congress this year, Tanzanians engaging in tourism and travel
business are also invited to attend.
</P>
<P>
Macha said that those who are interested in attending are
required to pay a registration fee of 250 U.S. Dollars which will
enable them to become temporary members of ATA for the congress.
</P>
<P>
ATA, established in 1975, is an international non-political
and non-profit travel industry association whose objective is to
promote tourism in Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on Sunday extended its earlier order for
additional older Boeing 737s to be immediately inspected for
possible fuel pump damage.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's order broadens the inspections to include Boeing
737-300, 400 and 500 series planes. The new order will affect
additional 118 domestic planes and 282 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the agency ordered inspections of some 152 Boeing
737-100 and 200 planes after mechanics working on a Continental
Airlines Boeing 737-200 found fuel leaking out of a pipe running
through one of the plane's wing fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
The agency ordered operators of the planes to inspect two sets
of fuel pump electrical lines in each wing within seven days or
five flight hours.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's order was made after the wiring in a United Airlines
737, inspected after the initial order, showed clear signs of
arching in one location and a second spot where bare wire was
exposed, the FAA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It said operators have completed inspections of only 13 of the
affected aircrafts and found signs of wear on the insulation of
wires in half of the 26 main pump lines.

KATHMANDU, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister and Nepali
Congress President Girija Prasad Koirala said Sunday in Biratnagar
of eastern Nepal that he is committed to holding free and fair
general elections in April-May, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Koirala, who was in eastern Nepal for various programs,
stressed at a press meet the need to ensure the participation of
not only the political parties and the parties represented in
parliament, but also the people in general including the ethnic
groups, indigenous people and the downtrodden so as to make their
roles meaningful.
</P>
<P>
The official RSS news agency quoted him as saying that national
consensus is the only weapon for putting an end to the existing
anomalies and aberrations.
</P>
<P>
Koirala's minority government, which took office on April 15,
is the fifth government in the country since the mid-term polls in
November 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said on Saturday that since minority government is by nature
not guaranteed of a long-term survival, another party could be
included for a majority government.
</P>
<P>
He said he would prefer the main opposition Communist Party of
Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) to its breakaway faction
the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML).

BONN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Albert Costa won the German Open as
opponent fellow Spaniard Alex Corretja retired in the third set in
Hamburg on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This was Costa's first tournament since claiming the Marbella
title last September.
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Costa led 6-2, 6-0, 1-0 when Corretja retired from
fatigue. Fourth-seeded Corretja was stretched to three sets in
every round in the Open.
</P>
<P>
Costa won his first two service games to love and held break
point in the second game when Corretja double-faulted. Although
Corretja was able to recover a Costa break for 3-1, he was able to
offer little resistance after that.
</P>
<P>
Costa broke again to lead 4-2 and again for the set, and then
dropped just one point in the first three games of the second set.
</P>
<P>
Costa was aware before the match of Corretja's problem.
</P>

<P>
BUCHAREST, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Romania Senate Chairman Petre
Roman proposed that Romania must begin its infrastructure
preparations to make sure that it can be part of the
transportation and energy channel connecting Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Roman made the remarks on Saturday night when he was just back
from Turkey after attending the Parliamentary forum of the

</P>
<P>
Romania must keep a long-range foresight on the construction
of the channel to make sure that Romania can play a vital role in
it, The Romania News Agency on Sunday quoted Roman as saying.

<P>
The construction of the modernized passageway for transportation
and energy is a project connecting the mid-Asian countries and the
Black Sea area.
</P>
<P>
Although the project is still in planning stage, all related
nations have already begun competing each other trying to be a

<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Some British hospitals have been
told to restrict their blood transfusion orders only to identified
patients, as national blood stocks fell to the lowest levels yet
this year.
</P>

saying that the supplies of group O blood has fallen to
dangerously low limits, the Sunday Telegraph revealed Sunday.

more donors, blood stocks were already low at 14,270 units last
Tuesday, then fell to 12,300 units and had only marginally climbed
to 13,341 units by last Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Speaks Highly Of Yunnan's Drug Rehabilitation Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
today was praised by a high-ranking U.N. official for its drug
rehabilitation and control program.
</P>
<P>
After visiting the rehabilitation center in Kunming, capital of
Yunnan, Pino Arlacchi, deputy secretary-general and executive
director of the United Nations Drug Control Program, said that he
"was deeply moved."
</P>
<P>
Arlacchi said that he has seen a very efficient and very
careful way to treat addiction with rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that it is a good investment to channel
resources here in this country and in this region, and I will do
my best to let the international community know that Yunnan is a
model for China and for the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1989, the Kunming Rehabilitation Center is the
largest in east and south Asia. It receives more than 5,000 drug
addicts every year.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Yuzu, head of the center, it has
successfully developed a medicine to help addicts give up their
habit.
</P>
<P>
He said that for people coming there for rehabilitation, the
center is like a family and a hospital.
</P>
<P>
"We administrate them strictly but treat and cure them
warmheartedly," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the cure rate of the center for the jobless
is 15 percent, and the figure for those who have families is over
60 percent, both exceeding the world average.

<HEADLINE> Jones Ready to Sprint Ahead in Fastest Women Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, China, May 10 (Xinhua) -- World champion Marion Jones,
who clocked the year best of 10.79 seconds at the IAAF Osaka Grand
Prix on Saturday, said today that she has been ready to defend her
honor as the world 100-meter queen at the worlds' fastest woman
100-meter race to be held here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After boarding on the plane from Bejing, Jones said that she
was in a superb form and ready to show her talent on the Chinese
soil.
</P>
<P>
"I feel great and I'm ready to run," said the 22-year-old, who
declined to take any drink and refreshments offered by the
stewardess.
</P>
<P>
"Is there a McDonard's in Chengdu," asked the American who
caught the plane at the last minute with boyfriend C. J Henter,
coach Trevor Graham and Chandra Sturrup of Bahamas, the 1996
Olympic 100m fourth finisher who will also compete in the fastest
women sprint.
</P>
<P>
But the world champion then kept her lips tight for any details.
</P>
<P>
The versatile sprinter who turned to track from basketball in
1996, has made unbelievable progresses over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
After failing to qualify for the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games in
the U.S. trials, she emerged to win the 100m title at last year's
World Champinships in 10.76 seconds, and was timed at 6.95 seconds
in the 60m two months ago, the year's world best.
</P>
<P>
"She is sure to break the world record. But not now, it is not
the right time," said her coach Graham, adding that it will not be
difficult to register a time of 10.60 for her protegee on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Graham said that there was no secret behind Jones' remarkable
progress, saying "there is no secret. I just try to do my work to
keep her running fast. Just try out the points basically."
</P>
<P>
"But, we are confident, we are here to win. We have been ready
for the race because there are so many world's top sprinters here."
</P>
<P>
However, Graham, who has been Jones' coach for just one year,
admitted that they paid no special attention to the race although
it was believed to be one of the highlights in the 1998 athletics
calender.
</P>
<P>
"We just treat it as an ordinary race during the season," he
said, indicating it was no different from the Grand Prix in Japan
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
But Li Xuemei, the Chinese top challenger for Jones, who
surprised the world with a 10.79 run, the second fastest time in
the world last season to Jones' 10.76, has directed all her
efforts towards the race.
</P>
<P>
To focus on the high profile competition in her hometown, she
has skipped several indoor races as well as meetings in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm still in a good shape," said the 24-year-old Li,
who trained about one hour Sunday morning and was rumored to have
been dogged by a right knee injury.
</P>
<P>
Li's coach Zhang Rongwei said that "I think she has the calibre
to run a time around 11 seconds."
</P>
<P>
The other world class foreign sprinters due to compete are
Savatheda Fynes of Bahamas, last year's world bronze medalist,
Carlette Guidry, a member of the U.S. 4x100m relay winning team at
the 1996 Olympic with a 10.94 personal best.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Gail Devers and Zhanna Pintussevich of
Ukraine, world 100m silver medalist last year, were expected to
travel to China but withdraw from the race in the last moments.
</P>
<P>
"We want to race against them, but they failed to show up,"
said Graham.
</P>
<P>
The race will start at 16:20 local time after the exhibition
events including the men's and women's sprint hurdles and 400
meters.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The national team of badminton
world power China arrived in Hong Kong on Sunday to participate in
the Thomas Cup and Uber Cup world badminton team championships
slated here for May 15-25.
</P>
<P>
As the organizers had failed to find sponsorship for the event,
this would be the first ever world-class tournament to be held in
Hong Kong without corporate funding. But the organizers had
repeatedly confirmed that the tournament would go ahead and would
be successful as the previous tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Of the 19 Thomas Cup tournaments held between 1948 to 1996,
Indonesia has won 10 times, followed by Malaysia five times and
China, four times.
</P>
<P>
Li Mao, China's head coach for the men's singles event, had
said that his goal in Hong Kong was to reach the final. He had
predicted that it was very optimistic for his team to reach the
top four. China had not qualified for the tournament finals since
1992.
</P>
<P>
And in the 16 Uber Cup tournaments held since 1956, China and
Japan each has won five times and Indonesia three times. The
Chinese women's team had won the title for five consecutive times
since 1984 before losing the last two tournaments, in 1994 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
But former world champion Li Lingwei, who is now the head coach
for the team's women's singles event, said her team was confident
but she declined to predict a sure victory.
</P>
<P>
Although five of her players are now ranked among the world's
top 10, Li was not so sure what would happen in the Hong Kong
tournament.
</P>
<P>
"The higher world rankings of our players do not necessarily
mean everything we need for the victory," she said in an earlier
interview with Xinhua. "Every medal has to be won through hard
efforts," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) will launch fresh efforts to resume the Afghan
peace talks which collapsed here on May 3.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary General of the OIC Ibrahim Saleh Bakar is
expected to arrive here in a couple of days to initiate new
efforts to resume the talks, a report by the News Network
International quoted OIC sources as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the region, Bakar will visit Afghanistan's
southern city of Kandahar, where he will meet Maulana Abdul Jalil,
a senior official of the Taliban militia for "foreign affairs,"
and is likely to hold a meeting with Mulla Muhammad Rabbani, the
head of the Taliban Interim Council.
</P>
<P>
Bakar will also meet leaders of the rival Northern Alliance and
try to convince them to resume the talks, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he will meet acting Chief of the U.N. Peace Mission
for Afghanistan based in Islamabad James Ngobi, and discuss with
him ways and means to resume the peace talks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The first ever face-to-face talks between the Taliban militia
and the Northern Alliance held here on April 26 and broke down on
May 3 after the alliance objected to the changes in the Taliban
negotiation delegation.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban team went back to Kandahar on May 1 and failed to
return. A new three-member delegation headed by the
representative of the militia in Islamabad, Abdul Hakim Mujahid,
was assigned the job to represent the Taliban in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out between the Taliban and the forces loyal to
Tajik warlord Ahmed Shah Masood in the north of Kabul soon after
the stalemate in the talks.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji on Inspectors' Role at Large State Enterprises (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Special inspectors sent by the
central government to watch over the performance and financial
status of key and large state-owned enterprises must be
politically competent and highly principled, just and honest, and
never slacken their self-discipline or pursue personal interests,
according to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
This remark was made by Zhu on April 28, when the State Council
appointed the first group of 21 special inspectors to large
state-owned enterprises across the country.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China set
a goal that the country should help most financially troubled
large- and medium-size state enterprises to overcome their
economic difficulties within three years, and that the
modern-enterprise system should be established in most major state
enterprises by the end of this century, Zhu told the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"To attain this goal, the Party Central Committee and the State
Council have decided to set up the special inspector system, which
will help enhance the government's supervision on state
enterprises while granting them greater autonomy in management,"
said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The special inspector system is a major step in China's efforts
to separate government functions from enterprise management, and
is also in conformity with international practices, he said.
</P>
<P>
The main duties of the central inspectors are to conduct
financial supervision of enterprise operations on behalf of the
state and to appraise the performance of principal enterprise

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji on Inspectors' Role at Large State Enterprises (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The premier said that only officials ranking above the
vice-minister level are eligible to serve as special inspectors,
and that each inspector will have four special assistants who
should be chosen from officials with professional backgrounds in
banking, finance, personnel, auditing and supervisory bodies, or
macro-control departments.
</P>
<P>
"The five of them shall form a special inspector's office,
which generally will take charge of the supervision of five
enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu went on to underline the necessity of gradually
establishing a system for the management and supervision of
special inspectors themselves.
</P>
<P>
"We decided that the tenure of office for a special inspector
and his assistants is three years, and that no one will be allowed
to serve a second term in the same enterprise," he said.
</P>
<P>
Any member of the special inspector's office must not hold a
concurrent post in the enterprise, nor can they accept any pay,
benefits, entertainments or gifts from the enterprise, he said.
</P>
<P>
"You are the first group of special inspectors appointed by the
central government of a new term," Zhu said. "I hope all of you
will work hard with a high degree of sense of responsibility and
sense of mission to accomplish this significant task, which will
have a bearing on the overall situation of our country's reforms."
</P>
<P>
Also on April 28, a training class for the 21 special
inspectors and their more than 80 assistants, along with another
class for general accountants from 94 key and large state-owned
enterprises, opened in Zhongnanhai, the central government
compound in downtown Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Visitors Gather in Haining for Tide-watching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 50,000 people gathered
today in the ancient city of Haining in east China's Zhejiang
Province to attend tide-watching activities.
</P>
<P>
The tide of the Qiantang River near Haining is one of the most
amazing phenomena in China. Scientists say that the bell-shaped
mouth of the Qiantang River near the city helps form the
not-to-be-missed "Haining Tide," whose crest can be as high as 3.5
meters.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, only every mid-August of the traditional Chinese
calendar was considered as a golden season for tide-watching in
Haining, but scientists say that the spring tide there is also
splendid.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, the Haining Tide can be seen 120 days of the year;
every month there will be nearly 20,000 visitors watching the
tide," said an official with the local tourist department.
</P>
<P>
Besides the tide-watching activities being held through
Wednesday, many other sightseeing activities, folk arts and trade
fairs have also been organized.

WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- As U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis B. Ross failed in his
last-ditch attempt Saturday night to wring concessions from
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and rescue the flagging
peace process, analysts were assessing the damage to Washington's
relations with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton, trying to rescue one of the
signature initiatives of his second term, needled Congress on
Saturday to pass his 22 billion dollars child care proposal, which
has stalled under Republican criticism that it slights mothers who
do not work outside the home.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A pioneer in genetic sequencing and a private company are
teaming up to decipher the entire DNA of humans within three
years. The Federal Government is in the middle of a 15-year
project, set to be completed in 2005, to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
-- The main Western industral nations imposed an investment ban
on Serbia Saturday and froze its assets abroad as their concern

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Blames Economic Powers for Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohammed has again attacked the world's economic powers for having
a hand in the Asian financial turmoil in an open dialog with
businessmen ahead of the Group-15 summit here Monday.
</P>
<P>
These economic powers sold huge amounts of currencies of
southeast Asian countries, causing their immediate devaluation, by
50 percent in Malaysia and 400 percent in Indonesia, Mahathir told
the businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir arrived here Friday night to attend the G-15 eighth
summit. He discussed with the businessmen the Asian financial
crisis Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
"These powers by doing so have been heading to impoverish the
people of these countries which used to live in prosperity before
the crisis," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
"They have also been aiming to spark off a state of political
chaos, set off economic disturbances and agitate the masses," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, alongside Indonesia, which hit hardest in the
financial crisis, are members of the G-15, now grouping 16
developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis will top the agenda of the three-day
summit, which will also seek ways to reactivate the south-south
cooperation and promote south-north dialog.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his country has drawn up plans to get out of the
crisis, on top of which is to promote trade with developing
countries, such as Egypt, to minimize reliance on developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
The trade exchange between Malaysia and Egypt in 1996 amounted
to 290 million dollars. The two countries have agreed to up the
volume to 1 billion dollars by 2000.

CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemeni Undersecretary of Petroleum and Mineral Wealth
Ministry Rasheed Barbaa said Saturday that there were positive
indications about the existence of gold mines in several Yemeni
governorates.
</P>
<P>
He said that exploration for gold has been under way in the
governorates of Hadramout, Haja and Zamar.
</P>
<P>
He also expected that zinc and lead would be found in the Naham
region of Sanaa governorate.
</P>
<P>
Gold search in Yemen actually began in the early 1980s, but
gold found then was in small quantities and not good enough for
export.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- China is to open a silk factory in the industrial free
zone of Ismailia, Egypt, with an investment of about 2.4 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ismailia governor said Chinese side will provide technology and
equipment, while Egyptian side provide premises and necessary
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Electricity has been restored in the sandstorm-hit
Basra, Nasseriya and Emara governorates in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency reported that the sandstorms which swept
southern Iraq last week destroyed the 400-kilovolt electricity
line and 21 42-meter-high pylons.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Head of the European Commission Office in Amman Yves
Gazo said here Sunday that EU's aid to the countries in the Middle
East region accounted for 54 percent of its total assistance of
1.68 billion ecu (about 1.81 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the EU will continue its economic support for the
region.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan's National carrier Royal Jordanian (RJ) is to
sell five aged TriStar aircraft and lease two Airbuses of A-310
and A-320 as part of its efforts to modernize its fleet and boost
its global network.
</P>
<P>
The move, which will be completed in a year, can save the
airlines 27 million to 30 million dollars annually due to the
per-hour flying cost difference between the two types of aircraft,
semi-official Jordan Times quoted RJ's President Nader Dahabi as
saying Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Calls for More Application of Research Fruits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China is facing an urgent task of
turning more of scientific research findings into industrial
use, said Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing here today.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee, made the remark when attending a forum to mark the
tenth anniversary of Beijing High and New Technology
Industry Zone, the first of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
"The experience of the zone over the past decade has
demonstrated that hi-tech zones are an effective means of turning
scientific research results into production forces, which has
yielded remarkable economic and social efficiencies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1988, Beijing High and New Technology Industry Zone
has become one of the most successful of its kind in the country,
with 5,650 businesses making electronics,
optic-machinery-electronics, new materials, new energy and energy-
saving, bio-engineering and new medicinal, and environment
protection products.
</P>
<P>
When many countries are adjusting strategies to make development of
high and new technology a forefront of international competition,
the vice premier said, China, as a developing country, should make
development of high and new technology "a most important and
urgent strategic task."
</P>
<P>
To complete the task, Li emphasized that importance should be
attached to basic scientific research and development of applied
technology. Reform on scientific research, education systems must
be deepened to promote the cooperation between industrial
production and research, and training of research and management
personnel should be improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li called for more high and new technology enterprises with
high competitive edge be established in high and new technology
development zones.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Leaders Dalian Wanda scored a 3-0
home win over Vanguards Huandao on Sunday to sit atop after 10
rounds in the Chinese soccer first division league.
</P>
<P>
With only three minutes into the game, Hao Haidong, the best
Chinese scorer, swung in his header off a right-wing pass from Li
Ming who failed to convert from the penalty spot 35 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
In the 69th minute, substitute Wang Tao put Wanda 2-0 as goalie
Fu Bin failed to block his header from entering the net.
</P>
<P>
Six minutes later, Li Ming eventually scored his goal in a
melee off a corner kick to help Wanda pocket 25 points from 10
rounds of matches.
</P>
<P>
Against the Vanguards, the Wanda eleven had missed several
great chances as their three kicks bounced off either from the bar
or from the post while Vanguards failed to launch serious attacks
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
In the other games, both Beijing Guo'an and Shanghai Shenhua
failed to garner three points from their away games to remain at
the second and third spots respectively in the league.
</P>
<P>
Guo'an lost its two great chances in the second half as Jorge
Luis Campos Velazquz of Paraguay fired his kick against the right
post and his teammate slammed the ball inches over the bar minutes
later for a scoreless tie against Sichuan Quanxing.
</P>
<P>
Against rainy weather, Shenhua tied 2-2 against Guangzhou
Apollo for one point from the away game, failing to overtake
Guo'an for the second spot as it still lagged behind one point.
</P>
<P>
Simicic Ioica of Yugoslavia netted in two goals, the first and
the last, to help Apollo stop its losing streak in the league.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> German Chemical Businesses Confident in Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A chemical exhibition to open here
tommorrow has attracted 175 German businesses on the heels of a
successful German consumer goods fair in Shanghai last month.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 exhibitors from 21 countries or regions will
participate in "Achemasia '98," an international show of chemical
technology and the biological industry. More than one-third of the
exhibitors are from Germany.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey indicates that most German enterprises in China
are satisfied with their businesses, despite the impact of the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The German Chamber of Industry and Commerce officially opened
its Beijing representative office on April 27, and the next day
more than 800 German business people gathered here for the seventh
Asia-Pacific Conference of German Industry.
</P>
<P>
China's chemical industry is the focus of many German
businesses. China has attracted more than 900 billion U.S. dollars
in direct investment to the area during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
According to Michaela Spaeth, a trade promotion officer with
the German Embassy in China, the investment from German chemical
enterprises in China will triple by 2005. A Sino-German
petrochemical project reportedly has received an investment of 5
billion German marks.
</P>
<P>
"To build Sino-German joint ventures is one kind of
cooperation; Germany would also provide machinery for
China's chemical factories," said Professor Gerhard Kreysa,
president of Dechema, the German Association for Chemical
Apparatus, Technique and Biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
"German manufacturers are confident in the Chinese market,"
Kreysa said.
</P>
<P>
Machinery for the chemical industry will account for 77 percent
of all displayed items in the exhibition, which will be held May
11-16.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will also offer more than 130 seminars on the
latest technology in biology, pharmacy and environmental
protection.

<HEADLINE> China To Strengthen Trade Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Beginning today, disputes
concerning foreign-funded businesses in China will be considered
within the examination scope of the China International Economic
and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC), China's major
commercial arbitration organization.
</P>
<P>
CIETAC's revised responsibilities also include disputes in
financing, the bidding process, engineering construction involving
capital, and technology and service from overseas countries, Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Shengchang, CIETAC's deputy director, the
commission has consulted dozens of foreign-funded enterprises each
year for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that CIETAC is planning to recruit native
Taiwan arbitrators to enhance its business.
</P>
<P>
About 33 percent of the current cases are disputes between
Chinese shareholders and their overseas partners, including those
from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. The percentage is increasing,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The participation of native Taiwan arbitrators would increase
the confidence of Taiwan investors and help protect mutual
investments of the two sides across the Taiwan Straits, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission's Shenzhen office recruited native Hong
Kong arbitrators in 1984 with favorable comments from Hong Kong
investors.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Taiwan natives could join CIETAC in their own names,
rather than by the recommendation of government organizations. He
said CIETAC already has received more than 10 applications.
</P>
<P>
The commission has 418 arbitrators sitting on its panel. They
come from 26 countries and regions. There are 137 overseas
arbitrators, including some from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
CIETAC is China's largest commercial arbitration institution,
receiving 723 cases last year. Since its foundation 40 years ago,
the commission has received more than 6,000 cases involving more
than 10 billion Renminbi. It has been the world leader since 1993
in terms of caseload.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, 17 percent of the cases involved
engineering, real estate, rent, intellectual property rights and
securities. Disputes concerning commodity deals accounted for 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
As commerce develops and the legal system improves, there will
be more conflicts in trade and more people will try to solve them
by means of arbitration, he said.

<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The MBA Association of the Western
Returned Scholars Association, made up of China's returned MBA
graduates who are now senior executives in China's industrial,
commercial and financial circles, was set up in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
As early as the beginning of the 1980s, the late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping reached an agreement with former U.S. President
Ronald Reagan to jointly train high-level business managers.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the former State Economic and Trade Commission started
an international training program with the United States, Britain
and Europe. So far, a total of 542 master of business
administration degrees have been awarded under the program.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the total number of China's MBA graduates
exceeds 1,000, with 35 percent working in state-owned enterprises
and government organizations. Another 35 percent are employed in
joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The newly founded association aims to offer services to its
members in academic activities and business exchanges and, at the
same time, acting as a bridge between enterprises and research
institutes and governmental organizations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Defends Rice Copyright Against US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- When talking about jasmine rice,
people will naturally add an attribute "Thai" before it, since it
is well acknowledged that Thailand is the right place where people
can find jasmine rice.
</P>
<P>
However, dark clouds are gathering over the fate of Thai
jasmine rice as a U.S. company recently launched a new kind of
rice, using the name "jasmati" as the trademark.
</P>
<P>
The new jasmati rice sparked an uproar of complaints among Thai
rice farmers and exporters as well as government officials and the
ordinary Thais.
</P>
<P>
Thai rice farmers were angered by the move of the U.S. firm,
known as RiceTec Co., saying it was designed to mislead consumers
into believing that the rice was similar to the famous Thai
fragrant jasmine rice.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the problem, Thai farmers who grow jasmine rice
in the northeastern provinces of Surin, Maha Sarakham and Buri Ram
also condemned the U.S. firm for violating their natural rights by
trading other grain in the name of their "heritage."
</P>
<P>
Thai lawyers and genetic-conservation groups Saturday urged the
Commerce Ministry to file a complaint with the U.S. government
about RiceTec.
</P>
<P>
Jakkrit Kuanpoth of Sukhothai Thammathirat university's School
of Law said Thai rice-exporters could file a lawsuit against
RiceTec in the U.S. court for violating the U.S. Unfair
Competition Act, which protects products and producers from a
certain geographical area.
</P>
<P>
Jakkrit said that according to the U.S. law, the firm may not
trade its grain as jasmati, because the name is a geographical
indicator that the rice is from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand could lose its market share for jasmine rice to the
jasmati if we don't do anything. We would like to urge the
Commerce Ministry to take action at government level by lodging
complaints with Washington to examine the issue," the Sunday
Nation newspaper quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, deputy minister of agriculture and
cooperatives Newin Chidchob told the local media that Jasmine rice
is a unique brand of Thailand and that the American company should
recognize the fact.
</P>
<P>
It is unbelievable that a company from the world power should
brazenly exploit the famous brand of a developing country, the
deputy minister said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand exports about 5.3 million tons of rice each year, of
which about 25 percent is fragrant or jasmine rice. The United
States is one of the major markets for Thailand's jasmine rice.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. company retorted in its report that the
jasmati rice has no relationship with Thai jasmine rice but was
derived from a variety called Della that originated in Italy.
</P>
<P>
A RiceTec breeder argued that he considered jasmine rice to be
a term for "any aromatic, sticky rice."
</P>
<P>
But when trading, the U.S. firm contradicted its own
explanation by labeling the grain as the "Texas-grown copy of
jasmine rice from Thailand."
</P>
<P>
Last year, RiceTec sought and was awarded patents on "basmati,"
the Indian aromatic, long grain rice, bringing the firm a monopoly
to market it.
</P>
<P>
Farmers, academics and biologists in India are in the process
of filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization on this
issue.
</P>
<P>
Jakkrit said the U.S. firm had not yet patented jasmati, but
the case of the Indian basmati has prompted concerns among Thai
farmers that they could lose the right to grow what their fathers
had begun to grow.
</P>
<P>
Songkran Chitrakorn, deputy director of the Agriculture
Ministry's Rice Research Institute, said jasmine rice originates
in and is unique to Thailand. The ministry has its record that
Thai farmers have grown the variety for over half a century.
</P>
<P>
An organic rice farmer from Surin province said no one could
claim ownership or monopoly rights in relation to jasmine rice.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who would steal the rice from Thai farmers is truly
shameless," he said.

<HEADLINE> Anwar: Malaysia Has No Surplus Budget This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will not have a
surplus budget this year because of the current economic problems,
unlike last year when it recorded a 6 billion ringgit (about 1.579
billion U.S. dollars) surplus, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
For the same reason the country would also not attain high
growth this year and the next, Anwar, who is also finance
minister, said while addressing a forum here.
</P>
<P>
"While we basked in being able to attain a 6-billion ringgit
(about 1.579 billion dollars) surplus last year, we have to admit
that it is impossible to maintain a surplus budget this year," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government would continue adopting tight fiscal measures in
dealing with the current situation, he said, adding the tight
fiscal policy however would not deny the people of basic
facilities such health, education or limit poverty eradication
programs and in fact efforts towards that end would be
intensified.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would not compromise on providing
facilities to the people, who in his view, were the most
vulnerable to the current economic problems.
</P>
<P>
"If we have the means, we'll use them firstly to ensure the
well-being of as many people as possible," the finance minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar reminded the corporate sector that although the
government's current focus appeared to favor only that sector, it
was actually supporting strategic projects which could serve as
the catalyst to spur national economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
He said: "As such, while we take on the problems together, they
(the corporate sector) should not assume that the government's
responsibility is solely to uphold and defend them at the expense
of priorities for the masses."
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the government's stand on putting the masses first
was clear.
</P>
<P>
"When allocating the recent 1 billion ringgit (about 263.852
million dollars) aid from the International Monetary Fund, we gave
priority to the needs of education, health, small and medium-scale
industries and petty business," he said.

<P>
MAPUTO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of Agriculture
and Fisheries Carlos do Rosario has urged South African farmers
or entrepreneurs to invest in Moamba county in southern Maputo
Province.
</P>
<P>
By making full use of the water in the Corumane reservoir and
the irrigation system in Sabie, he said, land resources in the
area could be developed, The Domingo newspaper Sunday quoted the
minister as making the statement during a recent visit in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Investments could be made through cooperation between farmers
of the two countries, just like the bilateral collaboration in
Mosagrius agriculture development program in Niassa Province in
north Mozambique, the minister suggested.
</P>
<P>
The water has not been fully used in the Corumane reservoir
due to lack of fund, he said.
</P>
<P>
Do Rosario asked the Farmers' Association in Sabie region to
quickly issue licenses for land use and development so as to
cooperate with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the major issue in the area is that the private
sector which has large tracts of land cannot utilize them as a
result of lack of technology and capital. Poor management in the
reservoir and irrigation system has also led to little benefits.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai Monday informed the cabinet that he has nominated Major
General Shaul Mofaz for the next chief of general staff of the
Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will meet again on Tuesday to officially approve
the nomination of Mofaz who will replace the current chief of
general staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak. Shahak will step down on July 9.
</P>
<P>
Before Mordechai announced his decision, the two top
candidates, Mofaz and Major General Matan Vilani, were summoned
to the Prime Minister Office to be informed of the nomination.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said both candidates are
fully qualified, but considering the fact that the chief of
general staff would have to work closely together with the
defense minister, he is in favor of Mordechai's choice.
</P>
<P>
Vilani is one of Netanyahu's childhood friends, while
Mordechai has been cultivating Mofaz since he assumed the defense
portfolio two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz, 50, is a father of two. He was first drafted to
the paratroops of the IDF, where he had held a number of senior
command positions.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, he was appointed the IDF commander in the West
Bank. In 1994, he became the head of the southern command.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he was named as the head of the planning branch of
the IDF. And last year, he was promoted to be the deputy chief of
general staff.

Lanzhou, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Adeptly sliding beads on an abacus,
General Zhao Xi ran calculations for the trial flight of China's
first unmanned plane 30 years ago in a desert laboratory 1,600
kilometers west of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The location is ghastly: in the vast Gobi Desert littered with
the ruins of outposts built 2,000 years ago by Chinese emperors
against the invasion of the Huns.
</P>
<P>
The site could be a dreamland for archeologists or adventurous
tourists. But, it's a secret military base that today is
off-limits to archeologists and tourists alike. The landscape
conceals China's state-of-the-art test site for missiles where
thousands of rockets have been launched.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Xi, a leading scientist, and his colleagues from the base
used abacuses 30 years ago to design and calculate missile tests.
</P>
<P>
But today, tens of thousands of lights on large computers are
flashing as well as sophisticated optical, electronic and laser
instruments.

generations of young Chinese scientists to nourish this piece of
wasteland into what it is today," said General Zuo Jizhang, chief

<HEADLINE> FEATURE: Surrealistic Missile Base Rises From Gobi Desert (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shrouded by trees are supermarkets, schools, hotels, post
offices, banks, bookstores and apartment buildings as well as
research and office buildings.
</P>
<P>
Parked on both sides of the road are military aircraft ranging
from supersonic fighters to bombers and transport planes.
</P>
<P>
Stored inside the silos are missiles ranging from early models
imported decades ago to the latest models developed by Chinese
scientists.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the missile test site started in the summer of
1958, immediately after the late Chairman Mao gave his approval.
</P>
<P>
Since then, pilots from the base have tested nuclear
explosions, satellite launches and a long-range carrier rocket.
</P>
<P>
In 1984 and 1988 the test site went through two technological
renovations which enabled it to test all-dimensional air-to-air
missiles and use digital signals to replace radar signals.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 a research group led by Professor Zhao Xi, chief
designer of the base's target drone, successfully tested a
supersonic pilotless plane which they had designed and
manufactured. China was the second country in the world to have
such a target drone.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans spent eight years and one billion US dollars to
develop such a plane," Zhao said, "but it took us only four years
and less than one million US dollars."
</P>
<P>
Last December, the country's first simulator laboratory for
air-to-air missile testing was built at the base, bringing the
Chinese air force into the digital age.
</P>
<P>
And the chief designer of the lab was a 30-year-old woman,
scientist Li Hong.
</P>
<P>
Li, who began her career studying missile technology at the
base immediately after she graduated from college 10 years ago,
now has a family and a 7-year-old son in the desert.
</P>
<P>
Last year, she took her son to Beijing for sightseeing, but the
boy who grew up in the desert with the missiles was not impressed
by the highrises and neon lights.
</P>
<P>
Uncomfortable with the heavy traffic of the city, her son said,
"Mother, I want to go back home."
</P>
<P>
"I never regret having chosen the desert to write my love to
the motherland," she said.

<P>
AMMAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf Sunday briefed Jordan's acting foreign
minister on Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations on arms
inspection.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Jordan's Talal Sat'an Al Hassan, al-Sahhaf
presented the file of Iraqi cooperation with the U.N. Security
Council and the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, in carrying out
relevant resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The briefing also covered the efforts made by the Security
Council to close the weapons file about Iraq and shift from the
point of disarmament of Iraq to that of permanent monitoring of
Iraqi military capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"The briefing was evidenced by all the relevant documents that
certify Iraqi cooperation with the Security Council and the
UNSCOM," said al-Sahhaf in a statement to Jordan's official news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf arrived here late Saturday night on a three-day
official visit to enlist Jordan's help for lifting the sanctions
imposed on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. He is
expected to deliver King Hussein a message from Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein later during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Security Council decided to renew the
sanctions on Iraq. The sanctions can only be lifted after the
Security Council certifies that Iraq has eliminated all its
weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Reigning Champions Defeated in Asian Mountain Bike Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese women cyclists swept the
top three positions as both the men's and women's defending
champions failed to retain their respective titles in the Asian
mountain bike championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yanping clocked one hour 43 minutes and 18.345 seconds to
beat compatriot reigning champion Wang Zexiu, winning the 5x5.35
kilometers cross country race in the championships.
</P>
<P>
To achieve her best performance, Ma Yanping established her
upperhands from the very first lap and enjoyed a comfortable edge
of 5 minutes 44.54 seconds against second-placer Wang Zexiu.
</P>
<P>
Yu Quanlan completed the Chinese sweep by finishing third in
one hour 51 minutes and 49.867 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"Although I was recruited into the national team last year, I
was under no pressure to compete in the race," said Ma, adding
that "I am confident of taking the title in the upcoming Asian
Games this December."
</P>
<P>
On her part, Wang Zexiu contributed her fatigue to the busy
schedule as she also competed in other previous meets.
</P>
<P>
In the men's race, Totsui Shunsuke of Japan surged ahead from
the first lap to take the 7x5.35 kilometers title in 2 hours 3
minutes and 30.894 seconds.
</P>
<P>
His compatriot Udagawa Akihito finished second in 2 hours 5
minutes and 41.962 seconds, edging Chinese Li Fuyu to the third
place in 2 hours 10 minutes and 42.683 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Valdez Placido of the Philippines failed to
complete the course together with other 25 competitors as only 16
out of the 42 entries cross the finishing line.
</P>
<P>
As the championships concluded on Sunday, Japan took home two
gold medals from the women's downhill race and the men's cross
country event, while both South Korea and China won one gold medal
apiece.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri is expected to meet United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in Paris Monday to discuss ways of ending Israeli
occupation in south Lebanon, Lebanon' Orient radio reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hariri left here Sunday morning for Syria from where
he will head for France.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Damascus, Hariri will hold talks with
Syrian Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam, who is in charge
of Lebanon's affairs, and other senior officials in order to
coordinate their joint positions ahead of the meeting with
Annan, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon
on the condition that the Lebanese government agrees to provide
security guarantees for its northern border before its pullout.
</P>
<P>
Both Lebanon and Syria flatly rejected the offer, insisting
that the withdrawal must be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, seeks a
comprehensive deal that would also involve an Israeli withdrawal
from the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
Annan welcomed the Israeli offer and has established a
committee to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Malawi's Cross-Border Trade Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A recent study shows that there is
a considerable development of trans-border trade between Malawi
and its neighbors, according to Sunday Mail.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian newspaper quoted the study by the University of
Malawi as saying that the informal cross-border trade between the
neighboring countries in the region is an important economic
activity and in some cases, the informal trade is several times
higher than the formal trade.
</P>
<P>
Malawi-Zambia informal trade monitored from the eastern border
town of Mchinji of Malawi shows that from 1995 to 1996 Malawi
exported to Zambia non-agricultural commodities worth 2.6 million
U.S. dollars, while agricultural commodites amounted to 732,000
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The main agricultural goods exported by Malawi were maize
products, Irish potatoes and beans. Malawi imported large
quantities of fertilizer and secondhand goods worth 17.2 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Malawi-Mozambique informal trade was monitored from four
border towns in the west and one in the east. Malawi exported a
total of 3.8 million dollars worth of various products, while it
imported 13.6 million dollars mainly in food products over the
two years.
</P>
<P>
Informal cross-border trade with Tanzania was monitored at the
northern border town of Karonga. Malawi exported 11.2 million
dollars worth of products, while imports were 10.8 million
dollars, mainly used clothes, electrical appliances and
kitchenware.
</P>
<P>
Malawi's total value of formal trade with the neighbors was
about 64 percent of the total informal trade, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
The study suggests that by encouraging the cross-border trade,
Malawi can cover its annual food shortages of 250,000 to 500,000
tons without diverting its scarce national resources to importing
these commodities from outside the region at higher prices.

<HEADLINE> Iran Summons German Ambassador over Attack in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran summoned German ambassador in
Tehran Horst Baechmann on Sunday to strongly protest against the
"irresponsible act" of the German police in connection with an
attack on Iranian mourners in the German city of Cologne.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, the
Iranian Foreign Ministry called for arrest and punishment of
those "who violated the religious sanctities" of Muslims and
the Iranians residing in Germany.
</P>
<P>
A group of Iranian dissidents insulted and attacked the Ashura
mourning ceremony held by Iranians and Muslims residing in Germany
to mark the death anniversary of the Shiite third Imam
Hussein. Two Iranians were injured in the clashes and sent to
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry Director General in charge of Western
Europe affairs Ali Ahani told Baechmann that the failure of the
German police to provide security for those attending the
religious rituals is not at all acceptable.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ceremony had been held with the prior
knowledge of the German officials concerned, adding that the
German government is responsible for consequences of any similar
incidents in the future.
</P>
<P>
Baechmann denounced the attack, saying that according to
reports received from the German Foreign Ministry, the
demonstration by the Iranian "counterrevolutionary agents" took
place "suddenly."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the local police in Cologne were unaware of
the significance of Ashura ceremony for Muslims, nor did they have
a precise evaluation of the sensitivity of the issue.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Told All Ready for Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Philippine President Fidel
Ramos was told here Sunday by chiefs of the Commission on
Election, the armed forces and the national police that everything
had been ready for Monday's elections.
</P>
<P>
During a breakfast meeting of presidential and vice
presidential candidates and other concerned parties hosted by
Ramos, Commission on Elections chairman Bernardo Pardo announced
that all preparations for the national and local elections have
been done.
</P>
<P>
There will be "no postponement or failure of elections, as well
as other wrong and baseless predictions," Pardo told the
president.
</P>
<P>
"All preparations have been done to make sure that every aspect
and stage of the electoral process is carefully implemented," he
added.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the holding of honest, orderly and peaceful
elections, the poll body has also accredited three citizens'
monitoring groups to check fraud and cheating in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff General Mariano Clemente of the armed forces and
chief director Santiago Alino of the Philippine National Police
told Ramos that plans have been made during and after the polls in
keeping with Ramos' order for the holding of honest, orderly and
peaceful elections.
</P>
<P>
The plans include providing security to polling places,
election inspectors and Commission on Election personnel
performing election duties, protect voters from harassment,
coercion, intimidation and reprisal and continue enforcing orders
of the Commission on Elections in political subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine National Police had also identified 425 towns
and municipalities as "election areas of concerns." About 116,000
military men and policemen had been deployed all over the country
to maintain peace and order.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that as of Sunday, 33 people had been killed in
election-related violence.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday lodged a strong
protest to the German government for the attack on Iranian
mourners in Cologne and the "irresponsible attitude" of the
German police in connection with the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted a statement
from the Foreign Ministry Information and Press Department as
saying that the attack took place at a time when a group
of Iranians and Muslims residing in Germany were holding
mourning ceremonies for the third Imam Hussein of the Shiite
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry called on the German government to
arrest those involved in the incident for their "disregard of
the religious sanctities of Muslims."
</P>
<P>
Local English Daily Iran news reported that a group of
unidentified Iranian dissidents insulted Imam Hussein and the
household of the Islamic Prophet Mohammad in front of the "Iran
House" in Cologne, where Iranians mourned on occasion of Ashura,
the anniversary of Hussein's death on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian dissidents also physically attacked the mourners,
the daily said, but German police prevented the mourners from
responding to the attacks and as a result two Iranians were
injured in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The group also surrounded the automobile carrying an Iranian
cleric "in full view of German police," spitting at the car and
shouting anti-religious slogans, it said, but they were pulled
back by a few Iranian mourners.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another report said that two Iranian dissidents
also raided a symposium in Vienna, Austria on Thursday when the
Iranian deputy foreign minister for education and research
affairs Gholamali Khoshrou delivered a speech.
</P>
<P>
The attackers threw eggs and colorful materials at the
gathering and then fled from the scene, the report said.

<P>
The acting minister said that the suspects were from the same
group with Islamist affiliation and aimed to destabilize the
country, but he declined to name the group.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will not accuse any other country at this time for the
violence, he added.
</P>
<P>
On April 30, a Volvo car exploded at the parking lot of the
Jerusalem International Hotel at the suburb of Amman, seriously
damaging itself and four other nearby vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A previously unknown group, Abu Thar Al Ghafari, claimed the
responsibility for the explosion in a statement issued in Lebanese
capital Beirut.
</P>
<P>
But the Jordanian government doubted it for lacking accuracy.
</P>
<P>
The car explosion at the hotel followed a series of bombings in
the past month that targeted the car of former head of the General
Intelligence Department Mohammad Rasoul Kilani and the car of
former Interior Minister Jawdat Sboul, as well as the residence of
Major General Yousef Gassous of the Jordanian Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
None of the explosions or attacks resulted in loss of life or
injury.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian State Probes Ghost Worker Frauds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The government of Osun State in
southwestern Nigeria has started investigations into ghost worker
frauds involving some of the state ministries and top government
officials, media reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the state's Property and Funds Investigation and
Recovery Panel is now probing into a ghost worker fraud in the
Osun State Mass Education Agency.
</P>
<P>
The panel suspects that about 62 million Naira (about 730,000
U.S. dollars) were paid to ghost workers by the agency.
</P>
<P>
As part of its "war on ghost workers", the state government
suspended four directors of various agencies and redeployed seven
others in October 1996, following the discovery of alleged
misappropriation by the state's pay-at-sight committee.
</P>
<P>
Among the agencies and ministries where misappropriation were
discovered are the office of the military administrator,
ministries of agriculture, information, works and transport and
the state Hospital Management Board.
</P>
<P>
They will all be investigated by the panel, the reports said.

<P>
NEW DELHI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- India has only one doctor for
about every 2,500 people showing the weak and fragile healthcare
infrastructure, Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted a latest study
as saying here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We have 407 doctors, 214 nurses and 1,600 beds for every one
million people in a population of 950 million," the study said.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality in India is among the highest as an average of
80 out of every 1,000 children born die, while 39 in a developing
country like Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy of 55.5 is also among the lowest, it said,
adding it is 66.5 in Thailand and 59 in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
With the population growing at 2.5 percent, India would be a
country of one billion people by the turn of the century. To
fulfill the healthcare needs, India would need to add a whopping
80,000 beds annually for the next five years, the study added.

signed here Sunday a covenant to reaffirm their commitment to
ensure the holding of honest and peaceful elections.
</P>
<P>
The three-page document was signed by the candidates at the
Presidential Palace during a breakfast meeting hosted by President
Fidel Ramos to get their support for credible elections.
</P>
<P>
Only five of the 10 presidential bets and four of the nine vice

forms of cheating, intimidation or similar acts during the
elections and especially on the election day.
</P>

does not have "to resort to violence and fraud just to win." All
it takes is to reach out to the masses and prove that he or she
has the best program of government, he added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Export Franchise City Concept to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A Malaysian company which
introduced the "franchise city" concept is seeking to export the
idea to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Kota Francais (M) Sdn Bhd signed here Sunday a memorandum of
understanding with Jetpa Holdings of Turkey to jointly develop the
concept in Turkey and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The concept involves the siting of businesses with franchise
capabilities under one roof.
</P>
<P>
Kota Francais and Jetpa Holdings which are involved in Turkey's
construction, motor, tourism, food, electronics and education
sectors, were represented at the signing by Chief Executive
Officer Zainal Ariffin Osman and Chairman M. Fadil Akgunduz
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"We have about six months to finalize the details. Maybe next
year, we can start something in Turkey," Zainal told reporters
after the signing.
</P>
<P>
Kota Francais's first franchise city in Shah Alam near Kuala
Lumpur would be operational in September, and has so far attracted
a tenancy rate of 60 to 70 percent, Zainal said, adding his
company was in the midst of establishing more franchise cities
within Malaysia, including in the states of Perak, Kedah,
Terengganu, Johor and along the peninsula's east coast.
</P>
<P>
He said Kota Francais hoped to establish 25 franchise cities
throughout the country by the year 2005 at a total cost of 2.5
billion ringgit (about 659.63 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Philippine Polls, a Fight Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Is it popularity or political
machinery that counts in Philippine politics and finally gains the
upper hand in the presidential race on Monday, when some 34
million Filipino voters go to the polls to choose their country's
next president?
</P>
<P>
With 10 official presidential candidates set to reach the
election day, Monday's presidential race will be the largest and,
most likely, one of the tightest in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
Based on the results of various opinion polls conducted in the
run-up to the elections, many pundits predicted a virtually
two-way fight between highly popular Vice President Joseph Estrada
of the main opposition, and Speaker of the House of
Representatives Jose de Venecia of the powerful ruling party.
</P>
<P>
In the latest poll conducted on May 2-4 by the country's most
respected pollster, the Social Weather Station (SWS), Estrada, the
standard-bearer of the LAMMP (Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses)
party, solidified his massive lead with a hefty 33 percent support
rating.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia of the ruling Lakas-NUCD (National Union of
Christian Democrats) party emerged as Estrada's closest rival with
15 percent, the best showing for the veteran politician who has
fared poorly in many previous polls.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found three candidates crowding for the third
place -- Senator Raul Rocco, former Cebu governor Emilio Osmena,
each with 11 percent, and former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim at 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who made a household name in the 1960s by playing
Robin Hood-style heroes fighting for the poor, has led all opinion
polls conducted this year by the SWS, which almost accurately
predicted the results of the 1992 presidential ballots.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who runs on a populist pro-poor platform, enjoys a
broad constituency among the ordinary masses which account for
more than two-thirds of the country's 70 million population.
</P>
<P>
He vows to drastically reduce the 35-percent national poverty
rate, give priority to agriculture and education, and restore
peace and order in the country.
</P>
<P>
"My obvious edge is that among all the candidates, I'm
identified with the poor," said the portly and mustached ex-movie
star, a college dropout who is disliked by the business community
and the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
Confident that the presidency was already in his bag, Estrada
on Thursday announced some of his cabinet choices and the
priorities in the first 100 days of his administration.
</P>
<P>
Estrada even claimed victory at a rally held Friday. "It's all
over but the counting," he said. "I think I will win because all
the surveys show I am leading."
</P>
<P>
But political analysts say that Estrada's victory is still not
a foregone conclusion although the polls did show a trend in favor
of him and Filipino voters are usually prone to choose
personalities over parties and issues.
</P>
<P>
With the support of incumbent President Fidel Ramos which means
powerful political machinery and sufficient resources, De Venecia
still stands a big chance to win the election despite his low
popularity, they add.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia has been lackluster in many previous opinion polls
until the latest SWS survey, dogged by his acknowledged image as a
"trapo" (Filipino parlance for the traditional politician good at
backroom deals).
</P>
<P>
The endorsement of Ramos, who picked De Venecia as his
successor and remains a popular figure, is expected to bring one
to two million votes for De Venecia. Ramos, who must step down on
June 30 when his single six-year term ends, is barred by the
constitution to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
But the most important advantage of De Venecia is his
formidable political machine which will play a major role in
winning actual votes on the election day, according to columnist
Alex Magno.
</P>
<P>
Magno said that a strong and complete slate, including many
unopposed candidates, in both congressional and local elections
showed the Lakas-NUCD has a clear organizational superiority over
the other competing parties, including Estrada's LAMMP.
</P>
<P>
"The Lakas has the clear advantage due to the party's
100-percent candidate presence in the 17,000 elective posts open
in this election," he said. "The closest organizational rival, the
LAMMP, has only 30-percent candidate presence. This is going to
tell in the final vote."
</P>
<P>
According to Magno, the Lakas-NUCD's organizational superiority
may bring a lot of machine votes for De Venecia since its local
candidates will draw their followers to vote for him and win "soft
votes" from rival candidates.
</P>
<P>
Soft votes refer to voters who have low-level conviction about
their initial preferences. According to the estimate of the De
Venecia camp, a lot of the lower-income Estrada voters are soft.
</P>
<P>
In fact, De Venecia himself did not hesitate to declare that he
is "the man to beat" due to his powerful political machine.
According to him, the Lakas-NUCD has a membership of 6.5 million
which means millions of command votes.
</P>
<P>
Being speaker of the lower house for six years, De Venecia also
boasts support from most provincial governors and other local
officials, as well as from several influential religious groups
which usually demand their followers vote as a bloc.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts said there are also chances a dark horse
emerges in the May 11 polls, since no one is expected to get major
support in a field of as many as 10 contenders.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, the presidential candidate who gets the
highest number of the votes will be declared the winner. No
run-off will be held.
</P>
<P>
Some voters, particularly those who loathe both the
controversial Estrada and the "trapo" De Venecia, may turn to
other candidates with a better image, thus creating some
imponderables.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the analysts say, it is still too early to rule out
the possibility that Rocco, a famed lawyer, or Lim, a tough
crimebuster who has the backing of former president Corazon
Aquino, might land Malacanang, the country's presidential palace.

<HEADLINE> China Improving Vegetables with New Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- More varieties of vegetables will
be served by Chinese families because of new technology.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaobing, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture,
said the Chinese government is making efforts to please Chinese
housewives by filling their vegetable baskets through the use of
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"The well-to-do Chinese families not only need a sufficient
supply of vegetables, but also hope to taste what vegetables
should be," he said.
</P>
<P>
Modern science and technology have not only helped increase
the vegetable output in China, but spoiled their tastes partly due
to the use of fertilizers, said Chai Min, a staff member with the
China Vegetable Seed-Breeding Center.
</P>
<P>
So the government also needs to turn to science and technology
to make Chinese food taste better and more delicious, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that both rural and urban vegetable markets are now
steadily priced and sufficiently supplied, though Chinese families
are demanding more vegetables to meet their tastes.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China has made some progress in this
field during the past few years. North China's Shanxi Province has
spread 138 types of vegetable seeds during the past five
years. Liaoning Province in the northeast and Qinghai Province in
northwest of China have also made progress in reducing fertilizer
use on vegetables, he added.
</P>
<P>
"China will also conduct a study on seed-breeding, and
increasing nutrition of vegetables soon," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
To make Chinese vegetables safer for consumers, the Ministry of
Agriculture will pass a regulation guiding the production and
technological process of vegetables this year, he said.

<HEADLINE> 10,000-Year Old Animal Fossils Found in Dalian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A large number of animal fossils
dating back to the late Quaternary Period (about 10,000 years ago)
have been found near this port city in northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
The fossils are now stored in the Jinzhou Museum in the city of
Dalian.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Mingcheng, the curator of the museum, the
fossils were disovered in a limestone cave on the northeast slope
of Mount Taishan in the suburbs of the city. He explained that
they include bones and teeth of cattle, sheep, deer, and hairy
rhinoceroses.
</P>
<P>
Local geologist Liu Jinyuan said that a severe flood probably
carried the remains into the cave, which is even older than the
fossils.
</P>
<P>
"The fossils will provide valuable clues for the study and
research on the area's ancient animal groups and geological
conditions," Liu added.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Urged to Recycle Solid Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- With waste disposal being a major
threat to the environment in southern Africa, environmentalists
have repeatedly urged countries in the region to recycle waste
materials to ease pollution.
</P>
<P>
Recycling is the separating and processing of waste materials
into reusable materials. The recycled product, which may or may
not be similar to the new unrecycled material, is used again.
Other than easing pollution, recycling also reduces raw material
production costs, the Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Managing director of a South African-based company Sappi Waste
Paper Dennis Skeate told the paper that huge piles of waste have
been seen across the region's dump sites and could harbor
diseases and pests and pollute land, air and water.
</P>
<P>
Public concern with environmental quality has made recycling a
major growth industry in Europe. But of all southern African
countries, only South Africa is so far increasing economic gains
in the recycling since it has the technology and other countries
rely on her for recycling, he said.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, recycling has helped create employment and
provides a source of income for people on the streets who sell
waste materials to recyclers.
</P>
<P>
According to a South African environmental researcher Ntombi
Silomntu, "Developments that are taking place in the tyre and
cement industries on how to tackle the problem of scrap tyres are
quite impressive. Old tyres are used as road asphalt, and there
are plastic and glass recyclers too."
</P>
<P>
In Namibia, recycling as a waste reduction option is a fairly
new concept. But only plastic is recycled in Namibia and most
items that need recycling, for example, glass and paper are
transported to South Africa and reimported to be made into
different secondary products.
</P>
<P>
Most countries in southern Africa recycle waste paper, very
few recycle waste beverage cans or soft drink cans and other tin
products on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has a 20 percent recovery rate with a minimum of five
to eight tons of used beverage cans being recovered every month.
However, the cans are transported to South Africa for recycling.
In Zimbabwe, only plastics and paper are recycled locally.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, the collection of recyclable waste such as
vehicle bodies, empty oil drums, tins and others, help to reduce
the rate of filling of the Tabata dumping site in Dar es Salaam,
the paper reported.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Will Filipinos See Peaceful Elections? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Will the Filipinos see a "clean,
peaceful and orderly election" on Monday when they go to the polls
to elect the country's president, vice president and
parliamentarians as well as local officials?
</P>
<P>
Will a possible failure of elections in parts of the country
become a reality? What will happen if the elections fail in some
places?
</P>
<P>
These questions have been hitting the headlines of newspapers
and television programs in the Philippines since the election
campaign started three months ago.
</P>
<P>
There have been widespread concerns that Monday's national and
local elections could be marred by vote-rigging, which could spark
violence as were the cases with the previous elections.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 general elections, which were regarded as
relatively orderly, more than 100 people were killed in
election-related violence.
</P>
<P>
This year, the situation has improved as compared with the
previous ones, yet 33 people have reportedly been killed in
election-related violence since January.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that election-related violence could
escalate if large-scale ballot-rigging takes place.
</P>
<P>
Watchdog groups in the country are charging that the Commission
on Elections, which overseas the elections, has not taken measures
to prevent possible large-scale vote-rigging by parties and
candidates, which they said would spark more violence.
</P>
<P>
They said the commission had not barred hundreds of officials
suspected of cheating during the 1995 Senate elections from
helping to count this year's votes.
</P>
<P>
Retired Supreme Court justice Teodoro Padilla, who headed the
tribunal on the Senate polls in 1995, has warned recently that
Monday's elections could even be worse in the matter of cheating
compared with the 1995 elections.
</P>
<P>
His warning was echoed by Manolo Gorospe, chairman of the
election commission who said in a statement two weeks ago that the
commission is expecting a failure of elections in many parts of
the country, particularly in Mindanao, the most violence-prone
region.
</P>
<P>
Such a failure may lead to a delay in the proclamation of
national and local leaders, including the president, he said.
</P>
<P>
Former Senate president Jovito Salonga has also warned that if
there was no proclamation on or before June 30, the day President
Fidel Ramos' six-year term ends, there would be "a big problem,
chaos and a vacuum in the leadership."
</P>
<P>
In this case, the military could take over because it is the
"strongest entity" that can move in, he said, citing the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
If this really happens, there would be political chaos in the
country, analysts said, adding that the opposition will revolt
against a military take-over.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Jose Estrada, who leads the field of 10
presidential candidates, said: "If I'm cheated out of victory, I
will go to hills and fight."
</P>
<P>
Former president Corazon Aquino has also said that if the
elections are rigged, she would lead another "people power"
movement which led to the fall of her predecessor Ferdinand Marcos
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, rebel groups in the country have threatened to make
troubles during the elections. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front
and other rebel groups have threatened to disrupt the elections if
polling is conducted as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramos, who is limited to a single six-year term by the
constitution, has assured the Filipinos that there will be no
failure of elections this year, and that he will step down on June
30.
</P>
<P>
He said the armed forces and the police, which have been
deployed in all violence-prone areas in the country, will do
whatever they can to deal with the trouble makers.
</P>
<P>
Some Presidential and vice presidential candidates, invited by
Ramos as a final pre-poll step to ensure a "clean, peaceful and
orderly" election on Monday, attended a breakfast meeting Sunday
at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
The meeting could serve "a forum for the exchange of views to
promote open and transparent elections," the Presidential Office
said.
</P>
<P>
On May 2, all the front runners in the presidential race signed
a covenant promising to play their part in ensuring peaceful,
honest, and orderly elections.
</P>
<P>
These indications point to relatively orderly elections in the
country this year.
</P>
<P>
But political analysts say election uncertainties in the
Philippines will not come to an end until the election results are
accepted by political parties and a new government is formed in
seven weeks after the polls.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Textile Industry in New Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's textile industry is
facing another viability crisis, with thousands of jobs now on
the line due to the current high prices of local lint despite
marked falls on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Textile Workers' Union has appealed to the
government to urgently take action to save the troubled textile
industry following reports that several big companies were on the
brink of closure due to unfair pricing policies, the Sunday Mail
reported.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Union Simon Tsokotsa told the paper
that most ginneries which acted as middlemen between growers and
spinners had not reduced their lint selling prices despite marked
falls on the world market, resulting in local spinners buying
lint at unfairly higher prices than other spinners worldwide.
</P>
<P>
If the trend was allowed to continue, he said, local companies
would be unable to compete internationally due to viability
problems, forcing widespread closures and loss of thousands of
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Tsokotsa called for the urgent formation of a task force to
review the downwards of the selling price of cotton lint to
spinners to save them from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1991, the
textile industry has faced many obstacles which resulted in
several companies closing down, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jobs have decreased from 20,000 in 1990 to 13,000 presently, a
decrease of about 35 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The union predicted that by the end of the year, 4,000 more
jobs could be lost if the situation did not improve.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Gold Market Suffers Great Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's gold market suffered a loss
of 145 million Jordanian dinars (about 205 million U.S. dollars)
within the past six months due to the drop of gold prices at the
international market, semi-official Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We in the kingdom have 70 tonnes of gold worth 600 million
dinars (about 847 million dollars) (six months before). At the
current prices, the gold is worth about 455 million dinars (about
642 million dollars)," the paper quoted Ghaleb Sakijjha, secretary
of the Jewellers Association, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Due to the excessive supply of gold at the international
market, world gold prices dropped at the end of last year and
the beginning of 1998, thus affecting local demand for gold
and causing a stagnation in Jordan's gold market, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Media Urged to Cover Constitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's National Constitutional
Assembly (NCA) has urged the media to play a leading role in
publicizing the on-going debate on constitutional reforms so that
ordinary Zimbabweans understand the need for a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day workshop Saturday on the media and the
constitution in Bulawayo, the country's second largest city, NCA
national coordinator Isaac Maphosa said the whole process would
die a natural death if it did not receive publicity, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabweans would have missed an opportunity to participate in
deciding their destiny, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a craving nation out there waiting for information
so that they can digest it and make an input into the
constitutional debate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The present constitution, drafted at Lancaster House, London
in 1979, was a compromise document reached between the then
Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith, Abel Muzorewa's United
African Nation Council, the Patriotic Front coalition of Robert
Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and Joshua
Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) to end the second
Chimurenga war.
</P>
<P>
Debate to reform the current constitution was now gathering
momentum with the launch of the NCA, an organisation comprising
labour unions, civil society and churches.
</P>
<P>
Maphosa said the NCA was trying to bring in the entire
spectrum of society to decide their destiny through participation
in a constitutional reform debate in order to come up with a
constitution they could call their own.
</P>
<P>
In the recent debates, the trade union and opposition parties
and some ruling ZANU-PF members and parliament members demanded
constitutional reforms to limit presidential terms and urge
current President Robert Mugabe to retire.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe has been the country's leader since independence in
1980.

<HEADLINE> Washington Peace Talks Must Be Rescheduled, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Washington
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks scheduled for Monday has to be
rescheduled as the Israeli government needs more time to discuss
the U.S. proposal on Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank,
said a senior official.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, made the
remarks to Xinhua here on Sunday to confirm the reports that the
Washington summit has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
The time is too short before the planned Washington meeting
between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National
Auithority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat and a whole cabinet
meeting must be held to address this issue before Netanyahu
travels to Washington, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet started a meeting Sunday morning to
discuss this issue.
</P>
<P>
The planned Washington summit may be rescheduled for later this
month if an agreement can be reached beforehand on Israel's next
troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
There has been no indication that Israel is ready to accept the
U.S. proposal which asks Israel to hand over 13.1 percent of the
West Bank territories to the Palestinians during the second stage
troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that a way will be found that won't entail
withdrawing from 13.1 percent of the West Bank," Israel radio
quoted Davis Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's Communications Advisor, as
saying on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Privatize Tea Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Tea Development
Authority (KTDA) will be privatized by 2000 following a long-term
dispute with local tea farmers.
</P>
<P>
The body will become a private company owned by farmers under
the name Kenya Tea Development Agency, said KTDA Managing
Director Eustace Karanja Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An association of small-scale tea factories and growers will
soon be formed to promote and foster the development of the
industry in small-holder areas, he was quoted by Sunday Nation
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new company, an association of small-scale tea growers,
will be incorporated in January 2000, and elections of directors
to be held in 2001, he said.
</P>
<P>
It will also issue guidelines on tea cultivation standards and
requirements, tea manufacturing and packaging standards,
transportation and housing.
</P>
<P>
The existing loan guarantees of factories, he said, will not
be affected by the move, though all KTDA assets will be
mortgaged.
</P>
<P>
The KTDA now owes the government more than 1.8 billion
Shillings (30 million US Dollars) and has guaranteed 2.5 million
Shillings (41,700 US Dollars) in loans to various tea factories.
</P>
<P>
The Authority has been severely criticized by farmers and
boycotted for several times in the last few years. Some farmers
had called for its abolition, arguing it did not serve their
interests.
</P>
<P>
Last December, small-scale farmers demanded that they be
de-linked from the KTDA, claiming the body had outlived its
usefulness.
</P>
<P>
The body has also been accused of failure to collect tea on
time and exploiting farmers by paying them "peanuts" for
high-quality green leaves.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 representatives of tea-growing districts said
then they wanted to run their own factories or to get more
involvement in the running of the KTDA.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Adopt Measures to Check Foreign Nurses' </HEADLINE>

KUWAIT CITY, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait are taking measures to
stop the current exodus of foreign nurses from the country due to
low salaries and lack of incentives, Health Minister Adel Khaled

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Launch National Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is spending 2.04 billion
Shillings (34 million U.S. Dollars) on the national census set
for August next year, Planning and National Development Assistant
Minister Elijah Sumbeiywo has said.
</P>
<P>
The census, which will be the fourth since the country's
independence in 1963 and sixth since 1948, projects a population
of 30 million by next year, local press reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has committed 986 million Shillings
(16.43 million Dollars) -- half the budget -- in preparations
"well at an advanced stage," Sumbeiywo was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the money is expected to come from donors
including the U.N. Population Fund and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The census bill will certainly dent the June budget against a
backdrop of scarce resources, for which the government intends to
freeze new development projects as one of the ways to salvage the
tattered economy, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's last census was held on August 24/25, 1989. It was
steeped in controversy and the results was withheld until March
1994, putting Kenya's population at 21,443,636, including
foreigners residing in Kenya at the time.
</P>
<P>
The census ranked Kenya's eight top ethnic groups as follows:
Kikuyu - 4,455,865; Luhya - 3,083,273; Luo-2,653,932; Kalenjin -
2,458,123; Kamba - 2,448,302; Kisii - 1,318,409; Meru -
1,087,778; Mijikenda - 1,007,371.
</P>
<P>
The Nandi, Kipsigis, Marakwet, Elgeyo and Pokot were counted
under Kalenjin, the tribe where Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
is from.
</P>
<P>
Heavy criticism came after the announcement of the results
from opposition parties based along divided tribal lines. Even
Moi dismissed the results as "a waste of time and money" at the
time.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Determined to Combat Money Laundering: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides has stressed his government's determination to curb
money laundering and crime in general on this eastern
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Saturday on measures taken
by the Cypriot government to stamp out money laundering,
Kasoulides said reports in international press about the volume
of money being laundered in Cyprus are unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of Foreign Affairs publication on "Measures Taken
by the Republic of Cyprus on Preventing and Combating Money
Laundering" was presented at the conference.
</P>
<P>
According to the publication, the government of Cyprus
attaches top priority to the need for an adequate and effective
response to the crime. To this effect, it has introduced an
appropriate legal and institutional framework, promoted
enforcement capabilities, developed appropriate policies and
implemented effective measures against money laundering.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said competitive offshore centers in other countries
and Turkey try to present Cyprus as a source of money laundering
for their own reasons. "This view is rejected by assessments from
various international organizations," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Most negative reports in the foreign press base their
arguments on the fact that Cyprus has a strong offshore sector
operating on the island, Kasoulides said, pointing out that "the
existence of these companies does not automatically mean the
island is used as a money laundering center."
</P>
<P>
Rejecting allegations that a number of offshore companies
operating in the European Union have moved to Cyprus because of
the island's lax legislation on money laundering, Kasoulides said
Cyprus has adopted all relevant regulations recommended by
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has ratified the 1988 Vienna Convention and has signed
the 1990 European Convention on Money Laundering.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money laundered each year in the world's
financial system was recently estimated to exceed 500 billion
U.S. dollars. Almost 70 percent of these laundered funds are
estimated to be derived from drug trafficking.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
made an important speech at a forum marking the 20th anniversary
of a nationwide debate on the criterion for verifying truth here
on May 8.
</P>
<P>
Following is an excerpt of the speech by Hu, who is also a
member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee:
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, our Party and country held a major debate on
whether practice is the sole criterion for verifying
truth. Initiating a nationwide mind-emancipation drive guided by
Marxism, the debate made ideological preparations for the
epoch-making Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central
Committee, and exerted a significant and far-reaching influence
over the historical process of the Party and the country.
</P>
<P>
Remembering the debate today is of great importance for holding
high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, further
emancipating the mind, using and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory
creatively, solving all kinds of problems, and propelling the
great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The debate on the criterion for verifying truth took place when
our Party and country were facing a major historical transition,
and was carried out under the leadership and with the support of
the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries such as Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
In May 1978 a publication run by the CPC Central Committee
Party School for internal circulation first carried the article
titled ``Practice is the Sole Criterion for Verifying Truth'',
which had been pre-checked by Hu Yaobang. On the following day,
the article was published in the Guangming Daily, and was then
transmitted by Xinhua News Agency around the country. Thus there
started a major debate on the criterion for seeking truth.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Won't Take Over if Elections Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine armed forces chief Gen.
Clemente Mariano said Sunday that the military respects the
country's electoral system and will not take over civilian rule in
case of disturbances or unrest following possible failure of
elections.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no military takeover," Mariano said in response
to press reports that national and local elections to be held on
Monday might fail due to fraud, cheating and violence.
</P>
<P>
Civilian rule must be supreme over military rule, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that fraud and cheating had been found in the
registration of some voters in Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
In addition, 33 people have been killed in election-related
violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
To ensure honest, orderly and peaceful elections on May 11,
about 116,000 troops and policemen have been deployed all over the
country, especially in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, senator Gregorio Honasan, a former army colonel
who helped topple the late ex-president Ferdinand Marcos in 1986,
said he would launch another putsch similar to what he and other
soldiers did in 1986 should the coming elections fail.
</P>
<P>
Former president Corazon Aquino has also reportedly expressed
the same idea.
</P>
<P>
At stake in the May 11 elections are president, vice president,
12 out of 24 senators, 260 House representatives, 78 provincial
governors and thousands of local officials and councilors.

<P>
It is proper to say that the debate was an ideological
forerunner for the great transition, with deep and far-reaching
significance in our Party's history since the founding of the
People's Republic achieved at the Third Plenary Session of the
11th CPC Central Commission, as well as for the reform and
opening-up over the next two decades. It laid a theoretical
foundation for our Party to re-establish Marxist ideological,
political and organizational lines.
</P>
<P>
In his speech titled ``Emancipate the Mind, Seek Truth from
Practice, Unite and Adopt a Forward-Looking Attitude'', made at
the Central Work Conference on December 13, 1978, Deng Xiaoping
spoke highly of the great significance of the debate, saying, "The
current debate on whether practice is the sole criterion for
verifying truth is, in fact, also one on whether to emancipate our
minds.
</P>
<P>
"A party, a country, or a nation, if it adopts a dogmatic
attitude, will fail to make any progress, thus losing its vitality
and ultimately ceasing to exist.
</P>
<P>
"Our socialist modernization can be carried out smoothly, and
the theories of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought will develop
smoothly, only if we emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts,
proceed from reality and combine theory with reality.
</P>
<P>
"In this sense, the debate on the criterion for truth is indeed
an issue concerning ideological and political lines, and the
future and destiny of the Party and the country."

<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Filipino voters go to the polls
Monday to elect a new president, a new vice president, 12 out of
24 senators, 260 members of the House of Representatives, and more
than 17,000 local government officials and councilors.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, the president is elected by direct
popular vote for a single term of six years. The vice president is
elected for a six-year term in a separate election at the same
time as the president. He or she can serve a maximum of two terms.
</P>
<P>
The canvass of the votes for president and vice president is
conducted by the National Board of Canvassers composed of all
members of the bicameral Congress.
</P>
<P>
The candidates obtaining the highest number of votes for
president and for vice president shall be declared elected. The
president of the Senate, who is chairman of the National Board of
Canvassers, shall be the one to proclaim the winning candidates.
</P>
<P>
But in case two or more shall have an equal and the highest
number of votes, one of them shall be chosen as president or vice
president by a majority vote of all the members of Congress in a
joint session assembled.
</P>
<P>
All 24 Senators are directly elected for six years by national
vote. But one half of the membership of the Senate shall be
elected every three years.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's constitution adopted in 1987, there are a
maximum of 250 members of the House of Representatives. But on
Monday, there will be 260 seats of the lower house of parliament
at stake, according to a guide issued in April this year by the
Commission on Elections (Comelec).
</P>
<P>
Among the 260 representatives, 80 percent or 208 shall be
elected by district, while the remaining 20 percent or 52 shall be
elected under a party-list system which will be implemented Monday
for the first time in the country, the Comelec said.
</P>
<P>
In the previous and current legislatures, the party-list or
sectoral representatives were appointed by the president from
lists of nominees proposed by indigenous, but non-religious,
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, voters will cast two votes for the House of
Representatives -- one for the district representative and the
other for the party the voter wants represented in the lower
chamber.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 parties which have been accredited by the Comelec
will participate in the country's first ever party-list election
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Party-list Law, the party-list system is a mechanism
of proportional representation in the election of members to the
lower house.
</P>
<P>
The system is designed to enable small political parties and
marginalized and under-represented sectors to obtain possible
representation in the lower chamber, which traditionally, is
dominated by parties with big political machinery.
</P>
<P>
Instead of individual candidates, only registered organized
groups such as the peasantry, urban poor, youth, indigenous
cultural communities and veterans can participate in the
party-list election.
</P>
<P>
A party shall submit to the Comelec a list of at least five
nominees to represent it. Once the party obtains the required
number of votes, the Comelec shall proclaim the party-list
representatives according to their rankings in the list of
nominees.
</P>
<P>
A party should obtain at least 2 percent of the total votes
cast for the party-list system nationwide in order to be allocated
one seat.
</P>
<P>
Only a maximum of three seats may be allowed per party. Seats
are allocated at the rate of one seat per 2 percent of votes
obtained.
</P>
<P>
Five major political parties, which have largest party
representation in the lower house at the start of the current
Congress, are disqualified from participating in Monday's
party-list election.
</P>
<P>
The five parties are the ruling Lakas-NUCD (Peoples'
Power-National Union of Christian Democrats), the Liberal Party
(LP), the LDP (Fight of Democratic Filipinos), the National
People's Coalition (NPC), and the KBL (New Society Movement).
</P>
<P>
Party-list representatives are entitled to the same
deliberative rights as the regular members of the lower chamber.
They shall serve for a term of three years with a maximum of three
consecutive terms.
</P>
<P>
Also up for grabs are 78 provincial governors and an equal
number of vice-governors, 81 city mayors and the same number of
city vice-mayors, 1,526 for both municipal mayors and municipal
vice-mayors, 722 provincial board members, 912 city councilors and
12,232 municipal councilors.

<P>
The reform and opening in the past two decades has been a process
of constantly pursuing emancipation of the mind and seeking truth from
facts.
</P>
<P>
In all the work of the reform and opening, and the
modernization drive, Deng Xiaoping always advocated emancipating
the mind and seeking truth from facts, and our Party also
consistently held up the principle. Therefore, the ideological
line of Marxism has struck deeper in the hearts of the people, the
basic theory of Marxism has been closely combined with the
specific situation of modern China, and the socialist reform and
opening, and modernization drive has been consistently forging
ahead.
</P>
<P>
In May 1980 Deng said that whether a socialist economic policy is
correct or not, in the final analysis, is decided by the
development of the productive forces and the increase of the
people's income, and this is the most fundamental criterion.
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1992 Deng pointed out during his tour of south
China: The criterion of judging the work of each side must take
into account whether it is favorable for the development of
the productive forces of socialist society, favorable for the
increase of the comprehensive strength of the socialist state and
favorable for increasing the people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
Deng's speech during his tour of south China was a manifesto
that stuck to the theory and line since the Third Plenary Session
of the 11th CPC Central Committee and took the reform and opening,
and the modernization drive to a new stage in the significant
historical point at which China was experiencing the test of
political turmoil both worldwide and at home.
</P>
<P>
His speech gave a profound answer to many ideological questions
that had confined people's minds for a long time and offered new and
powerful ideological weapons with which we can grasp opportunities
and push ahead with the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.

<P>
The process of emancipating the mind and socialist
modernization construction in the past two decades has enabled us
to accumulate rich experience and offered us much deep-rooted
enlightenment on how to adhere to the ideological line of Marxism.
</P>
<P>
First of all, adhering to the ideological line of emancipating
the mind and seeking truth from facts demands that we approach
Marxism with a scientific attitude.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, adhering to the ideological line of emancipating the
mind and seeking truth from facts demands that we respect the
practice of millions of people, and consistently verify theories,
lines and various principles and policies with practice.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, adhering to the ideological line of emancipating the
mind and seeking truth from facts demands a deeper understanding
of China's national conditions, and unswerving procedure from the
actual conditions of the primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, adhering to the ideological line of emancipating the
mind and seeking truth from facts needs a world-embracing vision,
attention to the study of the international economy, politics,
science and technology, and culture in contemporary times, the
ability to grasp the historical trends, and the ability to take
the lead as the times demand.
</P>
<P>
Finally, adhering to the ideological line of emancipating the
mind and seeking truth from facts demands that we vigorously build
up socialist democratic politics.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Raid Airline's Offices in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Gunmen robbed Emirate Airlines'
offices in Nairobi Saturday in a new wave of crimes hitting the
Kenyan capital where a tycoon kidnapped at a ransom of about
830,000 US Dollars was rescued by police only a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
The six robbers, armed with pistols, robbed guests and stole
cash at the offices at 11:00 a.m. on the 20th floor of View Park
Towers downtown, before snatching a Toyota Corolla from a woman
outside, local press reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A guard was shot in the right shoulder when he attempted to
trap the fleeing gunmen by locking the main door of the ground
floor.
</P>
<P>
"I was closing the exit to stop three of the robbers when one
drew a gun and shot. He aimed at my head but I dodged and the
bullet caught my right shoulder," said Vincent Odima, the guard.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of office clerks, foreigners and local clients buying
tickets were ordered to lie down and relieved of cash and
personal effects during the 20-minute raid.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen stole 64,885 Kenyan Shillings (about 1,080 US
Dollars) and 2,190 U.S. Dollars from the office and an unknown
amount of money from the travellers.
</P>
<P>
They had disguised themselves by wearing Moslem caps.
</P>
<P>
Police said the gangsters were being pursued.

<P>
Now we are at an important historical period at the turn of the
century and a critical period to overcome the difficulties in
reform and achieve development. Today it is important for us to
commemorate the 20th anniversary of the debate on the criterion for
verifying truth.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of summing up past experiences, we should more
conscientiously and even more staunchly stick to the criterion of
practice, stick to the Party's ideological line of mind
emancipation and seeking truth from facts, so that our thinking
can be raised to the level of the requirements of the 15th
National Congress of the CPC and the requirements of the times.
</P>
<P>
First, we should be more conscientious and staunch in upholding
the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and start a new tide of
studying the Theory.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, guided by this scientific theory, we should be bold
in practice and exploration to deal with the new issues and new
contradictions with the spirit of mind emancipation and seeking
truth from facts.
</P>
<P>
In our effort to promote sustained, rapid and sound growth of
the national economy, at present we face many new issues such as
the reforms concerning state-owned enterprises, financial system
and other sectors, economic restructuring, and better opening to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
As regards these issues, the CPC Central Committee, with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, put forward important ideas and
methods. We must keep pace with, have an in-depth understanding of
and get a correct grasp of them, both theoretically and in
practice. At the same time, we must continue to make explorations
in our practice and conscientiously resolve practical problems.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, we should, according to the requirements of the 15th
CPC National Congress, unswervingly adhere to Deng Xiaoping Theory
and continue to enrich and creatively develop it in our practice.
</P>
<P>
The biggest theoretical role of the debate on the criterion of
verifying truth 20 years ago was that it restored the ideological
line of mind emancipation and seeking truth from facts. The
biggest theoretical achievement of our Party in the past 20 years
is the emergence of Deng Xiaoping Theory, which provides a
fundamental ideological and political guarantee for us to realize
the grand goal of building socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the debate 20 years ago and the following
reform and opening-up process over the past 20 years, ideological
theorists and journalists have made important contributions. In
the new situation, we should carry on the spirit of being bold in
exploration and make new contributions in theoretical study,
theoretical research and theoretical popularization.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Some components destined for the
Bushehr nuclear power plant, along with the vehicle transporting
them, have been stolen in Isfahan, central Iran, the morning
newspaper Iran Daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told the daily on Saturday from southern
coastal province of Bushehr that the spare parts had previously
been at Isfahan Shahrif University of Technology for testing.
</P>
<P>
He did not specify the identities of the stolen components and
when they were stolen. It is believed the vehicle transporting the
components was the target of the thieves "because the missing
parts are not considered very important," he added.

The security forces are investigating the case, he said,
giving no more details.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Seeks Double Taxation Avoidance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is seeking avoidance of
double taxation with more countries to improve its international
investment climate and ensure a free flow of foreign investment.
</P>

Myanmar reached an agreement on double taxation avoidance (DTA)
with Malaysia in March this year, the first such agreement after
it promulgated Foreign Investment Law in late 1988.

Myanmar is currently holding negotiations with Singapore and
three other countries for the conclusion of DTA agreements,

NEW DELHI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Political differences among the

The BSE sensitive index spurted to 4,147.29 on Tuesday, but
later gradually moved downwards to end the week at 4,022.20 as
against last weekend's close of 4,006.81.

<HEADLINE> New President's Inaugural Speech Applauded in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The inaugural address of Miguel
Rodriguez, the new Costa Rican president, has received positive
reaction across the nation.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican politicians welcomed two elements in the
address: the tone of conciliation, and the economic and social
targets set by Rodriguez, who swore in on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez committed himself in the speech to achieve an annual
economic growth of six percent, a yearly inflation of no more than
five percent, a poverty index below 17 percent and an unemployment
rate of less than five percent.
</P>
<P>
Former President Luis Alberto Monge said that Rodriguez's
speech broke with the tradition that the incoming president
criticizes the outgoing.
</P>
<P>
Luis Fishman, current president of the Legislative Assembly,
said that speech signaled a radical change in the takeover
ceremony. Leaders of the two major parties have started a
civilized power transition, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jose Maria Figueres, the outgoing president, said that the
speech clearly paved a way for the future.
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Ramon Arrieta, on his part, backed the speech
because it was a call to the unity of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, some cautious responses also surfaced amid generous
praises. A small group of political analysts regard Rodriguez's
speech as unrealistic and misleading.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Help Landslide Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier Romano Prodi convened
an urgent cabinet meeting on Saturday, discussing ways to help
those hit by massive landslides in southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the meeting, the government said it
has worked out a series of emergent measures to restore order in
the disaster-struck areas.
</P>
<P>
One of the emergent measures is to concentrate financial and
personnel strength to aid the five towns in the Campania region,
where the landslides occurred.
</P>
<P>
As its first effort, the Italian government has provided the
disaster area with a relief of 53 billion lire (about 311 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Due to week-long heavy rains in southern Italy, massive
landslides attacked five towns in the Campania region last week,
causing 119 people dead, 400 missing and more than 1,000
displaced.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the number of victims will rise sharply in
the days to come.
</P>
<P>
Officials said it is the largest landslides in the country
after World War II.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Firms React Calmly to China's Ban on Direct Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- International direct selling
companies have reacted calmly to the State Council's announcement
of a ban on direct sales, despite the blow to their considerable
interests in China, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"We understand and respect the decision of the Chinese
government ... and have stopped all our activities of direct
selling," Herbert Ho, vice-president of Amway Pacific Limited, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sunrider, a leading herbal food and skin-care cosmetic company,
is preparing a new business plan to take account of the new
regulations.
</P>
<P>
"But no matter what kind of operation we use, we will make
appropriate arrangements for the sellers," said a Sunrider
spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
Direct selling was an unknown sales style to most Chinese
before US-based Avon entered Guangzhou in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Since then, direct selling, in many cases involving pyramid
schemes, has been lauded as an opportunity to get rich quick
through introducing multiple levels of sales people.
</P>
<P>
Goods sold in this fashion, such as cosmetics and exercise
machines, can be a cash cow for sales people.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that at least 1,500 companies with 2.6
million employees have operated pyramid sales across the
country. Out of these, only 518 were approved by the government.
</P>
<P>
"It's necessary to stop the operation of pyramid sales since it
has begun to hurt social stability and economic development," said
Wang Zhongfu, director of the State Administration for Industry
and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
He called on the branches of his administration to help the
registered companies modify their sales mode.
</P>
<P>
According to the official ban, companies engaging in direct
selling have to wind up their business or apply to change their
licence for that of a regular retailer by October 31.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the process of working out a revised mode of
operation which will take into account the company's strong points
and the present characteristics of Chinese society," said Ho of
Amway.
</P>
<P>
The company has registered capital of around 80 million US
dollars in China and a 58,000-square-meter factory in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Nancy Ho, a spokesperson for Amway, said the government
prohibition order will not affect the company's planned investment
in Pudong New Area in Shanghai, where Amway has bought a
100,000-square-meter site to build a cosmetics plant.
</P>
<P>
Similar confidence has also been demonstrated by Avon Co.
</P>
<P>
Just a week after the announcement of the ban, Avon broke
ground for its new 40-million-US-dollar manufacturing plant in the
Taiping Industrial Development Zone in Conghua, Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The plant will be ready in October and bring Avon's investment
in China to 90 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We have great confidence in our long-term business prospects
in China and cooperation with the Chinese government," said James
Preston, chief executive officer and chairman of Avon Products
(Worldwide).

MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A woman candidate running for vice
mayor in a town in the southern Philippines escaped unhurt from an
attack Sunday, but one of her supporters was injured, police said.
</P>
<P>
The candidate was about to get off from the vehicle approaching
her house when attacked in Paracable town, Camarines Norte
province. The attacker fled, police said.
</P>
<P>
One supporter of the candidate was seriously wounded by the
shrapnel of a grenade thrown by the attacker, bringing to at least
37 the number of people injured in election-related violence.
</P>
<P>
The attack was the latest of a string of election-related
violence in the country. It was reported that a total of 33 people
have been killed in various violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
The southern Philippines is regarded as a violence-prone region
in the May 11 polls. To ensure the peaceful holding of the
elections, thousands of troops and policemen have been put on
alert in the region.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 elections, 169 people were killed in violence.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines holds its national and local elections next
Monday. At stake are the presidency, the vice presidency, 12 out
of 24 senators, 260 members of the House of Representatives, 78
provincial governors and thousands of local officials and
councilors.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Refugees in Thailand Moved to News Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 20,000 Cambodian refugees,
mostly Khmer Rouge dependents, are being evacuated to a new camp
in the northern Thai province of Si Sa Ket for better control and
security reasons, the Bangkok Post reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Thai military officials had begun relocating
those refugees from a makeshift camp about eight kilometers from
the border to a nearby camp.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation of the refugees, who fled the recent fighting in
Cambodia between government forces and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas,
is expected to be completed in seven days, said province governor
Poj Jaiman, who inspected the evacuation Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation is being conducted as a precautionary measure
against fears that the refugees would be vulnerable to attacks
from both Phnom Penh troops and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that fighting in Cambodia remained heavy
Saturday with Cambodian government forces claiming near-victory
over the Khmer Rouge which has been hit by mass defections in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Thai policemen in the province have been ordered to beef up
security at the two camps.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, Thai Red Cross officials delivered 8,000 cans
of fish to refugees at the two camps as emergency relief aid.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
handed rice and canned food to the refugees.

<HEADLINE> Flood Threat Top Concern of Three Gorges Dam Builders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Builders of the Three Gorges Dam,
the world's largest water conservancy project, are taking measures
to fend off the threat of the summer floods and guarantee the
smooth progress of construction, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Ensuring the security of upstream and downstream cofferdams
this summer is top of our agenda," Wang Jiazhu, vice-president of
the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corp (CTGPC),
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The giant Three Gorges Project, with a total investment of
around 200 billion yuan (24.1 billion US dollars), is expected to
be completed by 2009.
</P>
<P>
The successful river closure last November opened the second
phase of the project's construction. CTGPC will build the
left-bank dam and powerhouse between 1998 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
For the last six months, the builders have been heightening and
compacting the cofferdams as well as constructing cutoff walls
inside them, said the English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, the area of completed cutoff walls
totalled 83,000 square meters with a maximum depth of 74 meters.
</P>
<P>
The cofferdam project is expected to be completed by the end of
May. It is capable of withstanding floods up to 72,300 cubic
meters per second, which occur only once every 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The cofferdam project is among the most difficult elements of
the Three Gorges Project. Its total earth and rock refill volume
is 10.3 million cubic meters, and the total length of the two
cofferdams is 2,438 meters, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
He said that the builders will start trial water extraction
from the foundation pit in mid June, and that all water will be
drained by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that concrete pouring is the key element of
the second phase, and that 20 million cubic meters of concrete are
planned to be poured.
</P>
<P>
The maximum annual pouring quantity is expected to be four
million cubic meters, a new world record. But the amount this year
will only be 1.3 million cubic meters, he noted.
</P>
<P>
CTGPC has established four concrete mixing systems to produce
high-quality concrete. The company has also built a large quarry
located seven kilometers from the project site, said Wang.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Government not to Reconcile with ETA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose Aznar
reiterated on Saturday that his government will not open dialogue
with the terrorist group ETA, or the Basque Homeland and Freedom.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the City of Vitoria, Aznar said "Spain will not
back down. The government will not talk with ETA."
</P>
<P>
ETA assassined a city councillor in the city of Pamplona on May
6 and a policeman in Vitoria on May 8, sparking wide-spread anger
across the country. A large number of people took to the street,
condemning the violence of ETA and Herri Batasuna, which is a
legal organization close to ETA.
</P>
<P>
As long as all the Spanish people close their ranks, Aznar
said, they can bring an end to violence, which is the best way to
wipe out terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will not give ETA and Herri Batasuna any
room for dialogue, adding that they will end up in jail.
</P>
<P>
ETA was set up in 1959 with an aim to build an independent
Basque state in northern Spain and southwestern France. It has
launched a war against the Spanish government since the 1960s,
killing about 800 people so far.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Defies Western Pressure Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said here Saturday that the referendum result in Serbia
last month demonstrated that it is impossible for the country to
accept any foreign meddling in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic made the comments while meeting with U.S.
presidential envoys Richard Holbrooke and Robert Gelbard.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug news agency quoted Milosevic as saying that
Yugoslavia hopes to develop bilateral ties and cooperation with
the United States on the basis of equality, mutual respect and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
</P>
<P>
However, Milosevic said his country will not be subjected to
any political pressure over the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Although some Western countries showed an obvious partiality
toward the separatist-minded ethnic Albanian terrorists in Kosovo,
the president said, the position of the Yugoslav leadership and
people is that the issue is an internal affair of Serbia and can
only be resolved within Serbia through political means.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, a Serbian province with an ethnic Albanian majority,
has sunk into chaos since ethnic Albanians calling for
independence from Serbia clashed with the local Serb police in
February.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav and Serbian authorities have rejected any foreign
meddling or the internationalization of the issue, arguing it is
Serbia's internal affairs.

<P>
MANAGUA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman
will bear witness on Tuesday to a district court in the case of a
drug trafficking plane detected by the National Police last week.
</P>
<P>
According to a judicial summons, Vice President Enrique Bolanos
and President Aleman's daughter Maria Dolores will also give
evidence during the investigation process.
</P>
<P>
As ordered by Judge Martha Quezada, the president, his daughter
and the vice president will make their statements on the case in
the presidential office, instead of in court, because they have
legal immunity.
</P>
<P>
Judge Quezada is investigating several government officials who
were allegedly involved in the crimes relating to the drug
trafficking by the Lear 35-A plane and to the forgery of official
documents.

<P>
Investigation showed that the plane, stolen from the United
States last December by drug traffickers, made at least 49 flights
since it entered Nicaragua last December without being inspected,
because it was considered the "presidential plane."
</P>
<P>
Aleman had admitted that he traveled in the plane to El
Salvador last February to attend a Central American summit, but
explained that he had not flown to any place inside the country.
</P>
<P>
Aleman had declared his innocence in the case and blamed civil
aeronautics officials, police and migration directors for the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Nicaragua Lino Gutierrez announced Friday
that his country is willing to cooperate with Nicaraguan
authorities in the investigation of the jet case.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that President Aleman and his government will
clear what occurred here," said the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
"The United States government harbors no doubts that President
Aleman has been an untiring fighter against drug trafficking, and
that the cooperation between Nicaragua and the United States in
drug trafficking matters has been excellent," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez noted that Nicaragua seized more drugs than any other
countries in Central America, saying "I think that Nicaragua has
played a positive role in the war against drug trafficking."

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's Foreign Exchange Reserves Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's foreign exchange
reserves dropped to 14.544 billion U.S. dollars last week, the
lowest in more than a year, the central bank announced.
</P>
<P>
In the week between April 28 and May 5, the reserves fell by
117 million dollars due to a growing market demand for hard
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The drop was also attributed to less oil sales and capital
redemption as well as foreign debt repayment. The government spent
more than 600 million dollars last month servicing foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate fluctuated between 536 and 537 bolivars
against the dollar last week, still within the range allowed
by the bank.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, the dollar will rise to 589
bolivars by the end of the year because of the tense political
climate in the country that normally prompts a flight of capital
and a bigger demand for hard currencies.

<HEADLINE> General Elections to Be Held in Philippines Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Filipino voters will troop to
polling stations Monday to elect a new president,
parliamentarians, provincial governors and other local officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commission on Elections, which oversees the
polls, the casting of votes will start at 07:00 (GMT 23:00 Sunday)
and end at 15:00 (GMT 07:00 Monday) across the country.
</P>
<P>
There are over 34 million registered voters and 80 percent of
them are expected to turn out to cast ballots in 174,374 precincts
in the country, election officials said.
</P>
<P>
The voters will choose a new president as well as a new vice
president, 12 out of 24 senators, all 250 members of the House of
Representatives, 78 provincial governors and 1,600 mayors.
</P>
<P>
Eleven candidates from major and minor political parties are in
the presidential race to replace President Fidel Ramos, who is
barred from a second term by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine Constitution, the president serves a
single six-year term and is not allowed to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
The front runners in the presidential race, according to the
latest opinion polls, are Vice President Joseph Estrada from Laban
ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses), Speaker Jose de Venecia from the ruling Lakas-National
Union of Christian Democrats (Lakas-NUCD), and former Manila mayor
Alfredo Lim from the Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
A poll by the Social Weather Station published last Thursday
put Estrada's support rating at 33 percent, while De Venecia
trailed in second place with 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, political analysts said the high number of candidates
means the victor will inevitably have only minority support, and a
dark horse could emerge in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Official results of the presidential polls will not come out in
less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
To attain a peaceful election, the government has deployed
policemen and soldiers at hundreds of "hot spots," or
violence-prone areas, in the capital city of Manila and other
regions.
</P>
<P>
Since the election campaign period started in the country in
January, at least 27 people have been killed in election-related
violence.

</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- More than two million Paraguayans will cast
their ballots in the country's general elections scheduled for
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll results show that Raul Cubas from the ruling
Colorado Party and Domingo Laino from the opposition Democratic
Alliance are the two most promising candidates to win the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Cubas, 54, was named merely one month ago to replace former
general Lino Oviedo as the presidential candidate of the Colorado
Party. The latter was sentenced to 10 years in jail for an
attempted military coup in 1996.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- The member states of the the Southern Cone
Common Market announced a plan here on Friday to turn their common
market into a zone free of mass-destruction weapons.

as well as the high-power conventional arms as being capable of
causing mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Cone Common Market, also called the Expanded

<P>
Official statistics also showed that Brazil's investments in
science and technology registered an annual increase of 14 percent
during the past five years.
</P>

The report said that the region of Alberdi, 300 kilometers from
the capital of Asuncion, suffered most from the overflow of the
Paraguay and Parana rivers.

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- A lengthy frontpage article introduced the contributions a
missile test base affiliated to the Chinese Air Force, which is
located in a desert in northwest China, has made over the past
decades in developing the country's air force ordnance, such as
supersonic unmanned target drone and state-of-the-art air-to-air

Tojo, the top war criminal of the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newspaper carried on its second page a
caricature along with a poem satirizing the Japanese attempt to
distort history. The cartoon shows Hideki Tojo, carrying a
skeleton face and a blood-dripping Japanese sabre, hides under a
cloak of "peace-loving hero".

prestigious polytechnics based in Shanghai, have scored major

<P>
-- Liu Minxue, an economist and member of the CPPCC National
Committee, China's top advisory body, noted that the private
sector could possibly offer more than 5 million job opportunities

solution to the problem of re-employing laid-off workers from the
loss-suffering state-owned enterprises.

"Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,

<HEADLINE> Jiangxi Province Set to Develop Three Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi Province's
deputy governor, Wu Changqing, said during a recent commodities
fair here that his province will lay emphasis on the development
of three areas between now and the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Development will center on areas along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi
Railway, as well as the economic belt along the Yangtze River and
Poyang Lake, and along the Beijing-Kowloon Railway.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi, located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze
River, is the hub of three economic development zones -- the Pearl
River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, and southeastern delta area in
Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi province has abundant mineral and agriculture
resources. The provincial government had approved 4,366
foreign-funded enterprises by the end of 1997, with total
investments standing at 3.69 billion US dollars. The province had
approved 850 Taiwan-funded enterprises by the end of March this
year, with total investments of 1.5 billion US dollars allocated
to some 80-odd project areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the provincial government has engaged in extensive
efforts to improve infrastructure facilities. All counties and
townships are currently linked by program-controlled telephones,
with the province's total installed generating capacity standing
at 5.02 million kw. The new Beijing-Kowloon railway has greatly
improved Jiangxi's transportation network.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has also introduced regulations to
improve the local investment environment and protect the rights of
investors.

SHANGHAI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Dropping in on the Web site
www.shanghaicommerce.com on the Internet can provide a panoramic
view of Shanghai's renowned Nanjing Boulevard, as famous in its
own way as Oxford Street in London and Broadway in New York City.
</P>
<P>
As one of 10 projects aimed at building Shanghai into an

<P>
A "surfer" at an Internet bar in the municipality's
Jinlingdonglu Street said: "Window shopping on the Web is easy and
interesting, and I can obtain up-to-date commercial information as
well."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> World Population to Reach Eight Billion in 2025 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The world population will reach
eight billion in 2025 compared to 5.8 billion in 1997, the World
Health Organization (WHO) predicts.
</P>
<P>
Although women will be having fewer babies in 2025, an average
of 2.3 compared to 2.9 in 1995 and 5.0 in 1955, the world will
never have been so densely populated, said WHO in its World Health
Report 1998 published here Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the population under the age of 20 will be only 32
percent of the total compared to 40 percent now.
</P>
<P>
The following are other features of life in the 21st century
outlined by WHO in its annual report:
</P>
<P>
- Every day in 1997, about 365,000 babies were born, and about
140,000 people died, giving a natural increase of about 220,000
people day;
</P>
<P>
- More people will live in cities than ever before. About 59
percent will live in urban areas and only 41 percent in rural
areas. In 1995 the ratio was 55 percent rural and 45 percent
urban. In 1955, 68 percent of the global population was rural;
</P>
<P>
- In industrialized countries, heart disease, stroke and cancer
will remain the leading causes of death. As deaths from heart
disease and stroke decline, deaths from some cancers will increase;
</P>
<P>
- In developing countries, these noncommunicable diseases will
become more prevalent, largely due to the adoption of "western"
lifestyles and their accompanying risk factors. But infectious
diseases, mainly HIV/AIDS and possibly tuberculosis, will still be
a major burden.

<HEADLINE> Global Population Ageing Goes Fast in Next 25 Years: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The global population aged 65 and above
is likely to grow by 88 percent in the next 25 years, almost a million
people a month, predicts the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the working age population will
increase only 45 percent, WHO says in its World Health Report 1998
-- Life in the 21st Century -- published here Monday.
</P>
<P>
This implies that a relative decline in the number of people in the
productive age group will have to provide for an expanding number of
older dependants, not merely in the form of direct support to older
relatives, but also through taxation for the provision of health and
social services, and social security.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining health and quality of life in ageing populations will
be vitally important, socially and economically," the WHO report says.
"In the 21st century, postponing the adverse effects of old age for as
long as possible will be a major political and personal
preoccupation."
</P>
<P>
The report points out that health-related policies are needed for
those already in old age and those who will be the older people of the
future.
</P>
<P>
"As people live longer they must plan throughout life to take
better care of themselves, on the assumption that a large proportion
of their lives will extend beyond what have traditionally been
regarded as their most productive years," WHO says.
</P>
<P>
WHO advises people to take greater responsibility for their health
at the earliest opportunity, adopting habits such as a healthy diet,
adequate exercise and avoidance of tobacco early in life and
maintaining them for the rest of their years.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that most countries are now seeking alternative
types of welfare packages, such as combinations of public sector and
private sector health insurance and pension schemes, funded by direct
or indirect taxation and voluntary contributions, that will ensure
long-term care for older people.
</P>
<P>
Lamenting that the social status and well-being of countless
millions of women worldwide remains tragically low, WHO calls on the
international community to put more emphasis to women's health.
</P>
<P>
As the global population ages, there will be more females among the
older population.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that longer lives for women are also years of quality,
WHO stresses, policies aimed at ensuring the best possible health for
women as they age, should be geared to the problems that begin in
infancy or childhood, and should cover the whole lifespan, through
adolescence and adulthood into old age.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Hosts Breakfast Meeting to Ensure Honest Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Philippine President Fidel
Ramos hosted a breakfast meeting Sunday with candidates running
for president and vice president, the Presidential New Desk said.
</P>
<P>
The breakfast meeting began at 7:30 a.m. as scheduled and the
holding of "honest, orderly and peaceful" polls is the primary
concern of the meeting, it said.
</P>
<P>
As of late Saturday, six presidential candidates had accepted
the president's invitation and confirmed their participation.
</P>
<P>
The other guests invited are key government officials,
religious groups and heads of citizen monitoring groups.
</P>
<P>
During the breakfast, chiefs of the Commission on Elections,
the Philippine National Police, the Armed Forces of the
Philippines and other departments concerned were to introduce the
status of preparation for the elections.
</P>
<P>
Fraud, cheating and violence are feared in the elections. It
was reported that at least 33 people have died in election-related
violence.
</P>
<P>
The presidential bets attending the meeting were House Speaker
Jose de Venecia of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party, Vice President
Joseph Estrada of the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight
of Patriotic Filipino Masses), former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim of
the Liberal Party, former Defense Secretary Renato de Villa of the
Democratic Reform Coalition Party, Emilio Osmena of the
Progressive Movement for Devolution of Initiative Party and Manuel
Morato of the Partido Bansang Marangal (Decent Nation Party).
</P>
<P>
Former First Lady Imelda Marcos Saturday officially withdrew
from the contest, deciding to support Estrada who led with a 33
percent popularity rating in a latest survey. De Venecia followed
with 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
After Imelda's quit, 10 candidates are running for the
presidency in Monday's polls. Also at stake are the vice
presidency, 12 out of 24 senators, 250 House representatives, 78
provincial governors and some 1600 local mayors.

social services, and social security.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining health and quality of life in ageing populations will
be vitally important, socially and economically," the WHO report says.
"In the 21st century, postponing the adverse effects of old age for as
long as possible will be a major political and personal
preoccupation."
</P>
<P>
The report points out that health-related policies are needed for
those already in old age and those who will be the older people of the
future.
</P>
<P>
"As people live longer they must plan throughout life to take
better care of themselves, on the assumption that a large proportion
of their lives will extend beyond what have traditionally been
regarded as their most productive years," WHO says.
</P>
<P>
WHO advises people to take greater responsibility for their health
at the earliest opportunity, adopting habits such as a healthy diet,
adequate exercise and avoidance of tobacco early in life and
maintaining them for the rest of their years.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that most countries are now seeking alternative
types of welfare packages, such as combinations of public sector and
private sector health insurance and pension schemes, funded by direct
or indirect taxation and voluntary contributions, that will ensure
long-term care for older people.
</P>
<P>
Lamenting that the social status and well-being of countless
millions of women worldwide remains tragically low, WHO calls on the
international community to put more emphasis to women's health.
</P>
<P>
As the global population ages, there will be more females among the
older population.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that longer lives for women are also years of quality,
WHO stresses, policies aimed at ensuring the best possible health for
women as they age, should be geared to the problems that begin in
infancy or childhood, and should cover the whole lifespan, through
adolescence and adulthood into old age.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's first ecological museum is
under construction in the southwest province of Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the museum, being jointly built with help
from the government of Norway, is also the first of its kind in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The museum, located in the central part of Guizhou, is intended
to protect the folk culture of the Changjiao Miao ethnic group, a
branch of the Miao nationality.
</P>
<P>
Ecological museums are a new kind of museum which protect the
natural and cultural legacy of communities.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 300 ecological museums worldwide, most
of them located in Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
The 4,000-strong Changjiao Miao ethnic group gets its name from
its custom of wearing head ornaments in the shape of long horns.
</P>
<P>
They live in 12 villages, and still preserve their ancient folk
customs and beliefs today.
</P>
<P>
The construction of this ecological museum was started last
June and is expected to be completed and opened to the public next
year.

HANOI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and the United States will
hold their fifth round of negotiations on the conclusion of a
bilateral trade agreement, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported
Saturday.

<P>
During the negotiations which will be held in the U.S. on May

Vietnam and the U.S. began their first round of trade talks in

</P>
<P>
During the previous four rounds of talks, the U.S. side made
in-depth inquiries into Vietnam's laws and briefed the Vietnamese

delegation, Tran Dinh Luong, was quoted by the VNA as saying.
</P>

According to Luong, the U.S. side will not grant Vietnam the

<HEADLINE> "Russian Street" Market to Be Moved Indoors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Every day, hundreds of foreign
tourists flock to the outdoor Yabao Road Garment Wholesale Market
here to buy cheap but quality garments specially designed for
foreigners in terms of style, pattern and size.
</P>
<P>
Within a few months, however, the market, known as "Russian
Street" because of the number of Russian and Eastern European
traders doing business there, will no longer be in the open, as
the vendors are to be moved into the brand-new Beijing Jili
Mansion, the construction of which is being funded by a Malaysian
company to the tune of 320 million yuan (38.55 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has already launched a program to
clear the streets by relocating all outdoor market places in the
urban districts to indoor venues.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, when the six-story Jili Mansion is
completed, more than 4,000 businessmen will be moved from their
outdoor stands in the 10 year-old Yabao Road market.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the Jili Mansion, with a total
floor space of 30,000 sq m, will not only accommodate the garment
wholesale market but also a three-star hotel with more than 180
rooms, and other facilities including restaurants and recreation
sites.
</P>
<P>
For the past decade the 400-m-long Yabao Road has been home to
the largest outdoor shopping area -- and the biggest retail export
center -- in the Chinese capital. It exports some one billion US
dollars-worth of garments annually, 40 percent of the city's total.

LAGOS -- The remnants of the junta forces and rebel allies have
killed at least 50 people in northern Sierra Leone in a fresh
round of persecution of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The junta remnants and rebels, who were driven out of the
capital Freetown in mid-February, Friday also burnt down several
others in villages some 70 miles from Makeni, a major town in the
north of the war-ravaged country, according to a British
Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a local priest as saying that the people in
that area were persecuted because they firmly supported President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who was reinstated in March after the fall of
the junta.
</P>
<P>
The remnants of the junta forces and their rebel allies then
retreated to the northern and eastern parts of the country, where
the west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) has been carrying
our an operation to mop up them. (Sierra Leone-Junta-Killings)

<HEADLINE> More People to Enjoy Healthier, Longer Life Next Century: WHO </HEADLINE>

<P>
GENEVA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Deaths before the age of 50 years
will be cut by half by the year 2025, the World Health
Organization (WHO) predicts in a report published here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the World Health Report 1998, WHO says that global life
expectancy at birth, now 66 years, is projected to reach 73 years
by 2025.
</P>
<P>
"The most important pattern of progress now emerging in general
is an unmistakable trend towards healthier, longer life," says the
report.
</P>
<P>
However, WHO warns, in 1998 a total of 21 million people, two
out of every five worldwide, will die before reaching the age of
50 years, defined as premature deaths, including 10 million
children who will die before their fifth birthday.
</P>
<P>
"Tragically, while average life expectancy has been increasing
throughout the 20th century, three out of four people in the least
developed countries today are dying before the age of 50, the
global life expectancy figure of half a century ago," says WHO
Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima on the occasion of the
report's publication.
</P>
<P>
"Reducing these premature deaths is one of the greatest
challenges facing humanity at the dawn of the 21st century,"
Nakajima stresses.

The 17-year-old American did not always handle her Spanish

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Child Care Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
released new child care guidelines Saturday and pressed Congress
to act on his child care reforms.
</P>
<P>
The president also criticized a bankruptcy reform provision
pending before Congress that would force mothers seeking child
support to compete with banks and credit card companies for
payment when fathers file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
"That's not the law now, and if that competition starts, we all
know who will lose the contest -- the children," Clinton said in
his weekly radio address. "They shouldn't have to stand in line
for the support they need."
</P>
<P>
The weekly radio speech was dedicated to Mothers' Day Sunday
and focused on what Clinton said was government's responsibility
to help parents.
</P>
<P>
"There is no substitute for a mother's love or a parent's
responsibility. We, too, in the national and state governments,
however, have a responsibility," Clinton said. "Today and every
other day we should... do everything in our power to give our
mothers the peace of mind they deeply deserve."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration issued two sets of guidelines: a
step-by-step consumer guide from the Department of Health and
Human Services for parents shopping for child care, and Justice
Department advice on screening care-givers hired to work with
children, the elderly and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines recommended include criminal checks through the
FBI's fingerprint records. Clinton has asked Congress to pass
legislation eliminating state barriers to checking criminal
backgrounds of child care workers. That plan must be approved by
Congress and all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in his address, also promoted his 21.7-billion-dollar
package to subsidize child care for working families, the
legislation languishing in Congress, where some Republicans want
to aid stay-at-home moms and others want to use available money to
cut taxes for families instead.
