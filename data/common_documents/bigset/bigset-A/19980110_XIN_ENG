<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation In Yangtze River Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan plan to join
in tapping the resources in the middle and upper reaches of the
Yangtze River Valley in order to take the advantage of
opportunities arising from construction of the world's largest
hydropower station.
</P>
<P>
According to Guo Shuyan, vice-minister of the State Planning
Commission, high priority projects include establishing a rape
seed production base and edible oil refinery in central China's
Hubei Province, construction of a container port and sewage
treatment plant in Chongqing municipality, and a 12-mw hydropower
plant on a tributary to the Yangtze, said Guo.
</P>
<P>
The governments of China and Japan are concerned about the
construction of forest belt networks in the upper and middle
reacheds of the Yangtze and protection of ecological environment
in the Three Gorges Area, said Guo, who was attending a seminar on
techniques to preserve environmental protection in the Yangtze
River Valley. The seminar covered afforestation and the disposal
of sewage water and emissions.
</P>
<P>
Guo went on to say the fact that the Three Gorges Project has
basically altered the river course in the upper reaches of the
Yangtze will require China to reconstruct or extend ports in
Chongqing Municipality and its Wanxian and Fuling counties.
</P>
<P>
China is currently conducting the early-phase feasibility
studies for constructing a railway linking Chongqing and Wuhan,
the capital of Hubei Province.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Launches Horticultural Directory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The 1997-98 horticultural
directory was launched in Harare today and was immediately
dispatched to Zimbabwe's foreign missions.
</P>
<P>
The directory provides information on producers of various
horticulture products and sources of materials, equipment and
machinery in the country.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for foreign affairs Andrew Mtetwa said, "we must
prepare for a day when we are to pay duty and still be
competitive, those in the industry must keep a good quality of
their products and all connections abroad."
</P>
<P>
Under Lome IV, African, Carribean and Pacific countries
enjoyed duty free access into European markets for specifidc
products. But Lome IV will expire in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean horticulture industry has been a key player in
the economy and export markets.
</P>
<P>
Floriculture exports for instance grew from 3.1 million
Zimbabwe dollars in 1985 to 500 million dollars in 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
Currently one U.S. dollar equals to 17 Zimbabwe dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mtetwa said, "I would like to point out that the government
supports and appreciates the efforts that have been made to
promote and expand the horticulture industry."
</P>
<P>
He also encouraged cooperation between the government and the
private sector, "it is beneficial to both of us in that in
marketing your horticulture industry, you in turn also market
Zimbabwe."

<HEADLINE> New Seedlings Helps Chinese Sugarcane Grower Increase Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A new type of sugarcane, which
is still in trial use, is expected to help China's top sugarcane
producer increase its output substantially.
</P>
<P>
Chongzuo County, in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, has maintained an annual sugarcane output of about 1.8
million tons. Guangxi itself is also the country's number one
sugarcane grower.
</P>
<P>
However, because the county has for a long time mainly relied
on one type, the "Guitang-11", it has become increasingly
difficult for it to raise its output.
</P>
<P>
In order to overcome this situation, in 1996, the county spent
500,000 yuan (60,200 US dollars) on a factory that can produce a
million seedlings a year of a new variety, "Xintaitang-16". With
it, the county planted 670 hectares of sugarcane last year,
raising the per hectare average output from 60 tons to 85 tons,
and a sugar production ratio from 13.5 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The county plans to grow 1,300 hectares of sugarcane with the
new variety this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary Mo
Mowlam said on Friday her talks with loyalist inmates in the Maze
prison near Belfast was "useful and constructive".
</P>
<P>
The minister spent more than three hours inside the prison,
urging the Protestant extremists to back a drive for peace in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
BBC quoted Mowlam as telling reporters that she had given the
inmates a 14-point plan and stressed that "Nobody is going to get
anything if we don't have a talks process."
</P>
<P>
The loyalist paramilitaries at the prison rewarded Mowlam's
courageous initiative by voting to renew their backing for
multi-party talks on a peace settlement soon after the talks with
Mowlam.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the loyalist prisoners decided to give the
go-ahead to their political arm, the Ulster Democratic Party, to
attend the peace talks when they resume in Belfast on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The loyalist prisoners, who wield extraordinary influence over
the Protestant political parties, withdrew support early this week
after the release of some IRA inmates and demanded similar
concessions, plunging the fragile peace process into further
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Expected to Have Normal Rainfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is expected to have a
normal rainfall season this year despite the much-dreaded El Nino
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The latest SADC Food Security Monthly Update said normal to
above average rainfall conditions have been observed in the
northern, central and southeastern parts of the region,
enveloping Zimbabwe and the northern and eastern parts of Angola
and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Similar observations have been made in other regional states
such as Malawi, central and southern Mozambique, Swaziland and
the northern parts of neighbouring South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Near normal to above normal rainfall was recorded in more than
80 percent of southern Africa last year during the period
covering October to early December.
</P>
<P>
However, elsewhere in the SADC region, dry conditions and a
slow start to the season has been noted with cumulative seasonal
rainfall recorded below normal with areas affected being Lesotho,
Botswana, Namibia, the rest of south Africa and central and
southern Angola.
</P>
<P>
Deputy director of the Zimbabwe Farmers Union Emerson Zhou
today said, "the first week of January has been good and if the
early planted maize crop receives some more rains up to the end
of February the crop will pull through."
</P>
<P>
He said the late planted crop would require sufficient rains
up to the end of March or April. The union was optimistic if the
rains continue for a little longer.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Climbs Higher in December 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Unemployment rate
picked up slightly in December to 4.7 percent but still making
1997 the best year in the last 24 years, the Labor Department
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The average for the whole year of 1997, 4.9 percent, was the
best since an identical rate of 4.9 percent in 1973, the
department said. Unemployment hasn't been lower since 1969, when
it was 3.5 percent and the highest was recorded in 1982 with 9.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
December's seasonally adjusted annual rate of unemployment, up
from 4.6 percent in November, still was substantially lower than
the rate at the start of the year, 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Employers added a larger-than-expected 370,000 jobs in
December, bringing U.S. payrolls to 123.9 million. That's 3.2
million more than a year earlier, the largest number of jobs
created since payrolls grew by 3.9 million jobs in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that there will be no much change in 1998 in
the health of labor markets. They expect the unemployment rate
will decline toward 4.5 percent, or a shade lower, before rising
late in the year toward 5 percent.

JOHANNESBURG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 election
officials have been deployed throughout Lesotho to ensure that
all eligible voters register to vote in the general election in
April, South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) Chairman Sekara Mafisa
said despite a few hitches, registration was progressing well.
</P>
<P>
He said while he expected registration to be completed on
schedule, heavy rains and flooding had caused delays in certain
areas.
</P>
<P>
The IEC had set aside six weeks for the work, but registration
could be extended in areas where flooding rivers made access to
the Lesotho interior difficult.
</P>
<P>
Mafisa said helicopters would also have to be used to
transport materials and personnel to inaccessible areas.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the nation would support the registration drive,
which started Monday. He stressed that political party leaders
had the right to monitor the process.
</P>
<P>
In terms of Lesotho's electoral law, every political party
contesting an election has the right to monitor the registration
of voters through its designated representatives.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Central Rural Work Conference (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Saturday edition of
the People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, carries an editorial
entitled "Stablizing and Reinforcing Agriculture", hailing the
holding of the Central Rural Work Conference.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, which concluded here today, once
again exhibited the determination of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee to place top priority on agriculture in economic
development and adhere to the principle of stablizing and
reinforcing agriculture and the work in rural areas,
the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses the importance of implementing the
essence of the conference and continuously working hard to resolve
all the issues concerning agriculture and the countryside in order
to maintain a sound development in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
China has recorded three good harvests in three successive
years since 1995. As a result, the output of major farm produce
has increased remarkably in both urban and rural areas, which enjoy
an abundant supply of farm products, according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The income of Chinese farmers has continued to grow and their
living standards have improved apace, with poverty eradication
efforts in the countryside promoting both social progress and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The editorial attributes the achievements to the fact that the
governments at various levels have implemented the policies of the
central government for reinforcing agriculture and that top priority
has been placed on protecting interests of farmers and their
enthusiasm for production.

<P>
However, the editorial says, the people must remain even more
vigilant despite the good agricultural situation. It stresses that
agriculture can neither be relaxed nor ignored.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that China has a population of over
1.2 billion, but its farming level remains somewhat low and
requires further modernization. It adds that the weak
agricultural foundation cannot be changed in the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
The editorial suggests placing priority on agriculture
in the primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Many problems have emerged in the country following successive
years of good harvests, including difficulties in marketing farm
products and falling prices.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the income of farmers and the development of village
based industries have slowed down somewhat, according to the
editorial.
</P>
<P>
China must place priority on solving problems in the
agricultural sector, or agriculture will quite likely regress,
adversely affecting the growth of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The editorial urges strict adherence to the principles of
stablizing and reinforcing agriculture. Priority must be placed on
implementing all the Party's policies concerning the development
of the countryside in order to encourage and protect the
initiatives of the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Successive good harvests have proved the correctness of the
Party's policies which must be continously carried out seriously,
says the editorial.

The editorial criticizes authorities in some localities for
working against the will of the farmers by random-readjusting
contracted land, charging excessive fees from them, or declining
to purchase surplus grain at protected government prices. Related
actions have sparked dissatisfaction among the farmers, according to
the editorial.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that related wrongful actions must be corrected, and
notes that the Party's rural policies are based on protecting the
interests of the farmers and fully mobilizing their initiatives.
</P>
<P>
China's agricultural sector is in a new stage in the
transformation from traditional self-sufficiency to a modern
commodity economy and new problems are likely to surface, the
editorial says. It adds that the emerging problems must be handled
in a timely manner to prevent any hindrance on the development of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls for local officials to change their styles
of work and adopt substantial and effective measures to deal with
the problems.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that special attention must be paid to matters such
as investments for agriculture, reductions in levies on the
farmers, and strengthening local Party organizations.
</P>
<P>
The editorial urges localities to deal with the problems in a
creative manner since different areas have different levels of
economic development.

<HEADLINE> German Unemployment Rising to New Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- German unemployment rose to a new
record high of over 4.52 million in December, exceeding earlier
projections, which signalled doubtful prospects for the country's
job market this year.
</P>
<P>
Labour office president Bernhard Jagoda said while he hoped for
a change for the better, more efforts should be made to prevent
unemployment from worsening.
</P>
<P>
"All in all, the economic dynamics were not strong enough to
revive the job market", he said, warning that Germany was not far
from breaking the level of five million unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The data released Friday by the Nuremberg-based Federal Labour
Office showed Germany's joblessness increased by a seasonally
unadjusted 199,900 in December to 4,521,600, or 11.8 percent,
compared to earlier projected rise of between 130,000 and 180,000.
</P>
<P>
In November, unemployment was 11.3 percent. The December
jobless figure also ran 373,400 higher than in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the country's western area, joblessness rose by 122,900 to
top 3.06 million, or 9.9 percent. In the eastern part, the jobless
total was up 77,000 to reach some 1.46 million for a rate of 19.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
For the year 1997 as a whole, Germany's unemployment averaged
4.383 million, or 11.4 percent, about 420,000 higher than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to Friday's labour market news, German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl admitted for the first time that his ambitious goal of
cutting German unemployment in half by 2000 was not realistic.
"This certainly cannot be reached", he said.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Peter Hausmann said the December figure
was "unacceptable high", adding that he hoped the government's
reform program would help create more jobs.

<P>
The government was expecting an up to three percent economic
growth this year, he said.

Major opposition Social Democrats termed the December jobless

PARIS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- France Friday criticized Israel for
its new projects to build Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and
called for the scrapping of these projects.

"The settlement is contrary to the international law and harms
the final status of the Palestinian territories which should be

French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.

Israel plans to build 500 new housing units in the Efrat

"We hope that the announcement of the extension of the Efrat
settlement will not be confirmed at a moment when international

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Fears of economic collapse in
Indonesia shook the world financial market over the past few days
and sent prices of many stock exchanges down at weekend.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street stocks plunged in early trading today. At 11:51
a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
132.77 points at 7,669.85, extending Thursday's 99-point drop.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes also sank early today.
</P>
<P>
Investors fear that continued problems in Asia will eventually
hurt the U.S. economy and erode more corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian markets tumbled further Friday after a panicky
selloff Thursday. A key stock market index in the Philippines
tumbled more than 8 percent today to its lowest level in almost
five years, while prices in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong
Kong, Thailand, and South Korea also finished lower. Hong Kong
stocks fell 3.3 percent, extending losses of the previous two
days.
</P>
<P>
The only good news came out of Indonesia, where the main stock
index fell only 1.2 percent after a devastating 12 percent plunge
Thursday. That followed President Suharto's promise to implement
sweeping economic reform under an International Monetary Fund
bailout plan.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
might cut off aid if urgent steps were not taken to tighten the
economy of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
But the latest turmoil in Southeast Asia failed to shake
several other key markets. Tokyo's Nikkei stock average fell just
0.2 percent, Frankfurt's DAX index fell 2.5 percent. In afternoon
trading, London's FT-SE 100 was down 1.6 percent.

ADDIS ABABA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Administration for
Refugee and Returnee Affairs of Ethiopia announced today that
Sudanese refugees residing at various quarters of Addis Ababa are
being transported to camps where they can receive proper aid.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement quoted by the official Ethiopian News
Agency, the administration said from today on, the refugees are
being transported to the camps prepared for them.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the refugees had left the camps and spread
around the city had made the aid distribution arduous, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The refugees have been supported by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The administration urged Sudanese refugees, who reside in
Addis Ababa and have applied for refugee status and not yet
registered, to approach the administration and register with it.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not disclose the number of Sudanese refugees
residing in Addis Ababa. But, according to the UNHCR, Ethiopia
is host to close to 350,000 Somali and Sudanese refugees
throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Lusaka High Court Condemns Comments on Kaunda's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Lusaka Hight Court condemned
today the comments by Richard Sakala, press aide and advisor to
President Frederick Chiluba, that former president and opposition
leader Kenneth Kaunda's detention is legal, Zambia News Agency
ZANA reported.
</P>
<P>
Justice James Mutale said in the court during Kaunda's habeas
corpus hearing that the court takes great exception to Sakala's
comments and cautioned him to avoid stepping on the toes of the
court.
</P>
<P>
He also warned all counsels and members of the bar to desist
from making extra judicial comments which have a direct bearing
on the hearing.
</P>
<P>
"I will not hesitate to impose full court sanctions on
officers of the court and members of the bar who do otherwise,"
said the justice.
</P>
<P>
Sakala, as the State House spokesman, said yesterday that the
detention of Kaunda was within the legal bindings which
government correctly adhered to.
</P>
<P>
He also observed that although 70 days has elapsed without the
state's charging the coup-related suspects, the period is within
the bounds of law.
</P>
<P>
However, Attorney General Bonaventure Mutale today apologised
for the comments on behalf of Sakala and undertook to guide him
and other government officials who would want to commnet on the
case before it is concluded.
</P>
<P>
The jurisdiction of the court should not be seen to be
undermined by any government organ, said the attorney general,
adding that he would ensure that the integrity of the court is
protected.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was arrested last December and later shifted to house
arrest for alleged involvement into an abortive military coup in
October 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) expressed
its concern here today over the Israeli government's decision to
set up more Jewish settlements on the disputed West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the 15-nation bloc, British Foreign Office
Minister Derek Fatchett, whose country is the current EU
president, said in a statement: "We are disturbed by today's
reports of further Israeli settlement building in the West Bank."
</P>
<P>
"This development is particularly damaging at a time when the
U.S., the EU and the international community are intensifying
their efforts to achieve a breakthrough in the (Middle East) peace
process," Fatchett said.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett stressed that the EU position is clear: "settlements
are both illegal under international law and damaging to the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
The British minister also urged Israel and Palestine to
exercise restraint to "avoid counter-productive unilateral actions
of this kinds."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Israeli government on Wednesday
decided to go ahead with the construction of 574 new housing units
on the disputed West Bank.

<P>
KHARTOUM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese forces managed to
repel an attack launched by the Eritrean forces against the
northeastern border town of Medessia,
</P>
<P>
The attackers suffered heavy losses and fled back to the
Eritrean territories, the local daily Al-Anbaa quoted today a
statement issued by Sudan's Kassala provincial government as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The attackers left behind them many casualties and large
quantities of explosives that were seized by the Sudanese forces,
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Sudan accuses Eritrea of
involvement in such attacks against Medessia. Sudan accused
Eritrea of launching a similar attack last June.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese opposition alliance is reportedly based in Eritrea
from where it launches cross-border attacks on the Sudanese forces.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea severed its relations with Sudan in December 4, 1994,
after it accused Sudan of backing the Eritrean rebels. Eritrean
President Assiais Afwerki stated in June, 1996 that his country
supports any armed activities that aim at toppling the Sudanese
government.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Needs Fund to Combat Water Polution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq needs millions of
U.S. dollars to rebuild its drinking water stations in a bid to
ease the severe crisis in the public health caused by water
pollution.
</P>
<P>
An official of the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) said here today that Iraq would face a real health crisis
unless the ICRC and other non-governmental organizations undertake
to rebuild the water stations in the country.
</P>
<P>
Frank Bertlsek, a spokesman of the committee's office in
Baghdad, said "We have no specific figures, but the water
pollution in Iraq has already affected the public health."
</P>
<P>
The ICRC intends to allocate millions of U.S. dollars to
rehabilitating more than 50 drinking water and sanitary drainage
stations all over Iraq in 1998, he said, adding that these
stations were damaged due to the lack of spare parts, purifying
chemicals and funding.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC is working in coordination with the country's water
departments to rehabilitate the water stations, but the problem is
more acute in central and southern Iraq due to the shortage of
water, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The revamping and maintenance works will focus on 50 out of the
1,500 water stations nationwide. So far, only one station for
recycling the sanitary water is operational in Ad-Diwaniyah
province in southern Iraq, the official added.
</P>
<P>
In one of its reports on the water problem in Iraq, the ICRC
said the problem is so severe that the technical teams which are
less qualified are unable to cope with it and the water facilities
and equipment are getting obsolete.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC has started implementing a health program aimed at
rehabilatating 50 water stations in Iraq annually since 1991.
</P>

Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.

BAGHDAD, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official said here today
that Iraq has been cooperative with U.N. weapons inspectors since
the end of the standoff last November and inspections have gone
smoothly, the Iraqi news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
disarming Iraq said that "since November 22, the inspections have
been conducted in a smooth, professional and cordial manner."
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis have been cooperative," the spokesman said shortly
after four U.N. vehicles carrying inspectors headed for inspection
sites on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Last October, Iraq threatened to expel American personnels in
the U.N. weapons monitoring teams, which triggered a standoff
between Iraq and the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's mediation, Iraq allowed U.N. weapons inspectors
to return to Baghdad last November to resume their work.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in
1990 will not be lifted until the UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is
free of weapons of mass destructions. Iraq has declared for many
times that it has destroyed all its mass destructive weapons.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England's monetary
policy committee has left base rates unchanged at 7.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The no-change decision on interest rates on Thursday encouraged
foreign exchange dealers to sell sterling on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Sterling fell more than three marks to DM2.9349 and slid a cent
against the U.S. dollar to 1.6155 dollars - its lowest level since
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
However, it was believed here that the pound's retreat is
temporary given that any move in UK interest rates is still
expected to be upwards.
</P>
<P>
City economists said there was now an increasing perception
that rates will rise only a quarter point further and this was
starting to depress the pound.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) offered its support
for the Bank's decision. Its chief economist Kate Barker said the
data pointed to a slowdown in growth and a further rise would
"risk having too great an impact when the economy is already
expected to be sluggish".
</P>
<P>
The CBI's latest distributive trades survey found retail sales
volume in the last three months of the year was well below the
same period in 1996.

LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ethnic minorities are
almost twice as likely to be turned down as their white
counterparts when applying for job, local press reports revealed
Friday.

<P>
It was reported that there were also sharp variations

Bangladeshi and Afro-Caribbean origin the most disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
The fact was further reinforced by figures drawn up by
the Trade Union Congress from the official Labor Force

workers is nearly 19 percent, compared with seven
percent among white workers.

Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds of working black people

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Mideast Peace, Deadlocked for Way out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Talks were halted, violence
staged and signed agreements hardly carried out. The Mideast
peace process plunged to its lowest ever ebb in 1997 due to
Israel's hard-line policy, but still has a hope of revival.
</P>
<P>
The year started with the encouraging signing of the Hebron
redeployment agreement by Israelis and Palestinians, which only
proved to be the prelude of a stalemate in the peace process for
the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
The stalemate was triggered by Israel's construction of the
Har Homa settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March which was
ensued by an uproar from the whole Arab world and the breakdown
of talks.
</P>
<P>
The situation worsened as Palestinian radicals set off suicide
bombs in Jerusalem in July and September to claim hundreds of
casualties. Israelis tightened security measures over the
Palestinian self-rule areas in retaliation, while the
Palestinians launched an economic boycott.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlements kept on mushrooming on the lands the
Palestinians claim as part of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Syrian and Lebanese tracks of the peace process
were in no better condition at all, even short of a notable
mediation attempt to reactivate the negotiations with the
Israelis suspended since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Likud government's practice of replacing the
land-for-peace principle, the cornerstone of the peace process,
with the security-for-peace formula was in full swing last year
and has been effective enough in bogging down the whole peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The government seized on anything relating to security as the
excuse to break its peace promises. The Hebron agreement was
hardly carried out as a result. Easing of the economic block on
the Palestinians was only conditioned on the arrest of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The government's stance of not giving up the occupied Golan
Heights kept Syria well away from the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Israel's hardline policy invoked the Arab world's strong
reaction and the international community's condemnation. The Arab
countries adopted a resolution in March to suspend normalization
of relations with Israel. A half number of them boycotted the
regional economic conference held in Doha, Qatar, in November,
simply to snub the Israeli attendance.
</P>
<P>
But the pressures were largely nullified by the United States
which vetoed twice the passing of U.N. Security Council
resolutions lashing out at its Middle East strategic ally's
settlement projects.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the most influential mediator in the
Mideast peace, was blamed for sitting on its hands through most
of the year. Other peace makers like Europe and Russia, despite
their continuous efforts, are still not in the position to
challenge the U.S. in taming Israel.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Mideast Peace, Deadlocked for Way out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 9 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
But there was a moderate change witnessed in U.S. policy -- it
slightly corrected its bias toward Israel to urge a time-out of
the settlement plan and the resumption of peace talks -- only
after Washington found it was losing Arab friends.
</P>
<P>
For now, the good news is that the peace talks were resumed
under U.S. mediation after a seven-month freeze; the bad news is
that they are in dilemma again.
</P>
<P>
It has to be pointed out that the deadlock does not mean an end
to the peace process, as none of the parties concerned slammed the
door of negotiations. This might have proved that no party in the
process wants to return to war and bloodshed, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The growing international community's pressure, particularly
that from Washington, and the increasingly strong call for peace
within Israel will help make a peace progress hopeful, they said.
</P>
<P>
After all, the troubled situation shuts out any big jump
forward as the gaps are too wide to be closed shortly. Netanyahu
has proposed to blend the phased redeployments in the West Bank as
already agreed upon in just one operation and as a part of the
final-status talks. The Palestinians brushed off the idea as a
ploy to avoid implementing the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
As for the scope of troop pullout, it was indicated that
Israel would hand over no more than 40-50 percent of the West Bank
to the Palestinian National Authority in the final settlement, far
short of the over 80 percent demanded by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
While no date has been set for resuming the Israeli-Syrian
peace talks, Israelis and Palestinians are now at loggerheads
over relatively minor issues like a halt to the settlement
projects, the opening of Gaza airport and sea port, and creating a
safe passage between the Palestinian self-rule Gaza Strip and the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Even if these problems are solved, the much more sensitive
final status bargains, scheduled to conclude in 1999, over the
status of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, borders and Palestinian
statehood are expected to be extremely tough.
</P>
<P>
Many Arab analysts pin the hope of progress on a change within
Israel, that is the collapse of the Likud government or the birth
of a national unity government involving moderate parties. In
fact, Netanyahu has been struggling in putting together his own
ranks, which are falling apart over disputes on peace process and
an evident lack of confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
As the Palestinians vow to announce their statehood next year
in spite of anything out of the negotiations, the year 1998 is
expected to be eventful and crucial to the peace process. And
observers pointed out that greater efforts, patience and
self-restraint are all in all to keep the peace march moving
ahead.

<HEADLINE> Senior Rwandan Officer Appears in Court on Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Rwandan government
officer appeared in the Kigali military court today to respond to
charges of killing 30 civilians during the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
The defendant, Major Samuel Bigabiron, is accused of having
misused military order and slaughtering 30 civilians during the
1994 genocide at Gihara in Runda, 12 kms west of the capital
Kigali, the Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The murder took place on July 1-2, 1994 in Runda.
</P>
<P>
During today's hearing, the prosecutor blamed this senior
officer for indiscriminately killing the civilians, without any
prior examination whether they were "Interahamwe" militia or not.
</P>
<P>
Bigabiro ordered his escorts to kill them, despite clear
instructions from the army high command to protect
non-combatants.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor accused Bigabiro of having ordered the massacre
to cover up sexual violence he had committed against a mother and
her daughter, fearing that the peasants will denounce him.
</P>
<P>
In his defense, Bigabiro rejected charges claiming that he
killed those people because they were the enemy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The court will resume the hearing next Tuesday. If he is found
guilty, Bigabioro risks life sentence according to the Rwandan
laws.

<HEADLINE> Russian Federal Council to Help Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The main task of the Russian
Federal Council for 1998 is to help power branches in developing
economy, Chairman of the Federal Council Yegor Stroyev said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a session of the Federal Council, Stroyev noted
that "the economic situation is still grave, although there are
some grounds for optimism."
</P>
<P>
This year, in his opinion, the parliament should concentrate on
basic economic laws, including a legislative provision of the tax
reform. "We should finally cut the tax burden," Stroyev said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the Russian parliament should focus on
state building this year. The existent administrative system in
Russia "appeared to be insufficiently efficient and, what is the
most dangerous, mutually uncontrolled", he said.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev said that an acute problem facing the country is the
development of federative relations.
</P>
<P>
He added that an uncontrolled establishment of agreement
relations between the federal authorities and regions, which does
not have a clear legal basis, results in an economic and political
inequality of regions and inflicts a considerable economic damage
on many large areas.

LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- All the three major stock markets
in Europe suffered heavy losses and ended sharply down Friday,
knocked by both Wall Street's tumble and Asian markets' turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares ended down nearly
two percent, or 98.8 points lower at 5,138.3, depressed by renewed
worries over Asian financial crisis and and fresh Dow weakness.
The index fell 55.2 points during the week.

The London market suffered a knee-jerk reaction to
stronger-than-expected US payroll figures, with the FTSE index
down by more than 100 points after the news.
</P>
<P>
Banking and insurance stocks posted losses as profit- takers
moved in.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt also ended in negative territory and
barely above the day's lows, tracking the weaker dollar and
following turbulence in Asian markets.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Goverment to Continue Regional Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- New Kenyan Foreign Minister
Bonaya Godana said today that the country will continue its
efforts to broke peace in Great Lakes Region and the Horn of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, which chairs the seven-member Inter-Governmental
Authority of Development (IGAD), will continue to devote itself
to the mediation of the 14-year-old Sudan civil war and to the
improvement of infrastructure in the IGAD area, he said.
</P>
<P>
It will also play an active role in the Great Lakes
region where sanctions on Burundi and ethnic clashes in Rwanda
are among key factors posing threats to the stability of the
region, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In line with the Kenyan constitution, it is the privilege of
newly re-elected President Daniel arap Moi to shape the east
African country's foreign polices, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked for the prospect of Kenya's relations with the west, he
just said that it will be a "challenging" task for him to smooth them
and that he cannot answer more until he familiarizes the
ministry's affairs.
</P>
<P>
Kenya saw relatively uneven ties with the west last year, the
year of elections. On July 31, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) cut a 205-million-Dollar three-year aid package to Kenya,
citing corruption and low governmental efficiency as key reasons.
</P>
<P>
Moi, in power since 1978, repeated his pledges at the
inauguration ceremony on Monday to bitterly fight rampant
corruption so as to jump-start the economy in his fifth and final
five-year term.
</P>
<P>
He last night announced the list of new cabinet which showed a
major reshuffle with the replacement of ministers for finance and
foreign affairs and the installment of three new ministries. The
appointment of vice president has been delayed.
</P>
<P>
Simeon Nyachae replaces Musalia Mudavadi as new Finance
Minister while former Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka moved to
the Education Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Godana, an ethnic Somali from Kenya's northeastern region,
once served as the deputy speaker of parliament and an assistant
minister. He holds a doctorate in law from studies in Britain and
Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Greek, French Foreign Ministers Meet in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos discussed today with his French counterpart, Hubert
Vedrine, the European Union (EU) expansion and Turkey's reaction to
the decision by the EU in Luxemburg last month not to include it
in the list of nations waiting to join the group.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine, who arrived here Thursday from Turkey, also had talks
earlier today with Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos and Prime
Minister Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
France believed that it was in the interests of both Europe and
Turkey for the latter to attend the Paris-proposed European
conference for prosective candidate members, said Vedrine after
his talks with Pangalos.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that he did not know Ankara's current position on
the issue, but he added that Turkey's reaction up till now had
been "negative."
</P>
<P>
After its failure in Luxemburg last month, Turkey warned that
it would suspend its political dialogue with the EU.
</P>
<P>
As for the illegal Kurdish immigrants from Turkey, Vedrine
urged the EU and the Schengen accord countries to cooperate closely
while calling on Turkey to exercise tighter control of its
borders.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Last month, Greece expressed its opposition to the
holding of such a conference, saying that Athens considered it
unnecessary because the content of the conference was unclear and
issues for discussion had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
Greece also insisted that if Turkey wanted to participate in
the conference, it would have to accept three conditions, namely
the jurisdiction of the international court at the Hague, the
unimpeded course of Cyprus toward EU accession, and progress in
the talks for solving the Cyprus issue on the basis of U.N.
resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Warned of Army Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The out-going chief of the west
African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG today warned against a
threat to peace in Liberia if the government insists on restructuring
the national army without the aid from the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECOMOG chief Victor Malu, the present restructuring
of the Liberian army is a government effort to transform the former
warring faction led by President Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Malu has since 1996 led ECOMOG to help disarm the warring factions
and provide security for the elections in Liberia which made Taylor,
the former leader of the defunct National Patriotic Front of Liberia
(NPFL), the post-war president.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian general, who was scheduled to hand over power to
his colleague Timothy Shelpidi Thursday, voiced his
regret that he could not participate in the restructuring of the
country's post-war army.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised Abuja Peace Plan, which brought to an end the
seven-year civil war in Liberia, ECOMOG should help restructure and
train the country's national army.
</P>
<P>
But Taylor, widely seen as the beneficiary of the peace plan, said
later that it is his constitutional sovereignty to reconstruct the armed
forces of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
This has led to friction between the president and Malu.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing here Thursday, the Information Director of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Adrienne Yande
Diop said the case had been submitted to the ECOWAS authority.
</P>
<P>
As the decision of ECOWAS is yet to come out, Liberia's Defense
Ministers announced earlier this week that the government is to
rebuild an army of 6,000 soldiers, half of that before the civil war.
</P>
<P>
"This is my only regret that I was not given the opportunity to
restructure a new national army that Liberians of all shades would
accept," Malu said at a departure ceremony in Monrovia, capital of
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"What we see here is that the present restructuring exercise is an
attempt to transform the factions into the army. This poses a new
security threat to the peace process in Liberia," Malu said, quoted by
a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, who was reportedly surprised at the order of his
transfer, the defunct factions in Liberia have not disappeared
completely.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taylor administration has denied the allegation that
the restructuring exercise is in favor of the NPFL, saying that the
new armed forces will be wide-based and represent the interests of
all.
</P>
<P>
Under a phased pullout plan, the 11,000-strong ECOMOG is scheduled
to leave Liberia by February 2. As the first step, 1,205 ECOMOG
officers and soldiers were pulled back from Monrovia two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Malu will soon return to take the position of the General Officer
Commanding (GOC), 2 mechanized division of the Nigerian army stationed
in Ibadan, one of the biggest cities in the west.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Names New Ambassador to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has officially appointed
a career diplomat as its new ambassador to Iran, marking the
initial normalization of the Turkish-Iranian relations.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the Official Gazette, which was published
today, said that Sencar Ozsoy, former Turkish ambassador to
Argentina, would go to Tehran to fill the post which had been
vacant for the past year.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Iranian relations worsened last February when then
Iranian ambassador to Turkey Muhammed Reza Baqeri made a
controversial speech during an anti-Israeli "Al-Quds (Jerusalem)
Night" in the city of Sincan, 40 kilometers west of Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkey expelled Baqeri on grounds that his words with strong
Islamic color interfered in the internal affairs of Turkey, which
is a secular state.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Iran demanded that Turkish ambassador in Tehran
leave the country in retaliation, dropping the Iranian-Turkish
relations to the lowest level.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long been accusing Iran of supporting its outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) and interfering in Turkey's internal
affairs over religious matter.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government, however, denied the charges, saying
that the alleged Iranian backing of the PKK was completely
groundless.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it also criticized Turkey for its quickly growing
military cooperation with Israel, warning that such a cooperation
would make the Middle East more unstable.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Unusual weather
conditions caused by El Nino have claimed the lives of 28 people
in Peru, a release from the United Nations Department of
Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) said today.
</P>
<P>
In its situation report on Peru, the DHA said that 12 other
inhabitants are missing, with close to 7,000 people affected so
far by the floods.
</P>
<P>
The floods have destroyed or partially damaged 1,940 houses and
destroyed 2,239 hectares of farmlands in the country. The damaged
corps included bananas, rice, soya, tobacco, corn and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
During the last week, heavy rains have continued to cause
flooding and landslides in the northern and central parts of Peru.
The DHA said that sea surface temperatures continued to increase
in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
The temperature of the Pacific Ocean was reported to have
reached an average anomaly of 4.2 degrees centigrade, an increase
which has not been seen during the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Through the United Nations Development Program and DHA resident
representative, the government of Peru has launched an appeal for
international assistance. The appeal is for emergency relief
supplies such as shelter, food and cooking equipment, tools,
equipment for draining or supplying water, and equipment for
supplying electricity.

ANKARA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A Greek Coastguard gunboat
fired on a Turkish fishing boat in the Agean Sea earlier
today, the Anatolia News Agency reported.

<P>
The incident, one of the latest confrontations between the two
hostile neighbors, took place between the Turkish coast and the
Greek island of Lesbos, but it caused no casualties or injuries.

The Greek gunboat reportedly sailed away after the shooting

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
condemned violence and killings in recent ethnic fighting in
Burundi, calling it deploring.
</P>
<P>
"We deplore the continued, indiscriminate killing of civilians
by both the Burundian army and the rebel forces," State Department
spokesman James Foley said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Foley said Rusty Hughes, U.S. ambassador to Burundi, has
visited the massacre site on the outskirt of the capital of
Bujumbura, where he saw the hacked bodies of innocent children and
other civilians.
</P>
<P>
"Grotesque violence makes the resolution of Burundi's problems
more difficult and complicates efforts to bring an enduring and
equitable peace to Burundi," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
The United States calls on all parties to this conflict to
respect the lives of non-combatants and immediately cease
hostilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the United States will send a special envoy to the
region next week for mediation, which he said was "part of U.S.
continuing effort to support endeavors to launch peace
negotiations."

<P>
LUSAKA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 14 people have been killed
in Nkhata Bay on the shores of Malawi's biggest lake, Malawi Lake,
since cholera broke out on December 1 of 1997, according to a report
from Blantyre, country's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
Health Services Controller, Chalamira Nkhoma, was quoted as saying
that 80 cases of cholera have been reported with 14 deaths since
December 1.
</P>
<P>
As of last week, the upturn of new cases have slowed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak is due to heavy rains over Malawi since November,
which have caused flooding, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cholera killed over 120 people in neighboring Mozambique at the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
He also said 470 cases of bubonic plague have been reported in

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, said today that it was
taking action against several EU members for failing to comply
with EU environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc's executive said it was seeking legal
proceedings against Luxembourg for not properly respecting a 1986
law requiring all its member countries to adopt common standards
for treating laboratory animals.
</P>
<P>
And the commission is sending warning letters to Britain,
Belgium and Portugal, ordering the three countries to comply with
EU laws or face court action.
</P>
<P>
Britain is in trouble for failing to extend a number of EU
environmental laws to Gibraltar, its territory in southern Spain,
while Portugal has been accused of violating an EU regulation on
environmental audits.
</P>
<P>
The commission also said Belgium was on the list because it has
failed to allow sufficient public access to information on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive Wednesday announced legal proceedings taken
against Belgium, Portugal, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands for
not respecting EU laws on preventing water pollution.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Internet services would be
available in Kuwait on a wide scale in three months, Kuwaiti
Minister of Electricity, Water and Communications Jassem Al-Oun
said today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Oun was quoted by Kuwait News Agency as saying that 54
companies had been tentatively chosen to provide the services in a
bid to promote scientific and cultural awareness among the
people. There are only two Internet companies operating in the
Gulf state now.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was the first country in the Gulf to provide Internet
services to its people. Thousands of computers in governmental
institutions, companies, education and scientific bodies are
enjoying the modern information services.
</P>
<P>
Internet has been developing quickly in Kuwait and more and
more people are getting familiar with its services and expect to
use it for deferent purposes.
</P>
<P>
Al-Oun noted that the authorities would censor the Internet
services for security purpose and to preserve national customs
and ethics.
</P>
<P>
The companies would be compelled to install certain systems to
prevent the clients from having access to unwanted web sites, he
said.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Expands Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
has recorded substantial progress over the past few years in
expanding its power industry.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, one of the nation's largest provincial economies, has
nonetheless been forced to deal with a bottle-necked power supply
which has hindered its development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Shandong Provincial Power Group (SPPG) invested
seven billion yuan in installing seven large and medium-sized
turbo-generators with a total capacity of 1.88 million kw.
</P>
<P>
The province also restructured its power generation
industry by closing small thermal power stations with high
coal consumption and poor efficiency and upgrading the local
power transmission grid.
</P>
<P>
The province's total power generation capacity currently
exceeds 16.1 million kw, with five power plants each having a
generating capacity of one million kw or more. Over 75 percent
of its power is generated by large and medium-sized
generators.
</P>
<P>
The SPPG funded the construction of a thermal power plant in
north China's Shanxi Province in order to use abundant local coal
resources for the commercial generation of electricity.

<HEADLINE> French Insurer Estimates Impact of Asia Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The on-going financial crisis in
Asia will only have a limited impact on economic growth in Europe,
President of the French insurance group Compagnie Francaise pour
le Commerce Exterieur (COFACE), Francois David, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio Classique, David said that only the
sectors of luxury products and railway construction will be harmed
by the crisis in Asia, especially in South Korea, while its impact
on other economic sectors in Europe will be "marginal."
</P>
<P>
He said that European companies should continue to invest in
the crisis-stricken countries in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the negative results from the crisis
will be compensated by "the vigor of European resumption" in
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"In the medium term, Southeast Asia will have excellent
fundamental balance sheets. It is a zone of strong growth in which
we should continue to invest and export," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he was less optimistic about Japan and South Korea, where
he expects more strokes of economic crisis to occur.
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned that Brazil, South Africa and Turkey could be
the next to be hit by economic crises because of their large trade
deficits, dubious banking system and weak currencies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the COFACE's president said he does not have any
worry about the perspective of economic development in China.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the French government, COFACE is
specialized in providing insurances to French businesses for
short, medium and long-term political risks which are not covered
by private insurance companies.

</P>
<P>
-- Confronted with what they acknowledge is a political popular
idea, business groups and other critics of President Clinton's
proposal to expand the Medicare health insurance program are
waving caution signs, portraying the plan as a risky experiment
with a system that is teetering on the brink of financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
-- A recharged President Clinton courted Hispanic voters and

The New York Times:

on some of the nation's most rugged and pristine public road.
</P>
<P>
-- The Federal Aviation Administration will send inspectors to

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission is
scheduled to meet next Wednesday to discuss plans to eliminate its
licensing system for banana imports and to aid Caribbean and
African banana producers, sources said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the European Union (EU) that the EU has been
prepared to make the move since 1997 when the World Trade
Organization (WTO) ruled that EU's banana regime broke free trade
rules and demanded a change no later than January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Mexico have
complained to WTO that EU's banana regime has discriminated
against their banana producers and in favor of banana producers
from former British and French colonies in Africa and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
At next Wednesday's meeting, the European Commission will also
consider providing aid to African, Caribbean and Pacific banana
producers in order to make them more competitive when confronted
with those from Latin American countries, which are much larger.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, sources said, EU might offer some 540 million
U.S. dollars in 10 years.

<HEADLINE> 4 Palestinians Wounded in Clash With Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Four Palestinian youths were
wounded in a severe clash with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank
city of Hebron today, the Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center (JMCC) said.
</P>
<P>
The clash between some 100 Palestinian youths and Israeli
soldiers occurred at an Israeli checkpoint near the Shuhada
Street, which was closed to traffic long time ago following the
clashes between the Palestinians and Jewish settlers in the city.
</P>
<P>
The four injured were sent to the Alia Hospital for
treatment. The Palestinians also threw a Molotov cocktail at the
Israeli police Patrol, the JMCC added.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is a city under the Palestinian authority. In the city,
most of the population is Palestinians. But there is also a Jewish
settlement inside the city, with about 500 Israeli soldiers
stationing there to maintain the security.
</P>
<P>
The city is famous not only for the signing of the Hebron
Agreement in January last year, but also for a large number of
clashes between Israelis and the Palestinians due to the strong
anti-Israel sentiment among the Palestinian citizens.

<HEADLINE> Singapore May Have Stringent Budget for 1998-99: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Tony Tan said on Saturday that if
Singapore's economic grow slows down, the 1998-99 budget will need
to be more stringent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ruling People's Action Party (PAP)'s awards
presentation ceremony where 350 party activists were recognized
for their services, Tan, who is also Chairman of the PAP Central
Executive Committee, said that Singapore would have to review its
expenditure and watch its spending to make sure it does not run a
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that Singapore must not jeopardize the
investments made in education and training, defense and internal
security, and economic and infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
These areas should be given priority and funded generously if
necessary to strengthen the country's foundation and make it even
more robust and successful, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that these areas are the long-term critical
investments which are the essential pillars for sustaining
Singapore's progress and stability.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Singapore must not go for political-popular
solutions at the expense of security, stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In making adjustments, there must always be a clear focus on
the long-term well-being of the nation and the people, he said.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) condemned today stepped-up terrorist
actions in Algeria that have claimed lives of children, the
elderly and women, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted the OIC based in Saudi Arabia as saying in a
statement issued by its Secretary General Ezzidine Al-Iraki that
"the Islamic religion emphatically rejects such ugly actions,
unprecedented in the modern history and bans them with consent of
all heavenly Sharias (laws) regardless of causes and
justifications."
</P>
<P>
Around 1,000 civilians, including children, old people and
women in Algeria have been reportedly slaughtered by terrorist
gunmen in the past 10 days, triggering dismay and concern in Arab
and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The OIC praised as a positive move a declaration made by the
Algerian government expressing readiness to cooperate with the
European Union to investigate the terrorism in the north African
Arab country.
</P>
<P>
Al-Iraki called for international cooperation to clamp down on
all forms of terrorism which has become a dangerous phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
He expressed readiness to contribute to the efforts against
terrorism.

a security zone on its border to cope with the NATO's eastward
enlargement, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federal Border Guard Service said that its main

It will also unify legal norms and acts suitable to the border
sphere into the Russian Border Code, and make its structure

<HEADLINE> South China Sea Oil Output on the Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The 1997 output of oilfields
in the eastern section of the South China Sea reached some 13
million tons and accounted for nearly 80 percent of the nation's
total offshore oil output.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern South China Sea Co., a subsidiary of the China
National Offshore Oil Corp., which developed the fields, reported
a 9.5 percent rise in output for the year, with total crude oil
sales hitting 12.9 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Said oil fields ranked fourth in the nation in terms of
total annual output, according to a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Three onshore oilfields, including the Daqing, Shengli and
Liaohe oilfields, continue to rank at the nation's leading
producers of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the company working in close cooperation with
overseas partners last year in the development of both old and new
oil led to the increase in total oil output, according to the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said new measures have led to the sustained and stable
growth in oil output.

<P>
JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of HIV/AIDS infected
people in Indonesia in the past month increased by 17 from 602 in
early December 1997 to 619 in early January 1998, Dr. Hadi
Abednego said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 619 HIV/AIDS infected persons, 466 had been declared

intercourse, six through infected syringes, two through blood
transfusion, two through hemophilia, while five infants contracted
the virus from their HIV-positive mothers and the rest from
unknown causes.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq: US Wants to Inflame Tension in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi government spokesman
described the U.S. maintenance of intensive military pressure in
the Persian Gulf as intending to inflame tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi news agency INA quoted the spokesman as saying that
the U.S. continuing military build-up has nothing to do with
U.N. Security Council Resolutions concerning Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said neither the United Nations nor the Security
Council has given the United States mandate to enforce
implementation of their resolutions or to threaten military action
against the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks Friday in response to
U.S. Defense Department spokesman's statement concerning the
U.S. intention to maintain military build-up close to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. spokesman has reportedly said the United States wants
to keep on as much diplomatic and military pressure as possible in
the Gulf to ensure that Iraq abides by the
U.N. disarmament-related resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The majority of U.N. member states are against the use of
force to settle international disputes, said the Iraqi spokesman,
adding they have objected to the U.S. military threats against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman went on to say that Americans want to give
justifications for a longer stay of their military bases in the
Gulf and to sell more arms to the region.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Economy Witnesses Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region has recorded an average annual growth rate of
14.4 percent since 1993, thereby leading the country's five
autonomous regions inhabited by minority ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region's growth rate has been well above the
national average of 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Kejie, chairman of the autonomous region, said here today
that the region's industry grew by an average annual reate of 23
percent over the past five years. He added that Guangxi's annual
sugar output which continues to hover around two million tons,
accounts for 33 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
In an address to 688 deputies attending the regional National
People's Congress, Cheng said the region's foreign trade volume,
influx of foreign investments and number of overseas tourists
increased during 1997 when compared to the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi imported and exported goods valued at three billion US
dollars during 1997, in addition to using foreign funds in excess
of 1.24 billion US dollars, and played host to more than 570,000
tourists from overseas.
</P>
<P>
However, Cheng noted that Guangxi's productivity continues to
lag far behind the national average.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Guangxi will continue to explore new reform methods
to accelerate economic development as part of an effort to narrow
gaps between itself and other parts of China, Cheng said.

PARIS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard said Saturday that the Dreyfus Affair 100 years ago, has
imposed "imperative of human rights in the service of the state."
</P>
<P>
In the affair, a Jewish officer, Captain Alfred Dreyfus, was
wrongly condemned for spying for the Germans but later found
innocent,
</P>
<P>
Richard made the statement in a message sent to the army on the
100th anniversary of the publishing of a mile-stone open letter by
writer Emile Zola, "J'Accuse," in which Zola condemned the
persecution of Dreyfus by the army.
</P>
<P>
"The armed forces look at this episode of our past and can be
satisfied with the course through which it has become now an
institution to guarantee the law and full of confidence from the
citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Dreyfus Affair also marked a "dramatic
change" in the French army which until then held a "monarchic
conception of the role of the armed forces."

<HEADLINE> WTO Expected to Make Breakthrough in China's Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
in a report Saturday that the recent progress in the talks on
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) might lead
to a final deal by the middle of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said that a breakthrough in China's WTO entry
talks is imminent though the United States has consistently
insisted on generous market access commitments by China before
its membership can be considered, said the European Report, a
twice-weekly newsletter published here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It said that Beijing has submitted, over the past four years, a
number of improved market access offers to the Geneva-based trade
watchdog, which cover all areas including industrial tariffs,
quotas, agriculture and services.
</P>
<P>
"Recent advances in tariff and quota negotiations suggest that
a final deal on market access is a realistic possibility in the
early months of 1998," the Commission said in a document for its
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
Industrial tariffs were cut steadily from 34 percent in 1994 to
17 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
China's quotas, used to cover some 1,200 products, are now down
to 350 and expected to be phased out altogether. Meanwhile, the
quotas of the European Union (EU) on Chinese textiles, shoes,
porcelain, ceramics and toys are to be phased out by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said that China has made great strides in
improving intellectual property protection in the country as well
as stamping out production of pirated compact disks and computer
software.
</P>
<P>
However, the Commission believed that China's negotiations on
services are holding up agreements on the final membership deal,
saying that "they are likely to prove the most problematic
outstanding issue."
</P>
<P>
The latest Chinese offer, which is being assessed by the
Commission and the EU member states, still needs to be improved
though it "includes significant new market opening commitments" in
such fields as distribution, legal services, accountancy, banking
and insurance," said the Commission.
</P>
<P>
China first applied in 1996 to join the WTO's predecessor, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

<HEADLINE> China Records Breakthrough in Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- China proved onshore an
additional approximately 1.5 billion tons of proven oil reserves
and pumped 143 million tons of crude last year, showing a drastic
annual rise in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yongkang, president of the China National Petroleum Corp.
(CNPC), told a national oil work conference here today that the
country increased an additional oil and gas production capacity of
15.92 million tons and 1.91 billion cu m, respectively, in 1997,
the largest amount since 1990.
</P>
<P>
China discovered ten major oil and gas bearing structures in
1997, each with a reserve to the minimum of 100 million tons,
making up two-thirds of its new oil and gas reserves, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
These oil and gas bearing structures are located along the
Liaohe River in northeastern China, the Junggar and Turpan-Hami
Basins in Xinjiang, and the Basin between Songhua and Liaohe
rivers in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the ten are in central and northwestern China, which
contributed to over half the country's newly-verified oil and gas
reserves in 1997. The area around Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia in
northwest China, southwestern Sichuan, and Junggar and Tarim
Basins in Xinjiang determined over 100 billion cu m of gas in last
year, the president added.
</P>
<P>
According to Qin Anmin, general manager of the China Petroleum
Engineering Construction Company (CPECC), the country signed 14
oil contracts with foreign companies, absorbing a total investment
of 280 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China had undertaken seven oil projects in foreign
countries, with contract value totalling 550 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China obtained 970,000 tons of crude oil from
overseas last year through joint and cooperative production with
foreign countries.

They expressed their hope that local officials and ordinary
people will carry forward their hard and self-reliant effort,
unite as one, and rehabilitate through production, reduce losses
brought about by the quakes to the minimum, and restore production

<P>
An earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter Scale hit the

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Warns Against Opening of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has warned against the opening of a military air base
near the western coastal town of Paphos, in the Greek
Cypriot-dominated southern island.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus Mail today, Denktash had a meeting Friday
with U.N. Permanent Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel and
U.S. and British ambassadors to Cyprus in Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern part of Nicosia, and warned them that
Turkish Cypriots would take immediate steps if the Greek Cypriot
side did not desist from opening the base.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise the necessary steps will be taken along with Turkey
in response to the Greek Cypriot administration's joint move with
Greece," Denktash was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Denktash made the remarks in response to an announcement by
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides on a TV talk show late on
Thursday that the Paphos air base would be ready as early as
January 24.
</P>
<P>
Clerides claimed that in conjunction with the installation of
the Russian S-300 surface-to-air missiles, the island's air space
would be fully converted.
</P>
<P>
The Paphos air base was constructed under a joint defense
pact, signed in November 1993 between Cypriot and Greek
governments. Under the pact, Greece will provide military
assistance if Cyprus is attacked.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government also decided last year to buy
Russian-made anti-aircraft S-300 missiles, which are expected to
be deployed later this year.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for boosting Cypriot air defense is to protect
tanks on the ground, Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side was reported to have threatened to
open an air base in the Turkish occupied northern Cyprus in
response to the Paphos base.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained 35,000 troops to protect the minority
Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus.

Robust growth in retail sales was achieved despite a slowdown
in the city's fixed assets investments during the year, according

The growth rate was some six percentage higher than the
national average, with sales growing at the same rate in both
urban and rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Doi Reelected as SDP's Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Takako Doi, leader of Japan's
Social Democratic Party (SDP), was reelected unopposed Saturday
for another two-year term.
</P>
<P>
After the reelection, Doi said her party would continue an
alliance with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to be a member of the ruling bloc, but we
will make a serious determination if the SDP's thinking is made
light of," Doi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
In early December, the SDP, one of the two non-cabinet allies
of the LDP, opened its top post to candidates, but no candidate
filed for contesting.
</P>
<P>
On December 28, Doi reversed her previous decision not to seek
reelection after party executives urged her to stay as leader. She
was the only candidate for the post by the deadline Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Doi's reelection will be formalized in a party convention that
begins January 24.
</P>
<P>
Doi, a former law lecturer, became chairman of the Japan
Socialist Party, the SDP's predecessor, in 1986. She left the
party in 1993 when she took the post of House of Representatives
speaker as required by Diet (parliament) rules.
</P>
<P>
In September 1996, Doi returned to the SDP and became leader of
the party, replacing former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students Exhibit Interest in British Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The '98 British Education
Exhibition, which opened today in Beijing, attracted more than
10,000 people before noon, including Li Meng, an 18 year-old girl
attending the high school attached to the People's University.
</P>
<P>
Many students and their parents, much like Li and her mother
and father, attended the exhibition to explore opportunities for
advanced studies in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in studying abroad," said Li, adding that
"Britain offers a possible opportunity since my father has close
contacts in the country."
</P>
<P>
Li, a good student who will most likely be admitted to Beijing
University without the need to participate in entrance
examinations, is nonetheless highly-interested in a Western
education which offers greater flexibility and evokes creativeness.
</P>
<P>
Great Britain is a pioneer in modern education and has a
reputation for cultivating outstanding students. The exhibition,
which attracted representatives from 101 British schools, is the
largest of its kind ever held in China. The exhibition attracted
colleges and universities as well as a number of British high
schools and prep schools for renowned universities.
</P>
<P>
One Ministry of Foreign Affairs official and her son, a high
school student, exhibited special interest in the Cambridge Prep
School. "I worked in Britain for ten years and knew the advantages
of the country's education system. I hope my boy can gain
admission to Cambridge University," according to the woman.
</P>
<P>
The governments of China and Great Britain, as well as social
organizations in both countries offer scholarships enabling
Chinese students to study in Britain. However, the number of
scholarships offered are far from enough, according to a Chinese
expert on international education exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the high cost of tuition for British schools

<HEADLINE> RENAMO President Appoints New Secretary General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- President of the biggest
opposition National Resistance Movement of Mozambique (RENAMO),
Afonso Dhlakama, has replaced Francisco Marcelino with Joao
Alexandre as his party's secretary general.
</P>
<P>
According to local paper "Noticias" today, this was announced
in a news release issued on Friday by the RENAMO. The release
said Dhlakama took the move after consulting with his party's
National Council and Political Commission.
</P>
<P>
Alexandre, the new secretary general of RENAMO, is 50 years
old and a member of parliament from Manica Province.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Dhlakama said that this move was aimed at
revitalizing the RENAMO in the year of elections. "As Marcelino
has a post in the National Elections Commission, he cannot devote
himself wholeheartedly to the RENAMO or the election commission,"
they noted.
</P>
<P>
RENAMO leader Dhlakama said two months ago that he intended to
remove Marcelino from the post of RENAMO secretary general,
alleging that he lacked initiative and was not good at listening
to others.
</P>
<P>
Marcelino started to hold the post in 1995.

WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- American balloonists Dick
Rutan and David Melton parachuted to safety after a helium cell
bursted, ending their fruitless chase for the honour to make the
first non-stop ballon flighting around the world.
</P>
<P>
Rutan, 59, and Melton, 39, landed in eastern New Mexico less
than four hours after the liftoff Thursday from Albuquerque, while
their "Global Hilton" drifted to an undignified landing in Texas.
</P>
<P>
Melton sustained a hip injury and was airlifted to Hospital,
and Rutan hit a cactus but with only slight cuts, said Patrick
Barry, a spokesman for the team.
</P>
<P>
The balloon hit the ground once and bounced for three times
during the eight-hour floating before it crashed near Gainsville,
in northern Texas.
</P>
<P>
The ground crew said the adventure ended when a helium cell in
the upper part of the balloon burst.
</P>
<P>
Before the abortion, American Steve Fossett quit his attempt
with "Solo Spirit" and another Amerivan balloonist Kevin Uliassi
in his "J Renee" failed in their round-the-world bids.
</P>

Swiss balloonist Bertrand Piccard, who had planned to take off
Friday with his "Breitling Orbiter II" from the Swiss Alps,

<HEADLINE> Turkey Expels 14 Iraqi Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today expelled 14 Iraqi
immigrants in a bid to cooperate with Italy in checking illegal
immigration, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said that Turkey took the Iraqi immigrants
including one child to Habur Border Gate by land this morning and
delivered them to the officials in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi immigrants were captured in Bodrum, western Turkey,
as they attempted to go to Italy via Greece, said the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has taken strict measures to control the border areas to
prevent the Kurdish immigration flow from northern Iraq, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
Local Daily News today quoted Turkish State Minister Sukru
Sina Gurel as saying that the illicit immigration flow can be
only prevented by re-establishing legitimate state authority in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Turkish Interior Minister Murat Baseskioglu
ordered an extensive investigation into the massive wave of
illegal immigration to Italy.
</P>
<P>
He said that those organizers of the refugee smuggling would be
punished under the laws.
</P>
<P>
"An inspection commission composed of administrative and police
officials is now in charge of the investigation. If necessary,
additional officials from the relevant ministries will join
them," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of Kurds from southeastern Turkey and northern
Iraq were transported via different routes to Italy since last
week, causing grave concern in Turkey and some west European
countries, or the Schengen states.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has detained dozens of immigration organizers and
hundreds of Kurds trying to flee Turkey for the Schengen
countries.
</P>
<P>
Daily News reported today that Turkish and Italian officials
would meet in Rome, capital of Italy, this month to increase
cooperation between the two countries on the issue.

MACAO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Macao banks will raise bank
deposit interest rates starting from next Monday, following
similar announcements in Hong Kong on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Bankers' Association announced Friday night that all
deposit interest rates will be raised by 0.75 percent next Monday,
after the increased interest rates on interbank transactions
forced Hong Kong banks to make similar announcements.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that they had foreseen interest rates to
rise sooner or later. They said that the increase will help Macao
banks ease operation pressure that was deemed too high.
</P>
<P>
Lao Pun-Lap, secretary general of the Macao Society of
Economics Study, said that the rise in interest rates will be a
blow to the already-sluggish retail industry and property market.
</P>
<P>
He said a further rise in interest rates in the near future
cannot be ruled out.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: 1998: A "Year of Bear" for Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine stock market,
which had been bearish for the most part of 1997, showed no signs
of recovery at the start of 1998. Instead, it fell sharply during
the past week.
</P>
<P>
The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index
(Phisix), the main barometer for the local bourse, ended slightly
higher on January 2, the first trading day of 1998, but failed to
sustain the positive mood in the ensuing week.
</P>
<P>
During the past five trading days, the Phisix lost about 20
percent to close at 1,518 points Friday, the lowest in five years,
from the close of 1891.27 points on January 2 in a swift meltdown.
</P>
<P>
The Phisix has so far declined more than 44 percent from the
2,714 points recorded prior to the currency crisis, which has
plagued the Philippines and other Asian economies for more than
six months.
</P>
<P>
The Phisix, which hit an all-time high of 3,447.60 points on
February 2, 1997, has lost all the gains made in 1996 and the
early part of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The latest turmoil in the local bourse was blamed on a renewed
free fall of the Philippine peso, which once nose-dived to a
record low of 46.50 pesos to the U.S. dollar during the period.
</P>
<P>
The fresh tailspin of the peso further shattered investors'
confidence in the country's economic future, triggering a wave of
panic selling, traders said. But some optimistic dealers expected
a technical rebound next week.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, many traders believe the latest downturn was just
the first of a series of storms and tests the Philippine stock
market has to experience in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The local bourse will have to face in 1998 three dampening
factors -- the deepening currency crisis, a projected economic
slowdown and the forthcoming presidential elections, traders said.
</P>
<P>
These dampers, among other things, are likely to turn 1998 into
a "year of bear" for the local bourse, they said.
</P>
<P>
The currency crisis, which has taken toll on the economy and
the stock market, is widely expected to persist until the second
half of the year at the very least.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the foreign exchange rate fails to stabilize, the
bear will stay in the market," a trader said.
</P>
<P>
A weakening peso will continue to exert upward pressure on the
already high interest rates in the country, which in turn will
increase financial woes of manufacturers highly dependent on
imported raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Massive layoffs by manufacturers, sharp declines in the
earnings of listed companies, increasing loan defaults, and other
adverse effects of the currency crisis are expected to emerge
during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Henry Ong, research head for Sapphire Securities, said the
market will be down in the first half of 1998 because with
corporate margins squeezed, stock prices will have to be adjusted
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the currency crisis, an economic slowdown has
been projected to strike the country in 1998, which has been
viewed as an "emerging tiger economy" by foreign investors in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The currency crisis and the El Nino weather phenomenon forced
the government to lower its 1998 growth target for gross domestic
product to 4 percent from an initial 6.5 to 7.5 percent. The
target is the slowest expansion that the country has experienced
in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the bearish sentiment in the local market is the
country's presidential elections in May 1998, which will determine
who will lead the country into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Investors, concerned over the results of the forthcoming
presidential polls, will remain on the sidelines until
uncertainties on the political scene clear away, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
If the elected successor of President Fidel Ramos opts to lead
the country away from the reform course stuck to by the Ramos
administration, the situation in the market will turn for the
worse, they warned.
</P>
<P>
Still, the local bourse's recovery also depends on other
economies in Asia, particularly the three hardest-hit economies --
South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
But it remains doubtful that the three economies will stabilize
soon this year with the help of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), whose belt-tightening policies have met with opposition
from these governments.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine stock market will see the end of the tunnel and
start a recovery only after the political dust dies down after the
May polls and the regional currency crisis comes to an end,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
If the situation in Asia normalizes and foreign exchange rates
stabilize, they said, investors' confidence will be rebuilt in the
economy and then the local stock market can make a turnaround.

<HEADLINE> Asian Foreign Ministers to Meet Every Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Former General Secretary of
the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Dato Ajit
Singh said Saturday that Asian foreign ministers would meet
annually at the U.N. General Assembly to foster closer regional
cooperation among Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
This was decided by the two major regional blocs of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and ASEAN. The
two regions represented some of the fastest growing economies of
the world and have a great future together, he said at a
partnership summit in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu in southern
India. The summit, which opened on Thursday, was organized by the
Confederation of Indian industry (CII).
</P>
<P>
The proposed restructuring and strengthening of the SAARC threw
up immense scope for closer interaction between its member
countries and the ASEAN economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
While trade and investment between ASEAN and SAARC countries
had grown impressively in the last six years, it still was not
enough and did not reflect the true potential, he further said.

<HEADLINE> Most Closed Coffee Factories Reopened in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- 73 of the 88 closed coffee
factories reopened since the closure a month ago, The New Vision
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Uganda authorities ordered to close part of its coffee
factories processing coffee beans with moisture above the
recommended level in November 1997 to guaranttee quality of the
product. Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA) said the
follow-up visits to the closed factories showed processing of wet
coffee has greatly declined.
</P>
<P>
But UCDA report said the cumulative total coffee exports in
the first quater of 1997-1998 coffee year from October 1 to
December 31 had declined from the same period of the previous
year from 1,290,986 bags to 551,580 bags (every bag contains 60
kilogram of coffee), the export value declined from 95.2 billion
Uganda shillings (some 83.50 million U.S. dollars) to 49.8
billion Ugandan shillings (some 43.68 million U.S. dollars), a
57.2 percent and 47.7 percent decrease respectively.
</P>
<P>
Consecutive heavy rains delayed harvest and the drying of
coffee. The post harvest drying activities have been almost
brought to a standstill, UCDA said in its report.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week all
higher.
</P>
<P>
This week, CPO physicals was highly in demand.
</P>
<P>
January-South settled the week at 2,610 ringgit (about 572.3
U.S. dollars) per ton, up by 460 ringgit (about 100 U.S. dollars)
from last week's close, on the volatility of the ringgit.
</P>
<P>
Most players believed that the uptrend would not end in the
near term and this stimulated further buying interest towards the
end of the week.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that CPO physicals is making a steady headway
to the level of 3,000 ringgit per ton next week. But, one dealer
said the market will also depend on the currency position and the
futures' leads.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) this week, the metal
ended the week on a remarkable note with its price level rising
above the 20 ringgit (about 4.38 U.S. dollars) per kg on the
extended depreciation of the ringgit which reached its intra-day
low of 4.8800 to the U.S. dollar on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tin started the week at 21.19 ringgit (about 4.64 U.S. dollars)
per kg and extended higher to 22.78 ringgit (about 4.99 U.S.
dollars) per kg on Tuesday. It touched the highest mark of the
week at 24.68 ringgit (about 5.41 U.S. dollars) per kg on
Wednesday, but settled off-high at 23.78 ringgit (about 5.21 U.S.
dollars) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Trading was volatile throughout the week with accumulated
turnover rising sharply to 508 tons compared with 288 tons last
week.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market, at the week's close, February
RSS-One surged nine sen to 284.50 sen (about 62.3 U.S. cents) per
kg, while SMR 20 jumped 6.5 sen to 279.50 sen (61.2 U.S. cents)
per kg.
</P>
<P>
This week, some inquiries were noted from the Middle East and
Europe for 1,000 tons of the SMR 20 grade for February shipment on
Thursday, and this at least added some sentiments in the market.
</P>
<P>
Further price adjustment on the rubber market was expected next
week should the ringgit's value, which was quoted at 4.5600/00 to
the U.S. dollar at this week's close, continued to be weaker, a
dealer said, adding the market is fetching the 300 sen (about 65.7
U.S. cents) level next week on price adjustment.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Launches Blood Donation Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia launched a blood
donation campaign Saturday as blood supply is depleting.
</P>
<P>
While launching the campaign, Malaysian Health Minister Chua
Jui Meng appealed to the people, especially non-Muslims to donate
blood as the blood donation percentage by Muslims who contributed
44 percent of the blood supply to the Blood Bank every year has
dropped because of the current Fasting month.
</P>
<P>
Chua particularly urged university students to donate within
this month.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Blood Bank would need about 25,000 pints of
blood to meet the demand for blood transfusion during emergency
surgeries in the forthcoming festive season when both Chinese and
Muslims celebrate their New Years at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
He also touched on the cost-cutting measures following the
economic downturn and appealed to the Finance Ministry not to cut
the Health Ministry's budget which he said is for providing health
service and medication to the people.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Determined to Defend Linked Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Administrative Secretary
Anson Chan Fang On-sang stressed here Saturday that the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region is determined to defend the linked
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Chan made these remarks when she met the media Saturday
afternoon before leaving Hong Kong on a 12-day promotional tour of
the United States and Canada this evening.
</P>
<P>
This is her first promotional visit since Hong Kong returned to
China last July. The visit will take her to Los Angeles, Miami,
San Francisco, Toronto and Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
Chan said the main purpose of her visit is, first of all, to
give an account of how the Hong Kong SAR has fared in the six
months since the city's return to China, in particular to talk
about some of the major problems that the Hong Kong SAR has to
deal with, she said.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure there will be a good deal of interest in and
questions on how we handle the financial turmoil," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, I want to make it quite clear that one of the
messages I will be giving loud and clear to my American and
Canadian audiences is that the government is absolutely determined
to defend the linked exchange rate," she said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that "there is absolutely no foundation" to the
rumors which she has heard that the SAR government is reviewing
the linked exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The linked exchange rate has served Hong Kong extremely well
and "there is no intention on our part whatsoever to review it",
she added.
</P>
<P>
Chan said she will also give an account of Hong Kong's business
opportunities and economic strengths during her visit to these two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said she hopes to do something to promote
tourism.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official: Ross' Mission Serious But Fruitless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian official today
described the talks held by Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat and U.S. coordinator of the Mideast peace
process Dennis Ross as "serious," but short of "final results."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs Radio,
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) representative to
Washington Hassan Abdurrahman said Arafat-Ross talks centered on
commitments of the transitional period and arrangements for the
upcoming summit meetings in Washington between the U.S.,
Palestinian and Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ross came to the region on Tuesday for talks with Netanyahu and
Arafat to try to pave the way for separate meetings they will have
with U.S. President Bill Clinton on January 20 and 22.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and Palestinian officials have noted that Ross has
failed to achieve progress on deadlocked peace talks ahead of the
key meetings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Echoing this view, Abdurrahman said the U.S. envoy's talks with
Palestinian and Israeli officials have not reached final results,
expressing hope that Clinton will pressure Israel into compliance
with the signed deals and halting settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
The PLO representative predicted that Netanyahu will capitalize
on the Israeli political crisis to delay implementation of the
second and third phase of West Bank redeployment.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the resignation this week of Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy due to dispute with Netanyahu on peace
process, giving more say in Netanyahu's government to the
hardliners.
</P>
<P>
Washington has put pressure on Netanyahu to agree to a
significant withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank and on
Arafat to take effective steps against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day mission, Ross criticized a decision by
Israel to build more than 600 new homes at two Jewish settlements
on the West Bank, a move that defies the U.S. call for a
"time-out" on settlement expansion.

<HEADLINE> Macao Economy Expects Less than One Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A leading local economist
estimated that the economic growth of Macao for 1997 was less than
one percent.
</P>
<P>
Lao Pun-Lap, secretary general of the Macao Society of
Economics Study, said at a seminar on Friday night that he
expected Macao economy should see a less than one percent growth
for 1997, a mild recovery from the negative figure in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The territory has reported good exports of both goods and
service, and the Macao airport has also achieved a satisfactory
growth in passengers and cargo transportation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Macao casinos reported a ten percent growth in
their income from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think there would appear a negative growth again for
1997," he said. "But the growth rate should be within one
percent."
</P>
<P>
No official growth figures have been announced so far.
</P>
<P>
The economist said that Macao will face a difficult year in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating currency crisis in Southeast Asia will make
it even harder for Macao's exports and tourism, and there is no
imminent evidence that the property market will step out of its
doldrums soon.
</P>
<P>
Lao urged the government to make vigorous efforts to improve
the competitiveness of Macao's export sector and tourism.

<HEADLINE> Slovak Republic Scores Upset Win in Hopman Cup Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Slovak Republic became an
unexpected victor by defeating France in the Hopman Cup mixed
teams championship today in Australia's western city of Perth.
</P>
<P>
Slovakians Karol Kucera and Karina Habsudova, who were rated
33-1 chances to win the tournament last weekend, beat France with
a 2-1 victory over the tournament's No.2 seed today. The
Slovakians terminated Australia's dream of reaching the Hopman Cup
final two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Kucera and Habsudova, who had to upset Romania last Saturday to
qualify for the main draw of the 576,000 US dollars event, wrapped
up the win when they downed Cedric Pioline and Mary Pierce 6-3,
6-4 in the deciding mixed doubles rubber.
</P>
<P>
France is the only country except Australia to have appeared in
all 10 Hopman Cups and was contesting its first final.
</P>
<P>
The two Slovakians pocketed 140,800 US dollars for their
efforts, while Pioline and Pierce split 76,800 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Odds of France claiming the final would have shortened
dramatically after Pierce, battling a thigh strain which later
required strapping in the mixed, accounted for a typically dogged
Habsudova 6-4, 7-5 in the women's singles.
</P>
<P>
Kucera etched out two high-quality sets to square proceedings,
triumphing 7-6 (9-7), 6-4 against Pioline.
</P>
<P>
Kucera and Habsudova needed an amazing eight set points to win
the first set of the mixed doubles and then fell behind 1-3 in the
second as France threatened to extend the match into a third set.
</P>
<P>
But the pair rallied to snatch five of the next six games and a
richly-deserved win.

<HEADLINE> 100-Seat Boeing-717 Under Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Boeing is developing a
100-seat plane, called Boeing-717, to meet the market demand for
comfort, low cost and high schedule reliability.
</P>
<P>
About 900 people in Boeing's Douglas Products Division in Long
Beach, California, are working on the plane, which is aimed at
short-haul commuter routes of less than 1,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
The plane, formerly known as MD-95, was launched in 1995 by
Douglas Aircraft. There has been uncertainty about whether Boeing
will continue the development of the plane after it acquired
Mcdonnell Douglas last August.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based Boeing, the largest plane-maker, said last
November that the production costs of the 717 needed to be reduced
to make it profitable.
</P>
<P>
The new plane has been priced at 32 million U.S. dollars, but
Boeing official said that a new price will be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
Boeing projects a market for about 2,500 airplanes with between
80 and 120 seats over the next 20 years.

<HEADLINE> 57 Aftershocks Occur in Quake-Stricken Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 57 aftershocks
occurred by 13:58 hours (Beijing Time) today following the strong
tremor that hit two counties near the Great Wall in north China's
Hebei province, according to the State Seismological Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter Scale jolted
Shangyi and Zhangbei counties at 11:50 today, causing houses
cracked or collapsed, a SSB official said, adding that the two
counties are 220 km northwest of Beijing, the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Among all the aftershocks, most were measured anything from two
to three on the Richter Scale, and the strongest one, measuring
4.6, which occurred at 13:03, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Although the quake-hit Shangyi and Zhangbei counties felt
frequent aftershocks, yet the situation "remains normal," SSB
seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, eight townships there with a combined population
of about 100,000, which are near the epicenter, have suffered
most, according to the SSB.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists predicted that more aftershocks may happen in the
two counties which cover a total area of some 500 square
kilometers in the coming days.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Senior Official Urges Investment Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- "Vietnam will follow the same
path as some countries in Asia currently bogged down in financial
and monetary crises unless it seriously reviews its structure of
development investment," Vietnam News Agency (VNA) Saturday quoted
a senior government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Executive Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said this
Friday when meeting with officials from the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He urged an exact and precise evaluation of the efficiency of
development projects so as to close loopholes.
</P>
<P>
This review, Dung said, should aim at increasing investment in
the highly-competitive and labor-intensive sectors.
</P>
<P>
Dung added that the national economy will continue to grow
rapidly if more funds can be allocated to these sectors.
</P>
<P>
He also called for proportional adjustments in investment in
different regions.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that Vietnam achieved a strong Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) growth estimated at 9 percent in 1997,
despite the negative impact of the financial crises in Asia and a
severe storm that hit the country's southern coast two months
ago.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkey End Diplomatic Rift by Naming New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 10 (Xinhua) - Iran and Turkey have named new
ambassadors to each other, putting an end to a year-long
diplomatic row between the two countries, local daily Iran News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told the daily Friday that Mohammad
Hussein Lavasani, an advisor to Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi and former Iranian ambassador to Canada, was appointed
as Iran's new ambassador to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an report from Ankara said that the Turkish
government has also assigned Sencer Ozsoy as its ambassador to
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Turkey cooled down in February last
year, when Ankara accused former Iranian ambassador Mohammad
Baqeri of insulting Turkey's secular government in a public speech
and ordered him to leave the country. In retaliation, Iran also
asked Turkey to recall its ambassador to Iran Osman Koruturk.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish source told Xinhua correspondent today that the two
countries have reached agreement over the naming of new
ambassadors on the sidelines of the eighth Islamic summit in
December which Turkish President Suleyman Demirel attended.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that despite the dispatch of new
ambassadors, Iran and Turkey still have disputes over some issues,
particularly the one of Turkish military cooperation with Israel
and the Turkish military invasion of northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, both Iran and Turkey need the bilateral cooperation,
in the framework of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)
and over the issue of exporting Turkmen gas to Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Ross Ends Shuttle Mission With Little </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- After four days of shuttle
mission here, United States peace coordinator Dennis Ross headed
home with little progress in breaking the stalemate in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Before returning to Washington late Friday, Ross said his
visit has achieved the narrowing of gap between Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), adding he knows better the
choices left for the parties.
</P>
<P>
Ross's mission was aimed at laying the ground for the meetings
that U.S. President Bill Clinton is to hold with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser Arafat in
Washington late this month.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Ross held separate talks with Netanyahu
and Arafat and convened a meeting between Israeli and Palestinian
security officials, who agreed to set up a hotline to coordinate
efforts in fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But no apparent breakthrough was achieved by Ross in narrowing
the big differences between the sides over the Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank. The delay of the redeployment has
become the outstanding obstacle that blocks any progress in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross's visit was conducted under the shadow of the resignation
of Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy due to disputes with
Netanyahu over economic and diplomatic policies.
</P>
<P>
Following Levy's resignation, hardliners are now dominating the
Israeli government, reducing Netanyahu's maneuvering room in
deciding the scope of redeployment. To appease the hardliners who
threaten to topple him, Netanyahu backtracked from his previous
position by scaling down the percentage of pullback from over 10
percent to eight percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ross was pressing Netanyahu to come up with a double-digit
pullback decision, as the PNA made it clear that it would reject
any offer less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
To offset the U.S. pressure, Netanyahu announced Thursday
that the government decision on further redeployment in the West
Bank would be divided into two parts and conditional on the
Palestinian fulfillment of commitments.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the first decision on the details of the scope
of pullback will be made ahead of his scheduled trip to the
U.S. late the month. The second decision on implementation to be
made months later will be based on the PNA's fulfillment of its
commitments, including fighting terrorism, amending the
Palestinian Covenant, confiscating illegal weapons and extraditing
Palestinian murderers.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's new idea on the long-delayed pullback seemed to be
an attempt to further postpone the redeployment to appease the
hardliners.
</P>
<P>
According to Netanyahu's idea, Israel does not need to carry
out the redeployment at least until June this year. The Hebron
agreement signed a year ago stipulated that Israel should have
completed all three phases of further redeployments in the West
Bank by mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Many now doubt Netanyahu's ability to carry out the second
redeployment since his government has in fact become hostage of
the hardliners. Another dove within the government, Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai threatened Wednesday night to resign
if the government could not implement the pullback within three
months.
</P>
<P>
Ross' mission hit another snag as Israel announced plans to
build a large number of new homes in Jewish settlements across the
Green Line, or the 1949 armistice line. The PNA strongly condemned
the move as another serious blow to the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The failure of Ross' mission implied the seriousness of the
situation. It is almost certain, as senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat put it, that the process could collapse if without
more active U.S. intervention. So the hope for a breakthrough is
now pinned on the pending talks in Washington hosted by Clinton,
who is under increased pressure to intervene in the peace process
personally.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Experiences Most Sever Cold Weather in 40 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has experienced the
most severe cold weather this winter at least for over the past 40
years, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
"This cold wave is a new experience that has come to us as a
disaster. We were not prepared for it," Kishananda Mohan Das,
director general of the Disaster Management Bureau, was quoted as
saying by a local newspaper on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The cold wave, which began to sweep across the South Asian
nation over a week ago, has affected all the country's 64
districts, with 25 of them identified as worst hit, he said.
</P>
<P>
At least 153 people, mostly elderly and new born, have died
from the severe cold and cold-related diseases during the past two
weeks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
District administrations were not prepared to face such a
calamitous situation, said the director general.
</P>
<P>
Sazedur Rahman, director of the Meteorological Department,
listed four factors responsible for the unbearable weather
condition -- a thick blanket of fog for days, high humidity,
absence of sunshine, and a significant fall in temperature.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is highly unusual, as thick fog in the winter
used to evaporate because of sunshine by the mid-day. But this
time the fog is so thick," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the fog also increased air humidity and chill of
the cold, even though the lowest temperature remains within the
normal range.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the situation would start improving within a
few days, with the temperature rising and fog disappearing.

<HEADLINE> West Observer Group Endorses Kenya's Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's main west donors have
given endorsement to the results of the just-ended General
Election in the country, saying that local observers' conclusion
"seems justified and reasonable".
</P>
<P>
Early this month, three main local observer organizations said
in its final statement that the "results do on the whole reflect
the wishes of the Kenyan voters and should be accepted in total."
</P>
<P>
In the December 29 General Election, President Daniel arap Moi
emerged the winner after garnering over 2.4 million votes against
the closest challenger Mwai Kibaki of Democratic Party who got
more than 1.8 million votes.
</P>
<P>
The Donors' Democratic Development Group (DDDG) mainly
comprising 22 missions to Kenya said in a statement issued here
Friday that "we note the conclusion of the domestic observers."
</P>
<P>
"Based on our own election observation exercise, this
conclusion seems justified and reasonable," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The DDDG noted that it deployed international observers to
monitor all stages of the electional process, adding that it
commended the discipline and resolve of Kenyan voters who
demonstrated their commitment to the democratic process through
their broad and peaceful participation in the poll.
</P>
<P>
"On polling day and during the count, we noted the
determination, energy and spirit of cooperation demonstrated by
the vast majority of electoral officials in the field," it noted.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that few political meetings were prohibited and
that the police played an important role in maintaining peace
order during the campaigns and on polling day.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, cases of open bribery were witnessed,
intimidation of party supporters was prevalent while political
parties did not share equal coverage on state media.
</P>
<P>
The group urged the new government to address the challenging
issues including the alleviation of poverty, the rehabilitation
of the country's physical and social infrastructure, and
improvement of economic governance.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
set aside about 90 million U.S. Dollars to be used by the small
indigenous miners for environmental management in their
operations and the improvement of safety during 1998.
</P>
<P>
The money is expected to benefit over 70,000 black small-scale
miners in the country to purchase better and safer mining
equipment which is expected to reduce the high rates of accidents
mainly due to pits caving in on the miners, according to press
reports here today.
</P>
<P>
The money would help them adopt better environmental
management mining skills through the availability of training.
</P>
<P>
President of the National Miners' Association of Zimbabwe Paul
Munyoro said on Friday, "we intend to work in small groups
throughout all the provinces so that we can stretch the money a
little bit longer."
</P>
<P>
He said the small mining sector was set for a boom during 1998
as it was now recognized as an important player in the economy of
the country by both the government and large multi-national
mining companies.

<HEADLINE> Armed Robberies Inflict Heavy Losses on Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
cash-in-transit industry has suffered greatly in the frequent
armed robberies last year, local daily Saturday Star reported
today.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 400 incidents of armed holdups of
security vans during 1997, which resulted in 60 deaths of
security guards and the loss of about 150 million Rand (about 31
million U.S. Dollars) in cash.
</P>
<P>
Cash-in-transit companies are spending in excess of 500
million Rand (about 100 million U.S. Dollars) a year to prevent
armed robberies, but they are still fighting a losing battle,
said Bruce Stirton, manager of Fidelity Guards Operations, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"What we have seen over the past few years is a change from
amateur attempts to rob us to extremely well-coordinated and
professional operations.
</P>
<P>
"What is most alarming is the sheer size of the groups. They
are always looking for the weakest link in the chain, so we are
continually reviewing our security measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
The measures include the construction of wall transfer units
at banks and other major pick-up points which would allow cash
vans to lock against a building and therefore eliminate
"cross-pavement" attacks, and the purchase of state-of-the-art
cash-in-transit vans for up to one million Rand (200,000 U.S.
Dollars) each.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Forex Reserves Up at 1.178 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's foreign exchange
reserves rose by 15 million US dollars to 1.178 billion dollars in
early January from 1.163 billion dollars at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
The latest report by the State Bank of Pakistan shows that the
approved foreign exchange reserves believed to be held within the
country totaled 487.57 million dollars and the balance held abroad
stood at 690.85 million as of January 3.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the nominal rise in foreign exchange
reserves was achieved due to some commercial loans raised by
state-run banks.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan maintained foreign exchange reserves above one billion
dollar mark throughout the first half of the 1997-98 fiscal year
despite all economic and political problems.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November last year the country's foreign exchange
reserves went up as high as 1.621 billion dollars but a severe
government-judicial crisis coupled with other factors caused a
draw down of 437 million dollars within a month, bringing down the
reserves to 1.184 billion dollars in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
During the last three months of 1997, Pakistan had to spend
more than 400 million dollars on debt servicing which would have
caused a big decline in the foreign exchange reserves had the
country not received a 250 million dollar loan from the World Bank
for banking sector reforms.

Richter Scale would occur some time this year in the border area
of Shanxi, Hebei provinces and the Inner Mongolian Autonomous
Region, an official of the State Seismological Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The border area is the Shangyi county area in Zhangjiakou, some
220 km northwest of Beijing, which was jolted by an earthquake
measuring 6.2 on the Richter Scale at 11:50 AM (Beijing Time)
today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese seismologists made the prediction at a national
conference on the earthquake trend in China, which ended Friday
here in Beijing, said Luo Zhuoli, director of the State
Seismological Bureau's Analysis and Forecast Center.
</P>
<P>
"The prediction was based on various omens of earthquake,
including topographic changes and abnormalities of groundwater and
electro-magnetic wave," Luo said.
</P>
<P>
After accumulating experience of quake monitoring and analyses,
Chinese seismologists have drawn their "quite accurate
conclusion," Luo said.

<P>
China has established a quite advanced system for earthquake
monitoring, with its focus on the North China region and the
so-called quake belt from Gansu, Shaanxi to Sichuan and Yunnan
provinces.
</P>
<P>
All provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have
established their own quake monitoring networks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Today's quake at Shangyi County in Hebei Province illustrated
that China is experiencing the fifth active period for earthquakes
in the century which began in 1988 and will continue for several
years, Luo said.
</P>
<P>
The 1995-1997 period has witnessed at least 20 quakes measuring
over 6.0 on the Richter Scale in the country. Some 18 ones
occurred in the western areas, such as Yunnan, Qinghai provinces
and Xinjiang Uygur and Tibet autonomous regions, including the
most powerful quake with a magnitude of 7.5 in Manyi, north of
Tibet Autonomous Region, on November 8, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country had already experienced the last quake-active
period between 1960s and 1970s. On July 28, 1976, more than
200,000 people were killed in Tangshan, Hebei province, by a
catastrophic earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
"However, earthquake prediction remains at a probing stage
worldwide, and China is no exception," Luo said, adding that the
difficult undertaking "requires big investment."

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Gemstones Mines Urged to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Mines Minister
Syamukayumbu Sayamujaye has said that there is no transparency in
the operations of the gemstones mines because their products are
not put on the open market.
</P>
<P>
While touring the emerald area in Ndola Rural in the north of
Zambia he said that this is one of the problems facing the
government, Zambia Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
He urged the mines to stop operating secretly because this is
overshadowing their business and preventing them from attracting
investment into their operations.
</P>
<P>
"Government can only encourage you by way of policies. You
should stop operating from the pocket and get a system which is
transparent and be able to attract investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is reviewing the mine policies to make
it possible for all to participate for the success of the
gemstone industry.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government has extended the deadline
given to small scale miners to furnish the Ministry of Mines with
information about their environmental plans, sources of funding
and operations.
</P>
<P>
The miners had been given up to September last year to do so
but the exercise failed as only 10 showed they are doing viable
business.
</P>
<P>
Sayamujaye said the deadline remains extended as the
government will not want to push them into doing something in a
rush.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Develop High-Yielding Flood-Tolerant Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Biochemists are
working with American experts to develop a high-yielding
flood-tolerant rice variety through genetic engineering, the
national news agency BSS reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the research is to develop a high-yielding rice
variety with adequate protection against total submergence, leader
of the Bangladeshi biochemists Dr. N Anwar Hossain was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The biochemists are developing the rice variety under a
collaborative project funded by the U.S.-based Rockfeller
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
This type of transgenetic rice would be able to survive under
total submergence for at least two weeks, and so when the flood
water recedes these rice plants will thrive again.
</P>
<P>
Complete submergence of paddy fields by flash floods is a major
cause of large-scale destruction of rice in Bangladesh, and in
Many other Asian countries like India, China, Japan and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
On average, 1.5 million hectares of paddy fields in Bangladesh
are submerged every year, and in Asia, the yield loss due to
submergence is 79 kilograms per hectare, the BSS said.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- French May Pierce beat Karina
Habsudova of the Slovak Republic in the Hopman Cup tennis
tournament final in Perth, Australia, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Habsudova converted just two of 17 break points as Pierce
prevailed 6-4 7-5 after 100 minutes on court to give France a 1-0
lead in the tie.
</P>
<P>
The bustling Slovakian could also have benefited significantly
had she been able to extend the match into a final set.
</P>
<P>
Pierce, playing her fifth match in three days, battled
tightness in her left thigh, several times pulling up short in
pursuit of Habsudova winners.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 Australian Open champion needed four chances to clinch
the first set which lasted 51 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In the second, she broke Habsudova after the Slovak had a
terrible seventh game and had two opportunities to close out the
match in the 10th game.
</P>
<P>
But the former world No.10 staved off her demise, ripping two
terrific cross court winners from her forehand.
</P>
<P>
But Habsudova lost her next service game to love and then
couldn't control a big Pierce serve on the third match point.
</P>
<P>
"It was a pretty tough match, but I expected a pretty tough
match against Karina," Pierce said.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Wine Exports up in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Wine export of Chile earned
more than 382 million U.S. dollars in the first 11 months of 1997,
a 12 percent increase over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean Association of Producers of Fine Wines for Export
said that the volume of wine export also increased 18.76 percent
to 202 million liters in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The rise of export was attributed to the price hikes of Chilean
wines in the international market. The price increased from 1.58
dollars per liter to 1.89 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain and Canada are the main consumer
markets for Chilean wines with 108.8 million dollars, 62.7 million
dollars and 32.4 million dollars respectively, the association
said.

<HEADLINE> Tajikistan Hopes to Join Central Asian Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Tajikistan's President Emomuli
Sharipovich Rakhmonov said his country hoped to join the
three-member Central Asian Union, Panorama, the Russian language
weekly of Kazakhstan, reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov made the remarks shortly after he attended the
two-day Central Asian Summit, which brought together the
presidents of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan in Ashgabat, capital of Turkmenistan. The summit
meeting ended last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country has made full preparations for joining
the union made of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement reached between the Tajik government and
the opposition has officially been carried out since the second
half of last year, and stability has prevailed in the country,
Rakhmonov added.
</P>
<P>
The president added that Tajikistan hoped to improve the
worsening economy in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, none of the union members have made official positive
response to Tajikistan's statement. They just said they hoped
Tajikistan's peace process should be further promoted.
</P>
<P>
Panorama said that the union will not take in Tajikistan in the
near future due to the complicated situation in the country.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Turkey Trade Rows over Kurdish Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish embassy in Rome issued
a statement on Friday criticizing the Italian government's cold
response to fight against international organized terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Foreign Ministry, in return, issued a statement in
the evening, saying that the measures the Italian government
adopted to curb the recent emigration of Kurds to western Europe
were a kind of fight against organized crime.
</P>
<P>
In November 1997, the Turkish government suggested that Turkey
and Italy hold a joint commission meeting focusing on the issue of
illegal immigrants. But the Italian government showed indifference
toward the proposal.
</P>
<P>
As for the recent inflow of Kurdish immigrants via Italy's
borders, the Turkish statement said it was "groundless" to say
that most of the immigrants were from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Somebody is trying to isolate Turkey at any cost, the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
Italy said it was keen to cooperate with Turkey in repatriating
illegal immigrants and fighting organized crime.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 refugees, mainly Kurds, have arrived in Italy
in the past two weeks, after months of the influx of increased
Kurdish immigrants. Italy and other western European countries
demanded Turkey stop the flow.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Turkey and seven European Union countries
met here Thursday to discuss the issue of Kurdish immigrants, but
Turkey refused to sign a joint declaration issued after the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Progress Made in Ukraine's Economic Development: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko said here Friday that some positive signs emerged in
the country's social and economic development in the second half
of 1997 but crisis still remained.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a plenary session of the Cities' Association of
Ukraine, Pustovoitenko said Ukraine's annual inflation rate fell
to 10.1 percent in 1997 from 39.7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1997 also saw the relatively stable exchange rate
between the Ukranian currency of Gryvna and the U.S. dollar and
the increase of bank deposits, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister pointed out that the country's
economy has not yet recovered from the crisis as the government
failed to fulfill thorough reforms, especially in the fields of
structural reform and management.
</P>
<P>
The government's major tasks in 1998 are to stabilize the
economic situation and create opportunities for future economic
growth, Pustovoitenko said.
</P>
<P>
The government will try its best to help people get back the
arrears of wages, pensions and subsidies, guarantee the collection
of taxes and tighten budget disciplines, he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that up to mid-December 1997, the arrears of
wages and pension had reached 6 billion Gryvnas (about 3.16
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko said that his government will also take steps to
fulfill the privatization of securities and create opportunities
for the development of the private sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
The detailed scheme for Ukraine's social and economic
development in 1998 will be worked out by the Ukranian government
in the near future.

<HEADLINE> DTV Attracts More Attention in Las Vegas Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAS VEGAS, the United States, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Digital
Television (DTV) was the focus of attention of some 100,000
attendees at the annual International Consumer Electronics Show,
which was opened Thursday in Las Vegas, Nevada.
</P>
<P>
After more than a decade in development and 1 billion
U.S. dollars in research costs, dozens of manufacturers lined up
row after row of their first models of DTV sets at the show and
declared that "the revolution in digital television has begun."
</P>
<P>
"One of the very hottest items coming out of the show this year
is the retail debut of DTV sets," said Army Hill of the Consumer
Electronics Manufacturing Association, adding that "This is the
next generation of television."
</P>
<P>
The exhibition in Las Vegas usually serves as a showcase of
state-of-the-art products that will likely find their way onto
retail shelves in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
But the DTV sets will be unavailable in retail stores until
late autumn and the initial prices for 35-inch to 100-inch DTV
sets will be very high -- the cheapest model expected to retail at
3,000 U.S. dollars while most sets will range between 5,000 and
10,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"When color TV came out it took 21 years before more people had
color than black and white," said Paul Goldenberg, owner of La
Habra-based Paul's TV.
</P>
<P>
He suggested to consumers that they buy an analog TV and then
purchase a set-top converter box that will allow them to receive
digital signals.
</P>
<P>
By U.S. government regulation, at least one of
network-affiliated station in the 10 largest cities in the United
States will start digital broadcasts by November, and all
television signals will be digital by 2006.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Allan, general-manager of the broadcasting division of
Harris Corp., estimated that the prices for DTV sets would drop to
500-700 dollars in about 5 years and to 300 dollars within 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Digital television has twice the detail of traditional TV and
features the sort of sound normally found only at movie
theaters. In short, the digital age heralds the biggest leap
forward for the television since the introduction of color sets in
1954.
</P>
<P>
"This is the television American have dreamed of since
television was invented," said a salesman.
</P>
<P>
Within more than 250 million traditional TV sets in use in the
United States today, TV makers such as Hitachi, JVC, Mitsubishi,
Panasonic, Sony Corp., Sharp and Philips Electronics are rushing
to market this year with digital television sets -- hoping to reap
huge profits, once the prices gain acceptance.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Garment Export Earnings Up in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's biggest foreign
exchange maker, the garment industry, has earned 1.82 billion U.S.
dollars in the first 10 months of 1997, a 30 percent rise compared
with the same period in 1996, the Sri Lanka Apparel Exporter's
Association said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The industry made an earning of 1.4 billion dollars from
January to October in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The rise was due to measures taken by the government in the
last three years to strengthen the garment industry, the
association said.
</P>
<P>
Local businessmen have been encouraged to produce fabrics and
other raw material for the garment industry, reducing the
expenditure on raw material imports from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, training courses are conducted in two institutes to
enhance the skills of those engaged in the industry.
</P>
<P>
The association said currently the industry is providing
employment to over 260,000 people. Fifty more new factories will
be set up by the government in the coming years, creating 12,500
more jobs for the locals.

<P>
The two countries share much in common and may have
technological, scientific, cultural, economic and trade
cooperation, according to the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
They may also cooperate in the international arena in order to
benefit the people of both countries and their respective regions,
said Dlamini.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between China and South Africa has grown from
14 million US dollars in 1991 to 1.6 billion US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises have invested more than 100 million US
dollars in their projects in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I am only eight-month old in China and I have been trying to
read books about China to understand the country and its people,"
Dlamini said, adding that "China is a very sophisticated and
complicated country".
</P>
<P>
"However, I think what I discovered is that people here are
very receptive, warm, amiable and cooperative, that is one of
reasons why it was possible for us to achieve the normalization of
bilateral relations," he said, adding that "because you are
dealing with people who are honest and ready to engage in
discussions on any issue".
</P>
<P>
Dlamini, a football fan, expressed pleasure over the success of
South African football team to enter the World Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed regret over the fact that the Chinese men's
football team failed to gain entry into the finals.
</P>
<P>
"But, something I cannot understand is that Chinese women in
soccer are leading in China," said the Ambassador, who watched the
performances of the women's national football team in Asian
Women's Soccer Championships.
</P>
<P>
"They are very skillful and they are the best team in the whole
of Asia," said Dlamini.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his willingness to facilitate exchanges between
soccer teams in the two nations. "Among friends, nothing is
impossible," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that 1998 would be a prosperous and productive year for
everyone," said the ambassador.

<HEADLINE> Number of Illegal Immigrants in Mexico-U.S. Border Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 14,849 illegal
immigrants were detained in the last quarter of 1997 along the
Mexico-U.S. border, much fewer than the previous record, a senior
official of the Texas Border Patrol Intelligence said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Moreno said that the Border Patrol detained 5,914
illegal immigrants in October, 5,171 in November, and 3,764 in
December.
</P>
<P>
But in August alone, 13,617 undocumented immigrants were
detained, while in September the figure was 9,547, Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the plummeted number of illegal immigrants to the
implementation of the "Operation Rio Grande" in late August.
</P>
<P>
On August 25, 1997, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) started the first phase of the "Operation Rio
Grande" between the U.S. city of Brownsville, Texas, and the
Mexican city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas.
</P>
<P>
The operation, aimed at "sealing" the border to prevent the
crossing of illegal immigrants, has been supported by a
considerable increase in the number of border agents, and the use
of the most advanced military technology to detect people
illegally crossing at any time of the day.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Strengthens on Reform Commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah bounced
back more than 20 percent at its peak Friday, after a dramatic
collapse Thursday, thanks to the central bank's support and
various positive news in the market.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said Saturday sentiment had improved after
U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke with President Soeharto about
the economic crisis and the latter voiced his commitment to
reforms agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The rupiah topped 7,600 against the U.S. dollar in the morning
trading session Friday before ending at 7,800/8,300, compared to
an opening of 10,200/10,700.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad voiced optimism that the
rupiah would continue to strengthen and the government would
continue its efforts to stabilize the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the rupiah got support from Bank Indonesia, the
central bank, through state banks and some dollar selling by
Singapore operators.
</P>
<P>
Some state banks were seen selling a significant amount of
dollars in the spot market, they added.
</P>
<P>
However, the stock market did not trail the strengthening
rupiah. It failed to hold early gains and shed more than 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index closed 4.13 points
lower to 342.97, off a high of 362.79 in the morning, from 347.10
the previous day.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta currency market was symbolically marked by dollar
selling by President Soeharto's eldest daughter, Siti Hardiyanti
Rukmana, who campaigned for dollar selling by Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
She sold about 50,000 of her savings account at state-owned
Bank Bumi Daya to buy rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia Governor J. Soedradjad Djiwandono said he
welcomed such an initiative.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 9 (Xinhua) -- High-level delegations from
Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico will gather together this week in
Panama to start negotiations on their joint efforts in the
establishment of the Multilateral Anti-drug Center (CMA).
</P>
<P>
Sources of the Panamanian Foreign Ministry said on Friday that
the high-ranking Latin American representatives, including vice
foreign ministers of the three countries, are expected to meet
next Monday with the members of the Panamanian and the U.S.
negotiating team and discuss details of the planned anti-drug
organization.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian and the U.S. governments reached a week ago an
agreement in principle on the possible establishment of the CMA in
the Howard U.S. military base near the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
"Although Panama and the United States have already agreed on
the juridical basis for the CMA operation, this is a response to
proposals of modification made by other participating countries,"
said the Panamanian Foreign Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian authorities consider that the arrival of the
Latin American delegations can be the beginning of dialogues with
other nations in the region which are interested in contributing,
through the CMA, their efforts to the fight against
drug-trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Delay Purchase of Russia's Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI) is planning to delay the purchase of 12 Russian Sukhoi
Su-30K fighters because of the currency beleaguering the country,
a military officer said.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to delay the purchase of the Sukhois," armed forces
spokesman wahab Mokodongan said here Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government decided last August to buy the
fighters along with eight MI-17 helicopters from Russia as part of
a defense modernization program.
</P>
<P>
The deal was estimated to be worth 500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mokodongan did not say if the military also panned to delay the
purchase of the helicopters, but he admitted the currency crisis
had forced the military to trim all its spending. "This move will
save us millions of U.S. dollars," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The monetary crisis, which started in early July last year, has
badly hit Indonesia's economy. The country's currency, rupiah, has
lost more than 200 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government said the economic growth in 1997 fell
to 5.1 percent form 7.98 percent in 1996. The country's inflation
rate also rose from 4.67 percent in 1996 to 11.5 percent last

<HEADLINE> Killing of Students Remembered in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The labor unions and student
and social organizations of Panama Friday marked the 34th
anniversary of 23 students who were killed by U.S. troops in the
country.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 associations held a protest in the main plaza of
the center of the capital, and the Association of Panamanian
Professors scheduled a mass in the Church of Christ the King, as
well as a ceremony at the graves of the students.
</P>
<P>
The 23 students were killed on January 9, 1964 during a protest
against the presence of the U.S. forces in Panama, causing the
suspension of the diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Several leaders considered the memory as an offense to the
Panamanian-U.S. negotiations on the establishment of a
multinational anti-drug center in Panama after 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition said that the new center will extend
the presence of the U.S. military forces in Panama, which violates
the Torrijos-Carter treaties signed in 1977. The treaties
stipulated that the U.S. military forces must be withdrawn from
the country before December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government had decreed January 9 as the Day of
the Martyr and banned any sales of alcohol and music in public on
the day.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Social Welfare Minister Mitchell Doens said
government officials will attend the commemorative ceremonies, but
normal activities will not be interrupted.

<HEADLINE> Austria Proposes Sending High-level EU Mission to Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Foreign Minister said
Friday that the European Union troika of Luxembourg, Britain and
Austria should send a high-level delegation to Algeria to help
solve the crisis in this North African country.
</P>
<P>
The EU wants to offer humanitarian aid to Algeria and cooperate
in the fight against terrorism, he said.
</P>
<P>
But it would be tough for the proposed EU mission, as it has to
achieve "constructive" results on the basis of non-interference in
 Algeria's internal affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf said on Thursday that his
country will welcome a visit by EU delegates as long as they only
discuss cooperation in the fight against "terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Algeria has consistently rejected foreign involvement in
dealing with its six-year-old conflict which has claimed 65,000
lives. The conflict started after the government canceled a
general election dominated by Islamic fundamentalists.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Trade up 12.1 percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- China's total volume of import
and export trade reached 325.06 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, 12.1
percent more than the 1996 figure, according to statistics from
the country's General Administration of Customs (GAC).
</P>
<P>
The year of 1997 was the 15th year of sustainable growth for
China's foreign trade, GAC said.
</P>
<P>
The export volume was 182.7 billion U.S. dollars, up 20.9
percent and the import volume, 142.36 billion U.S. dollars, up 2.5
percent. The favorable balance of the trade was 40.34 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A GAC official said that the fast growing export has become a
major factor for China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said that last year both China's general trade and
processing trade were on the increase.
</P>
<P>
The general trade value was 117 billion U.S. dollars,
up 14.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The processing trade value was 169.81 billion U.S. dollars,
increasing by 15.8 percent and accounting for 52.2 percent of
China's total foreign trade volume.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the foreign trade volume of the
state-owned enterprises and overseas-funded businesses also
grew. Last year, the export and import volume of the
state-owned enterprises was 163.06 billion U.S. dollars while that
of the overseas-funded enterprises was 152.62 billion U.S. dollars,
increasing by 12.7 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the Customs, China's 10 largest trade partners in
the world last year included Japan, Hong Kong, the United States,
the European Union, and the Republic of Korea. China's trade with
the 10 largest trade partners totaled 272.16 billion U.S. dollars
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria's Inflation Rate Climbs to 577 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's inflation rate climbed
to 577 percent in 1997, the highest since 1989 when the country
started reforming its economic system, Bulgarian media reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted the National Statistics Bureau as saying
that the inflation rate stood at 43.8 percent in January and
rocketed to 242.7 percent in February, the highest monthly rate in
the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The skyrocketing inflation was put under control four months
later and dropped to 0.7 percent. In the second half of 1997, the
monthly rate stood around 1 percent except in August which saw 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, as the high rates in the first two months greatly
enlarged the base of the accumulatively-calculated annual rate,
Bulgaria's inflation rate in 1997 inevitably reached a new high.
</P>
<P>
The reports attributed the high inflation rate in 1997 to the
slump of the exchange rate of Bulgaria's currency, the Lev,
against the U.S. dollar, the rise in the prices of fuel and energy
and the shortage of commodity supplies.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's budget for 1998, passed at the end of last year, has
a projected inflation rate of 16.4 percent in the new year. But
economists predicted that the de facto figure could be above 20
percent.

<HEADLINE> 100,000 Workers May Lose Jobs in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- About 100,000 workers in the
Southern Philippines, or 10 percent of the region's 1.1 million
labor force, will lose their jobs, if the nation's economic
situation continues to deteriorate, the newspaper "Today" reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Luchie Flores, secretary-general of the
Cagayan de Oro Chamber of Commerce and Industry Foundation Inc.,
as saying that productivity in North Mindanao, the Southern
Philippines, has fallen 15 percent since the third quarter of
1997.
</P>
<P>
"Thus productivity trend will continue to fall from 20 to 25
percent by the end of the second quarter of this year if the
government will not come up with a contingency measure to cushion
the fall," Flores said.
</P>
<P>
She said that those who borrowed money, especially in foreign
currencies, to finance their business have already seen the value
of their debts tripled over the last six months, and their debts
will continue to rise if the peso sinks further against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
"What exacerbated the problem is the high interest rates of
client-unfriendly banks refusing new loans if their clients cannot
pay off all outstanding debts," she said.
</P>
<P>
If the currency crisis continues to affect small business in
North Mindanao, Flores said, 100,000 workers in the region will be
laid off this year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso has lost about 42 percent of its value
since Last July when a Thai currency crisis spread to other
Southeast Asian countries. The downturn has continued this week
and the exchange rate between the peso and the dollar has fallen
to 45:1.

MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia believes that there is no
reason to regard the enhanced cooperation among five Central Asian
countries as something that will hurt the cooperation within the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a Russian official said
on Friday.
</P>

Valery Nesterushkin, spokesman for the Russian Foreign

summit held early this week in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan's
capital. The summit was attended by presidents of Kyrgyzstan,
Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

The summit calls for long-term cooperation among countries in
the Central Asian region.
</P>
<P>
There can be various forms of cooperation among CIS members,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Russia believes that such regional cooperation will not only
enhance the economic power of countries in this region, but also
expand the scope of cooperation within the CIS, he said.

BRASILIA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Navy is planning
to buy 20 A-4 Skyhawk aircraft worth 70 million U.S. dollars from
the United States, the first step to boost the navy's fighting
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The final decision will be made by President Fernando Henrique

<P>
The aircraft carrier will be replaced by a new one in eight to
10 years at the cost of 400-700 million dollars, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Brazil decided to buy the planes which were built in the
1950s. The production of the aircraft stopped in 1979 because of
their low price, said the naval authorities.
</P>

BANGKOK, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Gold Traders Association of
Thailand met on Friday to discuss setting up a bank for the public
to deposit gold in exchange for government bonds to boost the
country's reserves.
</P>
<P>
The association decided to allow deposits of gold of 96.5
percent purity, which is the approximate purity of most jewelry
gold sold in retail shops.
</P>
<P>
The association suggested that bonds for one-baht weight (15.2
grams) and 10-baht weight of gold be issued.
</P>
<P>
Those who deposit less than one baht weight of gold would have
to add cash to make up the difference, the association suggested.
</P>
<P>
The current retail price of gold is about 6,200 baht (115 US
dollars) per baht weight.
</P>
<P>
The association has appointed an 11-member panel to draft the
plan.

<HEADLINE> Year of Tiger Good for Both South Africa and China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Chris Dlamini, the first
Ambassador of South Africa to China, said that the year of the
tiger would be good for both South Africa and China.
</P>
<P>
In a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua, the ambassador
said the animal, tiger, is "beautiful" and "aggressive", while
the Chinese believe the tiger symbolizes vigor and auspiciousness.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, all agree that the "Year of the Tiger" will be a
good year.
</P>
<P>
"I would expect that China in 1998 would be more aggressive in
its attempts to address the question of economic development, both
for itself and for its partners," Dlamini said.
</P>
<P>
"I expect more especially because it is in the year of tiger to
translate commitments that the two countries made into reality for
both China and South Africa," he added.
</P>
<P>
China and South Africa established diplomatic relations at the
ambassadorial level on January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini, appointed as the first South African Ambassador to
China by President Nelson Mandela, assumed his office on January 1.
</P>
<P>
"We had a good ending (at the end of last year) when the
foreign ministers of the two countries signed a joint communique
on the establishment of diplomatic relations," Dlamini said.
</P>
<P>
"And also we had a very good beginning. On January 1, the two
countries implemented it (the communique)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini arrived in Beijing last April to serve as the director
of the Beijing-based South African Center for Chinese Studies,
which became the South African Embassy in Beijing on January 1.
</P>
<P>
He cited the normalization of bilateral relations as "an
historic achievement" for both countries and said that his major
objective is to strengthen the relationship between South Africa
and China.
</P>
<P>
"It is an honor for me to be appointed as the first Ambassador
of South Africa to China, one of the biggest countries in the
world," Dlamini said, adding that he will bear "more and higher"
responsibilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The sawn-off head of
Copenhagen's Little Mermaid statue was recovered on Friday, police
said.
</P>
<P>
A television cameraman was contacted on Thursday night by an
anonymous caller to arrange the filming of the severed head before
its return.
</P>
<P>
A local television channel showed photographs taken at a secret
location of a hooded man with the statue's severed head. The
cameraman later described the vandals as "young boys."
</P>
<P>
The missing head of the small bronze figure turned up in a box
early Friday outside a local television station, which had offered
a 25,000 crown (3,580 U.S. dollars) reward for its return.
</P>
<P>
The statue, symbol of Copenhagen, was found decapitated for the
second time in 34 years early on Tuesday. The Little Mermaid lost
her head once before in 1964.
</P>
<P>
The statue, a masterpiece of renowed sculptor Edvard Eriksen
finished in 1913, is located on the waterfront of the Danish
capital and attracts almost one million tourists a year.
</P>
<P>
It depicts the young heroine of Denmark's 19th-century author
Hans Christian Andersen's famous fairytale, "The Daughter of The
Sea."
</P>
<P>
The incident is under investigation and the search for the
culprits is going on.

<HEADLINE> Yuan and Her Coach to be Sent Home after FINA Hearings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PERTH, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese swimming delegation
is to send swimmer Yuan Yuan and her coach Zhou Zewen home after
FINA's doping panel hearings, a delegation official said here
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Yuan was found in her bag a banned drug growth hormone in the
Sydney Customs' routine baggage check during her stopover at
Sydney airport on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Coach Zhou said that he packed up Yuan's baggage in Beijing and
put the drug into her bag. Zhou told the customs that "his friend
in Canberra asked him to take the substance into Australia."
</P>
<P>
A six-member doping panel of the world swimming ruling body
FINA is now holding a hearing over the drug issue. "The doping
panel will probably hold more than one hearing," said the
delegation official who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
"We have booked flight tickets to Beijing for Yuan and her
coach," he added.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Yuan and Zhou were now waiting for the
Sydney Customs' punishment and FINA doping panel's decision.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian laws, the maxiimum penalty for
carrying banned drug is 50,000 Australian dollars and the minimum
is a warning from the customs.
</P>
<P>
The FINA doping panel, which has the right to apply santions on
individuals and federations, is expected to consider the case
under FINA rule DC 9.1.
</P>
<P>
The rule states that "trading, trafficking, distributing or
selling any banned substances" is a doping offence. A conviction
brings a minimum penalty of four years' suspension.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales Drop Due to Peso Depreciation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Passenger car sales in the
Philippines dropped by 15 percent in 1997 to 75,707 units from
88,977 in 1996 due to the continuing depreciation of the peso.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers Inc.
indicates that last December's sale nose-dived 42 percent to 4,709
from 8,137 units a year ago and a 3 percent decline from the 4,868
units in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Mario de Grano, secretary-general of the chamber, said the
Peso's fall triggered higher interest rates on car loans and led
banks and other financial institutions to be more selective in the
approval of retail papers, and to increase the down payment
requirement on prospective clients.
</P>
<P>
Coming from a growth in sales of 20 percent in 1996, the
chamber originally projected car sales to reach by 100,000 in 1997
but revised it to only 74,000 units toward the end of the year as
the market continued its spiraling downward trend started as early
as the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine currency has depreciated from 26.4 pesos to the
dollar to 45 peso since last July, a fall of 42 percent in six
months. The currency devaluation also forced the government and
individuals in the country to adopt belt-tightening measures to
tide over the crisis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congressman Hopes to Visit Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Tom Lantos, a Democratic
Representative, has written to Iranian President Mohamma Khatami
expressing his wish to visit the Islamic nation to see whether
there is a basis for improvement in U.S.-Iranian relations, a
Lantos aide said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lantos sent his letter on Thursday, a day after Khatami's
groundbreaking interview with CNN was broadcast both in the
United States and Iran, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
Lantos said in his letter that President Bill Clinton's State
of the Union address will take place on Jan. 27, after which
Congress will resume normal activities. Lantos said it would be
most convenient for him to visit Iran before that date.
</P>
<P>
Lantos last visited Iran as a university professor i 1978, a
year before the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Since breaking down of diplomatic relations between the two
countries in 1980, visits by members of Congress have been rare.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said in the interview with CNN that he preffered
cultural exchanges first and a people-to-people dialogue rather
than any political contact. But Washington has repeated its call
for a government-to-government dialogue, which it said was the
best way to address differences between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Dow Lost 220 as Wall Street Tumbles Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street plunged
today, with the Dow industrials falling as much as 275 points as
investors worried that the continuing Asian economic crisis would
eventually hurt economies around the world.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average finished with a loss of 222.20
points, or 2.85 percent, to 7,580.42 after a modest recovery in
the final half-hour. Trading was heavy in bringing the Dow's loss
so far this year to 328 points, or more than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was the Dow's worst day since its 554-point drop Oct. 27 and
its fourth-worst point drop ever.
</P>
<P>
Broad market indicators also were sharply lower, with the
Nasdaq Stock Market suffering its second-worst point drop.
</P>
<P>
Stocks fell after another decline in financial markets across
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered gainers by a 9-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume topped 745.36 million shares
as against 651.24 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 28.35 to 927.69, and
the NYSE composite index fell 14.18 points to 487.46.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index dropped 52.35 to 1,503.19, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 17.32 to 650.24.
</P>
<P>
While Indonesian markets recovered Friday, there were still
worries about the country's outlook. On Friday, Indonesia's main
stock index fell only 1.2 percent after a 12 percent plunge
Thursday. The Indonesian currency rebounded more than 20 percent
from Thursday's decline after President Suharto pledged to carry
out decisive economic reform under an International Monetary Fund
bailout plan.
</P>
<P>
But the latest turmoil in parts of Asia did not shake several
other key markets.

<HEADLINE> EU Welcomes US Review of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
announced that it welcomed a planned U.S. review of its sanctions
policy, which has been a major source of tension between the
United States and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU made the announcement in response to what U.S.
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat said Wednesday in
Washington about a review by the U.S. State Department of its
sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat reportedly said that the U.S. State Department was
"reviewing the use of this controversial tool" and that it was
establishing a team to find ways to make sanctions more effective
in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the penalties on foreign companies doing
business in Iran remained a "live" option.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two huge trading partners across the
Atlantic have been soured in recent years by threatened U.S.
sanctions against foreign companies doing business in Cuba, Iran
and Libya.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan told
reporters the EU welcomed a review of the sanctions, which it
believed were against international rules.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that a U.S. probe into the French energy company
Total had not been resolved yet. "We still have to see what it
means in reality," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been angered by the 1996 Helms-Burton law, which
tightened the U.S. embargo against Cuba by threatening to punish
foreign companies which invest in property confiscated after the
1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
Another key cause for the EU-U.S. tension has been the
Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, which was passed to punish foreign firms
which would continue to invest in Libya and Iran.

<HEADLINE> Group of 77 to Hold Ceremonial Meeting on January 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 77 will hold
a ceremonial meeting on Monday, 12 January, 1998 in the
Trusteeship Council Chamber at the Headquarters of the United
Nations to mark the formal turnover of the Chairmanship of the
Group of 77, a press communique said today.
</P>
<P>
The Chairmanship of the Group of 77 for 1998 was assumed on
January 1, 1998 by Ambassador Makarim Wibisono, permanent
representative of Indonesia to the United Nations, from Jakaya M.
Kikwete, minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation
of the United Republic of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 77 was created on June 15, 1964 when 77 developing
countries adopted a joint declaration at the conclusion of the
first United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
The evolution and history of the Group of 77 have been
intimately linked with the United Nations system, demonstrating
the dedication of developing countries to the goals and objectives
of the Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The activities of the group have vastly expanded since the
adoption by the First Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 in
October 1967 of the Charter of Algiers, as evidenced by the
Caracas Program of Action in May 1981 which represents an
integrated program for South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest single grouping of states, the Group of
77, which has played during three decades a cardinal role in
international economic relations, particularly calling for the
establishment of a more equitable international economic order,
has been a major actor as prime initiator of initiatives relating
to development and international economic cooperation among
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> EU Hopes for Deal Reached on Deutsche Telecoms Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU) official
said today that he would welcome any "satisfactory solution" to a
row over fees Deutsche Telekom plans to charge customers who are
going to switch to its competitors.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman Friday quoted EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van
Miert as saying that the EU would welcome a decent solution to the
row as long as it was in line with EU competition treaties.
</P>
<P>
The planned fees, ranging from 85 to some 100 German marks (135
to 160 U.S. dollars), will be charged from the German phone
company's clients who are switching to its rivals.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Van Miert was quoted as saying that such fees were normally
unacceptable to the EU's executive body, the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman added that the EU executive so far had
not received any complaint as regards the planned fees. He said
the Commission had written to ask for relevant information from
German competition authorities.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU executive would also consult other European
telecoms companies to see if such fees were commonly required.
