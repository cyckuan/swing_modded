<P>
   By early Wednesda morning, the line was thick outside Courtroom
401 in the central building of Maricopa County's Superior Court
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies guarding the door lined po tential spectators against
the dark panel ing of the hallway, then began scribbling numbers on
scraps of paper and handing them out to those who'd have to wait
for a seat to open up in the crowded court room.
</P>
<P>
   A skinny, brown-eyed schoolgirl re ceived No. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you here?'' a deputy asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see my mom,'' the girl answered. ``She's on the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   No one else had a good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the courtroom, prosecutor Juan Martinez began his final
argument in the case against Scott Falater, the pale, soft-spoken
man who says he was sleep walking when he stabbed his wife 44
times, then dumped her into the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, in Courtroom 402, prosecu tors and defense attorneys
argued over ev idence in the case of five young men accused of
kidnapping and raping a 15-year-old girl with a mental capacity of
a 6- to 8-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is trying to convince a jury the sex was
consensual. &QL; 
`CENTER OF UNIVERSE'
</P>
<P>
   In the hallway outside the two rooms are lawyers and gawkers and
deputies and family members and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A row of television trucks is parked outside the building,
antennas rising from their roofs like the flower stalks of agave
plants. TV cables snake along the lino leum floor of the hallway,
which is buffed each night and reflects fluorescent lamps in the
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   People lounge on cement benches and vinyl-covered chairs, their
skin waxy in the light.
</P>
<P>
   It's quiet, both inside the courtrooms and out.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Everything we're interested in is right here, in this building,
along this hallway, being performed for us in two long-run ning
plays in adjoining theaters.
</P>
<P>
   There's love and hate, sex, murder, fear, suspicion, race.
</P>
<P>
   There are cops and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   We can watch it in person or we can watch it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, that's what we like to do. We like to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters from all over the country are here, watching.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth floor of the central building of the Maricopa County
Superior Court complex has become the center of our city, the
center of the nation, the center of our universe. &QL; 
EXCUSES ON TRIAL
</P>
<P>
   A television camera focuses on prose cutor Martinez as he pulls
on surgical gloves, then lifts a plastic bag holding the murder
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   He opens the bag and pulls out the knife and grips it like a
killer, plunging it into the imagined torso of poor Yarmila
Falater, whose photograph is projected on a courtroom television.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the actual murder that interests us, though. Just as
it's not the rape being tried in the courtroom next door.
</P>
<P>
   It's the excuses.
</P>
<P>
   Will a guy who claims he was asleep _ who managed to recognize
his dog but not his wife, then cut her to pieces _ get away with
it? Will five punks taking ad vantage of a girl with the mind of
sec ond-grader convince a jury the sex was consensual?
</P>
<P>
   Martinez asked jurors not to fall for a fairy tale. He spoke of
the novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes. He said Quixote's
companion, Sancho Panza, at first recognized the old man was
jousting at windmills. Over time, however, and with constant
exposure to Quixote's rant ings, Panza came to believe in the fan
tasy. Is that how it is in court?
</P>
<P>
   Can buggy fantasy absolve brutal real ity? And, if it can work
for an accused murderer or accused rapists, can it work for us?
</P>
<P>
   Cervantes was never in the county courthouse here, but he
managed to put a line in Don Quixote for everyone on the fourth
floor and everyone at home, watching. It goes, ``Tell me what com
pany thou keepest, and I'll tell thee what thou art.'' &QL;

CIA ANALYST QUESTIONED TARGET BEFORE CHINESE EMBASSY BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A midlevel analyst in the CIA raised doubts about
whether military planners were zeroing in on the right building
shortly before American bombs struck the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, the night of May 7, government officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials spoke on the same day that the administration
began to brief Congress about an internal investigation of the
bombing that included an account of the analyst's warning. The
administration provided a similar reconstruction to the Chinese
last week in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The officials gave slightly conflicting accounts of the timing
and specificity of the warnings, first reported in The Washington
Post on Thursday. But for whatever reason, according to the
administration, the doubts either came too late or were lost in the
bureaucratic thicket before the strike that killed three Chinese
and wounded at least 20 others.
</P>
<P>
   The accident, at the height of NATO's air campaign meant to
deter Yugoslav forces from atrocities against Albanians in Kosovo,
was a stinging embarrassment to the United States and a serious
setback to relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis immediately after the satellite-guided bombs from
an American B-2 struck the embassy, military officials explained
that the intended target had been the headquarters of a Yugoslav
arms agency that is actually a few blocks from the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put an X on the map, but we put the X in the wrong place,''
a senior American official said at the time. The arms agency and
the embassy are about 200 yards apart.
</P>
<P>
   According to the officials familiar with the investigation, the
midlevel analyst did not know where the embassy was situated. But
based on his familiarity with downtown Belgrade, he did know _ or
thought he knew _ where the arms-agency headquarters was.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the building being targeted might not be the
headquarters, though he left open the possibility that it was a
related office, according to one official.
</P>
<P>
   One official said the analyst had raised his concerns many days
in advance of the bombing mission. Two other officials, however,
said Wednesday that the warnings were raised closer to the May 7
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been a few more days, it could have been
prevented,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior government official said Wednesday night that a
classified report from the inspector general's office of the CIA
has concluded that the analyst's cautions indeed went unheeded _ in
large measure because he departed for two days of training and
returned to discover, to his horror, that the bombers were already
on their way.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Wednesday night, and might not be for some
time, how furious an alarm the analyst had tried to raise before
his departure, and whether his superiors had simply dismissed the
warnings or given them serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was saying, `Gee, I don't think that's the right
building,''' one official recalled Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the bombing mission, CIA officials and
senior officers at the U.S. military's European Command learned to
their dismay that American bombs had struck the Chinese Embassy.
Pictures of grief-stricken survivors amid the rubble were a deep
embarrassment to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When the target was initially checked against electronic mapping
data in U.S. and NATO computers to guard against civilian
casualties, no alarms were sounded because a half-dozen government
databases had the location of the old Chinese Embassy, not the new
one, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav arms agency headquarters were picked because
intelligence experts have long suspected that it helped America's
rivals to develop advanced weapons, and that it sold weapons to
help finance the Yugoslav military, American officials explained
immediately after the warning.
</P>
<P>
   In their briefing to Congress Wednesday, the administration
officials said that a cascading series of errors contributed to the
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The first involved the use of three outdated maps, two
commercial maps made in Yugoslavia and a 1997 map prepared by the
National Intelligence Mapping Agency. That map was based on
information in a series of intelligence agency databases that were
outdated. But when the databases were checked against each other,
no mistake was detected _ because they were all based on the same
sources. ``There was some circularity to the databases,'' one
official said, meaning that they were based on the same erroneous
information.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the address of the embassy, and thus its coordinates,
was extrapolated based on an examination of numbers on nearby
streets. ``It was a pretty rough estimate,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation of how the mistakes were made was given to the
Chinese last week by Thomas Pickering, the undersecretary of state,
in a mission to Beijing that also included representatives of the
Pentagon, the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National
Security Council. To the surprise of the American delegation, their
Chinese counterparts were matter-of-fact about the incident. ``They
raised no allegations or alternative scenarios,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese officials had demanded earlier to know the names of
those responsible, and to get an account of whether they were being
held responsible. But Pickering's delegation deflected those
questions, identifying no individuals and simply assuring the
Chinese that ``there would be no attempt to whitewash the
incident,'' one administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   But a week after the explanation, relations with Beijing still
seem frozen in place. Chinese officials have not restarted talks on
China's effort to join the World Trade Organization, a negotiation
that was reaching its final stages when the bombing occurred and
resulted in an outpouring of government-orchestrated anti-American
protests on the streets of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It now looks like this is going to take a long time to get
back to normal,'' one trade official said Wednesday.

ON YOUR MARKS, GET SET, SHOOT!

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unbelievable as it sounds, the United States Golf Association
almost staged a perfect U.S. Open. That would be akin to the winner
shooting a record score all four days and the rest of the field
wearing smiles bigger than their corporate logos.
</P>
<P>
   The players actually liked way the USGA prepared the course
since they didn't have to use a weed whacker to advance balls from
the secondary rough. Even par 4's played with a driver, 2- or
3-woods, a wedge and a putter, and had the participants talking
about thinking rather than thinking about cussing.
</P>
<P>
   OK, John Daly did have a meltdown on Sunday after taking 11
strokes on one hole and a subsequent swipe at the USGA. By
Wednesday he had apologized.
</P>
<P>
   But after all, this is the USGA, which year after year seems set
on embarrassing the world's best golfers rather than identifying
them. So on Sunday afternoon, as Payne Stewart, Phil Mickelson and
Tiger Woods struggled with figuring out the treacherous slopes of
Pinehurst No. 2 in an Open finish for the ages, the USGA realized
it had one shot left at controversy,
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievable as it sounds, the USGA took it.
</P>
<P>
   It clocked the final two groups, which raises the possibility of
a penalty stoke for slow play. This means that the players had a
certain amount of time to hit the ball, depending on the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   With THE major of all majors on the line, the USGA expects the
contenders to pick up the pace? On a course made as difficult as
possible?
</P>
<P>
   Who or what was being held up anyway besides NBC's Sunday-night
lineup? What did the rules guys think they were watching, the NBA?
</P>
<P>
   The NBC broadcast crew did not make a big deal about this. I
slipped away from the television several times during the lengthy
telecast but was there at the end and heard a lot of blathering
about courage, destiny, missed opportunities and a baby on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Don't recall much about slowpokes, though.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I was stunned when I tuned into the postmatch press
conference televised live by The Golf Channel and heard Woods, who
tied for third with Vijay Singh, raise the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Had Woods not blown a couple of short putts, no more than six
feet worth, he might have been in a playoff on Monday. He seemed
more miffed, and rightly so, about the time-clock issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree being on the clock when you're in the last few
groups of a major championship,'' said Woods. ``With the greens as
severe as they are . . . it takes time to figure out the slopes. I
understand the pace-of-play rule, but there are exceptions to it.
And by looking at these greens, I think that's a pretty good
exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods and his playing partner weren't guilty of holding up
Stewart and Michelson. And those two were being followed only by
thousands of fans and, unfortunately, Tom Meeks, the director of
rules and competition for the USGA, or as he's also known, the
ultimate clock watcher.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks whipped out the stopwatch at almost the same point in last
year's tournament at San Francisco's Olympic Club: the 11th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had noticed the play was slow for several holes,'' Meeks
told the Associated Press. Seems Stewart and Michelson were
dallying a little to much for Meeks taste. Hey,I always thought
golf was a sport you clocked with a sundial.
</P>
<P>
   Not Mr. Meeks. He informed Trey Holland, the USGA's vice
president, that Stewart and Michelson were on the clock. What was
the rush? An Open course demands long rounds. Holland approached
Stewart, who was on the way to the 12th tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me you're putting us on the clock,'' said Stewart,
and then walked away after Holland gave them the news. Mickelson
took it in stride. He'd gotten the same message all four days.
Besides, if his baby beeper went off, he was out of there anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart makes a good point.
</P>
<P>
   When you are concentrating on winning a major championship, it's
hard to keep tabs on the group in front of you or how many minutes
it takes to figure your way out of trouble, which Open courses have
in abundance. Stewart suggested the USGA try to pick up the pace
during the first two days of competition.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, golfers are rarely given a penalty stroke, but just
knowing they are on the clock can be disruptive. In a major it can
be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   USGA officials could not be reached this week for comment on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   They might have already heard from Stewart, even though he liked
the way the entire contest was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell Tom Meeks, `I thought this was a golf
tournament and not a track meet,' '' he said.

AIDED BY LINEUP SHIFT, YANKS ROUT DEVIL RAYS, 12-4 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The New York Yankees wipe away the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays like lint, so it's hard to accept everything they
accomplish at face value. But there is no question the lineup
changes made last week are helping Bernie Williams and, in turn,
the entire Yankee offense.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, shifted from cleanup to No. 2 last Friday, had four
more hits Wednesday night in a 12-4 rout of the Devil Rays, and the
Yankees (41-28) moved to 13 games over .500 for the first time this
season. Tino Martinez had two home runs among the Yankees'
season-high 19 hits. ``It's nice to come here and get it going,''
said Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   In a seeming mismatch that pitted five-time Cy Young Award
winner Roger Clemens against a journeyman with six career victories
_ Tampa Bay's Dave Eiland _ Clemens barely hung on for the 240th
victory of his career, pitching poorly over five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has 13 hits in 22 at-bats in his five games in the
second spot in the batting order, for a .591 average, with 10 runs
scored, four doubles, three home runs and five RBI, and with just a
little bit of luck, he could have had even more Wednesday night.
Williams pushed center fielder Randy Winn against the wall with a
ferocious flyout in the third inning, and in the seventh, Winn
intercepted Williams' line drive while moving toward left-center
field.
</P>
<P>
   When manager Joe Torre juggled the lineup _ shifting Derek Jeter
to the third slot, Paul O'Neill from third to fifth and Martinez
from fifth to fourth _ he said he did so because Williams had
success while hitting second. But Torre probably was just being
gracious; the real reason, in all likelihood, was that he wanted to
force opponents to throw better pitches to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   While batting cleanup, Williams was surrounded by O'Neill and
Martinez, both of whom were struggling. Pitchers could work
carefully to Williams, to the fringes of the strike zone, knowing
that even if he walked, they could escape trouble by pitching to
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such luxury now: With Williams batting second,
pitchers know that if they work around him, they then have to cope
with Jeter, who is to the Yankees' lineup what Bill Gates is to the
computer industry. Consequently, Williams is getting more fastballs
to hit _ and he's been devastating, including two straight four-hit
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take the credit, sure,'' Torre said, joking. ``But I
don't think changing spots means a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The results speak for themselves. The combination of Williams
and Jeter hitting back-to-back _ they've already reached base in
the same inning seven times in the last five games _ appears to be
having a ripple effect. The Yankees are getting more runners on
base, and as they proved so often last year, more runners mean that
pitchers are liable to make more mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Eiland, who made his major-league debut on Aug. 3, 1988 while
pitching for the Yankees, survived for awhile Wednesday night, but
even after the Devil Rays took a 3-0 lead after three innings, his
demise seemed inevitable. Martinez banged his 11th home run to open
the fourth inning, and in the fifth inning, a reliever began
warming up as soon as Williams singled with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter singled and Martinez walked and the bases were loaded for
O'Neill. Devil Rays Manager Larry Rothschild called on the
left-hander Scott Aldred.
</P>
<P>
   Bearing a .140 average against left-handed pitchers, O'Neill
laced Aldred's first pitch down the right field line, and all the
runners were on the move, Williams scoring, and then Jeter and
Martinez. It was a crucial hit for O'Neill, who had 7 hits in his
last 55 at-bats (.127) with runners in scoring position, since May
1, and needs to produce to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge base hit for us,'' said Torre. ``I just sense
he's seeing the ball better.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens required all the run support he could get, on a night
when the physical action of throwing strikes appeared foreign to
him. Clemens threw a ball on the first pitch to 13 of the 27
batters he faced, constantly fell behind in the count, and labored
_ he threw 38 pitches in the second inning, 29 pitches in the
third. But he prevailed, and this was a night for the Yankees'
hitters, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had his first game of three or more hits since May 18,
O'Neill drove in four runs _ or just one fewer than he had driven
in over his 12 previous games _ and Chuck Knoblauch reached base
four times. Close your eyes and, for one night, you could imagine
it was 1998 all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys are seeing the ball well, and it's great to see
them get their confidence going,'' said Clemens. ``We've got a lot
of guys who are tough on themselves.''

GIULIANI NOT IN PARTY MOOD OVER QUESTIONS ON MRS. CLINTON AND NAVY
YARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Facing persistent questions from reporters Wednesday
about why his administration had killed plans for a glittery
magazine party at the city-owned Brooklyn Navy Yard, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani tried several tactics.
</P>
<P>
   He said ask someone else. He tried to change the subject. He
dismissed the issue as frivolous _ even injected a little humor.
Finally, he just left.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his discomfort was obvious. On Tuesday, a top
aide conceded that the city had blocked the party in part because
of reports that the new magazine, called Talk, planned to put
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the mayor's likely opponent in next year's
U.S. Senate race, on the cover of its inaugural issue.
</P>
<P>
   Also obvious was the intense media interest. Talk magazine is
co-owned by Miramax Films and Hearst Magazines; a Miramax
co-chairman, Harvey Weinstein, and the magazine's editor, Tina
Brown, were to be hosts of the Navy Yard soiree.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's news conference Wednesday had been scheduled to
follow a meeting with San Antonio Mayor Howard Peak, who was in
town for the basketball championship between the Knicks and the
Spurs. Giuliani is often sharp and unforgiving with the local
press, though he has cultivated a far friendlier image nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Peak and his wife stood off to the side as a reporter asked the
first of what would be eight successive questions about the Talk
magazine party. ``Talk to the Navy Yard,'' Giuliani retorted.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy Yard is city-owned property, operated by the Brooklyn
Navy Yard Development Corp., whose three directors are appointed by
the mayor and include Rudy Washington, the deputy mayor for
business services. When reporters pushed the point, Giuliani said
the decision had little to do with the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Navy Yard would have treated me the same way, even
though I am from Brooklyn, was born in Brooklyn and my father
worked at the Navy Yard,'' he said, adding pointedly: ``I don't
think this is an issue of discrimination against somebody from
Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he was pressed to explain who had made the decision to
block the party: Navy Yard officials or Randy Levine, the deputy
mayor for economic operations, who had already acknowledged in
interviews that he made the decision. ``I am sure it was their
joint decision,'' the mayor said. But he said he himself had
nothing to do with it. ``I don't care one way or the other,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corp. president
Marc Rosenbaum issued a statement supporting the mayor's
explanation. He said the Navy Yard's roof deck, recently renovated
as a party space, could accommodate only 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed scope of the event became larger and increasingly
unwieldy, involving over 1500 people,'' the statement said, though
it added that Mrs. Clinton was also a factor. ``We felt that the
party was beginning to take on a political cast and was no longer
simply for the launch of a new magazine, a situation which could
easily violate our policy against holding political events.''
</P>
<P>
   After the eighth question at his news conference, the mayor
sought to change the subject. ``I think you have got to have
another question,'' he said. ``I can't believe this is the only
thing.'' After yet another party question, he said: ``I imagine
there must be something else going on in the life of this city that
you'd like to ask about. Or we have gotten to the point of ultimate
frivolity?''
</P>
<P>
   His exasperation was rewarded by a question about City Hall
lobbying. But a moment later, it was back to Talk. Giuliani had had
enough. ``No no no,'' he said. ``No no. We have exhausted the
subject. If there are no more questions about another subject, then
I can go back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   An obliging television reporter switched topics, to plans by
Hadassah, the Jewish charity organization, to give Mrs. Clinton an
award. ``Are they going to have that ceremony at the Navy Yard?''
the mayor asked, trying a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Told it would be in Washington, he replied, ``Oh, OK, well, as
long as it's not at the Navy Yard, I'll have no comment on it.''
Then he muttered ``thank you'' and walked out.

PATAKI AVOIDS BUDGET ISSUE IN SPEECH ABOUT POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mich.)   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki went to Detroit on Wednesday to
promote his economic policies as a model for the nation, detailing
his record of cutting taxes and reducing the size of government but
skirting mention of the standoff back home over the state budget,
now nearly three months overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the Detroit Economic Club, Pataki called for
reducing federal income taxes an average of 13 percent over seven
years, eliminating the capital gains tax and changing Social
Security to allow people to invest some of the money they now
contribute. He proposed a Constitutional amendment that would
require a two-thirds vote in Congress to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He said he favored increasing federal spending on defense and
education, while scaling back the bureaucracy by abolishing the
departments of Commerce and Energy, repealing burdensome
regulations and selling some government assets.
</P>
<P>
   He said his proposals would save hundreds of billions of
dollars. ``But in a broader sense, this plan isn't about numbers,''
he said. ``It's about freedom. It's about people. It's about
restoring certain inalienable rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech before the club, a traditional stop for politicians
eager to proclaim the success of their stewardship, marked the
latest effort by Pataki to seize the national spotlight. It comes,
though, at an awkward time for him. After flirting for several
months with a long-shot bid for the presidency, Pataki took himself
out of the running in May when he endorsed Texas Gov. George W.
Bush for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   So at best, the speech was an attempt to help his standing as a
potential vice presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about those aspirations before the speech Wednesday,
Pataki said, ``I don't think that you think about the vice
presidency or cabinet positions. You have to first get the
nomination and win the election. That's where we are going to be
focused, doing that for Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, the state government remains paralyzed by the dispute
over the state budget. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, made a pointed reference
Wednesday to the governor's trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever he chooses to be, that's his priority and I think the
people of the state will eventually respond to each and every one
of our priorities,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Silver, Pataki and Republican state Senate Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno continued budget negotiations Wednesday, but
without substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
   While the sides are relatively close to a compromise, the
deadlock remains over Silver's insistence that Pataki agree not to
veto spending items proposed by Assembly Democrats. The governor
has refused to provide such a promise.

GAYNOR JACOBSON, 87, HELPED RESETTLE JEWISH REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., N.Y., Ohio, Mass.)  (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gaynor Jacobson, a former world director of the Hebrew Immigrant
Aid Society, who helped thousands of Jews leave Eastern Europe for
Israel and other countries in the West in the World War II period,
died on June 6 at a hospital in Sun City West, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   He was 87 and lived in Sun City West and also in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Jacobson worked for numerous Jewish
organizations in Rochester, N.Y., before joining the American Joint
Distribution Committee in 1944 as a country director in Italy,
Greece and Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six years, he used his diplomatic skills to
persuade various governments to take in survivors of the Holocaust.
He was especially active in helping hundreds of thousands of
refugees move from Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union through
Czechoslovakia to Israel and the West.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson was arrested and jailed for two weeks in 1949 in
Hungary for helping Jews leave the country. His work opening
borders was detailed in the book ``The Secret Alliance: The
Extraordinary Story of the Rescue of the Jews Since World War II,''
by Tad Szulc (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, 1992).
</P>
<P>
   From 1953 until 1981, Jacobson directed programs for the Hebrew
Immigrant Aid Society, becoming world director in 1966. He retired
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson was born on May 17, 1912, in Buffalo, N.Y. He received
a bachelor's degree from the University of Buffalo in 1937 and a
master's degree in social work in 1941 from the same university.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Florence; two daughters, Margot
Gotoff of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Helen Jacobson of Boston, and six
grandchildren.

LONG BEFORE HAMM, THERE WERE ROLE MODELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My favorite athlete is inexorably linked to the Women's World
Cup. She is a trailblazer and a terrific role model. I have an
autographed copy of her biography and I've memorized each page.
</P>
<P>
   And no, her name is not Mia Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's World Cup team plays Nigeria today and you know
what that means. Chicago's Soldier Field will be alive with the
sounds of Mia.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm, the U.S. team's star forward, has the kind of rabid
following generally reserved for rock stars. Indeed, she engenders
more high-pitched squeals than Ricky Martin.
</P>
<P>
   It's curious. You'd come off daffier than Farrah Fawcett in her
disjointed discourse with David Letterman if you suggested Martin
is the first musician to swivel his hips and sway a generation. And
yet it's considered perfectly politic to carry on as if Hamm and
her U.S. teammates were the first females to make it hip to be
jocks. Let the record show that is simply not so.
</P>
<P>
   Just because Hamm and Co. are making history, the media and
marketing mavens, however well-meaning, don't have any business
rewriting the history of women's sports in the latter half of this
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go, girl!'' was a movement if not a mantra long before the
first pony-tailed pixie donned a Hamm jersey and dragged her dad to
a U.S. women's soccer match.
</P>
<P>
   I'd hate for people to disregard the fact that before the U.S.
national soccer team preached working as one to get a job done, the
1984 U.S. women's Olympic basketball and volleyball teams practiced
it.
</P>
<P>
   The volleyball squad, behind the brilliance of the late Flo
Hyman, won the U.S.' first-ever medal in the women's Olympic
competition, losing to China in the final while drawing some of the
highest television ratings of the L.A. Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Miller, the charismatic equal to U.S. soccer's Julie
Foudy, led the basketball team in scoring, rebounding, steals and
assists as the Americans handed Korea a 30-point defeat to win the
first of back-to-back Olympic gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be a shame if people never knew that before soccer moms Joy
Fawcett (never to be confused with Farrah) and Carla Overbeck,
there were sprinting moms Wilma Rudolph and Evelyn Ashford.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after having a baby, Rudolph won three gold medals at
the 1960 Summer Games in Rome. It was the first Olympics to attract
a global televsion audience and the world, beguiled by Rudolph's
grace and beauty, could no longer claim that sports stripped women
of their femininity.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight years later, Ashford would make her fourth Olympic
team, in Seoul, after delivering a daughter that was growing inside
her even as she set a world record in the 100 meters in August of
1984.
</P>
<P>
   It's not right for people to be unaware that before Michelle
Akers overcame chronic fatigue syndrome to play soccer at its
highest level, Babe Didrikson Zaharias fought off colon cancer long
enough to triumph in golf at its highest level.
</P>
<P>
   Didrikson Zaharias, a basketball player and a double gold
medalist at the 1932 Summer Olympics in L.A. (in the javelin and
the 80-meter hurdles), became a founding member of the LPGA in
1949. In 1954 she won the U.S. Open by a record 12 shots after
being treated for the colon cancer that would claim her life two
years later.
</P>
<P>
   (With apologies to Hamm, if ever there was a female athlete who
could stare at a male icon and declare, ``Anything you can do I can
do better,'' it was Didrikson Zaharias).
</P>
<P>
   It'd concern me if people recognized Billie Jean King as the
woman in the World Cup commercial who is goading President Clinton
to attend next month's tournament final at the Rose Bowl and not as
the driving force in the formation of the women's professional
tennis tour that is flourishing today. King then punctuated women's
participation in sports by beating Bobby Riggs in a watershed
battle of the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'd be mortified if people didn't know that before
Donna de Varona became the chairwoman of the 1999 Women's World Cup
Organizing Committee, she gave people like me a blueprint for
success.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the age of 13, De Varona set 18 world records in
four different swimming disciplines. She won 37 national titles and
two gold medals at the 1964 Olympics. She was out of the sport
before her 18th birthday but never out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 she became the first female sports commentator on
network television when she was hired by ABC. Her high profile over
the ensuing four decades has served as a constant, comforting
reminder that sports is an option for girls, as a competitive
outlet and as a career.
</P>
<P>
   De Varona couldn't possibly have known the impact she'd have on
one pony-tailed pixie who dragged her dad to a sporting event one
summer to see De Varona and maybe snag her autograph. De Varona's
pen proved no less than a beacon, illuminating the child's path to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Karen,'' De Varona wrote on an inside page of ``Donna De
Varona, Gold Medal Swimmer. ``May you always enjoy the sport, the
people and the life of learning.'' &QL;

   Patricia Kerr Ross, 60, SUNY Arts Director &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Kerr Ross, former director of the State University of
New York's Programs in the Arts, died June 22 at a hospital in
Albany, N.Y. She was 60 and lived in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   As director of the university-wide arts programs from 1971 to
1991, Ms. Ross was instrumental in producing statewide arts
festivals, workshops and exhibitions. Over the years, her office
provided creative assistance and support to artists and arts
administrators throughout the State University system.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross helped bring dance to SUNY campuses by producing such
festivals as the Early Years of Modern Dance (1981) and Merce
Cunningham and the New Dance (1987). Dance Black America (1984) was
produced with the Brooklyn Academy of Music and filmed for public
television.
</P>
<P>
   From 1979 to 1987 she was executive producer of a series of
public television specials, ``SUNY in the Arts on Television.'' She
also organized faculty and student visits to artists, actors,
directors and producers, as well as the SUNY Writer's Festival of
readings, discussions and workshops. In 1985 she was co-producer of
``The Educated Eye,'' an exhibition at the New York State Museum of
400 artworks from 25 SUNY campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross, who taught arts policy at Empire State College, was
also director of the Thayer Fellowship, which supported outstanding
SUNY arts graduates in their first year of professional activity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 she founded and directed what became an annual ``Come
Sunday'' celebration of music and dance in Albany's historic Center
Square neighborhood. The festival presented such performers as
Dizzy Gillespie, Branford Marsalis and Garth Fagan as well as
emerging local artists. She retired from the university in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross is survived by a daughter, Linda Proctor of Concord,
N.H.; her companion, George Hofmann, an artist and professor at
Hunter College, and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pagliaro, 99, Concrete Contractor &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frank J. Pagliaro, a concrete contractor whose projects included
the Chrysler Building and the New York Athletic Club in Manhattan,
died June 20 at his home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 99.
</P>
<P>
   Pagliaro provided concrete for the United Nations, Shea Stadium,
the New York Coliseum, the Huntington Hartford Gallery in Columbus
Circle and numerous public housing projects in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, Pagliaro expanded his business, Knickerbocker
Construction, and became a general contractor, helping to build
Lincoln Towers in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He constructed buildings in many cities like the Federal Court
Building in San Francisco. His projects in the Washington area
include the Senate Office Building, the CIA Building and Robert F.
Kennedy Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Pagliaro was born on March 4, 1900, in Manhattan. After
graduating from Cornell University in 1925, he joined his father's
company, Knickerbocker Fireproofing, which encased steel beams with
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The firm later branched out into reinforced concrete, the basic
material of modern high-rise buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Pagliaro is survived by his wife, Anita; a sister, Mary Petrillo
of Bronxville, N.Y.; two sons, Frank Pagliaro Jr. of Burlingame,
Calif., and Leonard Pagliaro of Seattle; four daughters, Anita
Pagliaro and Carla Pagliaro, both of Livingston, Mont., and Alix
Barthelmes and Lisa Selz, both of Manhattan; six grandchildren; and
a great-granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce MacIver, 95, Novelist and Playwright
</P>
<P>
   Georgette Scott, a novelist and playwright who wrote under the
name Joyce MacIver, died June 15 at her home in New York. She was
95.
</P>
<P>
   She was best known for her 1961 novel, ``The Frog Pond,'' which
was inspired by her own experience with psychoanalysis and became a
best seller. Miss Scott was also the author of ``The Exquisite
Thing'' (1968), ``Mercy'' (1977) and ``The Glimpse'' (1984). She
was co-author of a play, ``American Royalty,'' with Richard Haase.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Baltimore, Miss Scott attended the Johns Hopkins School
of Journalism and began her writing career at The Baltimore Sun.
After moving to New York, she wrote for the International News

 &HT;    Spurs roll at finish, near title
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now only one victory separates San Antonio from a
title. One victory and the Spurs become the first of the old ABA
teams to win an NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   They have their chance because they held on, 96-89, against a
swarming New York team that could completely dig out of a hole it
dug for itself early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson and Tim Duncan had plenty of help this time, the
entire lineup in double figures, Robinson scoring 14 with 17
rebounds, Duncan 28 with 17 as the Spurs took a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks scrambled, gambling with traps and running wildly
after falling into a 13-point hole to start the second half and
when they cut the lead to a point with 5:24 left, feeding off
Latrell Sprewell, who scored 16 of his 26 points from 6:49 of the
third to 6:16 of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring or dishing, he brought his team back and then Allan
Houston sank a baseline jumper that cut it to 81-79 with 5:40 left,
the Spurs 3-for-13 in the period to that point. Charlie Ward could
have tied it seconds later but made only one at the line. After
Duncan and Robinson scored inside, Ward threw a jump pass that
Mario Elie intercepted. The lead was six. Marcus Camby's
three-point play halved it. Larry Johnson, enduring a terrible
night, made one from the line at 3:40. The Spurs began to take
control from there.
</P>
<P>
   After their 12-game playoff winning streak ended Monday _ they
had last lost May 11 to Minnesota _ the Spurs had plenty to think
about.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the matter of shot selection. Duncan, their
leading scorer, took only 16 shots in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the ball-handling lapses that cost them 18
points from 20 turnovers. ``We don't make 20 turnovers in two
games, let alone one,'' Avery Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was the ineffective play of forward Sean Elliott
and Elie. Elliott had only two points after three quarters and
seven for the game in 38 minutes. Elie was in early foul trouble
and scored only six points.
</P>
<P>
   That also meant they did not apply pressure on Sprewell and
Houston to work on defense, and the Knicks tandem combined for 58
points.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, they gave Elliott early shots. Duncan worked
into the flow quickly. The Spurs controlled tempo until Avery
Johnson had to leave with blood on his elbow. In his absence, the
much-maligned Ward took control against slower Steve Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks needed more help than usual from Ward because Chris
Childs was limited with a sprained knee. And Ward stepped up,
scoring 10 in the first as the Knicks grabbed a 29-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott came through. He had eight points by the five-minute
mark of the second quarter when he sank his second triple of the
game. The Spurs led 42-40 when Houston's string of converted free
throws in the Finals ended at 19, the Knicks hanging on with Ward
watching virtually the entire quarter. When he came back in the
final minutes, the Knicks had more energy, but they trailed 50-46
at the break, unable to stop Duncan, who had 14 points, seven
rebounds by intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly, the Spurs broke to their biggest lead _ 59-46 _ as
Larry Johnson was overmatched trying to score against Duncan and
Robinson. Duncan scored six in a 9-0 start while the Knicks missed
five with two turnovers in 2:46 of the second half. The Knicks
tried to rally as Houston worked a three-point play, Sprewell put
down a jumper and Camby forced a Robinson turnover, then dunked on
Duncan for 61-53.
</P>
<P>
   Trapping and gambling on defense, the Knicks excited a crowd
wearing so much home team orange it could have been Knoxville or
Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   But he Knicks could not get closer than eight despite a flurry
of 10 points by Sprewell. They trailed 72-63 going to the fourth.

EMBATTLED KNICKS FALL TO SPURS, WHO NOW LEAD SERIES 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Undermanned and physically drained, the New York
Knicks opened every resource they had and received an energized
effort from Latrell Sprewell, but they straggled out of Madison
Square Garden on Wednesday night crestfallen and on the brink of
elimination in the National Basketball Association finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, down by 13 in the third quarter and by seven with
eight minutes left in the game, pulled within 81-80 with 5 minutes
24 seconds remaining. But the Spurs, fresher, bigger and uncommonly
calm under the frenzy of the Garden crowd, held the Knicks off to
win Game 4, 96-89, and take a three-games-to-one lead in the
best-of-7 series.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were led by Sprewell's 26 points on 9-for-22 shooting
and 20 points from Allan Houston. The Spurs leaned on their big men
as Tim Duncan scored 28 points and had 17 rebounds on a pained
Larry Johnson (five points) and David Robinson came up with 14
points and 17 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will try to keep their finals dreams alive with Game
5 at the Garden on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy had his fears about this game. The
three key players he had left standing _ Houston, Sprewell and
Larry Johnson _ had all played 43-plus minutes in an emotionally
and physically draining Game 3 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win, we're going to have to be highly energetic,'' Van
Gundy said Wednesday afternoon at the team's shoot-around. ``And I
just sensed Tuesday that _ well, it was a draining game, and we've
got to get ourselves back energy-wise to come ready tonight. It's
not about a letdown. It's just that playing at a high level of
energy when you're down people is more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks needed to give Houston, Johnson and Sprewell a break.
In the first half, they found reinforcement from one usual suspect
and from one who was not so typical. Camby, the impact player from
the Indiana series, and Ward, the invisible point guard for most of
the playoffs, both came on to keep the Knicks close to the Spurs;
New York trailed by 50-46 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks shot 47.4 percent in the first half, which was a
major bump up from the 35 percent they had been averaging in the
finals. The Spurs, who have the league's best defense, were clearly
upset at how loose they had been.
</P>
<P>
   They came out in the third quarter a different team, and did not
allow the Knicks to score in the opening four minutes of the second
half. The Spurs held the Knicks to 0-for-5 shooting and were
contesting everything inside. They were also double-teaming Houston
and Sprewell and forcing turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Before they knew it, the Knicks were behind by 59-46 with 8:14
left in the third period. Van Gundy called a time out, and the
Knicks regrouped. Houston began a 7-0 run with a 3-point play when
he was fouled by Duncan on a jumper. The Knicks pulled within 61-53
with 6:13 left in the quarter on a dunk by Camby.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' defense stopped the momentum with a couple of stands
that led to Mario Elie either driving inside for a 3-point play or
popping a shot from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, ahead by 68-57 with 3:34 left in the third, were
trying to maintain their edge despite the lively play of Camby and
Ward, who both stripped the Spurs' big men from behind to force
turnovers and give the Knicks a chance to stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   They had their chance, trailing by just 72-63 after a frantic
third quarter in which they were led by the 10 points of Sprewell,
who put up a shot every time the ball was in his hands, and Camby
and Ward continued to make their presences felt.
</P>
<P>
   After having failed to duplicate the impact he had against
Indiana in the conference finals, Camby made a concerted effort to
keep himself on the court and avoid the foul trouble that had
plagued him against Robinson. He succeeded with 19 minutes of
foul-free effort in the first half, finishing with a lively 10
points and seven rebounds. He was one of four Knick starters with
10 points at halftime, along with Houston, Sprewell and Ward.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, Ward looked as if he were going to be a liability
for the Knicks. In the opening minutes of the game, he played
pedestrian defense as Avery Johnson drove by him, shot over him and
went to the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   That must have irritated Ward. With his pride challenged, he
came right back at his counterpart. Ward saved the Knicks, who were
down by 23-17 midway through the first quarter. He burst into view
with a flurry of steals and two 3-pointers to lead his team on a
9-2 run. Ward gave his team a 26-25 lead with 1:32 left in the
first quarter when he darted in front of a pass at the top of the
3-point arc and dashed the other way for a layin.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first period, the Knicks were up by 29-27 and
Ward's 10 points were the reason. In one quarter, Ward had scored
more points than he had in any Knicks playoff game but one, the 12
points he had in Game 4 against Miami in the first round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   When Ward walked off the floor for a rest early in the second
quarter, the Garden crowd stood in applause of the oft-maligned
point guard. By coincidence, the Nets' Stephon Marbury, who once
said the Knicks could not win a title with Ward and Chris Childs at
point guard, was sitting in the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Childs, playing on a sprained knee, took over. And Avery Johnson
went back to work. He drove to the basket twice for scores, and
then Jerome Kersey popped open for a long jumper to give his team a
33-31 lead with 8:20 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks tied the score several times, but the Spurs never
fell behind, countering every score by the Knicks with a steady
stream of passes to Duncan in the paint. He had 14 points in the
first half over a rubbery-legged Larry Johnson, who had played him
so admirably on his sprained knee in Game 3. In the first half, the
Knicks' power forward was 1 for 5 with two points.
</P>
<P>
   With only one day of rest, the Knicks could not lean on Johnson
for 43 minutes again. That was where Camby's ability to stay free
of fouls helped the Knicks. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE SPURS MAKE THEIR POINT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas)  (mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They won it the way Red Holzman's old Knicks used to.
The San Antonio Spurs claimed the game they needed at Madison
Square Garden, sending thousands into the street thinking the
miracle run is over. They did it without a celebrity show, without
a Jordan or a Miller standing up and planting a flag in the middle
of the court. The Spurs won with interior defense as imposing as
the New York skyline.
</P>
<P>
   The first five minutes of the third quarter Wednesday night
defined the Spurs, put them on the doorstep of their first title.
The race to get even for the New York Knicks ended in the forest of
arms, the long arms of David Robinson and Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson rejecting Larry Johnson low. Robinson stuffing Allan
Houston on the break. Marcus Camby, standing in the shadows of the
twin towers, blowing a layup. The second half starting with nine
straight San Antonio points. The Knicks pushed hard in the fourth
quarter, all the way back to within one point, but they never quite
made it all the way up the mountain. They lost Game 4, 96-89, and
face the end Thursday night. The Spurs made their point to all the
big stars in the house.
</P>
<P>
   A special treat. A rare experience. That's what the Spurs
originally thought playing the finals at Madison Square Garden
would be like. Festive. Star-studded. Billy Crystal, Woody, Spike,
and we get to perform for them.
</P>
<P>
   This was, Will Perdue said, a subject of much discussion on the
flight in from San Antonio last Saturday night. Baldwins and
Broadway, here we come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was saying how nice it would be to play here because
of the crowd and the celebrities,'' Perdue said.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to Madison Square Garden Wednesday night for Game
4, needing one victory, just one for the road. The Spurs came here
with what amounted to three break points on the Knicks' serve. Win
one, and they'd be on the threshold of a title. Lose all three, and
they'd be looking like every other Knicks' playoff victim.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-series consensus was that this should not have been such
an ordeal for a bunch that had already closed out playoff series in
Minneapolis, Los Angeles and Portland. Yet, after Monday night,
after the Knicks informed the Spurs they were not quitters like the
Lakers and Blazers, the Spurs may have understood the difference
between there and here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that Billy Crystal is going to defend us that
well or intimidate us,'' Steve Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what about Evander Holyfield, glaring hard at them
Wednesday night from the honorary first seat alongside Celebrity
Row?
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs claimed they had learned their lesson in Game 3.
They had to play ahead at the Garden. Their own little point guard
did some serious penetrating of his own. Duncan got untracked and
began lofting soft jumpers over Larry Johnson. By halftime, the
Spurs were ahead, 50-46, their defense warming up for the big
second-half start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked getting up on this team here because the fans here
are liable to turn on their team at the drop of a dime,'' Perdue
said before Wednesday night's game. ``We didn't do that. We wound
up giving them less to doubt. So the fans cursed behind our bench
at us for 47 minutes and when they realized in the 48th minute they
were going to win, they said, `Nothing personal. See you
Wednesday.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's more than the stars coming out that made this a challenge,
to avoid letting the Knicks send them home to face elimination.
It's driving through midtown on the way to the Garden, feeling the
energy in shadowed streets. It is the acoustics of the Garden, the
closeness and ferocity of the crowd. The Alamodome was loud with
nearly 40,000. It still was not Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Perdue, the former Bull, recalled how Michael Jordan's eyes
would sparkle as soon as the team bus rolled into town. Jordan had
the advantage of walking into the building with the idea that he
was bigger than any courtside fan, bigger than the Garden itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But who else could control a game like Michael?'' Perdue said.
</P>
<P>
   Before he shrank in the presence of Allan Houston this spring,
Reggie Miller stole a few spring showdowns by summoning Spike into
his theater and playing the classic villain for the reluctant
director. Tim Hardaway was hurt all the way back in the first
round, but in past years, he certainly had enough chip on his
shoulder to shoot the Garden stone quiet.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to know from Tim Duncan's face what he's feeling.
He is just 23. The idea that David Robinson was soft was always a
stretch, but his strongest supporters never called him arrogant.
That's what he and Duncan were Wednesday night in the lane, in the
the game the Spurs had to have. Broadway demanded no less.

REALLY QUIET FIELD FOR CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Real Quiet, with jockey Jerry Bailey,
emerged as the new Hollywood Gold Cup favorite against only three
opponents after the withdrawal of ailing ailing Old Trieste from
Sunday's $1 million race.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park morning-line maker Russell Hudak said Real Quiet,
a winner once in five races since his 1998 Kentucky Derby and
Preakness victories, will be 7-5 or 8-5 in the odds to be announced
after entries and post positions are set this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Hudak expects the betting to be close among Donn Handicap winner
Puerto Madero (Kent Desormeaux), 1998 Santa Anita Handicap winner
Malek (Alex Solis) and likely pacesetter Budroyale (Garrett Gomez).
The long shot could be no more than 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park apparently will have to settle for the smallest
field in the Gold Cup's 60 runnings. The 1\-mile race has drawn
five starters three times, most recently in 1994 when Slew of
Damascus and Gary Stevens led from gate to wire.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the loss of a would-be favorite like Old Trieste, who
was declared out of the race Tuesday after developing a fever,
would draw a last-minute entry or two from owners looking to
collect the $20,000 fifth-place check.
</P>
<P>
   But other local candidates are either unnominated or injured.
And top-ranked older horse Behrens is staying in the East for now,
because trainer Jim Bond didn't want to ship him to California for
both the Gold Cup and Del Mar's Pacific Classic, the Aug.29 final
race in the NTRA Champions on Fox series.

SPORTS COLUMN: A THIN LINE BETWEEN FOULING AND PLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the National Basketball Association controlled
track and field, the league would have devised a system by now to
make sure the favorite runners win and the popular jumpers triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Lesser known sprinters would be forced to race on uneven
surfaces that twisted and turned while their marquee opponents ran
straight away _ and five yards fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Elite hurdlers would only have to clear low hurdles while the
underdogs would have to clear high ones. A high jumper on the verge
of upsetting the favorite would suddenly see the bar elevated just
as he was about to clear it.
</P>
<P>
   Farfetched? Maybe. But this is essentially what the NBA, for
want of entertainment and maintenance of a star system, has done to
competition. With each new season, Dr. Naismith's game is moving
closer to professional wrestling. The NBA has an entire vocabulary
of calls, from veteran calls to makeup calls and calls that make a
point.
</P>
<P>
   This is not about pro-Knicks or anti-Spurs; this is about a
continuing evolution that turns games into vaudeville acts starring
overpaid coaches and officials who come dangerously close to
crossing the line between keeping order and manipulating results.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the referees bailed out the home team with foul
calls time after time, including, with about five minutes left in
the game, a 3-second violation on Tim Duncan that kept the Knicks
close. But alas, they couldn't keep them close enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks-Spurs championship series, which took a dramatic tilt
toward San Antonio with the Spurs' 96-89 victory Wednesday night,
is simply another example of how the NBA is evolving away from
competition and toward the embrace of marketing and entertainment.
About an hour before Game 3 on Monday night, a longtime television
basketball analyst, who also covered the NBA as a beat reporter for
several years, glanced at a list for the officiating crew and
casually predicted that the Knicks would go to the line
substantially more than they had in the first two games. Presto!
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks lived at the line on Monday as the bewildered Spurs,
who had been allowed to knock the Knicks around like pinballs in
San Antonio, protested. In the first two games in San Antonio, the
Knicks attempted only 31 foul shots to San Antonio's 66. On Monday,
the Knicks had 30 free throws to 22 for the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Why is a foul in Texas not a foul in New York? In San Antonio,
the Knicks attacked the Twin Towers and their shots were swatted
around the Alamodome like flies. In New York, the Knicks attacked
and went to the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' Mario Elie said he guarded Allan Houston in Game 3
the same way he had guarded him in Games 1 and 2: he mauled him,
used his bulk and toughness to offset Houston's quickness and
range. On Monday the officials apparently decided that what was
cool in San Antonio was not cool in New York. Elie was hit with two
quick fouls and then with a technical for protesting. Wednesday
night, Elie had clutch basket after clutch basket en route to 18
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, two ticky-tack fouls,'' the New York-born Elie said of
Monday night's game. ``Fans want to see key players playing, not on
the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   What Elie doesn't understand is that, in this Broadway drama,
Allan Houston, not Elie, is the key player. But Wednesday night,
Elie got the better of the matchup. At a time when the league is
wringing its hands over low scoring, the suddenly explosive Houston
_ with the all-America good looks, blossoming into a star before
the nation's eyes _ is the perfect antidote. The law has spoken,
without actually speaking: Elie will not be allowed to manhandle
Houston in Games 3 through 6. NBA law is extremely fluid.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1992 playoffs, Chicago Bulls head coach Phil Jackson
incurred a fine when he said the NBA would probably be delighted to
have a seventh game involving two of the nation's three largest
markets. Asked if he thought the results were being orchestrated,
Jackson said: ``I don't like orchestration, it sounds a little too
fishy. But they control who they send as referees.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a peculiar symmetry between NBA rules and the law,
between NBA officials and the police. Each has a mandate to keep
the peace, though more specifically their primary job is to
maintain law and order. Depending on your perspective _ and
standing _ the ultimate responsibility of each cop and official is
to protect the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The police might stop suspicious characters in nice
neighborhoods, or follow shady characters around the mall.
Officials protect the NBA elite, making sure they have enough elbow
room to maneuver without being manhandled by the likes of Elie.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NBA system, referees mark some players for fouls.
Marcus Camby has not yet earned the right to guard David Robinson
aggressively without drawing fouls. Wednesday night, Camby seemed
to finally unlock the secret of playing Robinson. Using finesse
rather than power, Camby didn't pickup his first foul until 8
minutes 36 seconds remained in the final quarter. He finished with
20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Jaren Jackson, a journeyman player who has spent nine years
bouncing around the NBA, understands both the scene and the play.
``You got to understand how games are being called, how officials
are calling against certain players on the floor,'' Jackson said.
``You may sacrifice getting a few jump shots in your face and guys
scoring, but that's the way it goes. You might get mad, but that's
the nature of the beast.''
</P>
<P>
   The beast, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   And the more I watch the NBA, the better I like track and
field. &QL;

 (Originally skedded as BKN-KNICKS-JOHNSON) (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was early in the fourth quarter Wednesday night,
and Latrell Sprewell received a basic entry pass from Allan Houston
in the low post. Maybe eight feet from the basket, he turned
another bland possession into a Broadway show.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning away from Jaren Jackson, he suddenly looked like a
tailback who fought through a scrum to the open field. With his
team crawling back into Game 4 at Madison Square Garden, Sprewell
had nothing but the rim in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   He never saw the long arm of Tim Duncan from behind, the
elongated reach of a 7-footer recovering defensively in time to
block the shot and keep the New York Knicks out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over that scene was repeated, a San Antonio Spurs
7-footer rejecting a New York swingman's shot. These National
Basketball Association finals are no longer about the Spurs and
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   It's height versus heart, and even the Knicks' corpuscles cannot
completely compensate for all those inches and pounds they give
away. In easily the most difficult loss of the postseason, New York
crept to within one point in the final minutes before begrudgingly
going down to the Spurs, 96-89.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether the Knicks can actually pull this off
was answered Wednesday night, when they fell behind by three games
to one. Whether they will be finished off by a team clearly more
talented and multidimensional in Game 5 or Game 6 is merely the
difference of waiting two days between games.
</P>
<P>
   But there they were, climbing uphill all evening, waiting for
the right moment to strike. You may remember Charlie Ward's errant
cross-court pass intercepted by Mario Elie with less than five
minutes left, a crucial turnover at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as anyone, Ward symbolized what this Knicks season
is about. Playing poorly for most of the series, he was asked to
play more and better because Chris Childs was physically unable to
perform after sustaining an injury in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   He made himself an offensive option in Childs' absence, scoring
10 points in the first quarter while darting all over the floor on
defense. At one point, he came around Duncan's backside as the
Spurs' center was about to corral a rebound. Snatching it away, he
motored upcourt before being knocked down and fouled.
</P>
<P>
   Maligned often and the subject of more trade rumors than Scottie
Pippen, Ward played as well at times Wednesday night as he has all
season.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before the Knicks took the floor, Kenny Anderson and
Stephon Marbury were literally holding court on opposite ends of
the floor. Two New York schoolboy legends, wearing immaculately
tailored suits, waiting to watch Ward direct his team in Game 4 of
the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about envy.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, stubborn as ever, would not take back comments he made
regarding Ward and Childs earlier this season, something like:
``They will never win a title with them. Never, never, never.''
</P>
<P>
   They may not, but on a night Ward's team needed a huge
performance from him, he delivered.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Larry Johnson, who did not look fluid on his
sprained knee moving up and down the court.
</P>
<P>
   In this wild postseason the Knicks have created for themselves,
he has been the lightning rod in so many instances. Whether it be
his immaculate 4-point play against Indiana, the way he shut down
Tim Duncan in the fourth quarter of Game 3 on Monday night or his
profane tirade at a practice, Johnson seems to sell papers and keep
the ratings from bottoming out.
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, he embodies the Knicks' dilemma: On the whole,
they're not a terribly likable cast. Yet they're accomplishing
something that's impossible not to like. Small, undermanned and
unrelenting, they're taking it to a physically superior team.
</P>
<P>
   The dichotomy is so hard to reconcile: Each time Johnson bends
his knees and looks into Duncan's eyes, he is much more than the
underdog; he is the antagonist in a basketball morality play _ the
reviled L.J. and his hooligans in gym shorts versus Saint Tim and
the San Antonio choirboys.
</P>
<P>
   The whole idea is provincial, really, as if we truly know that
Duncan and David Robinson are much better people than, say,
Houston. But we see what we want to see, and draw on the facts that
support our arguments.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, you have to give it up to San Antonio. In the
crucible of this wild series, when Duncan, Robinson and their
allegedly soft Western Conference friends could have folded up the
tent, they found a resolve befitting, well, the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle of height versus heart, the tall guys had
something in them, too, that told them not to quit.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks did not execute down the stretch, and missed some
important shots that could have turned this game and series around.
For that, they can be faulted. Their season 48 minutes from over,
they gave you a nice run that no one expected.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, heart gets you only so far in the finals.

REINSTATING SYMINGTON CONVICTION UNLIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The odds will be heavily stacked against prosecutors if they ask
a group of federal Appeals Court judges to consider reinstating
former Gov. Fife Symington's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gets 600 to 800 requests a
year for such ``en banc'' reviews of its decisions. Only 13 were
granted last year, and eight the year before, according to court
records.
</P>
<P>
   An en banc review is one of several options facing prosecutors
from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles as they decide how
to respond to Tuesday's appel late reversal. The court threw out Sy
mington's 1997 conviction on six counts of bank and wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 split, the court panel found that U.S. District Judge
Roger Strand erred by dismissing an elderly juror from Syming ton's
jury during deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Fallout from the reversal began Wednesday. A group of union pen
sion funds suing Symington in U.S. Bankruptcy Court asked to delay
the former governor's upcoming bank ruptcy trial, saying more time
was needed to prepare in the wake of the federal ruling.
Symington's lawyers oppose the delay.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the criminal case could respond to the appellate
reversal in several ways: seek the en banc review, appeal to the
U.S. Supreme Court, retry the case, craft a plea bargain or simply
drop the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can persuade them not to proceed (with a new
trial),'' said Terence Lynam, a member of Symington's defense team.
</P>
<P>
   But lead prosecutor David Schin dler said Wednesday, ``We have
no present intention of just letting Symington walk.''
</P>
<P>
   A plea bargain is possible but appears somewhat unlikely in
light of statements by both sides Tuesday and Wednesday. Defense
attorneys said they do not want to make a deal that requires time
behind bars or admissions of felony conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they are willing to consider only a plea to
more than one felony, a factor that under normal circumstances
would bring prison time.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles prosecutor's office, one of the largest in the
nation, requests only two to four en banc hearings a year, said
Miriam Krinsky, chief of the criminal appel late division.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Levenson, a former prose cutor and law school professor
at Loyola University Law School, said it would be tough to win an
en banc hearing because the appellate deci sion in Symington's case
boils down to differing interpretations of the facts of the case,
not a dispute over the reading of the law.
</P>
<P>
   En banc hearings generally are granted only if extremely
important constitutional issues are at stake or if a decision seems
to directly conflict with another case on which the court has
ruled, appellate court spokesman Mark Mendenhall said.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, meanwhile, would be heard
only if a new issue of constitutional law was at stake, Levenson
said.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by prosecutors on any appeal is probably a month
away, Krinsky said. Justice Department officials in Washington,
D.C., in cluding the U.S. solicitor general, must make the final
call on any appeal.
</P>
<P>
   If prosecutors opt simply to retry Symington, they could do so
imme diately on the six counts that were reversed. However, if they
wanted to include 11 counts on which Sy mington's jury was hung,
they would have to seek a new indict ment on those charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd have to reconvene a grand jury . . . just as if they
were starting over,'' Lynam said. ``That's a little more of a
hurdle they'd have to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Schindler said cost is not an issue. Decisions are made ``based
on the merits, and whether it's in the interest of justice to
pursue a case.'' The cost of the five-year prosecu tion has never
been revealed, though Lynam estimated it ``in the millions.''
</P>
<P>
   A retrial would cost less than the first trial because the
thousands of documents and exhibits in the case are ready for use
in court, Schindler said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution team, however, may not be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Attorney Nora Ma nella, who presided over the Sy
mington investigation for five years, is now a federal judge in Los
Angeles. Her successor, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, spent four years
specializing in prosecution of secu rities and bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Drooyan, who headed the criminal division that
prosecuted Symington, has since left the office for private
practice. His successor as division chief was Schindler's litiga
tion partner, George Cardona, who helped try the case against
Syming ton in 1997. &QL;

HIGH-OCTANE ECONOMY A BOON FOR TEENS SEEKING SUMMER JOBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE   AND GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- School's out, summer is here and for many San
Fernando Valley students, that means grabbing a slice of financial
freedom with that dreaded, but oh-so-necessary, summer job.
</P>
<P>
   As Reseda High School senior John McCrary graduates Thursday, he
already has scored a $9-an-hour job at Northridge Hospital Medical
Center, delivering supplies to operating rooms, nursing stations
and specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that hard to get,'' said McCrary, 19. ``You just
have to look and go for something you enjoy. It helps to look at
places other kids might not think to apply.''
</P>
<P>
   McCrary is right, according to economists.
</P>
<P>
   These days any teen-ager looking for a summer job should find
one because of the supercharged economy, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to say the summer job opportunities are going to be
pretty rich. Almost every business is looking for somebody,'' said
Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp., a nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser said this is the best job market for teen-agers he's ever
seen since he began tracking the Los Angeles economy in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy roaring, unemployment last month hit
5.5 &UR;  &LR; percent, its lowest level since July 1990, when the state
entered a dark economic period that lasted until 1995, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser and other economists have noticed an increased number of
help wanted signs in store windows _ an unsophisticated yet
accurate gauge of the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question for teens is what do they bring to the table
in terms of skills,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The more skills teens have, the better. Clerical,
communication, computer and machine shop skills are good ones to
hone.
</P>
<P>
   Like McCrary did &UR;  &LR; -- He took a work experience class at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   And like Reseda High School junior Denise Morataya, who is
putting her clerical skills to work as a secretary at Allstate
insurance for the summer. The 15-year-old aspiring psychologist is
making $148 a week, plenty for her needs now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was referred by my sister, but knowing how to do the job --
like how to be a secretary -- helps a lot,'' she said. ``It can be
hard without that _ going out there cold with no skills.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics at the
end of April found that this generation of teens likes to earn a
wage during time off from school, especially in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four percent of 15-year-olds work at jobs in places like
stores and restaurants, said the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth taken in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At Reseda High School, many students said they would go ``just
about anywhere'' to find a job, but a few said the key to
summertime employment bliss -- or as close as you can get to that
-- means finding a job that suits you.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fallbrook Mall's Sport Chalet, five high school students
found jobs in departments that handle their favorite sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been biking for a long time, and I got lucky when they
hired me here,'' said Craig Svanberg, 16, who works in Sport
Chalet's bicycle department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm good at repairing and tuning bikes. This job is a little
about the money, but more about having fun because I love what I
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Whale, 16, sells sports clothing at the store while her
friends go to the movies or the beach. But she enjoys the financial
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you're more responsible, and it gets you used to
the working world,'' Whale said. ``I like having the money so I can
buy my own stuff without having to ask anyone for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Smith, deputy chief economist for the California
Department of Finance, said service jobs, like fast-food
restaurants, are common summer stops for teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder to hire people now. If I were a high school
student, I would think that this is a very good summer to work,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics survey found that 28 percent of
15-year-olds worked during both the summer and the school year.
Eight percent reported working only during the school year, and 6
percent said they worked only during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that academically gifted and academically
challenged students were equally likely to work.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are always those cases that draw frustration. These
days, 17-year-old Zachory Kemp is feeling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've applied at movie theaters and video stores, and no one is
calling back. I'm going to have to go fast food,'' said Kemp, a
Reseda High School sophomore. ``I've been looking for a job for a
year, and it's just getting harder. I might try some
supermarkets.''

KNICKS USE HEFT, BUT IT'S USELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kurt Thomas would not be caught bragging about the
Knicks' defense on San Antonio's David Robinson and Tim Duncan, not
with the two of them scoring a combined 45 points in Game 3, not
with the power duo so clearly in control of the Spurs' two
victories to start the finals.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a new confidence to the Knicks for Game 4, if their
ability to control the Spurs' big men had suddenly turned this
series on its ear, then the swagger would have to remain in the
walk. They had used their bodies to push Duncan away from the
basket, but the Knicks would be careful not to use their mouths to
push his buttons, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Thomas _ and later Chris Dudley _ were asked if they
could possibly hope to shrink Duncan's numbers further from his
20-point, fourth-quarter-shutout effort in Game 3, they deferred to
the dominance of Duncan and Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as much as you can do because they get so many
touches,'' Thomas said. ``If they get 80 to 90 plays, 60 of the
plays go to those two guys. It's going to be difficult to stop
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks did not stop Duncan on Wednesday night. Although they
rode the bulky body of Larry Johnson to successfully nudge Duncan a
few inches away from his preferred spot in the low post, and forced
him to rely on his turnaround jumper from the middle of the paint,
or on a shot from the perimeter or around the foul line, Duncan got
28 points on 9 of 19 shooting. Robinson had 14 points. Only once in
the half did Duncan get a completely uncontested layup when, with
the lean Dudley barely able to move Duncan an inch on the baseline,
Duncan took a pass along the baseline from Jaren Jackon and laid it
in to give San Antonio a 44-40 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to meet them as early as possible and try to move him
out just an extra step,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said of the strategy
before Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   But Duncan adjusted to the pressure in a way he did not do in
Game 3. With the Knicks also putting pressure on Robinson to take
away the high-low game with which the Spurs drilled the Knicks in
the first two games, Duncan simply moved his all-round game away
from the basket. Although he got deep post position several times,
it was usually a few feet from the basket, where he set up for his
jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the first half, Duncan took a pass from Avery
Johnson at the foul line. Johnson _ 5 inches shorter _ stood in
front of him, but when the 7-foot Duncan lofted a 14-foot jumper
over his hands, Johnson was powerless to alter the shot. And when
Johnson found Duncan on the right wing, Marcus Camby was playing
well off Duncan when he put up his midrange bank shot that made the
score 59-46 early in the third quarter. Then, two times in a row,
the mismatch with Johnson was exploited. The Knicks had managed to
alter Duncan's game _ his shots were not the high-percentage ones
he got in the first two games and he was flustered enough to commit
three inexplicable turnovers late in the game _ but the alterations
were not drastic enough to change the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go to Duncan so often, you're not going to stop him,''
Dudley said. ``He's going to score and score a lot but you try to
limit his effective and the percentages. You keep a body on him and
take away the easy shots.''
</P>
<P>
   After letting Duncan run amok against one-on-one defense in the
first half of Game 1, the Knicks have used a variety of double
teams to shadow him. He finished Game 1 with 33 points and had 25
in Game 2. But Monday _ and again in Game 4 _ the Knicks hoped to
tweak their help on defense just a bit. Johnson will never be able
to stop Duncan's flawless turnaround jumper, but in Game 3, he had
successfully invaded and shrunk Duncan's comfort zone and had
pushed Duncan closer to a second defender who comes over to help.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the constant attention paid to Duncan with
the help defense opens up everyone else. In Game 1, when the double
team finally came, the Spurs kicked the ball out to the perimeter,
where Jackson awaited with a flurry of 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   The long-distance shots did not fall in Game 3, but Wednesday
night, the double team on Duncan cleared the way for the outside
shooters. In the third quarter, Duncan was double teamed, with
Johnson again blocking the easy way to the basket. So Duncan swung
the ball over to Johnson, who swished a 19-footer. Sean Elliott,
Mario Elie and Johnson combined for 46 points.

MONDESI DOESN'T LIKE TIME OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Raul Mondesi was upset when he was moved from the
fourth to fifth spot earlier this season and he responded by going
on an offensive tear that earned him back the cleanup spot.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi wasn't happy again Wednesday, but for a day he said he'd
live with manager Davey Johnson's decision to rest him. Mondesi,
who started the Dodgers' first 68 games, was replaced by Todd
Hollandsworth in right field.
</P>
<P>
   It doubled as an opportunity to get the slumping Mondesi a break
while adding Hollandsworth's left-handed bat to a lineup dominated
by right-handers. Mondesi said he was told he wouldn't be playing
by hitting coach Rick Down after the Dodgers lost Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to (sit), but (Johnson)'s the manager,'' Mondesi
said before the Dodgers played San Diego. ``I don't like to sit and
watch somebody play. If I was hurt, OK. But if I am strong and want
to go. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Entering June, Mondesi was batting .305 with 18 homers. He's 3
for 30 with one homer since but discounts the theory he's tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 28 years old. Tired? Why?, '' Mondesi said. ``I want to
hit every day. If we're winning 11-1 in the eighth, I want to
complete the game. . . . I want to win. If we win, I'm fine, even
if I don't hit very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson expected a nonfavorable response from Mondesi but said
he needed to do it to keep him mentally fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mondi's been expanding the strike zone too much,'' said
Johnson, who added some levity to the situation. ``He doesn't have
(Cal) Ripken's streak going. I'll probably have to throw him in
there before the night's over. It's just a change. I don't think
he's physically tired.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On second thought: As catcher Todd Hundley gets closer to
returning to the lineup Saturday at San Francisco, the admittance
from the Dodgers that they were wrong to rush him through spring
training finally arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, I probably would have been better off leaving
him in Florida, in extended spring training,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's been working the past eight days with bullpen coach
Rick Dempsey to iron out the flaws in his throwing mechanics.
Hundley has thrown out only seven of 60 would-be base stealers this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he did a decent job, a better than decent job, all
things considered,'' Johnson said. ``He was never more than 50 to
60 percent. You need more work than he got.''
</P>
<P>
   __ FYI: Left-handed hitting Craig Counsell started at second and
led off in place of Eric Young, who was 3 for 19 (.158) in his last
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Young) looked like he was a little frustrated to me,''
Johnson said. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Doug Bochtler cleared waivers, but he is mulling
whether to sign with another team as a free agent or join the
Dodgers' Triple-A Albuquerque squad. . . . The Dodgers used their
49th different lineup of the season against the Padres.

EARLY INDICATORS POINT TO SIZZLING SEASON AT THE THE CINEMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood's box office is lightsaber hot.
</P>
<P>
   Industry trackers interviewed Wednesday say the summer of 1999
will demolish last year's $2.58 billion U.S. record _ a daring
prediction since less than one-third of the 15-week summer period
has gone by.
</P>
<P>
   So far, domestic grosses have jumped an astounding 27 percent
over last summer's and are on pace to hit $3.2 billion _ revenue
from 665 million tickets _ when Labor Day rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty confident we'll set a new record,'' said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of the Exhibitor Relations Co. tracking
service. ``We've had terrific numbers so far, and there are a lot
of big films still to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer is the industry's most critical period, accounting for 40
percent of all ticket sales. In a change from previous years, when
the top movies were released by late June, movie fans this season
still can look forward to three movies considered sure-fire hits
and a dozen other films with solid prospects in the next 2{ months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no question that this summer will do better
than last,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source
forecasting service. ``There's a lot of diversity in the schedule,
with films for every audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The dominant player has been 20th Century Fox's ``Star Wars:
Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' which topped $333 million Tuesday
after five weeks. But four other movies have had strong results.
Universal's ``Notting Hill,'' Disney's ``Tarzan,'' New Line's
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' and Paramount's ``The
General's Daughter'' opened strong.
</P>
<P>
   All but ``Notting Hill'' beat ``Phantom Menace'' last weekend
even though the George Lucas prequel grossed nearly $19 million. In
a stunning show of drawing power, the latest Friday-Sunday period
set the record as the biggest nonholiday weekend ever. It was also
the first time three films ever topped $20 million on a nonholiday
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of performance underscores the success of megaplexes.
About 5,000 new screens have been added across the country in the
past four years, most of them in massive megaplex theaters that can
show a hit movie in as many as six different auditoriums at once,
Dergarabedian noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might think that there are too many major titles out
normally, but the audience has expanded,'' he said. ``The megaplex
strategy can work when there's a lot of good product out there.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, theater owners are no longer complaining, as they
used to, that studios are bunching most of their key titles at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have the shelf space to accommodate major titles as
they come out,'' said AMC marketing chief Richard Fay. ``When you
have three films do as well as those did last weekend, it shows
that megaplexes have expanded the grossing potential of movies. I
look for that to continue to happen this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Positive buzz has escalated recently for three upcoming
comedies: Sony's ``Big Daddy'' starring Adam Sandler, which will
open Friday; Warner Bros.' Will Smith vehicle, ``Wild Wild West,''
which will open Wednesday; and Paramount's ``Runaway Bride,'' which
reunites ``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere and
is scheduled to open July 30. Each could take in at least $150
million.
</P>
<P>
   The second tier contains a wide variety of July and August
titles with breakout potential, led by Universal's teen comedy
``American Pie,'' due July 9; Warner's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' with Tom
Cruise and Nicole Kidman in Stanley Kubrick's last film, to be out
July 16; and Disney's ``Inspector Gadget,'' which will open July
23.
</P>
<P>
   Positive word also has emerged on Fox's ``Lake Placid,''
Paramount's ``The Wood,'' DreamWorks' ``The Haunting,'' Warner's
``Deep Blue Sea,'' Universal's ``Bowfinger,'' Warner's ``Iron
Giant,'' MGM's remake of ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' Miramax's
``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' and Universal's ``Dudley Do-Right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer is different from previous years where you'd see
most of the top movies by the middle of June and then wind down,''
said Bucksbaum, who rates ``American Pie,'' ``Inspector Gadget''
and ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' as the potential sleepers.
</P>
<P>
   Fay said Universal's ``The Mummy,'' which opened May 7, played a
key role in jump-starting moviegoing a dozen days before ``Phantom
Menace'' opened. ``People got excited about going to the movies,''
he said. ``So now if they can't get in to see `Tarzan' or `The
General's Daughter,' they find another movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The first four months of 1999 suffered by comparison with 1998,
mostly because of the record-setting performance of ``Titanic''
last year. It took until last week for revenues to catch up with
1998's, when the industry set a $6.95 billion record for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks like a banner summer,'' said Fox distribution chief
Tom Sherak. ``The bottom line is it looks like we'll put a dent in
the bad first quarter exhibitors had.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength already likely in July and August has prompted more
shuffling of release dates than usual. Release of Universal's Steve
Martin-Eddie Murphy comedy ``Bowfinger'' was moved twice and is now
set for Aug. 13. Other prominent films such as Fox's action-drama
``The Fight Club,'' Sony's Martin Lawrence comedy ``Blue Streak''
and Universal's baseball drama ``For Love of the Game'' have been
moved back to the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a spectacular screening of `Blue Streak' and we felt it
matched up better in the fall lineup, which had been much more
adult and comedy-free,'' said Sony distribution chief Jeff Blake.
``So we chose to be the first big event film of the fall.''

JURY DELIBERATIONS BEGIN IN SLEEPWALKING TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Phoenix jury must now decide whether to accept a man's claim
that he is not responsible for killing his wife because he was
sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   After a month of testimony in a case that has drawn
international attention, the jury began deliberating Scott
Falater's fate Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Juan Martinez's urged the panel to take a lesson from
the story of Don Quixote. He said they should reject the defense
that Falater's attorneys presented with the help of two nationally
known sleepwalking experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fanciful sort of world, just like Don Quixote's,''
Martinez said. ``Are you willing to follow him there?''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said that Falater, who acknowledges stabbing his wife
and dragging her body into a swimming pool at their Phoenix home,
``is just plainly and simply a killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``His actions clearly indicate it was premeditated,'' Martinez
said. He said Falater stabbed his wife Yarmila 44 times in the back
yard, stashed his bloody clothes, put on pajamas and bandaged a
cut, returned to find that she was still breathing, and dragged her
into the swimming pool to finish her off.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing argument, defense attorney Michael Kimerer fired
back at Martinez, accusing the combative prosecutor of distorting
evidence in an effort to win a first-degree murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who is the man from La Mancha creating the fantasy
world is the prosecution in this case,'' Kimerer said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer was particularly critical of Martinez's claim Wednesday
that a psychologist's cryptic notes about an ``unforgivable sin''
showed that Falater had a motive for murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There simply is no basis or motive or reason why Scott Falater
would kill his wife,'' said Kimerer, who during the trial called
more than a dozen character witnesses. They testified that Falater,
43, was a devoted family man and a respected engineer known for his
calm demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sadness and the horror in this case is that because you're
in a sleepwalking state and have no voluntary control over your
actions, you have ended up killing the most important thing in your
life,'' Kimerer said.
</P>
<P>
   As the burly defense attorney spoke to the jury, Falater sat
behind him, expressionless, hands clasped in his lap.
</P>
<P>
   Crews from ``Court TV,'' ABC's ``20/20'' and from MSNBC recorded
the session. Their presence, along with squadrons of local press,
reflect the national fascination about the unusual defense on
behalf of a man whose frenzied 1997 outburst shattered the apparent
calm of his home life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a person who has never been in any trouble, this is a
man who had a wonderful marriage, and this is a man who had two of
the finest children you ever could have,'' Kimerer said.
</P>
<P>
   Falater's bloody attack ``was a total aberration from everything
in his life,'' Kimerer said. And that supports the defense claim
that Falater was acting involuntarily and therefore is not legally
responsible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer offered his own literary allusion. He said the Falater
case reminded him of Franz Kafka's story ``The Metamorphosis,''
about a man who awoke one morning to find that he had been
transformed into a giant insect.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tragically transformed man is Scott Falater, Kimerer
said. He said Falater awoke from his bloody sleepwalking episode
with no memory of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finds out that the life he had . . . is gone, the wife that
he loves is gone, his children are gone,'' Kimerer said. ``He's in
jail and he doesn't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer reminded the jury of Rosalind Cartwright, the Chicago
sleepwalking expert who said she believed so strongly in Falater
that she was testifying for free. Cartwright had also said she
feels obligated to educate the public about sleepwalking violence,
Kimerer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a sham,'' Kimerer said of the sleepwalking defense.
``Sleepwalking homicide or violence is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez offered his own interpretation of the handwritten notes
of a psychologist who evaluated Falater after the killing. It was
unclear whether the notes were a series of unconnected observations
or a disjointed narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unforgivable sin _ not continuing to grow _ getting stuck in
life,'' the notes read. Dad did it, so did SF (Falater). Dad told
him not to grow past his wife like he felt he did _ Scott did it
too.''
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Falater said his comment about ``unforgivable
sin'' was a reference to his concerns about a Mormon doctrine that
says those who kill will find no forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez offered a new interpretation of Falater's comment.
He told the jury that it explained his motive for killing Yarmila.
``We know by his own statement that she committed an unforgivable
sin,'' he said, drawing a conclusion that did not appear justified
by the trial's discussion of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez offered a series of speculations on the meaning of
``unforgivable sin,'' all of which suggested that Falater had
voluntarily admitted having a motive for killing his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps, she didn't want to attend temple,'' he said. Perhaps
it was her refusal to have more children, as Scott wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Then Martinez, who has claimed throughout the trial that the
Falater marriage was unraveling at the time of Yarmila's death,
commented sarcastically about the defense's version of the
Falater's home life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sure sounds like there's grounds to say this is the
happiest marriage around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer attacked Martinez's interpretation of the notes. ``This
concept of unforgiven sin is simply not supported by the
evidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both attorneys framed the case as a battle of the experts, in
which the jury must decide who offered the more convincing
interpretation of Falater's killing of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez claimed that the defense experts had defied common
sense, performing sloppy analysis of Falater's actions because they
were eager to add his case to the catalogue of sleepwalking
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so quick to want to make this a cause celbre,'' said
Martinez. ``They want to be a part of this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez ridiculed the extensive resumes of Cartwright and Dr.
Roger Broughton, the Canadian sleep disorder researcher who said
sleepwalking was ``by far the most probable'' explanation of
Falater's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I submit to you that these (resumes) are nothing but steps to
their shrines of self-indulgence,'' he said. Martinez attacked
Broughton's explanation of why Falater stashed his bloody clothes
in the wheel well of his Volvo stationwagon, which was parked in
the garage.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton said Falater was sleepwalking as he removed the
clothes and put them in a Tupperware container, which he then
placed in a plastic bag that police found in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian researcher, explaining that sleepwalkers often
carry out habitual tasks, said Falater had been accustomed to
storing the clothes there and using them for yard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is opposed to what the defendant says,'' Martinez noted.
He pointed out that Falater had testified that the clothes were
stashed in the car for use in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Walking over to the defense table, Martinez extended both arms
and pointed directly at Falater, ``You couldn't get your story
straight,'' he said to Falater, who looked back without expression.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer countered by describing Broughton and Cartwright as
``two of the finest, best experts in the world on parasomnias,'' a
subset of sleep disorders that includes sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's experts knew a lot about people who have
trouble breathing in their sleep, Kimerer said, but they had little
experience dealing with sleepwalkers.

EARLY INDICATORS POINT TO SIZZLING SEASON AT THE THE CINEMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood's box office is lightsaber hot.
</P>
<P>
   Industry trackers interviewed Wednesday say the summer of 1999
will demolish last year's $2.58 billion U.S. record _ a daring
prediction since less than one-third of the 15-week summer period
has gone by.
</P>
<P>
   So far, domestic grosses have jumped an astounding 27 percent
over last summer's and are on pace to hit $3.2 billion _ revenue
from 665 million tickets _ when Labor Day rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty confident we'll set a new record,'' said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of the Exhibitor Relations Co. tracking
service. ``We've had terrific numbers so far, and there are a lot
of big films still to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer is the industry's most critical period, accounting for 40
percent of all ticket sales. In a change from previous years, when
the top movies were released by late June, movie fans this season
still can look forward to three movies considered sure-fire hits
and a dozen other films with solid prospects in the next 2{ months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no question that this summer will do better
than last,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source
forecasting service. ``There's a lot of diversity in the schedule,
with films for every audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The dominant player has been 20th Century Fox's ``Star Wars:
Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' which topped $333 million Tuesday
after five weeks. But four other movies have had strong results.
Universal's ``Notting Hill,'' Disney's ``Tarzan,'' New Line's
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' and Paramount's ``The
General's Daughter'' opened strong.
</P>
<P>
   All but ``Notting Hill'' beat ``Phantom Menace'' last weekend
even though the George Lucas prequel grossed nearly $19 million. In
a stunning show of drawing power, the latest Friday-Sunday period
set the record as the biggest nonholiday weekend ever. It was also
the first time three films ever topped $20 million on a nonholiday
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of performance underscores the success of megaplexes.
About 5,000 new screens have been added across the country in the
past four years, most of them in massive megaplex theaters that can
show a hit movie in as many as six different auditoriums at once,
Dergarabedian noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might think that there are too many major titles out
normally, but the audience has expanded,'' he said. ``The megaplex
strategy can work when there's a lot of good product out there.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, theater owners are no longer complaining, as they
used to, that studios are bunching most of their key titles at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have the shelf space to accommodate major titles as
they come out,'' said AMC marketing chief Richard Fay. ``When you
have three films do as well as those did last weekend, it shows
that megaplexes have expanded the grossing potential of movies. I
look for that to continue to happen this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Positive buzz has escalated recently for three upcoming
comedies: Sony's ``Big Daddy'' starring Adam Sandler, which will
open Friday; Warner Bros.' Will Smith vehicle, ``Wild Wild West,''
which will open Wednesday; and Paramount's ``Runaway Bride,'' which
reunites ``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere and
is scheduled to open July 30. Each could take in at least $150
million.
</P>
<P>
   The second tier contains a wide variety of July and August
titles with breakout potential, led by Universal's teen comedy
``American Pie,'' due July 9; Warner's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' with Tom
Cruise and Nicole Kidman in Stanley Kubrick's last film, to be out
July 16; and Disney's ``Inspector Gadget,'' which will open July
23.
</P>
<P>
   Positive word also has emerged on Fox's ``Lake Placid,''
Paramount's ``The Wood,'' DreamWorks' ``The Haunting,'' Warner's
``Deep Blue Sea,'' Universal's ``Bowfinger,'' Warner's ``Iron
Giant,'' MGM's remake of ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' Miramax's
``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' and Universal's ``Dudley Do-Right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer is different from previous years where you'd see
most of the top movies by the middle of June and then wind down,''
said Bucksbaum, who rates ``American Pie,'' ``Inspector Gadget''
and ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' as the potential sleepers.
</P>
<P>
   Fay said Universal's ``The Mummy,'' which opened May 7, played a

he said. ``So now if they can't get in to see `Tarzan' or `The

CIA ANALYST QUESTIONED TARGET BEFORE CHINESE EMBASSY BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A midlevel analyst in the CIA raised doubts about
whether military planners were zeroing in on the right building
shortly before American bombs struck the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, the night of May 7, government officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials spoke on the same day that the administration
began to brief Congress about an internal investigation of the
bombing that included an account of the analyst's warning. The
administration provided a similar reconstruction to the Chinese
last week in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The officials gave slightly conflicting accounts of the timing
and specificity of the warnings, first reported in Thursday's issue
of The Washington Post. But for whatever reason, according to the
administration, the doubts either came too late or were lost in the
bureaucratic thicket before the strike that killed three Chinese
and wounded at least 20 others.
</P>
<P>
   The accident, at the height of NATO's air campaign meant to
deter Yugoslav forces from atrocities against Albanians in Kosovo,
was a stinging embarrassment to the United States and a serious
setback to relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis immediately after the satellite-guided bombs from
an American B-2 struck the embassy, military officials explained
that the intended target had been the headquarters of a Yugoslav
arms agency that is actually a few blocks from the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put an X on the map, but we put the X in the wrong place,''
a senior American official said at the time. The arms agency and
the embassy are about 200 yards apart.
</P>
<P>
   According to the officials familiar with the investigation, the
midlevel analyst did not know where the embassy was situated. But
based on his familiarity with downtown Belgrade, he did know _ or
thought he knew _ where the arms-agency headquarters was.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the building being targeted might not be the
headquarters, though he left open the possibility that it was a
related office, according to one official.
</P>
<P>
   One official said the analyst had raised his concerns many days
in advance of the bombing mission. Two other officials, however,
said Wednesday that the warnings were raised closer to the May 7
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been a few more days, it could have been
prevented,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior government official said Wednesday night that a
classified report from the inspector general's office of the CIA
has concluded that the analyst's cautions indeed went unheeded _ in
large measure because he departed for two days of training and
returned to discover, to his horror, that the bombers were already
on their way.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Wednesday night, and might not be for some
time, how furious an alarm the analyst had tried to raise before
his departure, and whether his co-workers had simply dismissed the
warnings or given them serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was saying, `Gee, I don't think that's the right
building,''' one official recalled Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the bombing mission, CIA officials and
senior officers at the U.S. military's European Command learned to
their dismay that American bombs had struck the Chinese Embassy.
Pictures of grief-stricken survivors amid the rubble were a deep
embarrassment to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When the target was initially checked against electronic mapping
data in U.S. and NATO computers to guard against civilian
casualties, no alarms were sounded because a half-dozen government
databases had the location of the old Chinese Embassy before it
moved in 1996, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav arms agency headquarters were picked because
intelligence experts have long suspected that it helped America's
rivals to develop advanced weapons, and that it sold weapons to
help finance the Yugoslav military, American officials explained
immediately after the warning.
</P>
<P>
   In their briefing to Congress Wednesday, the administration
officials said that a cascading series of errors contributed to the
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The first involved the use of three outdated maps, two
commercial maps made in Yugoslavia and a 1997 map prepared by the
National Intelligence Mapping Agency. That map was based on
information in a series of intelligence agency databases that were
outdated. But when the databases were checked against each other,
no mistake was detected _ because they were all based on the same
sources. ``There was some circularity to the databases,'' one
official said, meaning that they were based on the same erroneous
information.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the address of the arms headquarters, and thus its
coordinates, was extrapolated based on an examination of numbers on
nearby streets. ``It was a pretty rough estimate,'' one official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation of how the mistakes were made was given to the
Chinese last week by Thomas Pickering, the undersecretary of state,
in a mission to Beijing that also included representatives of the
Pentagon, the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National
Security Council. To the surprise of the American delegation, their
Chinese counterparts were matter-of-fact about the incident. ``They
raised no allegations or alternative scenarios,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese officials had demanded earlier to know the names of
those responsible, and to get an account of whether they were being
held responsible. But Pickering's delegation deflected those
questions, identifying no individuals and simply assuring the
Chinese that ``there would be no attempt to whitewash the
incident,'' one administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   But a week after the explanation, relations with Beijing still
seem frozen in place. Chinese officials have not restarted talks on
China's effort to join the World Trade Organization, a negotiation
that was reaching its final stages when the bombing occurred and
resulted in an outpouring of government-orchestrated anti-American
protests on the streets of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It now looks like this is going to take a long time to get
back to normal,'' one trade official said Wednesday.

MARINER CASTOFF OLIVARES EARNING HALO WITH ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He leads Anaheim pitchers in victories, has the
Angels' lowest earned run average, even claims his club's lone
complete game.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like someone the pitching-poor Mariners could use.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Olivares, however, is quite happy where he is. Besides,
Seattle had its chance, employing him for 13 games in 1997, and
didn't quite know what to do with the right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been pitching good,'' said Olivares, who won't face
the Mariners on this trip but is scheduled to catch them in Anaheim
next week. ``I'm more consistent and I'm able to hit spots with all
of my pitches. When you're able to do that, it helps you out.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares, 6-5 with a 3.45 ERA this season, was successful before
he joined the Mariners, playing for St. Louis and Detroit. He
obviously has distinguished himself since leaving Seattle as a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   As a Mariner, he was 1-4 with a 5.49 ERA in 13 outings, mainly
as the fifth starter. He didn't make the club's playoff roster. He
was gone by the winter.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Mariner manager Lou Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares says he wasn't used properly to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, I didn't pitch every five days, for whatever reason,''
Olivares said. ``I got caught in between. It didn't help me. Every
sinker-ball pitcher needs to pitch regularly to stay effective. I'd
be rested and get too strong.''
</P>
<P>
   BUZZ STUFF: Buhner Buzz Night, the annual shorning of a few
thousand fans, will take place before Thursday's game, even though
the principal figure involved remains hobbled.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners right fielder Jay Buhner, who has been on the disabled
list since May 19 with a strained left hamstring, had hoped to be
back for this homestand, but aggravated the muscle while running
the bases to show he was healthy again. His return now is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be 72 hours until I know anything,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner says the Kingdome, with its AstroTurf playing field, is
largely responsible for many of the injuries he has incurred in
recent seasons, the hard surface putting an extra strain on joints
and muscles. He said the place was the cause of serious injuries to
Edgar Martinez and Alex Rodriguez as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ballpark has shortened my career, no doubt about it,''
Buhner said. ``Anybody will tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner won't play in the Kingdome again, a place he says will
leave him with more good memories than bad. He won division titles
there, played in a couple of no-hitters, hit for the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   He also won't forget standing atop the building watching the
Blue Angels fly just 50 feet over head, using the Kingdome flagpole
as a guide point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's home,'' he said. ``I made a name for myself here.''
</P>
<P>
   FOUL POLE: One guy who didn't flourish under the cement top was
Dick Pole, a former Mariner pitcher now working as Anaheim's
pitching coach. He had an undistinguished two-year tour with
Seattle during the first two seasons of the franchise in 1977 and
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for memories, Pole said, ``I don't have any. They were all
bad ones. That's why I'm a good coach, because I know how not to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pole said he's not sad to see the Kingdome go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can get rid of this place as far as I'm concerned. It
wasn't a good place to pitch. I tell (Angels pitchers) not to walk
anybody. This place can be like arena baseball. You come into a
place like this, you tell your pitchers to keep it to five runs or
less, and you have a good chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL CHART: Mariner pitcher Jeff Fassero will start
Thursday's game against Anaheim, even after appearing in relief
Monday and Tuesday. First baseman David Segui won't be in the
lineup, still hobbled by a knee strain.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero faced two batters in the series opener against the
Angels, four the night before in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella called in his struggling left-hander Wednesday for an
office chat and is confident the player will be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him and he told me he was fine,'' the manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   Segui's knee remains sore after he injured it while taking a
swing and catching his spikes Monday in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think it would be a few more days,'' Piniella said.

HAPPY RETURN FOR SABERHAGEN, RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ORIOLES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ As much as his Red Sox teammates appreciate his
ability to throw a party, Bret Saberhagen meant much more to them
throwing on the mound in Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's 5-0 win over the
Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   And it was clear, from the heavy emotion Saberhagen invested in
the pumped fist he threw after striking out Baltimore's Mike
Bordick with two on and two out in the fifth inning, that he
prefers to be more than team toastmaster, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel like part of the team?'' said Saberhagen, who hadn't
pitched since stepping on a piece of broken glass at a team party
he hosted in New York a couple of weeks ago. ``It hasn't been two
years since my last win, but it sure feels like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who came into the game with as many wins (two) as
stints on the disabled list, shut out the Orioles on seven hits and
a walk in 5 1/3 innings for his first win since April 13. This was
only his eighth start, one in which John Valentin, on a night he
said he couldn't see the ball, broke a scoreless tie with a two-run
home run in the fifth off Juan Guzman and Reggie Jefferson hit a
solo homer in the Sox' three-run ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a frustrating year,'' Saberhagen said. ``But it's a
matter of getting out there the rest of the year and taking my turn
when it comes up. It doesn't feel like I've been a big part of it,
but there's still time.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who is always in the middle of all
things Red Sox and earlier extended his hitting streak to 11 games
with a seventh-inning single, left after his triple into the
right-field corner in the ninth. Manager Jimy Williams said
Garciaparra, who is 13 for 18 with two walks and a hit by pitch in
his last five games, hurt his upper left leg rounding first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to say day to day,'' Williams said when asked
about Garciaparra's availability in Thursday night's rubber game
against the Orioles, who had won four in a row and 11 of 12 before
falling Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's wait and see until tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Lou Merloni, who started at second base in place of Jose
Offerman after playing third base for Valentin Tuesday night,
finished the game at short and made the relay on a game-ending
double play with Tim Wakefield on the mound. Merloni would start at
short Thursday night if Garciaparra can't go, which would seem
likely given Williams's penchant for prudence when it comes to leg
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we have a team,'' Williams said. ``Certainly, we
don't make up lineups ahead of time, but Merloni can play four
spots. Maybe that's the way we have to be, the way we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen benefited from 2 2/3 innings of splendid relief by
Derek Lowe and another block of home plate by catcher Jason
Varitek, who prevented Cal Ripken from scoring on Charles Johnson's
single in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, who had opened the inning with a line single to center,
took second on a sacrifice and tried to beat a throw home from left
fielder Damon Buford. Varitek, however, planted his right shinguard
between Ripken's toe and the plate and applied the tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I got away with it,'' Buford said of his throw. ``It
wasn't the strongest throw. I threw it off my back foot. Tek
(Varitek) did a good job of blocking the plate. Really, it was all
Tek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what, he's good. If the throw's close enough,
he's going to block the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Buford, who struck out with the bases loaded in the first,
singled twice and made a terrific running catch of B.J. Surhoff's
foul fly at the left-field railing in the seventh. He was playing
left in one of those head-scratching lineup moves made by Williams,
who gave Troy O'Leary the night off even though he'd homered in
each of the previous two games.
</P>
<P>
   So, what else is new? Darren Lewis hit leadoff instead of
Offerman for only the second time this season and tripled and was
grazed by a pitch from Guzman just before Valentin went deep.
Jefferson, serving as the designated hitter and batting third
despite having just one hit in 13 at-bats this month, hit his
fourth home run in the ninth off Ricky Bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like each other in here,'' Williams said when asked why
this team recovers so nicely from tough losses, like the one
Tuesday night, in which the Sox took a 3-1 lead into the eighth and
lost, 5-3. ``It's easy to say, you know, but it has to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I think. I hear them pull for each other, things
like that. It's a compliment to them. We just try to make it simple
and play hard out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen departed with a 2-0 lead courtesy of the home run by
Valentin, who interrupted a stream of strikeouts by Orioles starter
Juan Guzman _ nine whiffs in 5 2/3 innings, which included striking
out the side in both the first and third innings _ with his seventh
homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That more than compensated for his three whiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see the ball, I couldn't pick up the rotation,''
Valentin said. ``It might have been because of the day off. That's
why I looked as bad as I did. It was scary out there. I was shaking
my head.''
</P>
<P>
   And Saberhagen was pumping his fist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just picked up where he left off,'' Buford said. ``A great
pitcher. A good night.''

FINALLY, A GAME WORTH WATCHING 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Let's get the basics out of the way first.
</P>
<P>
   No team has ever come back from a 3-1 deficit to win the NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   If the New York Knicks are going to do it, they'll have to win
two games on the road against a team that has lost two playoff
games, period.
</P>
<P>
   That said, let us salute the return of an old friend. After
three messy games that typified what the NBA has become in the late
'90s, an honest-to-God NBA basketball game broke out
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. This is not going to be any consolation to the
disappointed Knicks fans, but Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's 96-89 San Antonio
victory in Game 4 of the championship series was something that
wouldn't have been out of place 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There was movement. There was some decent shooting. There was a
sense of give-and-take, of just plain flow. We saw some superb
individual play, most notably the 28-point, 18-rebound performance
by mortal lock Finals MVP Tim Duncan, and we saw some collective
brilliance by a Spurs team that is now just one victory away from
winning the first championship in its combined 26-year ABA-NBA
history.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks made them sweat, but when there was a game to be won
the Spurs made all the requisite plays. Charlie Ward walked to the
free throw line with a chance to tie the game at 81 with 5:25
remaining. He made the first, but missed the second. New York never
did tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had one opportunity to get within 1 when Larry
Johnson, at the tail end of a miserable game at both ends of the
floor, had two shots with his team trailing, 86-83. He made the
first, whereupon San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich tried the old
let's-call-time-out-and-ice-him ploy. By golly, it worked. Johnson
missed the second one, and that's as close as New York would come,
primarily because when the Knicks needed a basket they missed six
outside shots in succession.
</P>
<P>
   But shooting wasn't what bothered Knicks mentor Jeff Van Gundy.
``Offense was not the problem tonight,'' he pointed out. ``We got
killed on the boards and we didn't guard as well as we needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The stats didn't lie. San Antonio outrebounded the Knicks by 15
(49-34), and that doesn't begin to outline the inside dominance of
Duncan and David Robinson, who combined for 35 rebounds and whose
altitudinous presence eliminated any hope New York might have had
of submitting an inside game to augment the sniping of Latrell
Sprewell (26) and Allan Houston (a controlled 20).
</P>
<P>
   Duncan blocked five shots, sometimes in tandem with Robinson.
And when Duncan blocks shots, he doesn't just block them. He
ingests them. He even comes up with some two-handers. The Knicks
had no chance.
</P>
<P>
   This has actually been a textbook NBA seven-game series. The
favored team won Games 1 and 2 despite not playing anywhere near
its capabilities for the simple reason that Games 1 and 2 were at
home. The other team came home and played a classic Game 3,
displaying far more energy and desire. The Knicks thoroughly
deserved to win that game.
</P>
<P>
   If form were to prevail, the Spurs should have come out with a
renewed sense of purpose for Game 4 Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. They should
have analyzed the goings-on in Game 3 and realized just how little
true energy they had. They should have made a vow to become the
aggressor. They should have made a pact to become a true team, and
not merely an aggregation featuring two big stars and 10 guys just
happy to be drawing a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly what happened. San Antonio led at the half,
picked up some nice breathing room by scoring the first 7 points of
the third quarter, then acted professionally when threatened in
what Magic Johnson used to call ``Winnin' Time.''
</P>
<P>
   And let's talk balance. You've already heard about Duncan and
Robinson. The Spurs also got the precise contributions they needed
from their other three starters.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Elliott, heretofore very quiet, had a solid 14. Mario Elie,
completely buried by Houston in Game 3, had a vintage Mario Elie
game, mixing up an occasional outside shot with some hard slashes
to the hoop, all of it adding up to a valuable 18-point game.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the Spurs got a first-class game from the
oft-forgotten point guard, Avery Johnson. AJ had a 14-point,
10-assist game that featured three first-half running hooks and
great floor leadership during a vital 44-minute stint. ``AJ is so
important to us,'' saluted Popovich. ``He keeps us in our sets.
Without him, we look a whole lot different. He gives us coordinated
possessions. He is The Man for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have every right to feel proud of what they did
Wednesday night, but the job is not yet done. The Knicks have
revealed themselves to be an ornery bunch. They don't quit in games
and they don't quit in series. But they really have next to no
hope. They have gone a long way but there are two very tall
obstacles in their path now.
</P>
<P>
   New York will fight, but the quest is now officially quixotic.
They might win Friday night, but three straight against this team?
Not remotely possible.

MORE CHURCHES WILL SIGN STATEMENT OF CONVICTIONS FOR NEWLYWEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN IWASAKI  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Pastors from more than 60 Eastside Christian churches
will sign a pact Thursday, during the height of the wedding season,
that aims to help engaged couples start their marriages on a solid
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Eastside Community Marriage Agreement is the latest
of 14 such pacts signed across Washington state since fall 1997,
and it is expected to have the most signers.
</P>
<P>
   Participating mainline and evangelical churches in seven cities
across Lake Washington will commit to work toward building ``strong
and joyful marriages'' by offering premarital counseling,
post-wedding mentoring and other training.
</P>
<P>
   Among the participants will be some of the area's largest
congregations, including Overlake Christian Church in Redmond and
Cedar Park Assembly and Eastside Foursquare Church in Bothell.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous agreements in other communities, the Eastside
pact is intended to be less rigid and more upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is the same, however: reducing the rate of
divorce, which claims an estimated one in two couples nationwide
today.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a list of requirements for engaged couples to be
married in a particular church, the agreement is more a statement
of convictions, according to the Rev. Dick Leon of First
Presbyterian Church of Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's saying, this is what we believe about marriage. Out of
that, we hope to welcome couples into a dialogue,'' said Leon, who
co-chaired a committee that drafted the document.
</P>
<P>
   The statement affirms that marriage is a holy union established
by God ``for the welfare and happiness of the human family and that
marriage works best when God is at the center of our lives and our
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The pact also states that marriage is intended to be a lifelong
commitment between a man and a woman and that Christian
congregations have the responsibility to foster lasting marriages
and strong families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couples who share a common faith in Jesus Christ and who seek
to follow God's word will be better prepared for the challenge to
excel in their lifelong relationship,'' the agreement says.
</P>
<P>
   Participating pastors also will agree that sex is ``so good and
so powerful that it can only be fully expressed within the bonds''
of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   That statement may dissuade churches ``that might have a more
liberal view of the Bible,'' said the Rev. Mitch Lomax of New Song
Church in Bellevue, who co-chaired the planning committee with
Leon.
</P>
<P>
   For a different reason, Catholic priests are not expected to
sign the Eastside pact, although some have done so in other
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic churches already have premarital requirements
established by the archdiocese, such as notifying a priest six
months before the wedding, taking a marriage preparation course and
other guidelines, said the Rev. Gerald Lovett of St. Jude Church in
Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastside agreement has some ``good things,'' Lovett said.
``It's not that I don't agree with it. But I thought I'd be
completely confusing my own people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the participating churches already have some aspect of
the agreement in place.
</P>
<P>
   St. Thomas Episcopal Church in Medina will see little difference
because of the pact, said the Rev. Ann Lukens, a member of the
planning committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``By canon law in the Episcopal Church, we always provide
premarital counseling,'' Lukens said.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement may lead St. Thomas to ``beef up our course
offering'' to help couples and families build strong relationships,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Some engaged couples needing a wedding location in a hurry will
thumb through the phone book, ``simply looking for a church that'll
say `yes,''' Lomax said. ``With this agreement, there may be less
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other 13 communities with marriage agreements are
Auburn, Renton, West Seattle, Enumclaw, Gig Harbor, Bellingham and
Spokane.

GOTHAM NATIVE SHOWS KNICKS THE EXIT DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All of Gotham went to bed in a bad mood Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   All except some folks who hail from West 97th Street, where
Mario Elie grew up, the place where he learned what kind of
toughness it takes to be a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 friends and family who were guests of Elie for the
disastrous Spurs outcome in Game 3 _ when Elie was whistled for two
quick fouls and never could become a factor _ were the only city
dwellers who left Madison Square Garden smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are dead. The team Elie grew up watching has been
shown the door. Friday, the Spurs might escort the Knicks out. All
of San Antonio understands that the imported New Yorker is part of
the reason why.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, when the Knicks were making another run at the
Spurs late in the fourth quarter, it was Elie who launched a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Kiss of death ... that's what they called the shot Elie hit to
put the Spurs up 81-73. And just moments later, when the Knicks
still refused to die, Elie took another shot.
</P>
<P>
   With the Spurs' lead down to 86-84, Elie missed, but it turned
out to be just as well. Elie snatched the long rebound, and the
Spurs whittled precious time off the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The ball in his hands, his feet on the Garden floor, his heart
steeped in New York basketball lore, Elie was at that particular
moment holding the key to San Antonio's win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what New York City is all about. Going to the basket
hard. Trash talking. I grew up five minutes from here, and it's
always great to come back here and play,'' Elie said.
</P>
<P>
   To make it extra special, Elie even jawed with Knicks fan
extraordinaire Spike Lee throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   Elie is no stranger to these sorts of moments. He won two titles
in Houston, which, in part, is why he is now with the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   But to sign him, the Spurs understood that Elie is the kind of
hard-nosed, up-from-the-trenches scrapper who likes to tell the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, every natural-born New Yorker has his own version of
the truth, but Elie doesn't do too bad.
</P>
<P>
   This past February, for instance, when the Spurs started off 6-8
and all of San Antonio was calling for coach Gregg Popovich's head
and for the trade of David Robinson, it was Elie who decided he
better go ahead and open his big truth-telling trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `As you go, we go, and you are not playing up to your
capability,'''' Elie said in his early-season state of the Spurs
address to Twins Towers Robinson and Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``And from then on, we went 43-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had lost, I would have taken a lot of flak, but we
didn't lose. I said what I said because it was the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   On that subject, let's call what happened Wednesday another
moment of Mario Elie truth.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more to the point, 48 minutes of truth, because the Spurs
rule, which accounts for Wednesday's 96-89 victory and their 3-1
lead in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone out there still interested in this series that is
leaking dangerously close to the month of July, this is without a
doubt the Twin Towers NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Robinson and Duncan combined for 35 rebounds
and 42 points. Despite the relentless will of the Knicks to stick
close, the Towers were too tall to topple.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it could be Duncan and Robinson who put an end to these
Finals, maybe as soon as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever natural-born size and talent Duncan and Robinson
possess, it took an early season kick in the pants from Elie to
shake them into action.
</P>
<P>
   If the Spurs are on the brink of a championship frontier, it is
because Elie brought his street swagger and heart to a franchise
desperate to shake its too-soft image.
</P>
<P>
   Elie brought that to Game 3, and it cost him when the refs
whistled fouls so quick that Elie was sure he was the victim of
Knick-friendly calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just let me play,'' Elie said, begging the refs to let him do
his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of questionable calls. There were a lot of
fast whistles. Two of our guards had four fouls with eight minutes
to go in the first quarter. I mean, this the NBA Finals. Let the
players decide the game,'' Elie said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, it was a different story. No ticky-tack fouls kept
Elie on the bench, out of action. In the cauldron of the Garden _
the place he dreamed of playing basketball _ Elie knew better than
anyone it was time to sieze the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they let me play tonight. Being home, getting 25
tickets, I was excited about being home. But I was a little more
relaxed tonight, and I put my head down and took my shots,'' Elie
said.
</P>
<P>
   The native New Yorker who now hails from San Antonio already
likes winning on the Garden floor, much to the Knicks' dismay.

SPURS ONE STEP CLOSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everywhere they turn this morning, the Knicks will be
surrounded by an annoying stat. It is the same one all teams in the
NBA Finals see when they are on the verge of elimination: No team
has ever come back from a 3-1 deficit to win the championship
series.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks can tell you about the 7-foot humanity behind
that stat. They can tell you that the NBA has never seen a center
combination similar to Tim Duncan and David Robinson. Forget about
deep analysis. You want to know why the Knicks lost Game 4 at
Madison Square Garden, 96-89? Duncan and Robinson; Robinson and
Duncan; Tim and David; David and Tim . . . you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan finished with 28 points, 18 rebounds, and 3 blocked
shots. Robinson contributed 14 points, 17 rebounds (including 9
offensive boards), and 4 blocked shots. In other words, they
outrebounded the entire Knicks team between them. Not only that,
they made any driving Knick a paranoid Knick around the basket.
They were constantly looking for the 7-footers. Each of those New
York drives had three options: a good basket, a block, or, most
often, a San Antonio rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``David was just a monster,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said
when it was over. ``People counted him out for some reason I'm
still not sure about.'' As for Duncan, ``Tim, just has a knack for
the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment has a double meaning. Not only can Duncan rebound,
he uses the backboard better than any player in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got two 7-footers back there to help us out,'' said
Mario Elie, who had 18 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 assists. They help
so much that it is almost impossible for the Spurs to have a
complete defensive lapse. Even though New York got 26 points from
Latrell Sprewell and 20 apiece from Marcus Camby and Allan Houston,
they had to work for everything they got. They shot 41 percent from
the field and needed 40 shots from Sprewell and Houston to get
their 46 points.
</P>
<P>
   It probably doesn't mean much to the Knicks, but
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's game was one of the more entertaining ones of
the playoffs. The league has formed a special committee to help
bring flair back to the game for next season. But when you watched
the first half, a half the Spurs won, 50-46, you found yourself
wondering, ``Who needs changes?'' For the first time in the series,
a team actually managed to crack 90 points.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those aesthetics, both teams will have plenty to discuss
at this morning's film sessions. The Spurs should expect to hear
some choice words from Popovich, considering that the coach knows
the end of the game shouldn't have been as interesting as it was.
The Spurs had an 81-73 lead with just more than seven minutes to
play. Elie had just dunked, following a Larry Johnson airball. All
the Spurs had to do was maintain and close. They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they had to listen as the Garden reached its loudest
levels of the night in the next two minutes. Houston, the star of
Game 3, posted up Avery Johnson and hit a turnaround jumper to make
it 81-79. After that postup, Duncan turned the ball over and,
eventually, Charlie Ward was fouled. But the Knicks couldn't tie it
as Ward made only 1 of 2 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   That began a frustrating trend for the Knicks. They quickly fell
behind by 5, closed to 2 again, then fell back again by 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our chances,'' Houston said. He added, ``We still have
to play better defense. We have to play better defense to stay in
the series.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, the same man who said the Spurs are not superior to the
Knicks, still wouldn't say the Knicks are in trouble. Like most
Knick fans here, he mentioned a seventh game a few times Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking forward to the challenge,'' Houston said. ``It's
something that, if we win it, people will look at it and say they
can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks are beyond that point now. All the celebrities in
their house _ from John F. Kennedy Jr., to Adam Sandler, to Evander
Holyfield _ know that they are in more trouble now than they have
ever been in the postseason. They haven't been down two games
before. They are now.
</P>
<P>
   They have to figure out a way to control point guard Johnson (14
points, 10 assists). They also have to figure out how to do the
impossible. They have to stop Duncan and Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Late in Jeff Van Gundy's postgame press conference, someone
asked the coach if he had considered using ancient center Herb
Williams to help with Duncan-Robinson. Williams played in six games
all year. Van Gundy said he won't use him ``unless we have extreme
foul trouble.'' That's another way of saying Williams's playing
days are over. And after Friday night, the rest of the Knicks might
be done playing for the summer, too.

DODGERS FINDING MANY WAYS TO LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's reached the level where you can reach into
your bag and pull out a reason du jour as to why the Dodgers lost.
</P>
<P>
   Dismal starting pitching, a lack of clutch hitting or the
inability to manufacture runs come to mind. But those ideas are
running stale.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a new one: The Dodgers lack the ability to shut down
their opponents after scoring themselves. That's what happened in
the fifth inning of a 6-2 loss to the San Diego Padres at Dodger
Stadium on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A night after being shutdown by lefty Sterling Hitchcock, San
Diego right-hander Woody Williams (3-5) silenced the Dodgers on
five hits in eight-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman earned his 17th save after entering the game with
runners on first and second with none out in the ninth. He didn't
allow a run. The Padres have won five in a row while the Dodgers
followed their two-game winning streak with a pair of losses and
counting.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Dodgers (32-37) talked about being a few games
behind the Arizona Diamondbacks in the loss column a few weeks ago,
the Padres (30-38) can talk about being a game behind the Dodgers
in the loss column in the race to climb out of the N.L. West
cellar. If the Padres complete the three-game sweep tonight they
will be tied in losses.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-pressing Dodgers provided a quasi-early lead thanks to
a solo homer by Gary Sheffield and an RBI single from Jose Vizcaino
in the bottom of the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   It lasted two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Ismael Valdes (5-7) breezed through the first
four innings, but as soon as he had some breathing room the Padres
knocked the breath out of him and the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes initiated the problem by walking No. 8 hitter Damian
Jackson with one out and walked leadoff hitter Quilvio Veras with
two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens, starting again in the place of the injured Tony
Gwynn, then hit Valdes next pitch for a homer to left to give the
Padres a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Three pitches later Reggie Sanders homered to left to give the
Padres a 4-2 lead. They were the 18th and 19th homers Valdes
allowed this season as he and Chan Ho Park continue to battle for
the dubious distinction of allowing the most homers on the staff.
Valdes leads by two.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes hasn't been blessed with great run support lately. He's
done just enough to lose while pitching moderately well. His last
win came May 27, which pushed his record to 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   But Valdes has lost a career-high five consecutive games. It's
come in five starts in which he has allowed four earned runs just
once, which happened to be this night. During that span he's
allowed two earned runs twice and three earned runs on a pair of
occasions. In his last five starts Valdes' ERA is 3.63.
</P>
<P>
   Until Todd Hollandsworth and Karros led off the ninth with
singles, the only hits the Dodgers got off Williams came in the
fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield led off the fourth with his 15th homer of the season.
Hollandsworth struck out and Eric Karros hit a nubber in front of
the plate and was thrown out before Devon White doubled to
right-center. Vizcaino then blooped a single to center to score
White and give the Dodgers a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who entered with a three-game losing streak and hadn't
won since May 21, retired 13 of the next 14 batters. Adrian Beltre
was the only Dodger to reach base, and he got there after being
plunked with a pitch with two outs in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes more amazing on a daily basis just how much the
Dodgers can mess things up. After leadoff singles and a pair of
stolen bases put runners on second and third with one out in the
eighth, reliever Jamie Arnold fielded Ruben Rivera's comebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold had any easy throw to home to nab Sanders, but he
stumbled with his footing and threw a one-hopper that went through
catcher Angel Pena's legs. It allowed two runs to score and gave
the Padres a 6-2 lead.

MO ADMITS HE'S NOT BEEN A LEADER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Many of the Anaheim Angels said it Tuesday: ``We've
got our leader back. We haven't had a leader all year.''
</P>
<P>
   They were speaking of shortstop Gary DiSarcina, and it stung Mo
Vaughn. After all, the Angels shelled out $80 million for Vaughn in
large part for his leadership abilities.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn is the first to admit he hasn't really been much of a
leader this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been a leader since. &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; .,'' he said, his voice
trailing off. He was referring to his fall into the visiting dugout
at Edison Field in the first inning on opening night.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting sprained left ankle has limited Vaughn to just 12
starts at first base this season. He started his 44th game at DH
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a leader, you have to be on the field, he said. ``When
you're DH-ing you don't feel a part of what's going on. There's no
way you can. When I get on the field and play both sides of the
ball, I'm going to lead. When you're not on both sides of the ball,
you can't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game flows when you're on the field,'' he said. ``I'm
struggling right now because I'm really frustrated, but I don't
want these guys (teammates) to know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who went into Wednesday's game hitting .271 with a
team-leading 14 homers and 41 RBI, will return to first base Friday
against Oakland at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time, he said. ``If I have to stay in the dugout one more
week, I'm going to break something up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Mariners complete their three-game series tonight
at 7:05. Chuck Finley (4-7, 4.18 ERA) will start for Anaheim
against Seattle's Jeff Fassero (3-7, 7.19).

MARINER'S ANNOUNCEMENT WAS `LIKE RUINING SOMEONE'S WEDDING' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN SNEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The timing looked fishy to Tom Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Mariners fans were in a sentimental mood Monday, with
the ballclub starting the Kingdome's last homestand. And the hype
for a new stadium christening in three weeks was in full gear.
</P>
<P>
   To Phillips, co-founder of DeLaunay/Phillips, a Seattle public
relations firm, the twin events were a harmonic convergence that
prompted Mariners brass to throw a high, hard one at King County
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners owners say $60 million from ballpark tax surpluses
should be used to help offset the $100 million cost overrun of
building the new ballpark, Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mariners seem to be very adept
</P>
<P>
   at picking the time with which they basically put a gun to the
public's head,'' Phillips said when asked to rate the M's public
relations acumen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is sentimental about the last few days of the
Kingdome and the fervor of the new stadium is building and now
we're hearing about their plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Mariners' announcement on Tuesday reopened emotional
wounds left from the volatile political year of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That's when King County voters narrowly rejected a ballpark
sales tax, only to see
</P>
<P>
   state legislators patch together a financing scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable. There's a tendency
</P>
<P>
   to low-ball the cost estimates and grossly overstate the
benefits, and in the end, there isn't a tooth fairy or an Easter
Bunny,'' said Allen Sanderson, a University of Chicago economist
who studies sports facility financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state did a sugarcoated end run to finance the package,
and now the chickens are coming home to roost,'' Sanderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for taxpayers in those situations. `I told you
so' is small consolation when it's your own money.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Wednesday Seattle-area residents vented at the prospect of
forking over more public dollars for North America's most expensive
sports venue.
</P>
<P>
   And many noted the Mariners' pitch taints the excitement of the
days leading to the ballfield's July 15 debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be a big, joyous occasion for baseball fans
_ and the Mariners just ruined it,'' said state Rep. Steve Van
Luven, R-Bellevue, who sponsored the ballpark legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they ruined somebody's wedding. This will go down in
history as one of public relations' biggest blunders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mariners will lose in the court of public opinion and the
court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a spokeswoman for the Public Facilities District, which
owns the $517 million, 45,000-seat ballpark, acknowledged the
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very caught up in the excitement and the race to finish,
but the timing was unfortunate,'' district spokeswoman Kathy
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   A common strategy for teams that are offering unpopular
solutions to politically volatile issues is to time the
announcement during the best possible environment, said Dean
Bonham, a Denver-based sports business consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to capitalize on the opening of the stadium by
telling fans to hold your nose and try to get over the smell of the
money to cover the stadium construction overruns,'' Bonham said.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners board member Howard Lincoln maintained the timing was
not a political maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   The team went public for the first time in months only after it
exhausted behind-the-scenes efforts with PFD members that started
in February, and it learned from the team's lawyers that the
Mariners had a case to ask for the tax surplus, Lincoln said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lincoln said the Mariners did want to announce its mediation
request before the stadium-opening so that fans would not get
attached to the venue, then get the unpopular news.
</P>
<P>
   M's fan Scotty Dagman of Grays Harbor didn't like Lincoln's
stance that the county should issue more bonds to help cover cost
overruns.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't surprised the club would try to make a play for
more public money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know all the angles, all the tricks,'' Dagman said at the
Kingdome before Wednesday's Mariners-Angels game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year from now if the chaos is done and they put a winning
team on the field, it will be tamed. It's the torment you have to
go through.''
</P>
<P>
   But King County Councilman Pete von Reichbauer, R-Federal Way,
said this week's frustration among fans and taxpayers is different
than the emotions expressed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climate has changed. You have season ticket-holders
expressing outrage,'' said von Reichbauer, who voted against the
county's ballpark bond package.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said `enough is enough'
</P>
<P>
   and now they're very angry ... The irony is these were the same
people who three years ago were threatening to vote against me for
``losing baseball.'''
</P>
<P>
   The PFD, which is building the venue and will own the building
on behalf of the public, has kept a low profile in the contract
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our board is paranoid and I'm afraid I'll be in the doghouse
for speaking to you,'' stadium board member Bob Wallace quipped
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he hasn't detected any public outrage, noting the
core issue is whether the PFD is obliged to ask the county to issue
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wallace said fans will be able to separate the legal
dispute from the game on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a political issue. I see it as public
relations issue for everyone connected with baseball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of a new sports venue is a time for euphoria, said
Craig Tartasky, a Maryland-based sports marketing consultant and
chairman of the annual International Sport Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Once fans start enjoying the venue's amenities _ and the team
plays winning and entertaining baseball _ this week's political
anger will start to dissipate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always the feeling among fans that, `I want to be the
person who gets to the stadium.' It's not surprising there's a
reaction to not wanting to pay more for a stadium,'' Tartasky said.
``But in three years, will anyone remember that?''

ANGELS' HILL INJURED IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It hardly qualifies as news, considering the frequency
with which it happens. But that doesn't make the Anaheim Angels
feel any better about it.
</P>
<P>
   Their game against the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night
featured an injury to another key player as the Angels saw the end
of their two-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners beat the Angels 8-3 before 25,087 at the Kingdome,
knocking the Angels 8{ games behind first-place Texas in the AL
West.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, the Angels pitchers had been able to avoid the
injury bug that has plagued the rest of the team. But starting
pitcher Ken Hill, after giving up three runs in the second inning,
didn't make it out for the third.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who had surgery to remove bone chips from the elbow June
15 of last season, had a ``tight right elbow,'' according to team
trainers.
</P>
<P>
   A trip to the disabled list for Hill seems likely and would
require the Angels to find another starter. Mark Petkovsek,
Shigetoshi Hasegawa and Scott Schoeneweis are candidates to leave
the bullpen and join the rotation. But if the Angels decide to go
to the minors, the favorite would be Mike Fyhrie, who is 8-3 with a
3.51 ERA at Triple-A Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's replacement Wednesday _ Mike Magnante _ gave up two runs
in his first inning of work, yielding a two-out, two-run single to
David Bell on an 0-2 pitch in the third.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of clutch hitting the Angels haven't been
getting.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored in the first on Darin Erstad's leadoff homer
(No. 7) and in the fourth on an RBI double by Matt Walbeck.
</P>
<P>
   But they missed opportunities to get back in the game later in
the fourth and again in the fifth. With runners on second and third
with two out in the fourth, Gary DiSarcina grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, the Angels had runners on second and third with
one out, but Todd Greene struck out and Garret Anderson grounded
out. In that inning, Mo Vaughn doubled to center, his first
extra-base hit since a home run on June 12 against Arizona's Andy
Benes. And it was only Vaughn's second extra-base hit in 20 games,
going back to a home run off the Royals' Jose Rosado on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels haven't scored five runs or more in a game since June
6, when the scored seven against the Dodgers, a string of 14
consecutive games. They've now scored four runs or fewer in 25 of
their past 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get some offense, Angels manager Terry Collins
gave outfielder Matt Luke his fourth start since being promoted
from Edmonton on June 13.
</P>
<P>
   For Luke and the Angels, his arrival didn't come soon enough.
While the Angels searched for offense, Luke was trying to recover
from a strained back muscle that caused him to miss 2{ months.
</P>
<P>
   Luke has provided some much-needed punch, taking a .455 average
(5 for 11) with two homers and three RBI into Wednesday's game. His
hot start hasn't surprised him, considering he had some big hits
for the Dodgers last year. He hit 12 homers in 102 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always believed I could play, but last year was a big
stepping stone, confidence-wise,'' said Luke, 28. ``I was a rookie
in there battling. I had 60-some starts and was put into every
pressure situation imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Luke made a big play in the field Tuesday, making a diving catch
in right field for the third out of the eighth inning with the
potential tying run on third base. On Wednesday, he made a catch
while crashing into the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of his injury, in spring training we didn't get a
chance to see enough of him defensively,'' Collins said. ``He's
played good in the outfield, but he hasn't played enough for us to
get a feel for what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Luke hits, it doesn't matter much how he plays the
outfield. And Luke believes he can help if given the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball's a profession which you have to continue to prove
yourself and stay healthy,'' he said. ``When I have both of them
the opportunities will be there. Having confidence is one more
piece to the puzzle, and the hardest piece is believing in your
ability. I have that.''

EMBATTLED KNICKS FALL TO SPURS, WHO NOW LEAD SERIES 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: CHANGES throughout . ) (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A rigid, misplaced jumper by the Knicks' Allan Houston licked
off the rim and bounded up in the air late into a tense night, and
the two 7-foot stars for the San Antonio Spurs popped up like two
cymbals flashing and glinting in the air.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson clamped down on the rebound and embraced the
chance to turn the Knicks' desperate attempt at a fourth-quarter
comeback into an act of futility. By the end, Robinson and Tim
Duncan combined for 35 rebounds to erode the body and spirit of the
Knicks by winning Game 4 of the National Basketball Association
finals, 96-89, Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks left their home floor crestfallen and on the brink of
elimination as the Spurs took a 3-1 lead in the best-of-7 series.
No team has ever come back to win a championship from such a
deficit. The Knicks, a team that has thumbed its nose at bleak
situations all year, will have to win Game 5 Friday night at the
Garden to keep their run toward destiny alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' Houston said. ``This is the ultimate challenge.
Your back can't get any further against the wall at this point,
down, 3-1, in the finals. But you know something? This is something
that you always welcome as a competitor, as an athlete. We're not
hanging our heads down. We're looking forward to the challenge. All
you can do is stay positive and say, `If we win this thing, people
won't believe it.' But they didn't believe we'd be where we are
right now when we were 21-21, either.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would have thought they would be so close Wednesday night
after trailing by 13 points in the third quarter. Somehow, the
Knicks dug deep and scrambled to come within a point with 5 minutes
24 seconds left, and they were down by just 86-84 with 3:40
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   That was all they could do. Standing on wobbly legs, the Knicks
missed their next seven shots while the Spurs remained uncommonly
cool beneath the frenzy of the Garden and took a 94-84 lead with 37
seconds left on the strength of good free-throw shooting by
Robinson and Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   It was over. The core players who had pulled off Game 3 on
Tuesday _ Houston, Latrell Sprewell and Larry Johnson _ had no
impact in the last 3:40. Harassed by double-teams much of the
night, Houston did not have the same feathery touch and finished
with a tough 20 points. Sprewell scored 26 points, but was often
too frantic under pressure and hit just 9 of 22 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't execute well down the stretch,'' Sprewell said. ``We
were stuck on 84 points for what seemed like the longest time.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could help, especially not Johnson. He had worn the
springs in his remaining good knee to the nub and had nothing left
in his body to give. With just five points, Johnson fouled out with
1:14 left and fell into his seat dejected over the Knicks' turn of
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Duncan was relentless. He had 28 points to go
with 18 rebounds, while Robinson scored 14 points and had 17
rebounds around an active Marcus Camby, who finished with 20 points
and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   After having failed to duplicate the impact he had against
Indiana in the conference finals, Camby made a concerted effort to
keep himself on the court and avoid the foul trouble that had
plagued him against David Robinson. He succeeded with 19 minutes of
foul-free effort in the first half, finishing with a lively 10
points and seven rebounds. He was one of four Knick starters with
10 points at halftime, along with Houston, Sprewell and Ward.
</P>
<P>
   But the spindly Camby was no match for the massive and looming
presence of the Twin Towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Size does matter in this league,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said.
``And their size beat our speed and quickness because not only did
they affect us on the boards and in the post, but they affected
everything else. Every penetration was a difficult, difficult
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven blocked shots Robinson and Duncan combined to make was
a testament to that fact. But as tall as they were, the Spurs'
greatest jolt came from its smallest player, point guard Avery
Johnson. The two point guards who had been the most maligned,
Johnson and the Knicks' Charlie Ward, were the two impact players
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Invisible for most of the playoffs, both came on to lead their
teams. Ward scored 11 points, his most in 14 games, while Johnson
drove right back at him for 14 points and had 10 assists. They were
responsible for a close first half, which the Spurs led 50-46. The
Spurs leaned on their defense to start the third quarter and forced
the Knicks to miss their first five shots as they took a 13-point
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just came out of the half and wanted it more,'' Camby
said of the Spurs' third-quarter start. ``We left guys open and
they went on a 9-0 run. From that point, we were playing from
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Spurs were too much to overcome. Houston wasn't there to
save them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just missed shots,'' Houston said. ``I wasn't frustrated. I
wasn't tired. I had some good looks. I just missed shots.''
</P>
<P>
   They Knicks just missed a chance. They were within reach, just a
clawing moment away from turning the whole tone of this series
around. Now, they must try to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it more fun,'' Camby said. ``No one gave us a shot
of making the playoffs. We're all about making history. People
doubted us before, and they're going to doubt us now. We're
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   But they understand what they are up against. Robinson and
Duncan are right there in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have to come in very focused,'' Duncan said. ``We
don't want to give them an opportunity for life. We want to get
this next game and concentrate and be focused and not have to worry
about going back to San Antonio.''

PIPELINE WORKERS INVOKE FIFTH AMENDMENT IN INQUIRY INTO DEADLY
FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELLIS E. CONKLIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLINGHAM, Wash. _ Five Olympic Pipe Line Co. employees have
invoked the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer federal
investigators' questions about the deadly explosion that rocked
this city two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators also revealed on Wednesday that a valve on the
pipeline closed without warning minutes before the rupture, causing
a massive pressure surge on the line. The reason for the closure is
unknown, since system operators did not order it.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the investigators said they have learned that tests on the
pipeline conducted by Olympic more than three years ago revealed
three potential trouble spots in the line, close to the rupture.
</P>
<P>
   The same results were found in testing a year later,
investigators said, but Olympic did not excavate the pipe to check
the spots.
</P>
<P>
   The employees' refusal to assist the National Transportation
Safety Board has stalled progress in determining what caused the
fuel-pipeline rupture, NTSB lead investigator Allan Beshore said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never personally experienced before people exercising
their Fifth Amendment rights,'' Beshore said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the employees, whom Beshore declined to identify, worked
in Olympic's headquarters in Renton. Two of them were pipeline
controllers, another a person who supervised the two controllers.
He did not disclose the duties of the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic Pipe Line officials could not be reached for comment
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Between 13 and 25 minutes before the fiery inferno killed two
10-year-old boys and an 18-year-old fly-fisherman, a valve about 20
miles south from the break closed unexpectedly, investigators said
Wednesday. It is the second valve on the pipeline that apparently
did not function correctly. Last week investigators said a check
valve just one-tenth of a mile from the break ``either
malfunctioned or was not closed in a timely fashion'' after the
rupture, increasing the spill by up to 130,200 gallons.
Investigators now estimate the spill at 277,200 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Beshore said Wednesday that a March 1996 test administered by
Olympic Pipe Line revealed the three potential trouble points,
including a .4-inch ``defect'' that is thought to be within a few
feet of the rupture, but that won't be known for certain until the
damaged pipe is at last unearthed - perhaps as early as Friday or
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of that defect, which investigators believe may have
been a gouge or dent, was to thin the pipeline wall by 23 percent.
Apparently, Beshore said, Olympic Pipe Line officials took no
action because the gouge was so small.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're currently looking into that,'' Beshore said, declining
to elaborate further.
</P>
<P>
   With the use of an internal detection device called a smart pig,
the pipeline company also found two other ``anomalies'' in the line
near the eventual rupture. One was termed a ``wrinkle,'' which
means the line may have been bent or buckled. the other was a
``mash,'' or a dent possibly caused by something pushing down on
it.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the discovery of the irregularities in the
pipeline, Norm Stanley, an Olympic spokesman said, ``We have no
idea whether to be concerned with this yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Beshore said the NTSB will want to `` look at the accuracy of
that inspection device.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the 23 percent reduction in the pipeline wall was
alarming, Beshore said, ``That would weaken a spot in the pipe.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic Pipe Line also inspected the same section of line in
1997 and found the same problems.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Batten, a former NTSB pipeline accident investigator for
23 years, expressed concern over the Olympic Pipe Line inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen, I would have to ask why the pipe wasn't
excavated for inspection,'' Batten said. ``They said it was too
small (the .4-inch gouge), but one needs to ask what their criteria
they used to make this decision (not to dig up the damaged line).''
</P>
<P>
   Beshore said the Olympic employees were subpoenaed after
rebuffing NTSB's demands for an interview. Two of the employees
quickly invoked the Fifth Amendment to protect themselves from
self-incrimination, while the other three had their lawyers do it
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he has asked the U.S. Attorney's Office to
intervene, Beshore said after a long pause, ``I'd rather not get
into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the assistance of the employees in question,
Beshore said NTSB investigator will eventually be able to recreate
what happened on the system. But he added, the investigation is a
long way from completion. It may take six to nine months. In the
interim, ``this is not a criminal investigation,'' Beshore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline continued to seep Wednesday from a small spot on the
hillside into Whatcom Creek, near the water treatment plant. The
gasoline is being contained using absorbent pads, booms and
skimmers. The city of Bellingham asked again Wednesday that people
stay away from Whatcom Falls Park for safety reasons. Officials
estimated Wednesday that cleanup expenses have exceeded $2.4
million.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ST. LOUIS _ Entering Wednesday night, the Astros were trying to
avoid their first series sweep at Busch Stadium in nearly three
years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Worse, they could feel the Cincinnati Reds breathing down their
necks.
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 8-4 before a
rain-soaked crowd of 36,402 at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, only 13-13 against National League Central teams,
begin an important four-game series today at the Astrodome with the
second-place Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett and Bill Spiers each drove in two runs for the
Astros, who haven't been swept at Busch since Sept. 2-4, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get swept on the road, especially in your
division,'' Everett said. ``We're only .500 against our division.
We need to salvage all the games we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiers, Derek Bell, Craig Biggio and Tony Eusebio had two hits
each for the Astros, who are 5-5 in manager Larry Dierker's
absence.
</P>
<P>
   After a 1-hour, 52-minute rain delay, the Astros wasted no time
against Cardinals starter Juan Acevedo, scoring two runs in the
first inning and two in the third. With two outs in the first, Jeff
Bagwell walked, Bell singled and Everett drilled a two-run double
into the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio led off the third with a single, advanced to second on a
grounder by Spiers and took third on a wild pitch. Bagwell singled
up the middle to put the Astros up 3-0, and Richard Hidalgo added
an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the Astros' eight runs came with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our situational hitting was a lot better,'' interim
manager Matt Galante said. ``We're a free-swinging team that is
going to strike out a bunch. That's the kind of players we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have good days, we're able to score a bunch of runs.
When we have a bad day, we leave men stranded.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had 12 hits Wednesday after combining for 16 in the
first two games of the series. They batted .243 in the series and
struck out 29 times. The Astros lead the majors with 528
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds cruised through five innings before allowing two
home runs that brought the Cardinals to within 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Powell pitched two scoreless innings of relief and Trever
Miller closed it out, ending the game with two strikeouts. Galante
said it was important for Reynolds to pitch deep into the game
after the entire bullpen worked in Tuesday's 14-inning loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing was we were able to get through with thin
pitching,'' Galante said. ``Last night took a lot of pitching out
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis fell one game below .500 and 7{ games behind Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire went 3-for-5 with an RBI for the Cardinals, and Joe
McEwing extended his hitting streak to 15 games with a one-out
single in the third inning. On the play, Everett slipped on the wet
grass and appeared to jerk his neck. He was attended to on the
field and remained in the game until the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who delivered the game-winning hit Tuesday, singled
past Spiers at third base to make the score 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis caught a lucky bounce in the fourth. After a leadoff
single by Willie McGee, Edgar Renteria bunted to the right side and
Eusebio's throw ricochetted off Renteria's hand and struck
first-base umpire Gerry Davis above the left eye. Davis left the
game but later returned.
</P>
<P>
   Placido Polanco sliced the lead to two runs with an RBI ground
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds escaped potential disaster in the fifth. After a
leadoff single by McEwing, Reynolds struck out Darren Bragg and got
McGwire to fly out to right field. Ray Lankford singled to put
runners at the corners, but Reynolds struck out McGee.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros pushed lead back to four, 6-2, in the sixth courtesy
of three walks and two singles, and Spiers singled in a pair in the
eighth.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ Their last time out, the Twin Towers of David Robinson
and Tim Duncan were just a couple of nondescript big buildings on
the famous New York skyline.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, they stood taller than the skyscrapers of the
World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   The last time they hit the floor at Madison Square Garden, the
supporting cast of the Spurs was like that old saying about there
being a broken heart for every light bulb on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, the likes of Mario Elie, Avery Johnson and Sean
Elliott played like their names belonged in neon on the marquee.
</P>
<P>
   These were once again the Spurs who had devoured the shortened
NBA season like a plateful of hors d'oeuvres.
</P>
<P>
   They were alive. They were aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, following Wednesday night's 96-89 victory over the Knicks,
they are back in control of the NBA Finals and one win away from
capturing their first championship.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anybody have expected anything different from a team
that has treated defeat like a trampoline all year long and always
bounced back bigger and stronger than ever?
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone think that these Spurs, who have not lost
back-to-back games in nearly four months, would suddenly come
unwound after just one emotional effort by the home team in Madison
Square Garden?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since we got ourselves together at the end of February
and went on a roll, we have always made a point of responding
strong to a loss,'' Robinson said. ``When we've lost games, we've
gotten together, we've talked, we've refocused and we've taken care
of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody did more business in Game 4 than the two-headed monster
of Duncan and Robinson. Duncan used his fundamentally sound
footwork and a quick drop step to hit a steady diet of bankers to
finish with 28 points and 18 rebounds. Robinson did most of his
offensive damage simply by making himself available around the hoop
and cleaning up all of the Garden, collecting 14 points to go with
his 17 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   That's 35 rebounds between them, one more than the entire roster
of the Knicks, who this time couldn't quite match the emotion and
the fever pitch and the magic that carried them in the previous
game.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson, the talkative little point guard, wasn't darting
into the lane for driving shots or setting up teammates with his 10
assists, the combo of Duncan and Robinson was always around to
cover up San Antonio mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   When Elie wasn't responding from a personal failure in Game 3
right here in his hometown with one of his classic Junkyard Dog
efforts, pouring in half of his 18 points in the third quarter
alone as the Spurs took control, then the two big men were around
to keep balls and their team alive.
</P>
<P>
   When Elliott, who had been so quiet, so rarely heard from in the
first three games, wasn't hitting big fourth-quarter shots, it was
Robinson and Duncan always there to bail the Spurs out.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and Robinson. Or Robinson and Duncan. The billing doesn't
really matter when they are clubbing you over the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``When those two guys have got it going like that, they are
virtually unstoppable,'' said Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy. ``When
they outrebound us by themselves, when we get beat on the boards
like we did (49-34), well, you're not going to win a Finals game.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet New York had its chance with just over five minutes left in
the game and Charlie Ward at the line for two free throws. He made
just one, and the Knicks, who had a chance to tie, stayed behind
81-80 and never could climb over the hump.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson came back with a hook in the lane. Duncan went down
onto the blocks on the right side of the hoop and connected on
another one of his bankers. When the Knicks missed seven straight
shots, it seemed that either Duncan or Robinson was there to
rebound every one.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have had an unlikely and often messy run through the
playoffs and into the Finals, filled with soap-opera elements of
coaching intrigue, management backstabbing and player unrest. It
has also given rise, maybe, to the next great scorer in the league
in Allan Houston. But after carrying the day with 34 points Monday
night, Houston was limited to 20 and shot only 7-for-18.
</P>
<P>
   Open shots were harder to come by. The Spurs' Twin Towers were
always lurking, blocking seven shots between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels so good to have responded like this again after a
game the last time that didn't make any of us happy,'' Robinson
said. ``This is the way we wanted to play then, and this is how we
have to play on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the stage that Robinson has wanted to play on for 10
years in the NBA. Now the curtain rises on his big night in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim was just Tim,'' said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. ``He has
been so dependable, so strong all year. But I'm so glad for David.
He's a guy who has had to respond to all of the criticism through
the years and performed so well this year when a lot of people said
he couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and Robinson. Or Robinson and Duncan. Two big standouts
in the Manhattan skyline.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ The Knicks had it all going again. They might have been
outclassed and outmanned by a bigger, better, healthier team. But
there they were, in great shape for a stretch run. They made
highlight plays on desire. The Madison Square Garden crowd screamed
its throats raw. The faith in magic expressed on nearly 20,000 ``I
Still Believe'' T-shirts seemed real.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Spurs, however, had no use for magic and other such romantic
nonsense. Instead, they believed in free throws and rebounding, in
size and defense.
</P>
<P>
   If that might be dull, as it has been labeled, then the NBA can
have more committee meetings. The Spurs might just settle for the
league championship after a 96-89 victory in Game 4 of the NBA
Finals on Wednesday put them one win away from their first title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we did anything amazing on the offensive end,''
Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ``But we did make free throws, and
we made stops.''
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by 13, the Knicks at one point got within one.
And with four minutes left, after a Marcus Camby slam for a
three-point play, they were within three.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs simply stepped up their defense, refused to allow
the Knicks more than one long, tough jumper per trip downcourt and
made enough simple, dull free throws to take a 3-1 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the magic the Knicks seem to have whenever needed,
no team has ever come back from a 3-1 hole in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to come in very focused the next game and get it out
of the way,'' said Spurs forward Tim Duncan, who turned in game
highs of 28 points and 18 rebounds. ``We don't want to give them
any opportunity for life. We just want to knock them out.''
</P>
<P>
   They might have knocked most of the remaining life from the
Knicks by physically outmanning them inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, however, will not concede anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win this thing, people won't believe it,'' New York
guard Allan Houston said. ``But they wouldn't believe it when we
were 21-21 that we would be where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they might be running out of reasons to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs outrebounded the Knicks with a 31-16 second-half
blitz. By themselves, Duncan and David Robinson outrebounded the
Knicks 35-34, with Robinson getting nearly as many offensive
rebounds, nine, as the entire Knicks team (10) and blocking twice
as many shots, four, as the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to say David and Tim were outstanding and really took
it to heart as far as rebounding the basketball,'' Popovich said.
``David was just a monster. I'm so happy for him. He showed people
what he could do when a lot of people counted him out for reasons
I'm still trying to figure out. And Tim really has a knack for the
boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan finished as strongly Wednesday as he had played poorly
down the stretch in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be more effective in the fourth quarter,'' Duncan
said. ``I knew I didn't play well in the fourth quarter (on
Monday). Even if it wasn't scoring, I wanted to throw out of the
double teams and make them pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a very good team down the stretch. We developed
that through experience. We make plays down the stretch. That was
the big thing in Game 3 we knew we didn't do. We really
concentrated on that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Camby dunk on, the Knicks missed their next seven
shots, never getting close to the lane. The Spurs didn't need to
shoot. They made eight of 10 free throws in the final minutes to
put the game away easily.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Elie dropped in the final two free throws to give him a
series-best 18 points, thoroughly reversing his homecoming disaster
in Game 3 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell had 26 points for the Knicks. Houston added 20
but made just seven of 18 shots. As a team, the Knicks were
15-of-42 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Knicks managed, as they have throughout their
postseason run, to do just enough to stay in range, and 2{ minutes
into the fourth quarter they were within five.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and Robinson each scored off offensive rebounds, and Elie
got loose for a fast break. But the Knicks stayed on the Spurs'
heels, pulling out the precise formula that had lifted them to the
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell made a flying tip-in of a Charlie Ward miss, then broke
loose for a fast break, forcing Duncan to foul and give up two
points. And when Houston swished a fadeaway, the Knicks had a 6-0
run, pulling them within 81-79 with 5:39 left. They even moved
within one on a Ward free throw.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Garden crowd rocking again and the Knicks waving
their arms and running the floor as they had not since the Eastern
Conference finals, the Spurs suddenly found themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson hit a jump hook with 5:09 left, his first field goal of
the second half, to stop the Knicks' run. Duncan hit another, his
first field goal since shortly after halftime, and Robinson added a
layup. And the Spurs choked the life from the Knicks' offense,
never allowing them another chance to shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was just great down the stretch,'' Elie said.
``When we had to make stops, we made them. Our big guys did a great
job eating the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Knicks could not defeat that with blind faith and a few
miracle, off-balance shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Size does matter in this league,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy
said. ``It does, particularly in the playoffs. Their size beat our
speed and quickness. Not only did they (Duncan and Robinson) affect
us on the boards and post scoring, every penetration was a
difficult, difficult shot. Those guys are great, great players.''
</P>
<P>
   Too great to beat, it would seem. No matter what the Knicks tell
themselves they believe.

TWIN TOWERS POINT SPURS TOWARD NBA TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All you need to know about Wednesday night is movie
director and Knicks maniac Spike Lee's mouth seemed wired shut. He
was too unflappable in his courtside seat.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news if you are Knicks fan.
</P>
<P>
   The envelope for best team in the 1999 NBA season is close to
being opened, and the Knicks suddenly seem like Lee at the Oscars:
Waiting to applaud the original favorite who eventually won.
</P>
<P>
   That is the case following San Antonio's 96-89 Game 4 victory
against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. The Spurs lead the
best-of-seven NBA Finals 3-1, and are just one win from winning
their first championship.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio can also become the first former ABA team to win a
title with a win here Friday in Game 5. No team has ever recovered
from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   After shaking off a Game 3 defeat, the Spurs are well aware of
Finals history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely don't want to give them any opportunity for
life. ... It's a one-game thing,'' Spurs center Tim Duncan said.
``We just want to knock them out.''
</P>
<P>
   This series has been about the Knicks' difficulty in climbing
the deeper Spurs and their two 7-footers. It was the same story
Wednesday for New York, which got pummeled inside by the Spurs'
Duncan and David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   They combined for 42 points, 35 rebounds and 7 blocked shots.
Duncan and Robinson shut down the lane in the final five minutes,
making the Knicks' fourth-quarter comeback attempt a feeble one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Size does matter in this league,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy
said. ``It does. And particularly in the playoffs. And their size
beat our speed and quickness because not only did they affect us on
the boards and the post scoring, but every penetration was a
difficult, difficult shot.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two words that now describe the Knicks' chances:
Difficult and improbable. Though the Knicks made history by
becoming the first eighth seed to reach the Finals, they must win
Friday, and two games at San Antonio to create more.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it more fun,'' said Knicks center Marcus Camby, who
started for the second straight game. ``When we were 21-21, no one
gave us a shot at making the playoffs. Probably none of you guys
thought we'd be in the Finals. We're all about making history.
People doubted us before, they're going to doubt us now.''
</P>
<P>
   And with good reason if Duncan and Robinson continue to have
such a strong say.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, they outrebounded the Knicks, who at a team grabbed 34
rebounds. Robinson was the biggest force. He finished with four
blocks _ two more than New York had _ and nine offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going after jump shots, ``we made them come into the
paint,'' Robinson said. ``We challenged their layups, their dunks.
It's great when you make a block (and) convert on the other end.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan said he could see the Knicks wilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of heartbreaking for them every time (Robinson)
was able to tip one in,'' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about it the whole series. We know they go
to the offensive boards hard and we know we have some studs to get
to our offensive boards.''
</P>
<P>
   New York, though, never gave up.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks fought back from a 13-point deficit in the second
half. They could have tied the score or taken a lead twice with
five minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But each time, the Spurs got big baskets from Duncan or
Robinson. It was a Robinson jumper followed by Duncan's hook shot
that extended the Spurs' 81-80 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 86-84, Mario Elie and Robinson each made two free throws.
Sean Elliott's pair of free throws with 57.6 seconds left put the
Spurs ahead 92-84 and iced the victory.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Allan Houston _ the hero in Game 3 _ did not have a
basket in the final five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just missed some shots,'' Houston said. ``I wasn't
frustrated. I wasn't tired. I had some good looks. I made those
shots most the time I took them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' last lead was 39-38 with six minutes left in the
second. San Antonio took a 50-46 lead into halftime and distanced
itself at the start of the third with a 9-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' 72-63 advantage, which they took into the fourth
quarter, was their biggest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Houston and Camby each scored 20 points. Sprewell had 26. But
the Spurs finished with better scoring balance. All five San
Antonio starters scored 14 points or more.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps none were bigger than Avery Johnson's 14 points and 10
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the guy who makes us feel like we've got coordination on
every possession. He's the man for us,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich
said of Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams shot the ball well and played to their strengths
early. The Knicks ran up and down the floor, scoring off
fastbreaks. San Antonio re-established its inside game with Duncan
and Robinson overpowering whomever New York put in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that had to do with the emergence of the point guards.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' Charlie Ward was effective early, igniting
fastbreaks and finding teammates for easy baskets. Johnson
countered when he got his running left-handed hook shot to fall in
the first quarter. He also set up Duncan and Robinson deep in the
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to break down their defense,'' Johnson said.
``Sometimes I gave into (the Knicks') pressure. I wanted to be a
little more aggressive and if I didn't score that meant we were
going to get offensive rebounds, and David had nine of them.''
</P>
<P>
   An important number in Game 4. Now the magic number is one.

HALAMA ENDS M'S SKID; UNIT TRADE LOOKING BETTER AND BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ While the Mariners conduct their Kingdome countdown
this week _ just four days left inside on plastic grass _ the
Anaheim Angels have been running their own tally.
</P>
<P>
   Lost starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they're 2-for-2. On Tuesday, the Angels' Steve Sparks
went out after three innings with a badly swollen right ring
finger. Wednesday night, Anaheim's Ken Hill was lifted after two
frames, experiencing tightness in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, it's unclear which will disappear first, the Angel
pitching staff or the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Taking full advantage of this hardship, the Mariners made their
four-game losing skid evaporate, beating their shorthanded visitors
8-3 before a crowd of 25,087.
</P>
<P>
   The home club has had no such problem filling the mound this
series. One leg of the Randy Johnson deal has followed another in
impressive fashion, making that 11-month-old trade look better each
week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, rookie Freddy Garcia tossed seven shutout innings
before losing his touch in a 4-2 defeat to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, fellow rook John Halama (6-2) turned in six solid
innings. Though hit around at times, the 24-year-old lefty from
Brooklyn continued to show remarkable poise, keeping the damage to
a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, Halama and Garcia are 14-6, while the Big Unit is
off to a 9-3 start in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the point,'' Mariner manager Lou Piniella said of
the record comparison. ``The point is the organization went out and
made a trade a lot of people frowned on. To their credit, these two
young guys have held up to their end of the bargain real well.''
</P>
<P>
   In his sixth Mariners start, Halama got out of serious trouble
in the fourth and fifth innings, leaving runners on second and
third each time. He was pulled after 96 pitches, his legs tired and
holding a comfortable 6-2 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up six hits, walked two and struck out six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've felt comfortable all year,'' Halama said. ``Now it's just
a matter of doing it every five days instead of coming out of the
bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing up, Frankie Rodriguez, just back from a rotation
stint, went the final three innings, allowing one run on four hits.
He earned a save and Piniella plaudits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked the way Rodriguez threw out of the bullpen,''
said Piniella, who has been desperate for another setup man. ``His
arm bounces back real well.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rodriguez, ``It was a good lift for me and the team. We've
been taking some shots lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wilson backed the Mariners' offensive effort with three
hits, Brian Hunter had three RBIs and the club went its third game
without a home run, a season high.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, Anaheim was left wondering how long starter
Chuck Finley will last Thursday. His rotation mates, Sparks and
Hill, faced just 11 Mariners batters each in the previous two
evenings, forcing heavy bullpen use for Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Hill had no trouble in the first inning. He retired the Mariners
1-2-3, not permitting a ball to leave the infield. He had a 1-0
lead, thanks to teammate Darin Erstad's leadoff home run on the
fifth pitch of the game. He used 13 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Anaheim's veteran right-hander started to wobble,
his inning extended by a defensive lapse. Hill gave up a single to
Edgar Martinez, walked Butch Huskey and, after a flyout, walked
David Bell to load the bases. Wilson singled sharply to left,
bringing home Martinez to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Davis grounded one to third, where Angels rookie Troy Glaus
cleanly gloved the ball and _ nothing happened. Glaus glanced to
second and to first. Each time, he held the ball. Glaus was charged
with an error, Davis was safe at first, even after stumbling as he
left the plate, and a run scored, putting the Mariners ahead 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   To rub salt in it, the next batter, Hunter, hit a high chopper
to Glaus, who again caught the ball but had no chance to make a
throw. Another run scored.
</P>
<P>
   Hill got a double-play grounder from Alex Rodriguez to end the
mess, but that would be his last pitch. The right-hander, who has
had arm surgery in the past, flies home to California Thursday to
receive more extensive medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny's arm tightened up on him, and I wanted to get him out
of there,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``There are going to
be days it doesn't feel good, and tonight was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Make that two of them.

   SEATTLE _ Sergei Khrushchev, whose father ruled the Soviet Union
and its Communist Party during the height of the Cold War with the
United States, on Wednesday passed the examination to become a U.S.
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev and his wife, Valentina Golenko, successfully
completed the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
examination in Providence, R.I., said Dan Danilov, their
Seattle-based immigration attorney, who was with them for the
20-question test.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will take the oath to become naturalized citizens July
12,'' Danilov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It marks a remarkable turn of events, especially considering
that it was his father who told the United States, `We will bury
you,' and had the economic and military power to make that a
credible threat at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev's father, Nikita Khrushchev, ruled the Soviet Union
from 1953 until he was deposed in 1964, two years after he and
President John F. Kennedy squared off in the Cuban Missile Crisis
that brought the world to the brink of nuclear conflict. Nikita
Khrushchev died Sept. 11, 1971, in virtual isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Khrushchev, 63, a senior research scholar and lecturer at
Brown University's Center for Foreign Policy Development in
Providence, is a rocket engineer and computer scientist who once
headed the Soviet Missile Design Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   He has published his father's memoirs and other books, including
several about how leaders of powerful nations make dangerous
mistakes because of misperceptions of their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Valentina Golenko, 50, who is also a scientist, got 100 percent
of the INS citizenship questions correct and Sergei Khrushchev got
95 percent correct, Danilov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed one question on what form of government is the United
States,'' Khrushchev said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He responded, `executive,' meaning `Legislative, executive and
judiciary,' but the answer they wanted was `democracy,''' Danilov
said. ``He had enough correct answers to pass anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife said she has been studying a 10-volume history of the
United States to prepare for the test.
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev said he felt obligated to become a citizen after
living here for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be good citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kane at the INS press office in Washington, D.C., said
the agency is barred from commenting on the tests.

DODGERS FINDING MANY WAYS TO LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's to the point where you can reach into a bag
and grab a reason du jour as to why the Los Angeles Dodgers lost.
</P>
<P>
   Dismal starting pitching, a lack of clutch hitting, disinterest
or the inability to manufacture runs have been used, so here's a
less-investigated reason that does just fine: Too many times the
Dodgers score, only for the opposition to counter with runs in the
next half-inning.
</P>
<P>
   As much as a lack of hitting and nonexistent intensity could be
blamed for the Dodgers' 6-2 loss to San Diego at Dodger Stadium on
Wednesday, so could starter Ismael Valdes for allowing four runs in
the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-pressing Dodgers provided a quasi-early lead with a
solo homer by Gary Sheffield and an RBI single from Jose Vizcaino
in the bottom of the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   It lasted two outs.
</P>
<P>
   The moment Valdes (5-7) had room to breathe, the Padres knocked
the breath out of him. Eric Owens, starting again in the place of
the injured Tony Gwynn, hit a homer to left to give the Padres a
3-2 lead. However, it came after Valdes walked No.8 hitter Damian
Jackson with one out and light-hitting Quilvio Veras with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of walks to the little guys killed (Valdes),''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``Fastball middle in (to
Owens). If you're looking to drive the ball, that's what you want.
I got more upset about walking the little guys in front.''
</P>
<P>
   Three pitches after Owens homered, Reggie Sanders did the same
to give the Padres a 4-2 lead. They were the 18th and 19th homers
hit off Valdes this season as he and Chan Ho Park battle for the
dubious distinction of allowing the most on the staff. Valdes leads
by two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't surprise me,'' Valdes said of the homers. ``I'm
making bad pitches. It's frustrating ... it's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes hasn't been blessed with great run support lately, but
he's done enough to lose while pitching moderately well. His last
win came May 27, which pushed his record to 5-2. But he is on a
career-high five-game losing streak in which he's allowed four
earned runs just once, which happened to be Wednesday night. During
that span his ERA is 3.63.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, it's different,'' Valdes said. ``Things are not
working out. It's one thing or another. I make bad pitches and cost
us games. I don't know what to say. This is a tough year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have won five in a row. The Dodgers followed their
two-game winning streak with two losses and counting.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Dodgers (32-37) talked about being a few games
behind the Arizona Diamondbacks in the loss column a few weeks ago
despite playing poorly, the last-place Padres (30-38) can talk
about being one game behind the Dodgers. If the Padres complete the
three-game sweep tonight they will be tied in losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't getting to be a whole lot of fun here,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, it been brutal, right up to the Padres' Woody
Williams (3-5) being the latest to stuff the Dodgers' supposed
dangerous offense.
</P>
<P>
   Until Todd Hollandsworth and Eric Karros led off the ninth with
singles, the only hits the Dodgers got off Williams came in the
fourth inning. Sheffield led off with his 15th homer of the season
and Vizcaino had a bloop single to give the Dodgers a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who hadn't won since May 21, retired 13 of the next 14
batters, another reason why the Dodgers are 13th in the 16-team
National League in runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're out there pitching and you see their lineup, you
know if you relax they're going to put a hurtin' on you,'' Williams
said. ``We went through that. It takes one game and guys will be
confident and go out and you think you can win. That's what
happened with us.''
</P>
<P>
   It leaves Johnson constantly shuffling the lineup to find
answers that might not be around. Today's attempt will be to rest
Adrian Beltre, who's 0 for 10 since moving to the second spot in
the order, and start the left-handed hitting Dave Hansen at third.

HILL INJURED IN ANGELS' LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It hardly qualifies as news, considering the frequency
with which it happens. But that doesn't make the Anaheim Angels
feel any better about it.
</P>
<P>
   Their game against the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night
featured an injury to another key player as the Angels failed to
extend a winning streak to three games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners beat the Angels 8-3 before 25,087 at the Kingdome,
knocking the visitors 8{ games behind first-place Texas in the AL
West.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, the Angels pitchers had been able to avoid the
injury bug that has plagued the rest of the team. But starting
pitcher Ken Hill, after giving up three runs in the second inning,
didn't make it out for the third.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who had surgery to remove bone chips from the elbow June
15 of last season, had a tight right elbow, according to team
trainers. Hill will return to Anaheim this morning to have the
elbow examined by team medical director Dr. Lewis Yocum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's serious,'' said Hill (3-7), who gave up
three runs and three hits in two innings and was the losing
pitcher. ``Last year it was worse. I tried to get through the
(second) inning, but that was enough. You could see I was erratic.
My ball was everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he felt the tightness in the elbow even before the
game started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got arthritis in there,'' he said. ``It's something I've
had. When it flares up, I'm in trouble. It's a day-to-day thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a major elbow operation, there are going to be days it
doesn't feel real good and today was one of those days,'' Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``If he's only going to miss a start,
then we'll make adjustments. But I'm not going to think about that
until I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   A missed start for Hill would require the Angels to find a
temporary replacement, which would probably be reliever Shigetoshi
Hasegawa. But if Hill needs to go to the disabled list, the Angels
would likely go to the minors to find a replacement. The favorite
would be Mike Fyhrie, who is 8-3 with a 3.51 ERA at Triple-A
Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's replacement Wednesday _ Mike Magnante _ gave up two runs
in his first inning of work, yielding a two-out, two-run single to
David Bell on an 0-2 pitch in the third. It was the kind of clutch
hitting the Angels haven't been getting.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored in the first on Darin Erstad's leadoff homer
(No. 7) and in the fourth on an RBI double by Matt Walbeck.
</P>
<P>
   But they missed opportunities to get back in the game later in
the fourth and again in the fifth. With runners on second and third
with two out in the fourth, Gary DiSarcina grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, the Angels had runners on second and third with
one out, but Todd Greene struck out and Garret Anderson grounded
out. In that inning, Mo Vaughn doubled to center, his first
extra-base hit since a home run on June 12 against Arizona's Andy
Benes. And it was only Vaughn's second extra-base hit in 20 games,
going back to a home run off the Royals' Jose Rosado on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels haven't scored five runs or more in a game since June
6, when the scored seven against the Dodgers, a string of 14
consecutive games. They've now scored four or fewer runs in 25 of
their past 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get some offense, Collins gave outfielder Matt
Luke his fourth start since being promoted from Edmonton on June
13.
</P>
<P>
   For Luke and the Angels, his arrival didn't come soon enough.
While the Angels searched for offense, Luke was trying to recover
from a strained back muscle that caused him to miss 2{ months.
</P>
<P>
   Luke has provided some much-needed punch, taking a .455 average
(5 for 11) with two homers and three RBI into Wednesday's game. His
hot start hasn't surprised him, considering he had some big hits
for the Dodgers last year. He hit 12 homers in 102 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always believed I could play, but last year was a big
stepping stone, confidence-wise,'' said Luke, who went 1 for 4
Wednesday, including an RBI single. ``I was a rookie in there
battling. I had 60-some starts and was put into every pressure
situation imaginable.''

GOP REVEALS HIGH-TECH MANIFESTO
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans unveiled their ``e-Contract with
High Tech'' Wednesday, declaring that they, not Vice President Al
Gore and his fellow Democrats, are the true friends of Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Republican majority will keep the Internet free _ count
on it,'' promised Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La. ``With this e-Contract,
we are telling this nation that we will stand at the door to the
Internet in front of all those in this administration who think
they can put their greedy, grubby hands on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-Contract is the GOP's most overt pitch yet to the
high-tech community and perhaps the strongest proof yet of the
industry's growing clout in Washington. It essentially compiles
existing GOP bills _ many of which have Democratic support _ into
one top-priority package.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled on the Republicans' Contract with America, the 10-point
tax-and-welfare-cutting agenda that ushered in their House majority
in 1994, the e-Contract promises to ``ensure that high-tech America
has the freedom it needs to innovate, grow, expand and imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insisted that they will clear the way for the
industry to ``create wealth'' and accused Democrats of stifling the
growth of the New Economy through taxes, regulations, subsidies and
antitrust suits.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats derided the effort as a craven appeal for campaign
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about money and sticking their hands into the pockets
of high tech,'' said House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders proved Wednesday that they intend to play
hardball, provoking a direct showdown with the White House over
legislation to limit lawsuits related to the Y2K computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP leadership announced that the House will move to a quick
vote on the Senate version of the bill and send it directly to the
White House, skipping a House-Senate conference at which the
administration had hoped to negotiate further compromises.
</P>
<P>
   Gore urged President Clinton to veto the bill unless Republicans
make concessions, and even though the White House Wednesday
reiterated its veto threat, Republicans were undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to overcome (Gore's) objections, we want to beat
his objections,'' said Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas. ``The Y2K bill
represents a dichotomy between two major political parties. We're
saying we're on the side of the engineers who create wealth, and
the vice president has put himself on the side of the lawyers who
want to redistribute it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bill is a top priority for Silicon Valley manufacturers
who fear getting hit by a wave of lawsuits stemming from computers
that are not properly programmed to deal with the year 2000 date.
Gore's office has said the legislation is ``overreaching and not
protecting American consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   By refusing further compromises on Y2K, which has support from a
dozen Senate Democrats, including California's Dianne Feinstein,
Republicans are hoping to drive a wedge between Democrats and
Silicon Valley just as the presidential race is heating up.
</P>
<P>
   The new e-Contract reflects just how seriously Republicans are
taking Democratic inroads into what they consider their natural,
pro-business constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda, outlined on Armey's Web site at www.freedom.gov,
includes virtually all Silicon Valley's legislative priorities,
from looser computer export and encryption controls to a permanent
research and development tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda also calls for more vague efforts such as
``modernizing the education system,'' ``reining in excessive
regulation from federal agencies,'' ``allowing high-speed Internet
access to flourish'' and protecting intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said Republicans will push the legislation with the same
intensity that drove their original Contract with America, much of
which was passed into law, including a  &LR; major welfare reform and
restrictions on securities litigation, another high-tech priority
that remains the only Clinton veto that Congress overrode.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also touted their high-tech record so far _ much
of which passed with broad Democratic support _ including a
three-year moratorium on Internet taxes, an increase in immigration
visas for skilled workers and a bill that partially deregulated
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Their enthusiasm toward a laissez-faire approach to high-tech
has so far been confined to commerce, however, as Republicans have
been much more aggressive in attempting to regulate online content.
Republicans have backed legislation that, for instance, would
impose criminal penalties on commercial Web sites that allow anyone
17 or under to access pornographic material deemed ``harmful to
minors,'' and require Internet service providers to provide
information on filtering software to block salacious content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our measures were designed to let the high-tech industry
continue to thrive without the three biggest drags on innovation:
big government, trial lawyers and big labor,'' Armey said in policy
memo.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech industry associations, which have tried to avoid
entanglement in Washington's partisan wars, warmly welcomed the
e-Contract, but they were careful to note that they hoped for a
``bipartisan'' effort and pledged to ``work closely with both sides
of the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry lobbyists also warned Republicans that the showdown
with the White House on the Y2K bill would doom the legislation and
be a disaster to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 Coalition, which includes the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and a host of
high-tech trade groups, wrote in a letter to the GOP, ``We are
convinced that if such a bill were vetoed, the momentum to
legislate on this important matter would be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups wrote that a veto ``would be viewed as a complete
failure and would pose substantial risk to the American economy.''

 GORE SWEEPS INTO CALIFORNIA AS A CONTENDER  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On his first swing through California as a
declared presidential contender, Vice President Al Gore received an
enthusiastic standing ovation Wednesday night at the San Francisco
Hilton from about 600 supporters who had paid $1,000 each to hear
him stress improving schools, the economy and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore began his 57th trip to California _ which was expected to
raise nearly $1 million in a state crucial to his fortunes _ in the
exclusive San Diego community of La Jolla with a campaign lunch
Wednesday that raised $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   At last night's dinner in San Francisco, California Gov. Gray
Davis introduced Gore, saying, ``The vice president cares about
California, and he has come through time and time again for this
state. It is time for California to come through for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Bill Lockyer, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown,
mayoral candidate Clint Reilly, former White House Chief of Staff
Leon Panetta and developer Walter Shorenstein were among local
dignitaries who attended the dinner of grilled chicken, mashed
potatoes and white chocolate mousse.
</P>
<P>
   In both La Jolla and San Francisco, Gore stressed improving
California schools, building a strong economy and protecting the
environment. But he hit particularly hard on gun control. ``We have
to make sure the agenda for America's future is set by the American
people and not the NRA,'' he told the San Francisco audience to
enthusiastic applause.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing to distance himself from President Clinton, Gore said
in San Francisco: ``It is time for a clean start in a fresh
century. ... I want to keep the prosperity going and make some
dramatic and indeed revolutionary changes.'' In a theme he had
repeated throughout the day, Gore also stressed ``my own values of
faith and family.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles Thursday, Gore is expected to attend three
fund-raising events before heading to Iowa Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day fund-raising push is expected to swell his
campaign's bottom line in time for the June 30 filing deadline for
campaign fund raising in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In La Jolla, Gore spoke to warmly enthusiastic groups of
supporters, seeking to underscore his experience as a Vietnam
veteran, a former divinity student, a husband of 29 years and a
future grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   But he was greeted as well by anti- &LR; abortion protesters at a
lunch at the home of Patrick Kruer, a Southern California real
estate magnate and an alternate on the state Coastal Commission.
</P>
<P>
   There, the vice president stressed his experience and his family
history in an effort to underscore the differences between himself
and the pack of GOP presidential candidates _ notably George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in San Diego, in a county that Gore noted has the largest
population of veterans in the United States, he mentioned his own
status as a Vietnam veteran _ something Bush cannot claim.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting a contrast with the family values agenda of GOP
candidates like Dan Quayle, who used the Murphy Brown television
character in a famed critique of single motherhood, Gore said he
wants to lead an America that respects and serves ``all kinds of
families.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did in his official campaign kickoff last week in
Tennessee, Gore called again for ``revolutionary improvements in
public education _ not gradual, incremental change.'' He said that
would include making ``high quality preschool'' available to all
American children.
</P>
<P>
   That Gore enjoys advantages in the campaign as a sitting vice
president was evident as he toured the state in Air Force II, where
even the seats carry the vice presidential seal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was met by dignitaries at both the San Diego and San
Francisco airports, and then whisked through the streets, stopping
traffic with an official motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's visit, with its official veneer, included few chances
to rub elbows with voters, in contrast to other presidential
candidates. In recent visits, Democratic rival Bill Bradley rode
the Sausalito ferry, and Republican John McCain visited a Silicon
Valley computer firm.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sought to remind audiences Wednesday that it is his
experience in office _ on the environment, education and foreign
affairs _ that separates him from the rest of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   He also underscored his agenda, which has been dubbed
``practical idealism,'' and argued for policies that will ``build
an America that's not just better off, but better.''

   1. THE SEX PATROL IS MONITORING THE HALLS Everyone thinks of the
famous North Carolina story about the 6-year-old who was suspended
from school three years ago for kissing a classmate on the cheek.
That's because it is a lot easier to contemplate than the actual
fact of many of the ``student-to-student'' sex harassment cases
that are now coming before the U.S. courts. By Cynthia Gorney. From
The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (7,500 words) + edited
article available.

FROM HERE TO ETERNITY Two Keck telescopes, which stretch a massive
10 meters across, have been operating on Mauna Kea since 1990 and
1996. Japan's wafer-thin 8.3-metre Subaru telescope collected its
first images from space in January. And in the same neighbourhood
the Gemini North, an 8.1-metre telescope built by a seven-nation
consortium, is scheduled to begin scanning the heavens any day.
These are three of an elite new generation of optics that promise
to lead mankind beyond the solar system into unexplored regions of
space. By Michael D. Lemonick. From Discover magazine. 1,000 words

STOP EXPORTING WEAPONS Oscar Arias, the former president of Costa
Rica who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987, argues that Americans,
who show great concern about the reported loss of classified
nuclear secrets to China, should be just as outraged at U.S. sales
of advanced weaponry throughout the world. New York Times Op-Ed.

RUSSIANS DON'T BELIEVE THE U.S. MEANS WELL It sounded like
kiss-and-make-up time again when President Clinton and President
Boris Yeltsin met at the Cologne summit. If Mr. Clinton felt he
kept having to repeat how eager he is to see Russia flourish, it
reflects the intensity of disbelief that has built up in recent
months. It is reported that 80 per cent of the Russian public
consider the U.S. to be the enemy. By Flora Lewis. 800 words.

TRACKING MUTATIONS IN AIDS VIRUSES MAY HELP GUIDE
</P>
<P>
   DRUG CHOICE There are now a number of drugs that can effectively
suppress the AIDS virus HIV-1 and improve the health of many
HIV-infected patients. HIV-1, however, mutates rapidly and can
quickly acquire genetic mutations that make it able to resist
particular drugs. This is one of the major reasons anti-HIV
treatments fail. In this week's Lancet, researchers report that
they were able to improve the treatment of HIV-1 infected patients
by periodically checking them for viruses with drug-resistance
mutations and then, if mutations were found, switching the patients
to more effective drug combinations. By Michael McCarthy. From The
Lancet News Service. 1,000 words.

HE'S NOT A GAMBLER, BUT BOXER AYALA TRYING TO BEAT ODDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Like many innocent out-of-towners, Fort Worth's
Paulie Ayala needed to have the betting line on his title fight
against World Boxing Association bantamweight champion Johnny Tapia
spelled out for him yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia-Ayala occupies a prime spot on the big electronic board in
the Race &AMP; Sports Book at the Mandalay Bay Resort &AMP; Casino, site of
their scheduled 12-rounder on Saturday night. As of yesterday
afternoon, the odds on Tapia successfully defending his 118-pound
title stood at minus-$600. The odds on Ayala, the WBA's No.
2-ranked contender, were listed at plus-$400.
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean to prospective bettors, innocent or
otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   ``Minus-$600 is a heavy favorite for Tapia,'' said Marc Ratner,
executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, and a
participant in the final prefight news conference here. ``When
you're laying 6-to-1, that's a pretty good favorite. In other
words, if you wanted to bet on Tapia, you have to put up $600 to
win $100. If you want to bet on Ayala, you bet $100 and you can win
$400. There's no value, as they say, to betting on the favorite.
You get much better odds when you bet on the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the odds nor the explanation, however, lightened Ayala's
mood before he and trainer Henry Mendez took their seats on the
dais at the hotel's Events Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those odds are crazy. But I don't bet,'' Ayala said. ``I throw
in some change in the slot machines, but I don't bet. But I bet _ I
mean, I'm confident _ I'm going to win. This is a business trip
really. There's no joking or gaming around for me. I'm here to
fight, make money and go on home. I'm not here to leave some of it
in the casino, for the decorations.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after their final news conference in Los
Angeles, Ayala and Tapia dutifully sat through their guaranteed
final news conference with promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank, Inc.
Clearly, the mix of a whirlwind promotional tour that began so
amicably last month had clashed with the demands of training camp,
and the realization that someone is going to suffer a serious
career setback in two nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we were in LA on Tuesday,'' said Tapia, 32, of
Albuquerque, N.M. ``I'm tired of this ... . And I'm anxious to get
to him \RAyala\S. You don't even know. I'm tired of looking at him
at press conferences. I'm tired of talking into the mike. It's time
to put up. Ain't nobody taking my belt away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Freddie Roach said Tapia _ a three-time champion despite
repeated bouts with cocaine earlier this decade _ definitely had
slipped on his game face.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they changed opponents tomorrow, we don't care,'' Roach
said. ``Johnny's getting a little fed up with me in the gym. He
peaked on Friday, our last day of sparring. We're just maintaining
right now. We haven't boxed since that day, and we won't box until
we see Paulie.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Tapia (46-0-2, 25 knockouts), Ayala's formal remarks were
clipped after what he also considered a wasted trip to a club in
Hollywood to pump up pay-per-view sales on Showtime Event
Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do my part for the promotion,'' said Ayala, 29. ``But
it messed up my \Rtraining\S schedule. I left Vegas at 7 in the
morning and got back at 5 in the afternoon. I went to the gym at 6
and wound up running at 9 at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm through selling tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he really was not. When it came time for Ayala (27-1,
12 KOs) to stand behind the microphones and shower yet another
round of praise upon his opponent, he flicked on the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me seven years to get my first title shot, so this
one's come a lot faster,'' said Ayala, who suffered a sixth-round
technical loss against then-World Boxing Council champion Joichiro
Tatsuyoshi in Japan on Aug. 23. ``I'm just ready to fight. I'm
looking forward to a very intense night of boxing. I'm confident
and looking forward to being the WBA bantamweight champion of the
world.''

RANGERS BADLY NEED TOM GOODWIN AT TOP OF LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Tom Goodwin taking batting practice is a
little like watching your toddler play one of those tiny toy
pianos.
</P>
<P>
   Plink, plunk, plink, plonk.
</P>
<P>
   Flare to left. Dribbler to short. Flare to left. Pop fly to
center.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a toe-tapping tune, is it?
</P>
<P>
   That said, the news that Goodwin should be back at the top of
the batting order Sunday in Seattle is music to the Rangers' ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you don't know how much a guy means to you,'' Rusty
Greer wisely observed last night at The Ballpark in Arlington,
``until he's not there any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing to say about a guy with but a single homer and a
measly dozen RBI, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to a curious hypothesis: The Rangers may just be
a better team _ at this point in time _ with Goodwin in the lineup
than with super rookie Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Before you get a rope and form a lynch mob or petition the
Baseball Writers Association to revoke my baseball writing
privileges, hear me out.
</P>
<P>
   First, it's a moot point at the moment anyway, since Mateo went
on the disabled list with a badly strained groin after last night's
game with the A's. It's not as if he has to be sent back to
Oklahoma to make room for Goodwin to return to the active roster,
now that the center fielder's injured left hip has just about
healed.
</P>
<P>
   But have you taken a look at the Rangers' offense over the last
three weeks?
</P>
<P>
   Here, put this clothes pin on your nose and get a little closer
to these numbers:
</P>
<P>
   .156 and .063.
</P>
<P>
   The first represents what Rangers leadoff batters had hit in the
first 11 games after Goodwin was injured (not including last
night's game). The second is what they've hit in the last nine
games, going a scintillating 2-for-32.
</P>
<P>
   Not so coincidentally, the Rangers, until last night's breakout
game against Oakland, had been struggling to score runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the last 23 games,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates
suggested. ``He's missed 12. In 19 of those 23 we've scored four or
fewer runs. I can't answer the question how much, but we do miss
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His on-base percentage is not what we'd like, but he was
leading the league in scoring percentage \R54 percent\S when he did
get on.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin had hit .297 in the 17 games before pulling up lame with
a slight tear in his left hip flexor, lifting his average to .240
for the season. He still leads the American League with 27 steals.
</P>
<P>
   There's no dispute that inserting the multiple-talented Mateo
into the lineup adds firepower. But without someone to ignite the
offense, the Rangers have sputtered badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When \RGoodwin\S is on base, he changes the pitches that guys
behind him get,'' Oates pointed out. ``It just makes the whole
lineup better.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates has tried three different players in the leadoff spot
since Goodwin was injured, including Greer and Luis Alicea for a
game each, but the burden has fallen primarily on second baseman
Mark McLemore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mac is suited much better as a No. 2 hitter,'' Oates said.
``We've experimented a little. We've tried Mac, we've tried Rusty.
We tried Luis \RTuesday\S night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mac can do it. He's been in one of those streaks where he's
not hitting very well, but he can hit leadoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, McLemore was showing signs of doing exactly that last
night, reaching base safely with a pair of walks and a hit through
the first three innings.
</P>
<P>
   But the point has been effectively made: Inserting Mateo into
the lineup and forgetting about Goodwin isn't the answer, at least
not right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tom does make a difference in our lineup,'' Greer
said. ``It's hard to explain. When he's in there, you don't really
think about it, but when he's not there for a couple of weeks, it
really starts to show.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's at the top of the lineup and getting on base, he's
putting pressure on the defense. And he was swinging the bat much
better before he got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, meanwhile, has shown flashes of brilliance but was
hitting just .182. His only home run came in his first game almost
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   What he doesn't need to do, however, is sit on anybody's bench.
If he's not starting here, he needs to be playing in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Mateo's groin injury _ the Rangers summoned
Scarborough Green from Oklahoma to hold the fort until Goodwin
returns Sunday _ allows Oates to delay his decision about what to
do when both are available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have either of them right now,'' Oates said, ``so I
don't have to answer that question today.''
</P>
<P>
   No, not today, but somewhere down the road, it's coming.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, starting Sunday in Seattle, Goodwin starts
plinking away again.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see if the rest of the Rangers'
orchestra chimes in.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WHERE WILL YOU BE WHEN THE SKY FALLS?
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, June 27.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been said that most Westerners who actually
make money in Russia do so by getting into the business of telling
Westerners how to make money in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, consultants have cleaned up by showing
managers how to meet the millennium computer challenge. Forests
have been felled to print reports on what might happen when
computers roll over to Jan. 1, 2000, but fail to sense that the
``00'' doesn't stand for the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits can play it safe by predicting that not all the Y2K
problems will be solved when the new millennium arrives in six
months' time. But at least to this computer maven, it looks as if
the failure to meet the deadline might not mean all that much.
</P>
<P>
   We need ask not only what might fail, but also whether it really
matters. It might be vexing for a writer to be told by a faulty
machine that his or her finest millennial ideas were stamped as
having been written on Jan. 3, 1900. But should that kind of error
drive us bonkers?
</P>
<P>
   The convening in late June of a special United Nations
conference to deal with potential disruptions from Year 2000
computer woes suggests the problem isn't all it has been cracked up
to be. With the possible exception of the refugee issue, no UN
conference in living memory has been known to solve the problem at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, in the course of their deliberations, many visiting
delegates were able to dine at fine New York restaurants. But will
any of those grand salons be forced to close on New Year's Eve, or
soon thereafter, for want of a date-functioning cash register?
They'll probably get by even if their $100-a-plate tabs must be
calculated on an abacus.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington, Congress has been dragging its feet on
passing even the mildest form of Y2K remedial legislation, thereby
offering yet another sign that the sky is not about to fall on our
digital desktops. In those rare times in the life of the nation
when a true crisis looms, lawmakers have a way of ending their
bickering with breathtaking dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when powerful computer networks have revamped Wall
Street to look and feel more like a Las Vegas casino, it's quite
possible to place bets on whether the Y2K glitch will land a
telling blow on the economy. As of now, the futures traders who
play this game for a living are gambling that there's no action to
be had from Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there has been lots of action in the stocks
of companies who repair Y2K defects. The smart money bought such
stocks in 1995, rode them up for huge profits by mid-1997 and then
dumped them. Most Y2K issues now sell well below their pre-1995
values _ another clue to what is not to come.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the white-hot crisis between East and West over Kosovo
has been dampened to a slow burn, Moscow correspondents have
pounced on the Russian mutant of the year 2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has all of 8 million computers, about the same number the
feds have in Washington. Perhaps every one is faulty. We know
consultants will make lots of rubles suggesting fixes. But we
should also realize that, whatever happens, the Slavic soul will
endure.

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    June is known as the month for weddings. But it is also the
highest month of divorces.
 &HT;    Patrice Williams had been married to Crawford less than a year
when their arguments led him to talk about divorce. That prompted
her to consider it seriously.
 &HT;    ''The independent person I was before I married made me try to
not become dependent on him. I was a single parent for nine years
with two kids who depended on me,'' she recalls.
 &HT;    That was when someone at her church, the Texas Cathedral of
Faith in Beaumont, suggested that she and Crawford take a video
course ''Before You Divorce.'' It was led by Robert and Janis
Sartin, who had been married five years before they divorced in
1985, and remarried in 1994. With that history, they were the
perfect leaders of a course on reconciliation.
 &HT;    St. Paul, in II Corinthinians, 5:18-19, wrote: ''All this is
from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us
the ministry of reconciliation.'' My question to pastors and lay
leaders of churches is this: Do you have such a ministry of
reconciliation?
 &HT;    If not, you could create one with the two ingredients outlined
here: the ''Before Your Divorce'' (BYD) videos, and a back-from the
brink couple like the Sartins.
 &HT;    When problems arise in marriage, one or both partners begin
thinking of divorce. The stigma that was once there, the belief
that parents should stay together for the sake of the children, is
gone.
 &HT;    What is not appreciated is that very quickly, a nearly automatic
high-speed process begins in which one or both spouses retain an
attorney, who tell their clients to separate and cease any contact
with their spouse.
 &HT;    The possibility of reconciliation drops precipitously when one
moves out. The attorneys fan the anger of their clients, and soon
the divorce is granted. In many southern states, divorce can be
effective within weeks. In the Northeast, the process takes a year,
enough time for reconciliation. Result: Massachusetts' divorce rate
is half that of Oklahoma.
 &HT;    BYD videos are a shock treatment to halt the runaway train.
''Divorce litigation is war. You are going to war against your
spouse. The battlefield is your own home. It is a hurricane in your
home,'' warns Warren Kniskern, an attorney who went through a
divorce.
 &HT;    He adds: ''Everything is at risk when you hire a lawyer. Don't
let a lawyer get between you and your spouse ... Work out details
through mediation, not litigation.''
 &HT;    The second video outlines the physical, emotional and spiritual
effects of divorce: ''I can't forgive him and I can't forgive her
(the other woman). I am not interested in forgiveness,'' says a
furious wife.
 &HT;    But an expert warns: ''The consequence of unforgiveness are
significant. It is bad on your health ... What it does to your
immune system, the pure chemistry of it creates a root of
bitterness that impinges everything else.''
 &HT;    Next is a deeply moving video of what the kids have to say about
their parents' divorce. Their heart-wrenching stories vividly
portray their anger and fear of abandonment. The fourth video makes
a case for forgiving one's spouse, again combining average people
with expert opinion. ''Forgiveness is surrendering my right not to
hurt you back,'' said one.
 &HT;    What is the impact of the videos? ''It was really an
eye-opener,'' said Mrs. Williams. ''A lot of times you mention
divorce without taking into consideration how it will affect
everyone in the family, how it will totally annihilate the other
person. The videos said forgiveness was a choice. That hit home. If
you forgive, you remember what happened, but it doesn't hurt
anymore.''
 &HT;    ''I saw the repercussions of divorce and decided `I don't want
to be there.' It helped me to forgive. Humility was something I
learned, to listen a little bit more. The workbooks gave an
opportunity to research what Scripture has to say, to let you know
this is right, it is God's way.''
 &HT;    The experience was equally sobering for Crawford and sparked
such a spiritual renewal in him that he has decided to go into the
ministry.
 &HT;    I spoke to one pastor in New York who has shown BYD to six
couples, all of whom halted divorce proceedings. Rev. Paul Dugan of
Community Presbyterian Church in Ventura has had to buy three BYD
sets, because it is listed in the church bulletin as a resource and
so many check it out to watch it themselves or to show it to
friends.
 &HT;    ``We had a couple who were separated for two years, who were
willing to go through BYD. They made a new commitment and had a
ceremony renewing their vows.''
 &HT;    Another church member, Michael Rothenhoefer, did divorce, but
watched BYD and took such thorough notes that he decided to change
his life. He quit a job in Los Angeles, requiring a two-hour drive
each way, and moved near his ex-wife and daughter so that they have
a pairing plan of shared custody. His faith deepened.
 &HT;    To learn more, call 800 489-7778.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    June is known as the month for weddings. But it is also the
highest month of divorces.
 &HT;    Patrice Williams had been married to Crawford less than a year
when their arguments led him to talk about divorce. That prompted
her to consider it seriously.
 &HT;    ''The independent person I was before I married made me try to
not become dependent on him. I was a single parent for nine years
with two kids who depended on me,'' she recalls.
 &HT;    That was when someone at her church, the Texas Cathedral of
Faith in Beaumont, suggested that she and Crawford take a video
course ''Before You Divorce.'' It was led by Robert and Janis
Sartin, who had been married five years before they divorced in
1985, and remarried in 1994. With that history, they were the
perfect leaders of a course on reconciliation.
 &HT;    St. Paul, in II Corinthinians, 5:18-19, wrote: ''All this is
from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us
the ministry of reconciliation.'' My question to pastors and lay
leaders of churches is this: Do you have such a ministry of
reconciliation?
 &HT;    If not, you could create one with the two ingredients outlined
here: the ''Before Your Divorce'' (BYD) videos, and a back-from the
brink couple like the Sartins.
 &HT;    When problems arise in marriage, one or both partners begin
thinking of divorce. The stigma that was once there, the belief
that parents should stay together for the sake of the children, is
gone.
 &HT;    What is not appreciated is that very quickly, a nearly automatic
high-speed process begins in which one or both spouses retain an
attorney, who tell their clients to separate and cease any contact
with their spouse.
 &HT;    The possibility of reconciliation drops precipitously when one
moves out. The attorneys fan the anger of their clients, and soon
the divorce is granted. In many southern states, divorce can be
effective within weeks. In the Northeast, the process takes a year,
enough time for reconciliation. Result: Massachusetts' divorce rate
is half that of Oklahoma.
 &HT;    BYD videos are a shock treatment to halt the runaway train.
''Divorce litigation is war. You are going to war against your
spouse. The battlefield is your own home. It is a hurricane in your
home,'' warns Warren Kniskern, an attorney who went through a
divorce.
 &HT;    He adds: ''Everything is at risk when you hire a lawyer. Don't
let a lawyer get between you and your spouse ... Work out details
through mediation, not litigation.''
 &HT;    The second video outlines the physical, emotional and spiritual
effects of divorce: ''I can't forgive him and I can't forgive her
(the other woman). I am not interested in forgiveness,'' says a
furious wife.
 &HT;    But an expert warns: ''The consequence of unforgiveness are
significant. It is bad on your health ... What it does to your
immune system, the pure chemistry of it creates a root of
bitterness that impinges everything else.''
 &HT;    Next is a deeply moving video of what the kids have to say about
their parents' divorce. Their heart-wrenching stories vividly
portray their anger and fear of abandonment. The fourth video makes
a case for forgiving one's spouse, again combining average people
with expert opinion. ''Forgiveness is surrendering my right not to
hurt you back,'' said one.
 &HT;    What is the impact of the videos? ''It was really an
eye-opener,'' said Mrs. Williams. ''A lot of times you mention
divorce without taking into consideration how it will affect
everyone in the family, how it will totally annihilate the other
person. The videos said forgiveness was a choice. That hit home. If
you forgive, you remember what happened, but it doesn't hurt
anymore.''
 &HT;    ''I saw the repercussions of divorce and decided `I don't want
to be there.' It helped me to forgive. Humility was something I
learned, to listen a little bit more. The workbooks gave an
opportunity to research what Scripture has to say, to let you know
this is right, it is God's way.''
 &HT;    The experience was equally sobering for Crawford and sparked
such a spiritual renewal in him that he has decided to go into the
ministry.
 &HT;    I spoke to one pastor in New York who has shown BYD to six
couples, all of whom halted divorce proceedings. Rev. Paul Dugan of
Community Presbyterian Church in Ventura has had to buy three BYD
sets, because it is listed in the church bulletin as a resource and
so many check it out to watch it themselves or to show it to
friends.
 &HT;    ``We had a couple who were separated for two years, who were
willing to go through BYD. They made a new commitment and had a
ceremony renewing their vows.''
 &HT;    Another church member, Michael Rothenhoefer, did divorce, but
watched BYD and took such thorough notes that he decided to change
his life. He quit a job in Los Angeles, requiring a two-hour drive
each way, and moved near his ex-wife and daughter so that they have
a pairing plan of shared custody. His faith deepened.

MCGWIRE WANTS TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the beginning, Mark McGwire genuinely did not understand
the public's fascination with him.
</P>
<P>
   After smacking five home runs during a three-game series in
Detroit as a rookie with the Oakland Athletics, several reporters
requested a few minutes with McGwire, who was on his way to hitting
a rookie-record 49 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if naive is the right word, but there was a golly
gee-whiz mentality about him in those days,'' former A's public
relations director Jay Alves said. ``He had not been exposed to
that type of scene. He was protected and sheltered, even at USC
(his college). He asked, `Why do they want to talk to me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   As he lumbers into Bank One Ballpark today with the Cardinals
for a four-game series, the country still wants to talk to McGwire
about last season's exploits and his 70 home runs. But McGwire
tires whenever the subject turns to 1998. Since none of us knows
exactly what it was like from the inside out, maybe he knows
something we don't.
</P>
<P>
   But what McGwire knows now is that St. Louis might not be
capable of contending for the playoffs this season. Injuries to
Cardinals pitchers have again ravaged their staff. And McGwire
badly wants to be on a playoff club.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, McGwire admitted how difficult the Cardinals'
chances appear in a discussion with St. Louis-area reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play too perfect,'' McGwire said to St. Louis-area
reporters. ``We can't afford to make mistakes. It's not just one
player. If it was two or three players coming into the mix and
jelling, I think that might make a difference, yeah. But one player
is not going to make a huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   It's always been about winning for McGwire. Even back when
McGwire was puzzled over the interest in him, the one aspect of the
game that really grabbed his attention was the winning. Playing in
Oakland in those days meant there was plenty of it going on.
</P>
<P>
   Over a three-year span from 1988 to 1990, the A's averaged more
than 100 victories a season, won the American League pennant each
year and won the 1989 World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   It may very well have been the best time in McGwire's career,
and he was barely old enough or mature enough to recognize it and
appreciate how rare an experience it was.
</P>
<P>
   He had just turned 26 when he won his first and only World
Series. McGwire readily admits he didn't fully grasp what was going
on.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire seemed to be rotting away in Oakland during his final
seasons with the A's. The club was going nowhere in the American
League West, and McGwire, with the help of a psychotherapist he
still consults, had matured by leaps and bounds.
</P>
<P>
   The personal turmoil in his life had finally come to an end, and
he wanted to appreciate the game and what it meant to him. But the
constant losing and playing in front of almost non-existent crowds
wore on him. It was evident to everyone within the organization and
those of us who covered the A's during those years.
</P>
<P>
   All through it, though, McGwire never demanded out of Oakland.
That simply is not his style and would make it seem impossible for
him to ask out of St. Louis in the future, especially since he
loves playing for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   He was vocal in wanting the A's to make the necessary moves to
return to contention. McGwire was willing to do his share by not
asking for the moon when his contract was set to expire after the
1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed on July 31, 1997, when the A's traded
McGwire to St. Louis for three pitchers. McGwire, who thought his
career would start and finish in Oakland, was not only traded, he
was now in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   While the Busch Stadium crowds have rejuvenated McGwire, it
appears the Cardinals are incapable of making a serious run in the
National League Central at any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he remains in top physical shape, the years are
starting to click by. McGwire will turn 36 on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, McGwire continues to do what he does best,
blasting home runs wherever he is.
</P>
<P>
   The home run hitter has always enjoyed a special place in
society and the game. During those early seasons in Oakland,
McGwire admitted he did not know the history of the game, but
simply knew how to play.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe it was understandable back then that he was unaware of
the adulation showered upon the long-ball hitters.
</P>
<P>
   If he didn't, or couldn't, understand the public's intrigue and
attraction with him in the early years, he surely does now. McGwire
reached the zenith of his career on a muggy September evening in
St. Louis late last summer when he became the game's single-season
home run record holder.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the season by demolishing Roger Maris' 1961 mark of
61, winding up with 70 home runs, a record that may stand the test
of time over another 37 years. The public's love affair with him
grew all summer, hitting a crescendo the night of Sept. 8, when an
entire nation was fixated on his every move.
</P>
<P>
   By now, there's little that hasn't been written or spoken about
McGwire, who stands atop the game as the greatest home run hitter
of the current era, on the verge of entering the hallowed ground of
the greatest home run hitters ever.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the adulation and fanfare, McGwire could not
escape controversy during his march toward immortality last season.
He was forced to defend himself after it was discovered he used the
dietary supplement androstenedione, which some researchers believe
to be harmful to the human body.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire needs 21 more home runs to become just the 16th player
ever to reach 500 in a career. Given that he still has not reached
his 36th birthday and has hit at least 50 home runs three
consecutive seasons, McGwire would seem to have a very good shot at
joining Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays as the only players
ever to hit 600 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of the home runs and statistics can be found in
any baseball record book, where McGwire has placed his name in
several categories. That's the easy stuff to know about McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   But given his lack of interest in rehashing his glorious summer
of '98, it's clear that individual records are not what matter at
this stage of his career.
</P>
<P>
   What McGwire is searching for is a return to the postseason. The
question looming over his head is whether it will happen. &QL;

FANS GOING TO BAT FOR CHANCE AT BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LES POLK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Mark McGwire's bat appears to be getting hot just in
time for the St. Louis Cardinals' four-game visit to Bank One
Ballpark this week.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, with three homers in his past four games, is tied for
second in the league with 22. And that spells danger for
Diamondbacks pitchers and excitement for batting-practice fans.
</P>
<P>
   Who can forget last year's onslaught, when McGwire walked into
BOB for the first time on June 12 and blasted a batting-practice
home run through one of the open panels in left field and onto
Jefferson Street?
</P>
<P>
   By now, 50,000 fans probably claim they were there for batting
practice on that Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   If the panels aren't open today through Sunday, there could be
an advertiser with a dented sign and a golden marketing
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   How about the Sunday batting practice of last season's June
series, when the bleachers, picnic areas, pool, outfield
concourses, TGI Friday's restaurant, the outfield mezzanine and
even the corners of the upper deck were jammed with thousands and
thousands of fans for batting practice?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire ripped shot after shot, some off the scoreboard wall,
some into the seats, one into Friday's and one into the upper-deck
beer garden in left field.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals took two out of three in the series, played before
more than 144,000 fans, and McGwire was on his was way into the
baseball history books.
</P>
<P>
   He hit one home run in that series, a 450-foot grand slam off
Andy Benes in Friday's opener, won by the Cardinals, 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   But it was batting practice that wowed the fans.
</P>
<P>
   The batting-practice scene begins early, long before fans can
even get into the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers take their cracks first, beginning about 3:40 p.m. for
a typical 7:05 p.m. start. Often, Diamondbacks reserves will take
extra batting practice even earlier in the day, sometimes joined by
starters.
</P>
<P>
   By about 4:30 p.m., as ushers are cleaning the suites and box
seats, the Diamondbacks begin regular batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter holds his daily chat with the media by
the dugout. It appears to be a relaxed, informal scene as players
come and go, coaches tend to their duties and monitor the players,
and some players' kids frolic on the field. But in reality it's a
scheduled, orderly process everyone goes through day after day.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, diehards are lining up or huddling in shady spots
around the ballpark, waiting for the magical 5 o'clock hour when
the gates open.
</P>
<P>
   Boom! Matt Williams smacks one into the left-field seats as the
first fans take up their positions. It bounces out of the stands,
missed by the initial wave of souvenir hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' Albert Luna of Phoenix said before a recent
Chicago Cubs-Diamondbacks game as hundreds of fans poured into the
stadium when the gates opened. ``You have a chance of getting a
ball from somebody you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Luna attends a few games each year and always arrives early for
batting practice, glove in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Early birds also have a chance to stumble upon that rare find, a
ball from early batting practice that wasn't picked up by ushers.
</P>
<P>
   From 5 to 5:35, fans can see the Diamondbacks in batting
practice. From 5:35 to 6:15, the visitors get their swings. After a
five-minute break to remove the cages, each team has 10 minutes of
infield practice before turning the field over to the grounds crew.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller children, those who aren't playing on the center-field
jungle gym or testing their youthful skills at the Cox Clubhouse
games area, try to get into the front row of the bleachers for
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   There, chances of getting a ball are better if a friendly player
tosses one up than trying to catch one amid the aggressive
grown-ups with their gloves in the rows above.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the big guys dive, jump, run and knock over anyone in
their way in pursuit of the balls. That angers some fans, but most
don't seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Expert ball retrievers will tell you to stand about halfway up
in the bleachers and play for the rebounds of missed balls if
you're serious about the souvenir hunt.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Tim Hollman of Sedona and his son, Tyler, were
hanging out, hoping to snag a Sammy Sosa shot.
</P>
<P>
   They did the same thing last year, when Sosa and McGwire were
neck and neck in the home run race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just fun to get here early,'' Hollman said. ``And I was a
Cubs fan last year, but this year it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to experience a leisurely batting practice and have
a chance to shag balls, go on a weeknight against a weak team, such
as the Florida Marlins. If it's spectacle you want, get there early
for the Cardinals series beginning tonight.
</P>
<P>
   While the left-field bleachers are the main hangout, right field
isn't bad. A number of balls soar into the outfield concourse or
picnic overhang on both sides. And it's fun just to watch sluggers
like Mike Piazza tattoo the center-field scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Key spots for autograph hounds are right next to the field down
the lines _ the third-base side for Diamondbacks, right field for
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   And fans who just want to relax and take in the proceedings
without getting trampled can sit in their box or grandstand seats
in solitude for a while _ before the late-arriving, early leaving
crowd shows up.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wilhelm of Glendale did just that on Friday when the Atlanta
Braves were in town. He came straight from work, waited outside
about 10 minutes, and then was the only fan in his section,
relaxing in the pre-game fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's cooler in here than it is out there,'' he said.
``And this is an exciting team.''
</P>
<P>
   Others stroll around the concourse, checking out the baseball
exhibits, shopping for souvenirs or loading up on food and drink
before it gets crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals fan Jake Robinson of Mesa says ``bandwagon'' fans have
taken some of the fun out of batting practice by jamming the stands
to see the stars.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers going to batting practice as a child in St. Louis,
when only a few dozen people would show up early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still fun, though,'' he said last week, waiting for the
gates to open for an Atlanta Braves game. ``It's a cheap way to get
balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson brought along a friend, Rene Schafler, to attend his
first batting practice ever at BOB.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't wait,'' the Los Angeles Dodgers-turned-Diamondbacks fan
said with a grin, flexing his glove.
</P>
<P>
   Neither got a souvenir that night, but you know they'll be
back. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Seeing the sites has its price
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, June 27, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a wall running the length of my family room, 38 identically
framed photos present a tiered montage-like remembrance of places
visited _ there's my wife standing on the Great Wall of China, me
atop one of Giza's huge stones, my grandson and me at Stonehenge,
my wife in front of the Sydney Opera House...
</P>
<P>
   It has been my passion to see the world, but I didn't want to
have to join the Navy to do it. Preferably, I've seen it with my
wife.
</P>
<P>
   We hardly are alone in this quest. Worldwide, tourist sites are
beginning to become inundated with people like me. I must confess
it's not a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   America's national parks have had to set limits for visits
because of the overcrowding and subsequent damage to the
environment. No longer can I mount the Giza pyramid stone I
straddled 30 years ago; Egyptian authorities properly have cracked
down. The constant throngs trying to see Michelangelo's ``David''
at the Academy Gallery in Florence now are governed by admission
rules that set 15-minute limits to the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Lines are serpentine to board the ferries for the Statue of
Liberty and Ellis Island; so are they to enter the great mosques of
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Gravity and masses of people now make it impossible for tourists
to wend their way to the top of the very Leaning Tower of Pisa, and
the lines of those waiting to get up the Eiffel Tower or to enter
the Washington Monument often are too long to endure.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is this an era when a weekend trip to Grandma's house
was the travel adventure of the year. We now are cross-country,
more and more becoming world travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, adventurers and/or explorers _ choose your definition
_ are finding more for us to visit some day. Cleopatra's ancient
Alexandria has been discovered just off the coast of Egypt,
everyone now knows every nook and cranny of the Titanic, and just
this past week it was revealed that Titanic's discoverer, Robert
Ballard, found two ancient cargo ships (circa 750 B.C.) in 1,000
feet of water near Tyre in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Where will it lead? I read somewhere not long ago that there
were plans to bring tourists to the site of the Titanic (at a very
heavy price) and there's still the likelihood that the generation
being born now will some day be able to buy a ticket for a ride in
space.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, however, there are other plans nearer actuality. In
Peru, the government is considering a plan to build cable-car
access to the ancient Inca capital of Machu Picchu, nearly 8,000
feet above sea level. Presently, the ruins can be reached by bus,
foot or helicopter, but the trip is arduous for most and thus the
numbers trying it are not unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Open it up with a cable car and it will be like trying to jam
into the elevators on the Eiffel Tower on a lovely June day.
</P>
<P>
   As the world population increases, the discovery of ancient
sites (i.e., tourist photo opportunities) do not increase
proportionately. The once easily accessible locations are not so
accessible anymore because we came to them in huge numbers _ and
did not treat them well.
</P>
<P>
   The world is a remarkable place to see and I do not regret my
travels. But I sense the need for better controls, keener
environmental protections and higher admission costs to cover those
necessities if these sites are to endure us _ for, if not, that
39th picture on my wall might be of a road sign advising me of a
great cultural site just ahead but to proceed no further.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine a much tougher mission in rehabilitation
than trying to buff the image of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, the
grandstanding Red-baiter of the 1950s whose excesses are enshrined
in his namesake -ism, to this day a synonym for bully demagoguery.
</P>
<P>
   But the historians and other wordsmiths of the cultural right
have lately taken up the task like manic elves. Scholarly
re-evaluations have been published, to the effect that McCarthy was
a misunderstood hero of the resistance to communism and the Soviet
Union, fatally maligned for a wee misstep here or there by foolish
and knavish liberals either indifferent to the horrors of Stalinism
or contemptuous of their own country. Or both.
</P>
<P>
   Now the redoubtable and relentless William F. Buckley Jr. has
joined in, with a novel in which the senator is, by reviewers'
accounts, treated more or less as a great and noble, if sometimes
floundering, beast brought down by nasty terriers.
</P>
<P>
   Revisionism, Lord knows, is not a conservative proprietary. A
testy cell of liberals has spent years, for instance, trying to pin
the Cold War on the United States. At the left fringes, there are
some who figure the Ayatollah Khomeini, if for the wrong reasons,
had it basically right with his Great Satan stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But reinflating the Joe McCarthy doll takes some especially
heavy huffing and puffing. First, his opponents must be recast as
either naive if principled dupes or duplicitous fellow travelers,
and Soviet subversion has to be made the fundamental menace to
American survival that it never had any hope of being.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the ranks of Soviet-leaning liberals, never vast, were
first decimated in the '30s by disillusion wrought of the Moscow
purge trials, and the survivors of that decimation were decimated
again by the shocking Hitler-Stalin pact.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, labor unions, often at heroic effort, were
ridding themselves of Comintern cadres. The Soviet-front
conveniences of wartime's expedient alliance were flopping. The
radical presidential candidacy of Henry Wallace fizzled. Liberals
were gearing up to press for social reform at home while contesting
imperial communism abroad, a parlay that would take formal shape
with the creation of Americans for Democratic Action. Few doubted
Soviet spying.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was a naked political opportunist, sloppy with the
facts, wanton in accusation, disdainful of civil liberties. The Red
scare he incited surfaced a few communist small fry, most of them
more dabblers than threats, but it savaged innocents equally and
created a hysteria that, among other damage, drove seasoned
diplomats from the State Department, degrading our ability to fight
the Cold War ably.
</P>
<P>
   It is well to revisit and newly understand history. But history
is not there just to be up-ended to serve ideological conceits. The
Soviet historians, who were the masters of that craft, would look
on the cultural warriors who are trying to outfit McCarthy with a
new, exculpatory narrative as mere amateurs _ but not without
promise.

WHERE'S THE OUTRAGE? GAMBLING MA JOR THREAT

   Once, you could stand under the Gateway Arch in St. Louis,
follow the Mississippi River, imagine Huckleberry Finn and darn
near taste America's heritage floating by.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you can stand in the same place and find a casino boat
anchored to shore, sending waves of cheap neon into the night.
</P>
<P>
   It is a terrible sight, the perfect metaphor for a country
infatuated with gambling and sports. And if ever the twains shall
meet . . .
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Isaac Burton was sentenced to prison for his role
in the ASU point-shaving scandal of 1994. On his way out of the
courtroom, he apologized to Bill Frieder, a poignant moment and the
first time someone said sorry to the coach.
</P>
<P>
   But no one gives a chip. Frieder is not an exiled cockroach, as
he may have been in another era. He is just a sloppy and friendly
uncle, doing commercials, running Jason Kidd's basketball camp,
dining alone in the press room of Bank One Ballpark, living a life.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, John Daly admitted to the golfing world that he
gambled away $9 million in recent years. That's not the total
amount bet _ which is closer to $93 million _ just the money he
lost.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Albert Belle admitted he lost more than $40,000
gambling on sports other than baseball, and baseball shrugged its
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, a large sports gambling ring was found operating
inside a Columbia University fraternity house.
</P>
<P>
   Hello? Doesn't anybody care anymore? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the NCAA concluded a two-year study on gambling and
announced the following: It will support legislation introduced by
Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., who is seeking a ban on Internet gambling.
The Senate Judiciary Committee adopted the legislation last week,
but many legal issues remain on how to police borderless
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA also supports a recommendation to restrict legal
gambling to those over age 21, and to ban legal betting on college
and amateur events.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bold and wonderful move, but the hurdles are enormous.
Gambling is so big that professional leagues tread lightly,
painfully aware of their consumer base. Gambling is so hot that Las
Vegas is spawning hotels like tadpoles. Gambling has grown up a lot
over the past few years _ and is looking very much like T. Rex.
</P>
<P>
   And in other news, the National Association of Directors of
Athletics recently held a convention in Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' Arizona State Athletic Director Kevin White said.
``It's inexcusable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC; 
Somewhere along the line, gambling went from dark secret to
national pastime. And many experts think the proliferation of
legalized gambling has set the recent tone of acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   State lotteries sell a government-sponsored dream to those who
can least afford to play games of chance. But proponents claim they
are just channeling a nation's taste for gambling into a productive
end, and by 1995, 37 states were sponsoring lotteries, reaping in
more than $34 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have an insatiable interest in gaming,'' White said.
``It's at a fever pitch and growing. Go to every major community in
this country, and if they aren't in the gaming business, they're
contemplating it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   This sudden tolerance has led to a rage of riverboat gambling
and on-land casinos, and over the past decade, 21 states have
legalized commercial casinos.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, here was the menu of legalized gambling in Arizona:
horse and dog racing, off-track betting facilities all over the
state, two weekly Power Ball drawings, two weekly Lotto drawings,
four weekly Fantasy Five drawings, more than 20 scratch-off games
and 14 casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one local casino tempts you with a new radio catch phrase:
With two locations, you can gamble 48 hours a day!
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become part of the American fabric,'' White said. ``And
in my view, it's a contradiction to sports.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If the numbers don't grab you, the apathy should.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, a research firm in New York estimated illegal sports
wagering at $8 billion a year. By 1995, it had risen to $84
billion, or $35 billion more than the illegal drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the NCAA cited these figures: $2.4 billion a year is
spent on sports wagering in Las Vegas. Nevada is the only state
with legalized sports betting. The illegal sports wagering
industry, however, could be generating as much as $380 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, the brush fires: Point shaving scandals at
ASU and Northwestern. A Cal State-Fullerton athlete who was offered
money to shave points. Betting on college sporting events by
Maryland players. A fiasco at Boston College, where players bet
against their own team.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in 1951, City College of New York's basketball team landed
in a point-shaving scandal and a nation screamed in outrage. Once,
Pete Rose was banned from baseball and his conqueror, Bart
Giamatti, was a hero. Now, it's too commonplace to get worked up
about.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bill Saum, the NCAA director of agent and gambling
activities, admits there isn't a college in the country where you
can't find a campus bookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is it's much like that proverbial iceberg,'' Arizona
Athletic Director Jim Livengood said. ``As bad as things seem on
the surface, I get the feeling it's going to get a lot worse.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Titanic Casino _ take what you will from the name _ is just one
of an estimated 250 online casinos. They are the breeding termites
that could tear down the foundation of college sports.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymity of Internet gambling is beyond frightening. A
basketball player at any major college can open an account under a
friend's name. Among a myriad of options, he can bet on the range
of points he will score in an upcoming basketball game. He can fix
the event in a most subtle fashion, even without throwing the
contest.
</P>
<P>
   But the implications are devastating. What if half the players
on the court have placed side bets?
</P>
<P>
   With a click of the mouse goes the integrity of sports.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard enough tackling the problem of point-shaving and
illegal gambling through human channels. But this is something
entirely different.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA knows its students gamble. An infamous and random NCAA
survey of 2,000 male student-athletes in Division I basketball and
football found that more than 25 percent reported gambling on
college events. Four percent claimed to have wagered on games in
which they played.
</P>
<P>
   New York economist Sebastian Sinclair says Internet wagering
generated an estimated $651 million in 1998. But to date, none of
the recent rash of scandals has pierced the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   It is the next Black Hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about more gambling scandals, it's a matter of
when, not if,'' Livengood said. ``It could be the ruination of
college athletics. It's that serious.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Titanic Casino's Web site sends you to a sports book
that adds 10 percent to the initial account of new customers.
</P>
<P>
   Need any other evidence that this is a sucker's proposition? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Addiction:
</P>
<P>
   My father was a heavy smoker.
</P>
<P>
   On his deathbed, days before dying of lung cancer, he asked for
a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   My wife's grandfather was a riverboat fanatic.
</P>
<P>
   On his deathbed, just days before dying in early February, he
sat in his hospital bed, nearly unconscious, holding an imaginary
conversation with a dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Hit me, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hit me, too. Once again. Like a ton of chips. &QL;

HELP FOR SHOOTING WOES IS NOT ON THE WAY IN DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the league that can't shoot straight, a hunt for accuracy is
under way. But it promises to be a lot like the NBA this season.
More miss than hit.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be little help in the draft at the very
position that has the name but little else.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting guards? How about missing guards?
</P>
<P>
   In basketball's current parlance, they are called ``the twos.''
The terrible twos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much,'' Suns scout Al Bianchi said of the chance
to land a reliable, accurate backcourt shooter in the draft on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that the Suns need one. A sure sign at the lack
of prospects in this class is the Suns' interest in Penny Hardaway,
who has talked about leaving Orlando and moving exclusively from
playmaker to shooting guard. The Suns have the No. 9 pick, but it's
not likely to land them the shooter they need immediately. Hence,
the Hardaway talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The twos are terrible this year,'' said Dick Percudani,
another Suns scout.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, they are a collection of players who have
been at other positions. College forwards are being measured for
their potential to play shooting guard in the pros.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the bunch are too small for the spot in the NBA,
although one might be an exception. Some scouts say 6-foot-3 Steve
Francis could succeed at the two spot, his position at the
University of Maryland. But for now, Francis, the potential No. 1
pick, is projected to be a point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is the versatile Lamar Odom of Rhode Island.
Bianchi said the 6-9 Odom has the physical ability to play at least
three spots: the point, small forward and shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   But there are questions about his maturity. Odom, an
underclassman, failed to report for a couple of physicals and has
expressed doubts about whether he should go pro. Odom was thought
to be the No. 1 pick by some scouts several weeks ago, but he might
be in a free fall.
</P>
<P>
   So what's left?
</P>
<P>
   One of the intriguing possibilities is Wally Szczerbiak, a 6-8
senior forward last season at Miami of Ohio. Statistics say he can
shoot. He averaged 23.6 points on 52.1 percent shooting last
season. But there are predictable questions about his quickness
along the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a small forward who people would eventually like to see
at the two,'' Percudani said. ``But can he create his own shots?''
</P>
<P>
   The marketing department has very few doubts about Szczerbiak,
who apparently has off-the-floor qualities that create interest and
ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks fluent Spanish, a language he learned as a kid when
his dad played in Spain. His father was in an early Suns training
camp three decades ago. Szczerbiak also has matinee-idol looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be the Ricky Martin of NBA basketball,'' Percudani
said, referring to the bilingual singer and soap opera star.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is Richard Hamilton, a 6-6 junior swingman
who averaged 21.0 points last year at Connecticut, the NCAA
champion. At 195 pounds, Hamilton probably has to make it as a
shooting guard in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Of the prospects under serious consideration, Trajan Langdon is
the one player who was a shooting guard in college. He averaged
17.1 points last season as Duke senior.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting statistic about Langdon is his three-point
accuracy: 42.8 percent. In a recent workout with the Los Angeles
Clippers, Langdon shot 22 for 25 from the NBA's longer three-point
distance.
</P>
<P>
   But there are questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big enough, quick enough?'' Percudani asked.
</P>
<P>
   At only 6-3, some question whether Langdon has the size to shoot
over bigger defenders. He was effective in shooting over zone
defenses in college. But against man-to-man coverage? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Two other names in a very uncertain class:
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Levett, Cincinnati. He can be an explosive athlete. He
also is an explosive personality. The second factor scares scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Carter of Mississippi. See Levett. The scouting report on
Carter is the same in a short book with too few twos. &QL;

 &HT;    TOP LAWMAKER SAYS HIS WASTE OF FEDERAL FUNDS EDUCATED HIM
 &HT;    700&AMP;add. For release Sunday, June 27.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The battle in Congress over how to improve federal
aid to schools is heavily influenced by Rep. William F. Goodling's
memories of his own abuse of federal grants during his days as an
educator more than a quarter century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasted a lot of federal dollars early on,'' the 71-year-old
Pennsylvania Republican admitted in an interview. He vowed to
reshape the controls over federal education funds before he retires
next year from Congress, at the end of his six-year term as
chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Before his election in 1974 to succeed his father as the
representative of a bucolic, three-county area near the Gettysburg
battlefield, Goodling worked for two decades in small public school
districts around Seven Valleys, Pa. He was first a teacher,
counselor and coach of football, basketball and baseball teams, and
later a high school principal, superintendent and school board
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the early days, when this money from the federal
government for equipment would arrive in October or November and
nothing was planned. My superintendent would come in and say,
'Order, order, order,' `` Goodling recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ordered all sorts of things that nobody even knew how to
use, if that's what the money was earmarked for,'' Goodling said.
``For all I know, that district still has some of our overhead
projectors piled up in a closet somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that experience left him suspicious of narrow grant
programs that are audited only to make sure that the paperwork
shows that funds were spent exactly how the federal government
specified.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Miller of California, who would become chairman of
the education panel if the Democrats retake Congress, ``always
wants to know what the taxpayers are getting for their money,''
Goodling said. ``I want to know what the children are getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodling was the chief drafter of the ``Straight A's Act,'' more
formally known as the Academic Achievement for All Act, which he
and House GOP leaders introduced last Tuesday (June 22).
</P>
<P>
   That bill would give states the option of blending funds from
their biggest federal grants, instead of using each only for the
purpose specified under federal law. If a state decided not to take
that option, any of its districts could do so on its own. Only
states or districts that failed to prove that their students were
improving in academics would have to follow federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   One typical rule dedicates about $8 billion of the $15 billion
in federal education grants distributed each year to help children
from schools with lots of poor students. Another rule earmarks just
over $1 billion for President Clinton's plan to reduce class sizes
by hiring 100,000 more teachers for the early grades.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking the Straight A's Act, Secretary of Education Richard
Riley charged, ``In their zeal for quick fixes and silver-bullet
solutions, Republicans are proposing another experiment in revenue
sharing (that) fails to ensure that federal resources are spent
effectively on practices that work.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley's attack, and the fact that Rep. Ralph Hall of Texas was
the only Democrat to join52 Republicans in cosponsoring the bill,
bodes ill for the proposal. Goodling might have a hard time
rounding up the kind of bipartisan support that is needed to avoid
a stalemate between the Democratic president and the
Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodling shrugged that off, pointing out that Clinton
overcame his early skepticism and signed a modified version of the
Educational Flexibility Act this spring. In some ways similar to
the Straight A's Act, although it affects fewer programs, the
flexibility act also allows mingling of funds. It was adopted
nationwide only after it had been pilot-tested in 12 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, after we've built a big enough coalition, the
president will see how good the Straight A's Act is, and he'll find
a way to take credit for it,'' Goodling predicted. ``If it'll help,
we're willing to change the name to the William Jefferson Clinton
Reform Act.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   Goodling said his belief that at least some federal aid can be
justified grows out of his experiences between 1967 and 1974, when
he was superintendent of the Spring Grow (cq) Area District near
his 20-acre horse farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the start, we were just wasting federal dollars trying to
make readers out of illiterate senior high school students,''
Goodling said. ``They didn't want to admit they couldn't read in
the first place, and we didn't know how to motivate them or how to
teach high school students to read.''
</P>
<P>
   So he convinced his school board to let him use federal funds
for the disadvantaged to support a completely different
anti-dropout plan designed by an early-childhood specialist on his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   The plan offered in-home tutoring for pre-schoolers who would be
described by today's educators as ``at risk'' _ children with a
parent, older brother or older sister who had dropped out of
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``By doing it at home, the parent or older sister was also
learning some things _ things like what it is you can do to help a
child become reading-ready,'' Goodling said. ``After several
months, they would move to a program at a church, because we didn't
think 3- and 4-year-olds should be brought into a formal school
setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefits over the years of working on the whole family's
literacy were so obvious, and not just for the kids,'' he said.
``You saw parents participating in PTA meetings who, before, would
never have come anywhere near a school.''
</P>
<P>
   When he left that job to go to Congress, Goodling warned the
incoming superintendent, ``Remember, board members' children can't
participate in this program (because their parents weren't
dropouts), so you're going to have to fight for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years the program was abandoned. ``He didn't do a
very good job of fighting for it,'' Goodling lamented.
</P>
<P>
   But as a member of the Republican minority on the education
committee in the 1980s, Goodling convinced the members to transform
the idea into a small but widely admired federal program for family
literacy. Called Even Start, it helped inspire similar requirements
for parental involvement in Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   Goodling didn't include either Even Start or Head Start on the
list of programs that states or districts could lump together under
his Straight A's Act.

 &HT;    Officials hope osprey population will take off in Ohio
 &HT;    By Rachel Kipp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ On Wednesday morning eight osprey chicks woke up
in their nests in the Maryland wild.
</P>
<P>
   Now the chicks are living in nesting boxes 25 feet off the
ground in the Spring Valley Wildlife Area as part of an effort to
bring the bird species back to the state of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, Spring Valley has been one of five sites in Ohio
to receive osprey chicks from the East Coast as part of an Ohio
Division of Wildlife project to have 20 breeding pairs of ospreys
in Ohio by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Ospreys, also called fishhawks, are a species of bird who feed
almost entirely on live fish, said Gary Imwalle, wildlife area
supervisor for Spring Valley. According to The Raptor Center at the
University of Minnesota, ospreys have special adaptations that make
them expert fishermen, such as a `spicules' on the bottom of their
feet for grasping slippery objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to a combination of pesticides which cause reproductive
failure, a loss of habitat, decreased water quality, and nest site
disturbances, ospreys left the Ohio area,'' Imwalle said.
</P>
<P>
   The last recorded wild osprey nest in Ohio was seen in 1913.
Imwalle said. Spring Valley was chosen as a site for the 10-year
study because it met certain criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted sites in all the corners of the state,'' he said.
``Sites had to be close to a wildlife work unit, to have a good
fish prey base, and be in a place that wasn't occupied by bald
eagle territory, who tend not to tolerate ospreys.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicks, who are about six weeks old when they arrive in Ohio,
come from Maryland, New York, and Virginia. Only one chick is
removed from each nest. A chick is only taken from the nest if
their are at least two others left for the parents to raise, said
Imwalle.

 &HT;    Medicare cuts mean less help for elderly, critics say
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Last year, when the Rev. Clifton Freudenberg was
released from the San Antonio hospital that installed his
pacemaker, he still felt unsteady from an inner ear condition that
was causing him vertigo.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than go home, he entered the skilled nursing unit at
Guadalupe Valley Hospital in his hometown of Seguin.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old wing was the kind of modern health care facility
that rural people don't often see in their communities. In fact, it
had been named the best in Texas by the agency that runs Medicare,
the federal health insurance program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Just months later, however, the unit had to close when the
federal government reduced the amount Medicare pays for patients
like Freudenberg. In Austin, the same cuts forced the St. David's
HealthCare Partnership to close all three of its skilled nursing
facilities this year and lay off 250 people. The last is set to
close June 30.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year and a half, cuts in what Medicare pays have
squeezed health care providers across the state and across the
country, causing hospitals to scale back services for the elderly,
such as skilled nursing, and forcing home health agencies to close
altogether. Statewide, more than 300 home health agencies that
relied on Medicare payments _ or one in five _ have closed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hospitals are saying Congress went too far in making the
cuts and pleading with lawmakers to soften the blow. They estimate
that Medicare reductions will cost them $18 billion more than
Congress projected in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saving more money than I think they meant to save,''
said Ron Anderson, president of Parkland Memorial Hospital in
Dallas and chairman of the Texas Hospital Association, which held
its annual meeting in Austin last week. ``If we undermine the
infrastructure too much, sure, we save some money, but we hurt
people on the other end.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, doctors and patients say, the cuts are
putting the hurt on facilities that are better at treating elderly
people recovering from strokes, infections or broken bones than
acute-care hospitals or nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks, Freudenberg received physical therapy and
supportive care that got him back on his feet. He participated in
group activities meant to ease his re-entry into his normal routine
as a preacher at Cross United Church of Christ in Seguin. Twice, a
volunteer stopped by to play the accordion music Freudenberg loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the hospital has the time to do for patients
what these people did,'' said Freudenberg, 76. ``Without that unit,
I don't know where I would be in ability or how I would have been
restored had I not had all the features of the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In the federal budget passed in 1997, Congress ordered hundreds
of changes in Medicare aimed at reducing overuse of and overpayment
for certain services.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the biggest targets were skilled nursing _ facilities
that treat elderly patients who are well enough to leave the
hospital but too sick to go home _ and home health care, which
brings treatment to the home during recovery and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents in Congress said there was too much variation in what
Medicare was charged for the services and too much opportunity for
waste and fraud.

 &HT;    Life in the land of white beaches and blue drinks
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANCUN, Mex. _ The new growth industry in this city of 400,000 _
built 28 years ago solely for the purpose of enticing tourists into
trading dollars and Deutschmarks for tequila and fajitas _ is hair
braiding.
</P>
<P>
   There are more people braiding hair in Cancun per linear foot
than anywhere in the world, I believe: tight braids with pieces of
silver foil on the ends, like the ones Bo Derek wore in the movie
``10'' some 15 years ago, or such as Whoopi Goldberg still wears on
occasion. As you wander through the innumerable shops selling
everything from Tommy Hilfiger knock-offs to Mayan art, merchants
beckon, showing off samples of hair braids perched spookily on
Styrofoam skulls. ``K-Mart blue-light special, today only, pretty
lady,'' they chant.
</P>
<P>
   Business is good, judging from the number of women and even a
few brave males I saw wearing braids. Even my better half fell for
the pitch and tried it, though it was only a day before she spent
hours unraveling braids out of her hair and cursing her moment of
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   This is my second trip to Cancun, which sits near the tip of the
Yucatan Peninsula, surrounded by ocean water so blue-green and sand
so white it almost looks fake, especially after getting used to
upper Texas Gulf Coast beaches. Cancun was founded in 1971 and on
my first visit 12 years ago it had already caught on as a tourist
destination, but nothing like now. It appears to be the preferred
destination point for high-school senior trips, at least judging by
what I saw last week while on vacation there.
</P>
<P>
   A parent has two choices to make if his child says he wants to
go to Cancun for a senior trip. Either say ``No way, Jose. Over my
dead body,'' or expect that the child:
</P>
<P>
   _ Will drink massive amounts of cheap alcohol at clubs that
could care less if the kid is 15, let alone 18 or 21. The legal
drinking age in Mexico is 18. The accepted age in Cancun appears to
be about 12, at least for visitors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Is likely to come home with a tattoo or pierced body part,
possibly both. I overheard more than one high-school student, whose
party was about to end with the trip back to the real world, say,
``Oh, man, my mom is going to kill me when she sees this tattoo.''
Or pierced eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   _ Will have a difficult time adjusting to normal-world hours,
having just spent a week sleeping until 3 p.m., drinking beer for
breakfast, then partying until the sun rises.
</P>
<P>
   My approach, which likely will draw criticism, is that ignorance
is bliss. I don't want to know what happened when my daughters went
to Cozumel, Cancun's older sister in tourism, for the youngest's
senior trip a few weeks ago. Now that I've seen it for myself, I
really don't want to know how my daughters spent their time. Those
are your two choices as a parent: Refuse permission and deal with a
surly, whining teen-ager. Say OK and hope it all turns out. Take
your pick. I figure they're about grown by high-school graduation
anyway, and they'll do what they'll do.
</P>
<P>
   Cancun has exploded in growth, and it now has the inevitable
array of hip eating places _ Hard Rock Cafe, Planet Hollywood,
Rainforest Cafe, Carlos and Charlies. The food is cheap, about
two-thirds of what you'd pay at the American franchises. The
service is impeccable everywhere you go, from the condos to the
beach-side beverage service, to the hundreds of shops both quaint
and chic, cheap and expensive. You can buy a Rolex watch here,
though why anyone would pay $3,500 for a used watch is beyond me,
or you can get a piece of Mayan ceramic for 30 pesos _ about three
bucks. I went for the latter.
</P>
<P>
   If you go, take a trip to Isla Mujeres, a tiny island five miles
off the coast and accessible by ferry for $14. It feels more like
real Mexico, with none of the franchise frenzy of Cancun, though it
too has grown tremendously in the past decade. At Isla Mujeres, you
can find a pleasant open-air cantina, such as Sombrero de Gordos,
and eat fajitas, sip Dos Equis and walk away having spent less than
$20 for three people. Then you can rent a golf cart or moped and
putter around the cobblestone streets, making your way through
narrow alleyways until you come across the whitewashed adobes and
dirt yards of the people who actually live here. It will remind you
this isn't Disney World, when you see where the people making five
pesos an hour live.
</P>
<P>
   Snorkeling is wonderful at Isla Mujeres, though the rainy
weather and cold weather precluded doing that on this trip. This is
the rainy season in the Caribbean, with a late-afternoon shower
almost a sure bet.
</P>
<P>
   The rain didn't bother me, since I'm not one to lie prostrate in
the sun baking myself for no reason. I endure enough sun working in
the yard. I prefer sitting under a thatched cabana on the beach,
reading a trashy novel, watching the rain and celebrating the fact
it had driven all the whooping high-school students inside to the
bar. The contingent from a Georgia high school was starting to
annoy me with their rebel yells as they downed shots of some
mysterious blue liquid I wouldn't drink on a bet. It looked like
windshield washer fluid.
</P>
<P>
   I noticed most the clubs don't open until 10 p.m., which is yet
another reason I never darkened the door of one during our visit.
That's bedtime when you're middle-aged.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, to be young again, although I think I would still pass on
the tattoo.

 &HT;    Accountablility key for Texas agencies
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ The Texas governor who would be president of
the United States needs a better explanation of why he does not
favor public accountability by groups that spend taxpayer money.
Gov. George W. Bush's rationale for vetoing House Bill 2557 just
doesn't add up.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the background: There are 55 community action agencies in
Texas that spend tax dollars on programs designed to help children,
the poor, the disabled and the elderly. These agencies are exempt
from the Texas Open Meetings Act and the Texas Open Records Act,
yet they spend millions of tax dollars funneled to them by state
and federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The East Texas Human Development Corp., headquartered in
Marshall, is one of those agencies. Since 1991, the Longview
News-Journal has been reporting about HUDCO's wasteful spending,
questionable management and inefficient delivery of services. In
addition to receiving state funds for programs that provide energy
and housing assistance and meals to children, the elderly and
disabled, HUDCO received some $3 million in Head Start education
funds annually.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, we reported the story of a $900,000 spending
spree with Head Start education funds. That included a $17,000
parent-staff banquet, of which some $12,500 was spent on gifts for
board and staff members. The other money was squandered on snow
cone and popcorn machines, cameras, sewing machines, microcassette
recorders and other items of questionable use. At the same time,
less than one-fourth of Longview's
</P>
<P>
   eligible children are being served by Head Start. That's where
we were 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, HUDCO was finally forced to voluntarily give up
its Head Start contract. But for more than eight years, precious
funds to help children were wasted and misused.
</P>
<P>
   HUDCO also has operated other programs providing housing,
weatherization, energy assistance and emergency services. The Texas
Department of Housing and Community Affairs and federal auditors
have criticized HUDCO for a ``pervasive misapplication of grant
funds,'' financial and management problems, failure to follow state
and federal regulations in spending grant funds, substandard or
nonexistent record keeping, violating federal contract terms,
failure to seek competitive bids and improperly shifting funds from
one program to another.
</P>
<P>
   This is what led state Rep. Bob Glaze (D-Gilmer) to introduce
legislation to require Texas' 55 community action agencies to open
their records to the public and hold public meetings when they
decide how they will use tax dollars. The bill passed without a
single dissenting vote. How often does that happen?
</P>
<P>
   The idea that it could subject ``faith-based organizations in
Texas to unnecessary government intrusion'' if they get state or
federal grants just doesn't wash. The proposed law wouldn't have
applied to faith-based groups unless they received a federal
contract to operate as a community action agency _ and then the
groups would be accountable only for the tax dollars received.
Shouldn't any organization that receives state or federal funds be
accountable?
</P>
<P>
   The second objection _ that any future problems such as those
with HUDCO would be dealt with promptly by the TDHCA _ is a
patently bad assumption. TDHCA and federal officials say they are
unable to hold tight reins over problem agencies such as HUDCO.
</P>
<P>
   That's why vetoing this bill is neither conservative,
compassionate, nor wise. Surely, a conservative would want to
ensure accountability of tax money. It's not compassionate because
a large number of Texas children from disadvantaged homes are
missing the educational, social, health and nutritional benefits of
Head Start. Texas' children, its poor, elderly and disabled are
being deprived of nutrition, housing, energy assistance and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   Public accountability and open government are concepts that
should apply to any agency that spends taxpayers' money. Without
adequate public oversight to ensure that these human services are
being delivered effectively and efficiently, it is harmful to
children, the poor, the disabled and the elderly of Texas. It
allows taxpayer money to be wasted and hurts all Texans.

 &HT;    Invisible on the streets of Southeast Austin
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's Note: I recently spent a couple Friday nights seeing
Austin as APD Officer Wayne Vincent and Dr. Ed Racht, EMS medical
director, see it. This is the first of two reports. The other will
run next week.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After 14 years on the street, Wayne Vincent
knows what it's like to be invisible. It's about 1 a.m. and we're
watching this guy walk through a parking lot, pointedly avoiding
looking at the white Chevy with the Austin Police Department decals
all over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you like being invisible?'' I asked Vincent as the guy
walks by the car without so much as a sideways glance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to it,'' he replied, adding that the passerby must
have either steel nerves or a clear conscience. ``He's not turning
around to see if we're looking at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Wayne's World.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Frank Sector, Southeast Austin. Everything from the
river south was his to watch from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. I rode with him
on a slow night, but there was more than enough to do.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first calls is about a missing person. A 14-year-old
hasn't come home. Her parents are worried. Vincent arrives, asks
the parents some questions. It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to
figure out this is most likely a runaway, but fortunately for this
family, it's a slow night and Wayne Vincent can pursue it.
</P>
<P>
   He asks about the teen-ager's friends and leverages bits and
pieces of information slowly, patiently by calling one friend, then
another, then another. In about an hour, he's got a pretty good
idea of who the girl is with and where they are.
</P>
<P>
   When we get there, we've just missed the teen, but she's on her
way home, so we go there for the reunion. Before leaving the house
to allow the girl and her parents to continue a rather painful
discussion about what's bothering her, Vincent talks to her.
</P>
<P>
   The officer delivers a forceful, but gentle, lecture on the
potential consequences of running away and says that he doesn't
want to see her again. It's a story with a happy ending and a cop
will take one of those whenever one presents itself.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent joined the Austin Police Department in April 1985. I
rode with him as he was winding up the patrol cop phase of his
career. He was top scorer on the detective's examination, so he was
just waiting for a slot.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that he is popular with his colleagues. On a ramp
outside the jail, a fellow officer asks, ``How do you say `No.
1?'''
</P>
<P>
   Flashing a wide grin, Vincent replies: ``Wayne Vincent.''
</P>
<P>
   He's an easy guy to talk to and like most officers, has a
definite point of view. ``I was doing community policing before
they had a name for it. I knew the people in Montopolis and all the
store owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Before community policing was the thing, getting to know the
community he policed got Vincent in periodic jams. ``I got chewed
out for not writing enough tickets,'' he said, explaining that
given the choice between writing tickets or getting to know people,
he went with getting to know people.
</P>
<P>
   For all that you see on television about cops or what you think
you know about Southeast Austin, police work can be awfully dull.
It can change in an instant, of course, but even the crowd at the
gang banger hangout is quiet. They give looks that are both dirty
and defiant, but dirty, defiant looks don't violate the penal code.
</P>
<P>
   There's a complaint about a noisy party. And there's a DWI
arrest where we wait for what seems like forever for a wrecker.
</P>
<P>
   It's 3:25 a.m. and Vincent is in the APD station, finishing up
the paper work on the DWI arrest. He and I are the two oldest
people in the room. The people who watch your streets at night
remind me of the people who stand guard at military posts all over
the world _ they are mighty young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the department has grown fast, that's why there's so
many young people,'' Vincent said.
</P>

 &HT;    You've been served, Gov. Bush, everything's fair game
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush in The New York Times isn't
new. But a New York Times column about Gov. W.'s contemplated veto
of a measure and the tone it sets for his possible presidency is.
</P>
<P>
   It underlines how people and groups will be using W.'s actions
in Texas, in light of his presidential candidacy, to leverage
issues they hold dear.
</P>
<P>
   The column, which the Austin American-Statesman shared with its
readers, was by regular Times columnist Bob Herbert. It said
indications were the governor was about to veto a bill to allow new
methods of appointing lawyers for poor people accused of crimes.
Judges make the appointments now.
</P>
<P>
   The piece was obvious jawboning to try to keep the governor from
vetoing the bill or at least to make him pay a political price if
he did.
</P>
<P>
   Bush vetoed it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But the column served notice to W., if it was needed: Just about
anything that's happened in Texas government during the 4 1/2 years
you've been governor, and particularly in the recent 140 days of
the regular legislative session, is going to be fair game.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to pay complete attention to everything happening during
the session is like trying to fly a kite in a hurricane. There is
too much going on _ more than 5,000 bills and resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the storm has passed, the nation's news media _
including the American-Statesman _ will be analyzing in greater
detail what happened. And didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly, Bush is going to get credit or blame in news
media all across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the lawyer-appointment bill.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 247, by Sen. Rodney Ellis (D-Houston), passed the
Texas Senate and House without dissent. It would have let county
commissioners courts set up a council to select attorneys, contract
with an outside association to appoint them or leave the power with
the judges.
</P>
<P>
   But judges, particularly in Houston, complained to the governor
that it stripped them of power.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert, noting that the bill would have required attorneys to
be appointed for poor defendants who request them within 20 days,
said, ``Most jurisdictions in the United States provide a lawyer
within 72 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But for some folks in Texas the idea of providing even minimal
constitutional protections for poor defendants is a step too far,''
Herbert wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one of those folks appears to be that beacon of
compassionate conservatism _ you've heard of him _ George W.
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the argument over need for the bill. Bush called it a
``drastic'' removal of power from judges and said ordering release
of defendants not assigned a lawyer within 20 days ``poses a danger
to public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis County District Judge Bob Perkins, a Democrat, said
judges know lawyers best and appoint them in Austin within 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Sharlot, dean of the University of Texas Law School,
called the proposed change desirable because it would ``give both
rich and poor defendants full access to the system.''
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't be alone if you suspected it was Ellis who
contacted Herbert. But though his office helped provide information
to Herbert, the push for the column came from civil rights
attorneys in Atlanta and Houston, said Ellis' top aide, Deece
Eckstein.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen B. Bright, with the Southern Center for Human Rights in
Atlanta, confirmed he had sent to Herbert copies of articles he has
written about Texas' justice process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judges (in Texas) have been so much a part of the problem
instead of part of the solution that I said to Bob Herbert and
others, `This is something you might want to keep an eye on,'''
Bright said. ``If anyone cared anything at all about fairness, they
would certainly care about this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas is No. 1 in executions, Bright noted, ``and the fact that
the governor's a part of all that is certain to become an issue at
some point. What Texas is doing would certainly be unthinkable in a
lot of other states.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis has been in South Africa for a week, Eckstein said. But
Bush turning thumbs down on the bill that passed the Legislature
without dissent makes him culpable, Eckstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Bush vetoed the bill, it wasn't his system,'' Eckstein
said. ``He's no longer the governor of a state that had a bad
system. Now it's his system.''

 &HT;    River of dirty air mucks up one of Texas' most grand vistas
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG BEND NATIONAL PARK, Texas _ The Window View Trail pamphlet
hedges its claim, and for good reason. It says that at this spot,
where a vulcanian basin in the Chisos range opens up in a V, one
can drink in 35 miles of desert vista ``on a clear day.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not clear days.
</P>
<P>
   These are milky days, days in which Big Bend's grand Window is
fogged. Even on good days visibility is limited. On the worst days,
say the locals, visibility is cut to 20 miles in and around the
park.
</P>
<P>
   Which is mystifying, since no one is around, seemingly, to dirty
up the air. Unlike national parks saturated with gas-guzzling rigs,
Big Bend's 801,163 acres swallow up its many visitors. It has a
sense of asylum many national parks lack anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Towering century plants _ the agave and lechuguilla _ reach high
from parched earth, seemingly to spare their blossoms from wild
passers by. On days like this it seems they're just trying to catch
a breath.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, responding to what might have been dismissed as
rants of a few environmentalists, the Texas Natural Resources
Conservation Commission held a hearing in nearby Alpine about air
pollution. One hundred and fifty people showed up, ranging from
aging hippies to ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't satisfied with the state's response to the problem,
particularly its dismissing Big Bend's veil as ``regional haze''
and its casual pointing of a finger across the border.
</P>
<P>
   True, Mexico may be Big Bend's biggest air problem. Two
coal-fired electric plants in northern Mexico, ominously monikered
Carbon I and Carbon II, belch out uncontrolled tons of sulfur
dioxide. The plants have controls for some pollutants like grimy
particulates and nitrous oxides. But sulfur dioxide doesn't become
a problem until it's somebody else's problem. It leaves the
smokestack barely visible, only becoming a real nuisance downwind
when chemical reactions turn it to sulfate.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Bend Regional Sierra Club has mounted a postcard
campaign to urge Mexicans to get their government to respond to
this issue. It also plans a ``Hands Across the Border'' conference
to talk up mutual concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But the last thing Big Bend's neighbors want to do is focus all
their attention on Mexico. Texas has much attending to do.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 preliminary field study involving the Environmental
Protection Agency and the U.S. Parks Service raised concerns that
pollution from North Texas, particularly what's called the
``lignite belt'' of coal-burning electric plants, was contributing
to the problem, too.
</P>
<P>
   A more definitive study to trace the sources of the haze is soon
to commence. Mexico initially was ready to commit itself
wholeheartedly to the effort, but reportedly has backed out.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, focusing too heavily on Mexico can blind us to our
own responsibilities. For too long we stood by while the panoramas
of the Grand Canyon were carved away by pollution attributed
largely to two electric plants to its west and its east. After a
successful lawsuit by environmentalists, a crackdown resulted in a
90 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide at the Navajo Generating
Station near Page, Ariz. Recently the Mojave generator in Nevada
agreed to similar controls.
</P>
<P>
   Days ago I saw with my own eyes, which expected the worst, that
visibility in the Grand Canyon seems stabilized. Parks service
experts agree, but aren't satisfied. We all deserve better.
</P>
<P>
   We can do something about the soiling of our air. We need to
lean heavily on Mexico. Texas needs to follow through on
initiatives from this legislative session to clean up electric
plants and other industrial polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing pollution where there's no one to pollute brings home one
truth: It's everyone's air.

 &HT;    Rough seas: Marineland fights to regain lost glory
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARINELAND, Fla. _ Rust stains mar the giant fish tank and
pounding waves have eaten away a deck overlooking the ocean, but
when the trained dolphins leap high in twisting flips at the midday
show, visiting children still squeal with delight.
</P>
<P>
   Once Florida's most popular tourist attraction, this pioneering
oceanarium has fallen on hard times. Travelers who once cruised by
Marineland on State Road A1A now bypass the area on Interstate 95,
speeding toward the bigger, brighter, newer mega-attractions in
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Cute penguins, playful dolphins and a sea lion batting balls
with its nose still fascinate the youngsters, but older kids
typically want high-thrill, high-priced rides based on ``Star
Wars'' or the Terminator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to compete with SeaWorld and Disney, because we
can't,'' said David Internoscia, interim manager of the 60-year-old
attraction just south of St. Augustine. ``We're aiming for a mix of
education, research and entertainment. About 75 percent of our
clientele now is school groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether those groups will be enough to keep Marineland in
business is still an open question.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling with declining attendance for decades, the
attraction declared bankruptcy, closed briefly last year and
reopened three months ago under the management of a nonprofit
foundation. A complicated series of deals has seen most of the land
_ more than 100 acres of gorgeous open beachfront and picturesque
dunes _ sold to the state and local governments for a park and
recreation area.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most hopeful: Jim Jacoby, an Atlanta developer, has
obtained about 40 acres immediately adjacent to Marineland where he
hopes to build an eco-tourism venture that will feature an
environmentally friendly hotel and dolphin-therapy research
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to build a real demonstration model, an
environmentally sustainable eco-village of the future,'' said John
Bevilaqua, Jacoby's marketing chief. ``There will be passive solar
power, electric cars, bike paths, foot paths and energy-conserving
buildings. There will be a small, upscale hotel, a spa and a
research and education center.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby hopes to start a dolphin therapy program in which
children with developmental problems such as autism can interact
with the animals.
</P>
<P>
   Work on his project begins this summer with the demolition of
two aging hotels on the property, with construction to follow
shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   But while it may bring new tourists to the area, Jacoby's
operation will have no direct links to Marineland, which is
struggling to break even on a consistent basis.
</P>
<P>
   Looming over the future like a black cloud is a $9.6 million
debt owed to bondholders from a previous attempt to redevelop the
park. The foundation is holding talks with the bondholders in hopes
of renegotiating the debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would save the facility,'' said Internoscia. ``But if it
isn't approved, it will go to public bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it reopened in March, Marineland has been operating in the
black, with 600 to 1,000 visitors per day, Internoscia said. He has
slashed the payroll in half and cut other expenses, while funneling
scarce funds toward aintenance and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   An escape from the crowds
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest factors in Marineland's favor seems to be the
fact that it isn't big, pricey and crowded. Admission is just $12
for adults, a bargain compared to $44 for most of Orlando's parks.
The cozy atmosphere lets children get up-close with the animal
performers, and there are no lines of sun-baked visitors like in
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the nostalgia factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first came here in 1947 with my parents, and we loved it,''
said Jack Bechtel of Boyertown, Pa., who recently brought his
grandchildren to Marineland. ``Now I want my grandson to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marineland's history is a colorful combination of science and
tourism schmaltz. Founded in 1938 by a Hollywood movie producer,
Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, it was used for more than a decade
for filming underwater movie scenes, including the 1954 science
fiction cult classic ``Creature From the Black Lagoon.'' The
facility was opened to the public in the 1950s after trainers
taught tricks to several of the dolphins. Throughout the 1960s,
Marineland reigned as Florida's most visited attraction, drawing
thousands every week.
</P>
<P>
   But those were the days before interstate highways, when a
Florida vacation usually meant a trip to the beach with perhaps a
stop at a nature-based roadside attraction such as Marineland,
Silver Springs or Cypress Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The construction of I-95 in the 1960s took most of the traffic
15 miles inland, away from Marineland, and the opening of Walt
Disney World in 1971 brought the dawn of a new era in Sunshine
State tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Marineland's steady decline began, and through the years the
dwindling crowds saw the facility deteriorate. Rust popped out on
the giant metal tanks holding corrosive sea water, while peeling
paint and broken concrete grandstands added to the air of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years the place was run by dolphin trainers who weren't
that good at maintenance, budgets and finance,'' said Internoscia,
an accountant by trade. ``We've got a lot of work to do, but we're
on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Marineland's most valuable assets are its 19 dolphins, which
would be worth well into the six figures if sold to other marine
parks. But Internoscia is determined to make a go of the park, and
he believes the constant stream of school groups _ lured by the
discount price of $5 a head _ could be Marineland's salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to carve out a niche,'' he said. ``We want
to be the top marine education facility around.''

 &HT;    Blank uses documentaries as his voice By Alison Maco
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Although not all of Les Blank's documentaries
are about musicians, many writers call him an ethnomusicologist
because of the intimate manner in which he captures performers like
Dizzy Gillespie and Mance Lipscomb _ playing music and living life,
seemingly unaware of the camera's presence.
</P>
<P>
   But Blank doesn't consider himself an ethnomusicologist. ``I'm
not that orderly in the way I gather information,'' he said during
a recent phone interview from the offices of Flower Films, his San
Francisco Bay area-based production company.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there was very little order in the way he made one of
his earliest works, ``The Blues Accordin' to Lightnin' Hopkins''
(1969), which the award-winning filmmaker screened Wednesday at the
Alamo Drafthouse Cinema as part of this month's Texas Documentary
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Blank came to Austin was during the 1995 South by
Southwest Film Festival, and he told AustinAmerican-Statesman
writer Don McLeese the following story about working with Hopkins
in the late 1960s. After a long first day of shooting, during which
the mercurial Texas bluesman had played about 10 songs for the
camera, Hopkins kicked out Blank and his producer Skip Gerson,
saying he never recorded more than 10 songs for an album and he
wouldn't do it for a film.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling dejected and desperate to finish his film, Blank noticed
that Hopkins was playing cards with his friends. He engaged Hopkins
in a conversation about the game, called Pity Pair (``It's a pity
if you don't get a pair,'' said Blank). Hopkins invited him to
play. Blank promptly lost his last $60.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found this very amusing,'' said the filmmaker recently,
``and invited me to come back and try my luck the following day.''
</P>
<P>
   Blank borrowed some money and returned the next day, only to
lose again to Hopkins. However, the bluesman agreed to finish
shooting the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought we weren't so bad after all,'' Blank said with a
chuckle as he recalled the incident 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Florida, Blank began making documentaries in the
1960s after graduating from Tulane University with an undergraduate
degree in English literature and a master's degree in theater.
Between 1967 and 1972, Blank started his production company and
worked on industrial films to make ends meet. After 1972, Blank
devoted himself full-time to independent documentary filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   One of his best-known documentaries is ``Burden of Dreams''
(1982), which chronicles the making of German filmmaker Werner
Herzog's doomed epic ``Fitzcarraldo.'' ``Burden of Dreams'' won
numerous awards for its unflinching behind-the-scenes portrait in
which Herzog reveals a passion for filmmaking that teeters on the
brink of insanity.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after ``Burden of Dreams,'' Blank made ``Gap-Toothed
Women,'' which also screened Wednesday at the Alamo. The
documentary is a lively meditation on, among other things, the myth
that gap-toothed beauties are sexier than the average woman. Blank
interviewed about 30 gap-toothed women, including '70s supermodel
Lauren Hutton. One woman, after biting into a piece of food,
describes the gap as her ``signature.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his own signature, Blank was hesitant to
categorize himself. ``I've been told I have a style. I've been told
that if someone saw one of my films, they could say who made it.''
</P>
<P>
   A respect for his subjects and a genuine appreciation for who
they are come through in Blank's documentaries. The absence of
voice-over in his films is another characteristic of his style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also reflects my lack of articulateness to be able to
define what the whole thing's about,'' Blank said of this
technique, and his explanation echoes Hopkins' definition of the
blues. Instead of explaining with words, Hopkins tells us early on
in the documentary that he lets his songs do the talking for him.
</P>
<P>
   Blank uses his own talent in a similar fashion. ``There are
certain things I can't say in words, and that's why I make movies.
I feel I've said something without having to use words to say it.''

money. Without adequate public oversight to ensure that these human
services are being delivered effectively and efficiently, it is
harmful to children, the poor, the disabled and the elderly of
Texas. It allows taxpayer money to be wasted and hurts all Texans.

   TRAVEL-MAPS _ In which we consider that much-cursed,
much-consulted fact of summer vacation, the road map. Automobile
road maps first apperared with automobiles a century ago. From the
teens through the '70s, millions were printed and given away for
free. Now you have to buy them--if you don't have a computerized
one in your dashboard. We unfold the history, talk to collectors,
visit the map archives in Chicago, weave in the romance of
cartography. Yes, romance; a map is just lines on paper, but as
Jack Kerouac and others have noted, those lines can unleash some
poerful yearnings. (Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)WITH

   MOVIE REVIEWS FROM ATLANTA
</P>
<P>
   REVIEW-DADDY _ Movie review of ``Big Daddy.'' It's Adam
Sandler's latest surefire moneymaker. The movie nimbly ties
together elements from his successful date movie ``The Wedding
Singer'' (boyish innocence and charm to woo the women in the
audience) and his even more successful yukfest ``The Waterboy''
(scatalogical scatting just for the boys). Throw in an itty-bitty
kid for Sandler to pal around with and you've got the makings of a
mack-daddy movie. Grade: B. (Longino, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15.

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ There is something satisfying about the sorry
spectacle of the genius neglected,'' Peter Gay writes of the most
revered name in classical music, ``something romantic about the
contrast between the lonely artist and the philistine world in
which he is forced to live, and die.'' Such a genius _ or so we
imagine _ was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, buried in a pauper's grave,
unappreciated in his own time. It makes for a real tearjerker, and
the Mozart that Peter Shaffer conceived for stage and screen 15
years ago brought forth buckets. But the truth, as usual, is less
romantic, and, as Gay deftly shows, closer to the grain of ordinary
life. ``Mozart'' is another in Viking's Penguin Lives series, brief
biographies of major figures by contemporary writers, and it is by
all odds a signal achievement. (Skube, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 25. FOR SUNDAY.

about time Americans had a taste of decent coffee; until recently,

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ There is something satisfying about the sorry
spectacle of the genius neglected,'' Peter Gay writes of the most
revered name in classical music, ``something romantic about the
contrast between the lonely artist and the philistine world in
which he is forced to live, and die.'' Such a genius _ or so we
imagine _ was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, buried in a pauper's grave,
unappreciated in his own time. It makes for a real tearjerker, and
the Mozart that Peter Shaffer conceived for stage and screen 15
years ago brought forth buckets. But the truth, as usual, is less
romantic, and, as Gay deftly shows, closer to the grain of ordinary
life. ``Mozart'' is another in Viking's Penguin Lives series, brief
biographies of major figures by contemporary writers, and it is by
all odds a signal achievement. (Skube, Atlanta

 &HT;    See NYC's bright lights on a budget
 &HT;    By Ray Marcano
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Start spreading the news _ you can travel to New York City and
not break the bank.
</P>
<P>
   How can that be, in a city in which $300-a-night room rates,
$50-per-person dinners and $65 theater tickets aren't uncommon?
Easy. Hunt for bargains and get to know Manhattan before you go,
and your trip will be a lot of fun without sending you deep in
debt.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to go and have been scared off by price, here
are a few tips.
</P>
<P>
   Lodging: A hotel doesn't have to cost several hundred dollars a
night. If you don't have to stay in Midtown, check out some of the
hotels just over the river in New Jersey. Secaucus, for example,
has several hotels and motels that range from $89 and up per night
(plus a 6 percent room tax). Some even offer free continental
breakfasts. Secaucus is just a few miles from midtown Manhattan,
and you can catch a bus to Midtown for $2.35 per person each way
(it's the No. 320). From there you catch the subway to any
destination in the city.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to stay in Midtown, get a hotel through
www.priceline.com on the Internet. On Priceline, you tell the
service how much you want to spend per night and the service
selects a hotel for you. Some warning: You have to give a credit
card number (although you can do that over the phone); the service
picks the hotel for you and you don't have a say in the matter;
once Priceline picks the hotel your credit card is automatically
charged and you can't get a refund _ so if the trip gets canceled,
you're stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the service, for some users, is terrific. I'll be in New
York this fall, and by using Priceline I'm staying at a first-class
hotel on 51st Street and Seventh Avenue for $113 a night _ tax
included. In all, that's just $15 more than the Secaucus option
(when including bus fare, train fare), and well worth the
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use Priceline to set your own airfare, but that's
even more of a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   You have to consent to making at least one stop along the way,
and that could be anywhere. So be careful.
</P>
<P>
   Meals: First, avoid the hotel restaurants. You'll spend $20 on
two eggs and some toast. Instead, go to one of the many delis or
grab a bite from a street vendor. You'll get a real bagel with
butter (not this Midwest thick bread that passes as a bagel) and
coffee for as little as $1. If you want something larger, eggs, a
bagel and coffee can be had for less than $3 at most delis.
</P>
<P>
   For lunch, get New York hot dogs _ again from street vendors _
for $1.50 each, loaded up with onions, relish, sauerkraut and more.
</P>
<P>
   For dinner, get a large New York pizza. There is nothing like a
fresh-made New York slice, and you can get a whole pie _ enough to
feed three easily _ for less than $12. If you want something
fancier, find a midtown deli or dinner that serves all kinds of
food for less than $10 per person. Get incredible hero sandwiches
with roast or corned beef, pastrami or other staples that are meals
in themselves, and are far superior to any chain sandwich stuff.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a sweet tooth, you're in a lot of trouble. Get a
black and white cookie _ very large, half with chocolate, half with
vanilla frosting _ for $1 to $1.25. How about an Italian ice
(cherry, lemon, other flavors) scraped out of the case for about
$1? Then there are the incredible array of danishes and pastries as
well as East Coast staples found in any deli _ Devil Dogs and Ring
Dings. At these prices, you won't have to watch your expenses, but
you will have to watch your waistline.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around: Seeing the sights won't cost an arm and a leg,
either. You can simply walk through any of Manhattan's incredible
areas _ Central Park, Midtown, Greenwich Village, Soho _ and admire
the shops, landmark stores and incredible architecture. For
example: You can start at 96th Street and Broadway, walk a few
blocks over to Central Park, then walk all the way down Central
Park West to 59th Street and Columbus Circle. From there, head down
Broadway to Times Square. If you're not used to walking you'll be
exhausted; if you can't make it all the way, hop on a bus for
$1.50. If walking doesn't bother you, you'll see several terrific
sights.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy a pass to see six great New York attractions,
including the Empire State Building, for $28 _ about half of what
it would normally cost. Those passes are available in Madison
Square Garden and other tourist spots.
</P>
<P>
   Clubbing: Entertainment can be free or nearly so, especially
during the week. Pick up a copy of The Village Voice _ it's free _
and look for clubs that charge no cover or admission. There are
several in the Village that are within walking distance of each
other. You'll have to buy drinks, so expect to pay $5 to $6 for a
beer and $6 and up for a mixed drink. But if a couple has two
drinks each, you can still have a night out for about $20, with
music, and that's not bad anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Souvenirs: When on your New York walking tour you'll find shops
that have New York T-shirts, three for $10; I even found a few that
had four for $10. You can get all kinds of hats _ New York Yankees,
New York emblems, anything you'd like, two for $10.
</P>

born and raised in the Bronx. He goes back to New York on occasion
for pizza, hot dogs and the Yankees. You can reach him at

But 18 years ago, Christopher Carson was ``the worst of the

Godwin, a 25-year prosecutor in Harris County, Texas. ``Now it's

U.S. GOVERNMENT HONORS HISTORIC GAY SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time, the federal government has
given landmark status to a gay and lesbian site, putting New York's
Stonewall Inn on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   The bar on Christopher Street in New York's Greenwich Village
was the scene of several nights of strident protests and fighting
after police raided it in the early hours of June 28, 1969 _ nearly
30 years ago. After the arrest of patrons and employees, protesters
assembled in the street and, by throwing pennies, beer cans and
other objects, forced police to retreat back into the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Widely viewed as the birthplace of the gay civil rights
movement, the Stonewall over the years has become a focal point for
homosexual activists. New York's annual Pride Parade for gays and
lesbians routinely passes in front of the Stonewall.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Interior Department Assistant Secretary John Berry
unveiled the plaque at the bar. He compared the Stonewall uprising
with other American historical events such as the Boston Tea Party,
the battle of Gettysburg and the signing of the Declaratino of
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the heat of a summer's night here at Stonewall that led
to the creation of a new civil rights movement for America,'' Berry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, President Clinton cited the Stonewall in a
proclamation declaring June to be Gay and Lesbian Pride Month. He
called the original Stonewall protesters ``a courageous group of
citizens (who) resisted harassment and mistreatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The rioting set ``in motion a chain of events'' that led to
``the birth of the modern gay and lesbian civil rights movement,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Department spokesman Tim Ahern said that of the 68,000
listings on the national register, no others were for gay and
lesbian sites. ``The Stonewall is the first and most significant,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the Stonewall, police harassment of gay bars was
routine not only in New York but in other cities as well, according
to David Smith, communications director of the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian civil rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Police often raided such establishments on the pretext of
enforcing liquor licensing or morals laws, he said. ``Establishing
the Stonewall as an historic landmark is a very important symbolic
gesture for our movement,'' he said. ``The Stonewall has enormous
cultural significance for our community.''

HE'S BAAAACK! THIS TIME, ADAM SANDLER DOES FATHERHOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not since Bill Murray has a ``Saturday Night Live'' player
claimed stardom on his own terms like Adam Sandler. In fact,
Sandler has made a career for himself by following in Murray's
footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Waterboy,'' he played a slurring crackpot who talked in
a side-of-his-mouth patter like Murray's groundskeeper in
``Caddyshack.'' But Sandler doesn't exhibit Murray's streak of
psychosis. In ``Happy Gilmore,'' Sandler displayed a hilariously
uncontrollable rage, but more often, Sandler plays a spoiled lug
whose charm comes from his saying whatever's on his mind and
following his slob impulses, as he does in ``Big Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a lot like ``Stripes,'' in which Murray was a
smart-aleck loser who tried to use the Army as a dodge and walked
out of the service a better human being. (And the movie lost its
comic purpose once that happened.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead of joining the Army, Sandler ends up caring for
5-year-old Julian (played by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse), who is
dropped on the doorstep of his best friend (Jon Stewart). It occurs
to Sandler, who plays the not-so-ironically named Sonny, that
having a kid around would be just the way to get his old girlfriend
(Kristy Swanson) back. Not only does that not happen, but it turns
out that having a kid around can really cramp one's style.
</P>
<P>
   Except that Julian doesn't exactly make Sonny a better guy. It's
more like Sonny makes Julian in his own image, indulging the boy's
tendency to make a meal of ketchup and training the kid to urinate
on walls in Manhattan. (It's as if he helps Julian find his inner
child.)
</P>
<P>
   One of ``Big Daddy's'' odd side effects is that the movie casts
a cold light on how intolerant the world can be of parents and kids
_ Sonny and Julian end up using the wall for a bathroom only after
some attitude-radiating jerk of a waiter won't let them use the
restaurant's facility.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Big Daddy'' deepens Sandler's streak of one-of-the-boys
tolerance; this time around, his crew includes a pair of gay
friends and a well-intentioned, accented idiot of a delivery boy
(Rob Schneider). And the biggest plea for tolerance comes from
Sonny's love of the original power balladeers: Styx. (He also gets
in a not-too-subtle shot at critics along the way.)
</P>
<P>
   He shares his love for Styx with Layla (Joey Lauren Adams), the
sister of his best buddy's girlfriend Corinne (Leslie Mann), who
looks down her nose at the underachieving Sandler. (He constantly
ridicules Mann, who put herself through medical school by working
at Hooters _ like I said, it's a one-of-the-boys comedy.)
</P>
<P>
   Adams takes a shine to both Sandler and his sorta-son, who share
as much chemistry as Sandler had with Drew Barrymore in ``The
Wedding Singer.'' It helps that Julian has the face of a tulip _
his doe-eyed look of misery will elicit the kind of ``awww'' that
will make ``Big Daddy'' a perfect date movie.
</P>
<P>
   This movie doesn't have the wild streak of my favorite Sandler
movie, ``Happy Gilmore,'' which was directed by ``Big Daddy''
director Dennis Dugan. ``Gilmore,'' Sandler's tribute to
``Caddyshack,'' features a moment that will go down in pop-culture
history, when Sandler's bad-tempered hockey hack-turned-golf pro
gets into a fistfight with Bob Barker. ``Big Daddy'' has nothing
quite that spectacular. It's like a collection of greatest hits
with one new tune thrown in _ a crowd-pleaser that's guaranteed to
be a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler tones down his brazenness even more than he did for
``The Wedding Singer.'' He shows a kind of ... well, I'm not sure
maturity is the word I'm looking for, but there is an evolution
here. This movie will make a kind of history all the same _ the
moment when the title ``Big Daddy'' came to suit Adam Sandler's
status in the entertainment world.

GORE BACK IN CALIFORNIA, STRIKING GOLD FOR CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Vice President Al Gore is borrowing at least one
political lesson from his boss, President Clinton: If you need
quick campaign cash, head to California.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president swooped into San Francisco Wednesday night
and, after a short stump speech and a little pressing of the flesh,
pocketed more than $600,000 for his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, San Francisco was the second stop on a two-day
campaign and fund-raising swing through the Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, this must be the umpteenth time that we've been
favored with a visit by the vice president to our state,'' Mayor
Willie Brown noted, with some sarcasm, in an introduction at a
$1,000-per-plate dinner at the San Francisco Hilton Hotel. ``It's
as if he's adopted this state as a part of his individual
constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, it is Gore's 57th trip to California as vice
president. And of his five scheduled events, only one is not a
fund-raiser: a visit to the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center.
</P>
<P>
   Past trips have largely revolved around fund-raising as well,
often for the Democratic National Committee. But Gore takes and he
gives. He also has handed out millions in federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   The largess Gore has helped secure for the state was even touted
by his aides in a 3-page memo entitled ``Working for California,''
which was distributed to reporters before Wednesday night's
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president cares about California, and he has come
through time and time again for this state,'' Gov. Gray Davis, a
fellow Democrat, said at the event.
</P>
<P>
   Gore began his speech by reminding the audience of the recession
that afflicted California before he and Clinton entered the White
House in 1993, contrasting it with the state's now flourishing
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot going on here in California that wasn't going on
seven years ago,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The response from the 600 Democratic contributors at the event
was warm. Alec Lambie, 56, of San Francisco, said he was encouraged
by Gore's talk of increased funding for education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds good,'' Lambie said. ``He'll have to get specific
about which particular programs and how he'll put them across. ...
By next fall, we should be able to see the meat of the matter and
what he's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Gore is trying to add to his campaign fund
before June 30, the deadline for presidential candidates to file a
report with the Federal Elections Commission on contributions in
the previous three months. Politicians view the report as a
critical barometer for the financial health of each candidate's
campaign, even though the party nominating conventions are more
than a year away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, at the end of the filing period, you make a
final push,'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   That main fund-raising race is between Gore and the early
Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Although Gore
was expected to raise $1.1 million Wednesday and Thursday in
California, Bush raised $2 million at a single event in Washington,
D.C., on Tuesday.

PACINO REKINDLES HIS LOVE OF THEATER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Given his druthers, you suspect that Al Pacino
might've spent his entire career hunkered down in some overworked,
underpaying off-Broadway theater deconstructing Shakespeare and
honing his avant-garde muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's had to settle for being one of the planet's
biggest movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the entertainment gods can be cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not unusual for successful Hollywood actors of a
certain age to speak wistfully of the theater as their ``first
love,'' just as some burned-out journalists prefer to think of
themselves as frustrated novelists.
</P>
<P>
   But in Pacino's case, the years of dedicated theatrical
craftsmanship speak louder than the cliches. So do his two Tony
Awards, the first of which he earned in 1969 for his performance as
a drug addict in ``Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?'' the second for
playing a nondescript nobody caught up in the turmoil of the
Vietnam War in a 1977 revival of ``The Basic Training of Pavlo
Hummel.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, when he wasn't making movies, Pacino has
returned to live theater, tackling everything from the title role
in ``Richard III'' (which he also filmed) to Oscar Wilde's
``Salome'' and a rave-inducing 1982 revival of David Mamet's
``American Buffalo.''
</P>
<P>
   Those occasions have allowed the Oscar-winning actor to
reconnect with the challenges of stepping out in front of a live
audience, minus the safety net that movies provide in the form of
skillful cinematographers and sympathetic editors.
</P>
<P>
   Pacino will walk the tightrope again this summer at the Mark
Taper Forum, where he'll be directing and starring in Eugene
O'Neill's ``Hughie,'' a brief, little-known two-character drama by
the author of ``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' and ``The Iceman
Cometh.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Pacino, 59, spoke of the occupational
hazards of stage acting with evident satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the feeling of the journey, going out there and you
can't turn back,'' he said. ``Generally, you really are, in movies,
just trying to get by, trying to live within the wires.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the millions who've seen his films, only a relative
handful of people have witnessed Pacino's stage work. By all
accounts, the Method-trained actor brings the same compacted
intensity to a 1,200-seat house that he does to his big-screen
portrayals of manic low lifes (``Dog Day Afternoon''), calculating
Cosa Nostra dons (``The Godfather'' series) and iconoclastic cops
(``Serpico,'' ``Heat'').
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hughie,'' Pacino plays Erie Smith, a Times Sqaure hustler,
gambler and horseplayer who, in the wee morning hours, bends the
ear of a night clerk (Paul Benedict) at the run-down Manhattan
hotel where Erie lives. Erie has just come off a five-day alcohol
binge occasioned by the funeral of Hughie, the previous night
clerk, who for years had been a willing co-conspirator in Erie's
chronic self-delusions.
</P>
<P>
   For Pacino, ``Hughie'' is practically an extended monologue,
during which the bored night clerk's thoughts wander hither and
yon, according to stage notes supplied by O'Neill that are never
spoken aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Do O'Neill's italicized prompts actually help, or are they
distracting?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know, you try not to read those things,'' Pacino
says. ``Usually you'll get them later as you get into rehearsal.
But it gives you a general idea of a sense of what was going on
with O'Neill at the time and what he was thinking about. That's
what intrigued me, really, how to communicate that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned before (that) this is the same author who wrote
`The Hairy Ape' and wrote `Strange Interlude.' (`Hughie') is this
kind of expressionism, which made me think it's possible to
actually voice the hotel clerk's ruminations. And it has to balance
the play, too. Where there is the touch of irony or humor, I think
it comes through a little more, in that juxtaposition.''
</P>
<P>
   To communicate the night clerk's subliminal ruminations, Pacino
briefly thought of adding another person on stage to read O'Neill's
editorial asides. Then, after trying out different approaches, he
came up with another idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to set it up in such a way that there's a different
tone in his voice when he's speaking (his thoughts),'' Pacino
explains. ``We spent a lot of time trying to find the right kinds
of sounds and present something that would give us the sense that
he's (thinking out loud).''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has been down this road before _ he first did
``Hughie'' in 1996 at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Conn. _
Pacino speaks of the L.A. revival as if he were wrestling with a
freshly minted drama instead of returning to an obscure,
70-year-old piece that O'Neill himself never intended to be
produced.
</P>
<P>
   In conversation, Pacino gives you the idea that his background
as a New York actor, trained by the venerable Lee Strasberg, is
never far from his mind when he sets about constructing a
character. ``I just read a Chekhov story the other day ...'' he'll
begin an anecdote, then digress into a point-by-point reminiscence
of a show he saw at a downtown New York theater 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Later, responding to a question about stage-acting methodology,
he launches into a quietly impassioned soliloquy about ``finding a
way to discover this play'' and the ``whole sense of adventure''
that comes from making dramatic sense of a difficult text.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always taken me a little longer to come to something,''
he says, ``and I'm happy that it does. And with Shakespeare, I'm
not ready to start until the run's over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, that's what I was saying in `Richard III' (his 1996
`Looking for Richard,' a documentary-style film about his staging
of the Shakespeare play). You're not going to get the play, you're
going to get pieces of it. But as you learn it, you're forced to
digest it, and it's with you in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   That aforementioned ``sense of adventure'' is why Pacino prefers
what he calls the ``fluidity'' of live performance vs. the
``fragmentation'' of film. When Hollywood came knocking 30 years
ago, ``It was suddenly a life that I wasn't prepared for,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to feel that in order to do a movie, one has to
have an appetite, because there's so much that goes into it. For
me, (film acting) is an exhausting experience _ not just the acting
itself (but) the being uprooted from where you are and sitting
seven or eight hours in a camper. As Orson Welles said, that's
really what you are paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   While the movies have made his fortune, Pacino still harkens
back to a memory of seeing a performance of Anton Chekhov's ``The
Seagull'' that he says changed his life. At the time he was ``just
a kid from the South Bronx,'' and that experience ``was the moment
that changed me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the line `People don't do things like this' at the
end of the play,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never heard anything like that. It was a whole (new)
world, like my whole life I was walking around and I had never
looked up at the sky _ and looking at that was like looking at the
sky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There I was, this kid sitting up in the third balcony. It's
like this ticket fell out of heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   And while great acting parts rarely drop from the sky _ either
in film or in theater _ Pacino seems content, for now, to let the
career chips fall where they may.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, I'm sort of trying to go with the flow. And I'm
happy in the sense that I don't know what the next thing is I'm
going to do. So maybe I can listen to these passions that are
there. 'Cause you don't _ for the most part.'' &QL;

FILM GETS LOST IN SEARCH FOR SEXUALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Probably no one makes more of those ``What does he think he's
doing?'' movies than writer/director Mike Figgis. He's out to
exhibit the mysteries of sex in a style that's one part film noir,
one part Calvin Klein commercial and one part Enya video. In his
newest film, the convoluted and pretentious puzzle ``The Loss of
Sexual Innocence,'' those who don't get up and walk out may be too
hypnotized by the imagery. And you can tell that all this tony,
film-school philosophizing means something to Figgis _ he's not
just showing off.
</P>
<P>
   This journey of self-discovery by lead character Nic (Julian
Sands) screams art film. Nic is trying to make sense of sex
throughout his entire life. As a teen, he's played by Jonathan
Rhys-Meyers, whose sculpted nose and mouth bear no resemblance to
Sands _ it's almost as if he's imagining himself as a
different-looking person when he was younger. But so much of this
adult fairy tale is annoying that stopping to nitpick over any one
point feels like a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Figgis can generate excitement. The movie jumps back and
forth between Nic's determination to get back to Africa, where he's
from, to an Adam-and-Eve story in which Adam is black and Eve is
white. (His ``first couple'' are so beautiful it's like Adam and
Eve themselves have answered some cosmic casting call.) Figgis'
reflex to change people's perceptions is touching, as is one of
Figgis' subplots, about twins separated at birth. It has so much
resonance that it may make you think about how horrible ``The
Parent Trap'' would be if twins were ``really'' separated at birth.
This section alone demands that the movie be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual Innocence'' is more like Figgis collected ideas that
wouldn't stand up as a movie on their own and pressed them into a
kind of film scrapbook. It could have used a lot more thought,
because his instincts veer more toward the hollow panache of a
Levi's ad when he doesn't shape them into a coherent story. But
there are bits, and bits of bits, that you won't soon forget _ if
you don't find the rest of the movie too insufferable.

`HUSBAND' IS IDEAL TREATMENT OF A WILDE IDEA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there a performer around who looks like he loves himself more
than Rupert Everett? Craig Kilborn comes close, but Everett's
slim-lipped hauteur makes him look as if he's blowing kisses to
himself. (That's what was so much fun about watching him in ``My
Best Friend's Wedding'' _ when he launches into ``I Say a Little
Prayer,'' it's like he's serenading himself.)
</P>
<P>
   And his slam-bang affair with, well, Rupert, gives a welcome
sizzle to ``An Ideal Husband,'' which has a glorious undercurrent
of intrigue. And right in the middle of it, there's Everett as Lord
Goring, shaving years off his age and loving every second of his
unabashed hedonism. Even in a waistcoat, his verve breaks through.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' is a handsomely mounted adaptation of
playwright Oscar Wilde's look at the intrigues of longing. Instead
of looking like a big-screen antique catalog, where you'd love
buying the rooms but you can't imagine anybody living in them,
``Husband'' is stocked with people you can relate to. Especially
Julianne Moore's roguish Mrs. Cheveley: As she prowls the rooms,
her smirk is initially entrancing, until it's evident just how
lowdown she can be.
</P>
<P>
   It's a marvel of a performance _ her opportunism is simply an
accessory to her, like pearls for the evening. Her tony cool is so
well-practiced that she makes Minnie Driver (who plays Mabel) come
off as a jumpy suburbanite in a school play.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cheveley inflicts her deviousness on the hapless Sir
Robert, played by Jeremy Northam. Northam shows restrained pain
beautifully; his despair is glimpsed through his thin veneer of
ice. His reserve comes from a fear of being found out. He's being
blackmailed by Mrs. Cheveley, and his past threatens his marriage
to Lady Chiltern (Cate Blanchett), whose idealism is nevertheless a
little tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   In this production, knowingness is key, and Goring and Cheveley
seem to have been hatched in the same bird's-eye-view nest, proudly
sidling up to each other in a corner and slicing up magnificent
dish about every loser in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Goring is capable of decency _ his feelings about
his friend Sir Robert make him dangerously close to human. As
Goring works to rouse himself from the paradise of his self-regard
and pursuit of women long enough to help his friend, ``Husband''
drizzles a glaze of warmth over its intricate, cold machinery. But
not too much to diminish its wicked, intelligent fun.

AIRLINE MOVIES OUT OF REACH _ FOR NOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is there any way to buy the airline version of a film, which
has the profanity and sex edited out?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.M., Richland Hills, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: At present, none of the major film studios is selling
``airline'' or ``family edited'' versions of its films for video
release.
</P>
<P>
   The Dove Foundation and the Video Software Retailers Association
have called on studios to release the versions of R-rated films
that are shown on airlines, which are often edited to remove
profanity, violence or sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   Dove recommends films by awarding ``family approved'' and
``family edited'' seals that can be displayed by video retailers.
So far, no ``edited'' seals have been issued because studios aren't
selling these versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is not giving the public what they want,'' said Dave
Lukens, Dove's development director. ``We think Hollywood would be
surprised by the choices the public would make if tamer versions
were also available.''
</P>

Broadmoor, Grand Rapids, MI 49512, or visit the Web site

CABBIE'S MIDLIFE CRISIS TOLD WITH COMPASSION

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The fine Indian actor Om Puri gives a world-class
performance in ``My Son the Fanatic'' as, interestingly, a man
discovering that he has no place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In this complex piece of cross-cultural tragicomedy, written
with astute insight by Hanif Kureishi (``My Beautiful Laundrette'')
and directed by Udayan Prasad (``Brothers in Trouble''), Puri plays
put-upon Parvez. An immigrant from Pakistan who's spent the last 25
years driving a cab around the dreary north England town of
Bradford, Parvez has long been contented enough with his
comfy-if-cramped home, his little family and the basement rumpus
room where he indulges the solitary joys of good Scotch and
Dixieland jazz records.
</P>
<P>
   A series of events, however, force Parvez to examine his
unremarkable existence. His son Farid (Akbar Kurtha) suddenly calls
off his engagement to an English girl, the first of many steps down
a path toward Islamic fundamentalism. His long-disappointed wife
Minoo (Gopi Desai) sets to wondering aloud why Parvez hasn't done
as well as his more ambitious buddies from the old country. Then a
wealthy German businessman (Stellan Skarsgard) comes to town to
party hearty, and in the process both abuses the driver-procurer
and encourages him to get more carnal fun out of life.
</P>
<P>
   Most disorienting of all, however, is the growing mutual
affection between the German's favorite prostitute, Bettina (Rachel
Griffiths), and Parvez. Far from the standard
hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold, Bettina is a relatively intelligent,
sensitive sort who makes a true emotional connection with the
much-older cabbie. Their relationship is propelled by the magnetic
tenderness of two searching souls tentatively orbiting kindred _
but otherwise inappropriate _ spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Rewarding as this affair is, it of course exacerbates the many
crises in Parvez's life. The personal becomes alarmingly political
as Farid and his radical friends organize an anti-prostitution
campaign. But even without his son's wholesale rejection of his
liberal-minded outlook, Parvez can't help but face the long-avoided
fact that the place he feels most comfortable living is a place
that will always consider him, if not an outsider, at least not a
full-fledged member of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Told almost entirely from Parvez's point of view, ``Fanatic''
ranks among the screen's most complete and compassionate
midlife-crisis movies. Never straining too much nor failing to give
a feeling its full emotional weight, Puri captures all the
contradictions that sustain this deceptively complicated man. He
shows how a guy can cherish his family while still needing to cheat
on his wife, put up with prejudice if that's the trade-off for a
little extra personal freedom, and define pride as a kind of
self-honesty that has nothing to do with prescribed notions of
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Son the Fanatic'' presents a rare drama indeed: a man
growing at a time in his life when that's the last thing anyone,
including himself, expects him to do. &QL;

INKSTER, KUEHNE ARRIVE AT CHAMPIONSHIP FROM DIFFERENT ROUTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ They are nearly a generation apart and at
different points in their playing careers, but US Women's Open
champion Juli Inkster and Kelli Kuehne understand each other quite
well as they begin the LPGA Championship at Dupont CC.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, who has two daughters, tries to balance her time
between golf and family, and frequently has older daughter Hayley
with her on tour while golf pro husband Brian is at home to watch
over younger daughter Cori. Keuhne, who is a two-time US Women's
Amateur champion and struggled through her first season on the
tour, is engaged to be married next year and admires the way
Inkster handles her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is not the only thing I want in life,'' said Kuehne,
whose breakthrough victory came last month in the LPGA Corning
Classic in Corning, N.Y. ``I want to have my cake and eat it too. I
want to one day be the best golfer in the world and be a wife and
mother. (Inkster) has two girls that are crazy about her, and she
is a great mother too. She does a great job with balancing other
things with golf, because golf is such a difficult game.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kuehne finished third in the US Women's Open at Old
Waverly GC in West Point, Miss., Inkster went up to her to offer
encouragement. ``I think she will be a very good player out here,''
said Inkster. She works hard at her game. She wants to be good. She
wants to be one of the best players out here. She has a lot of
spunk and you can't teach that. You just have to have it. You have
to have the determination to want to play well, and she has that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though she wasn't exempt, she was out there practicing,
practicing, practicing even when she wasn't in a tournanment. It's
a big jump from college golf to professional golf. She can't
overpower the golf courses and get away with it. She has to have
all of her aspects of her game working, and she has improved on all
aspects. Everybody is on their own page, and I just think it took
her a little longer. Now she knows she can win out here, I think
she will kind of springboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, who has won three times this year and 20 times in a
career that began in 1983, is still on an emotional high after
winning the Open. ``It's been great,'' she said. ``It's been a lot
of fun. It's just a huge tournament and to win the Open is just
kind of like the icing on the cake as far as my career. I'm still
walking around with butterflies in my stomach. I still came back
last week and finished third without practice the week before.''
</P>
<P>
   The family comes first, but winning the Grand Slam would be a
sizable bonus. ``I'm going to have to have another great week to do
it,'' she said. ``It's been a little hectic in my lifestyle and I
just have to focus on my golf game. I think I can do it. I think I
have as good a chance as anybody else out there right now. It's
just the pressure you put on yourself, the pressure that the media
puts on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne, who attended the University of Texas and saw brother
Hank win the US Amateur to become the first brother/sister
combination to win the women's and the men's amateur championships,
said winning should breed winning. ``I wouldn't say it was a
relief,'' she said. I would just say it happened a lot sooner than
I thought it would.''
</P>
<P>
   She told her caddie in the US Open qualifier just before Corning
that she thought she was on the verge of winning. ``I played
well,'' she said. ``It was a confidence booster, and I played well.
It was kind of weird. I just wasn't thinking mechanically about my
golf swing. I was just out there doing it and it was all going
great for me. As I said, it happened a lot sooner than I thought it
would.''
</P>
<P>
   The expectations were too high a year ago, and she lost her
exempt status. ``Last year was one of the hardest things for me,''
she said. ``I expected to win right off the bat. I expected to have
a year like Se Ri Pak had (when she won two majors) and that comes
along every 20 years. It was a lot harder because I put a lot of
pressure on myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most frustrating time of my life. It just seemed
like everything was going against me. I'd hit down the fairway and
it would catch a branch and go out of bounds. Right now if I hit a
ball down the middle of the fairway the tree would make it go 2
yards farther. The tides have turned and things are going well.
Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong last year. It was
just a very difficult year.''

RENDERING UNTO CAESAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that we're all properly enthralled with cut-rate shopping on
the Internet, along comes a chorus of bureaucrats and scholars to
bring us the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those Internet bargains are made possible by the absence
of old-fashioned sales taxes. But this week in Virginia, a band of
bigwigs from government and Internet industries began trying to
work out ways to close this lovely loophole before it grows to the
diameter of the Lincoln Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Advisory Commission on Internet Commerce was set up by
Congress eight months ago, but there's nothing new about
governments railing against out-of-state merchants who don't pay
local taxes. Ever hear of mail-order? The exact same issue arises.
How does a state or city levy sales tax on a retailer doing
business in another state or city?
</P>
<P>
   In general they don't, thanks to a 1992 Supreme Court ruling
that had nothing to do with the Internet. The court held that a
business must have a physical presence in a state before it can be
taxed there. In law, the concept is called ``nexus.'' Whether you
order by mail, phone or the Internet, if the retailer is outside of
Massachusetts and doesn't have a branch office here, he's beyond
the taxman's grip.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, buyers are the ones who really pay sales taxes. If
you order a product from out of state, you're supposed to pay your
state's sales tax. But the only enforcement mechanism is a guilty
conscience. Judging by how few of us pay, none of us is losing any
sleep.)
</P>
<P>
   So it's nexus, not networks, the panel will argue about. Ralph
Tabor, associate legislative director for the National Association
of Counties, hopes Congress will pass a law that sets aside the
Supreme Court's view of the matter. He wants Congress to declare
that a nexus exists whenever a transaction occurs. Sellers would
have to collect the sales tax that applies in the buyer's state,
county or city. Tabor says there's not much chance of such a law
passing anytime soon. But something like it will have to happen
before Internet sales can be taxed in an orderly way.
</P>
<P>
   Say you waved a magic wand and installed a reasonable Internet
sales tax system. How much money would it raise for local
governments? Less than you might think. A fascinating new report
from the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young says that if every sales tax
loophole had been closed last year, the Internet would have
generated a measly $170 million in extra state and local revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Measly? It is when you divide it up among the 6,000 government
bodies that charge such taxes _ or compare it to the $155 billion
these agencies managed to collect last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a forthcoming paper, Jonathan Zittrain, lecturer at Harvard
Law School's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, and
University of Chicago economist Austan Goolsbee, figure lost taxes
at $430 million tops, and probably closer to $210 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly at the moment, it's chicken feed,'' says Zittrain.
But he notes that states are really worried about what will happen
in five or 10 years if a substantial amount of the nation's
retailing goes virtual. The National Association of Counties says
local governments could lose up to $50 billion in tax revenues by
2005. Zittrain isn't looking out that far, but he reckons on $3.5
billion in vanishing taxes by 2003, still a relatively small chunk
of change, but real money at last.
</P>
<P>
   That's why government bodies are determined to bring taxation to
Internet commerce, to the consternation and horror of Internet
mavens who have long argued that the Web is a new universe of
commerce, unfettered by the traditional constraints of
``meatspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Dream on. Internet commerce will be far easier to tax than any
other kind. All transactions are going through computers, remember?
They're rather good at keeping track of who owes what to Caesar.
Once federal, state and local regulators get their acts together,
they'll learn to love Internet commerce, and the needed nexus
reforms will also force phone and mail-order firms to start
collecting taxes. Far from liberating us from taxation, the
Internet will likely make it harder to evade taxes than ever
before, even for those who've never plugged in.

TOYOTA REALIZES: HEY, WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A V-8! 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was some time in coming, but the folks at Toyota have
realized that if they want to break into the big truck market in
North America, they need a V8-powered truck in their stable.
</P>
<P>
   With the new Tundra, they have produced just such a truck, a
truck that can roam the range with the big Chevys and Fords and
Dodges _ out where the big dogs eat.
</P>
<P>
   The Tundra, all full of horsepower and torque, is a big step up
from the Tacoma (a fine, but small truck) and the six-cylinder T100
(which should have been this truck in the first place).
</P>
<P>
   The Tundra is the first Japanese entry into the North American
big truck market, which is exploding particularly with four-door,
five- and six-passenger trucks.
</P>
<P>
   And given that big, V8 pickups are virtually unique to North
America, it comes as no surprise that, when you look at the Tundra,
you see hints of domestic trucks: the rounded roofline and fenders
reminiscent of Dodge; the grill, pure Ford F-series; the pickup bed
more angular, with chrome accents above the wheel wells, looking
like a Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   The market at which the Tundra is aimed _ faithful to brand and
country _ has long been the core of the ``buy-American'' faction of
US customers. To help gain access, Toyota is building the Tundra in
Princeton, Ind., where it hopes to produce 100,000 of the trucks in
the first year and 50,000 new SUVs, built on the same platform, in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell you are dealing with a serious truck simply by
opening and closing the doors, front and rear. They are heavy and
slam with a thud that gives confidence. Getting in and out,
particularly with optional running boards, is easy. The smaller
rear doors open back and past a right angle to make reaching the
rear seat easier.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the seats are very firm. A 60-40 bench or buckets are
options in front, while the rear is a low, vertical-back bench.
With benches front and rear, this is billed as a six-passenger
truck, but adults would not want to do long trips in the back seat
because leg room is tight. Three kids would be fine back there,
though the straight-backed seats might prove uncomfortable on long
trips even for them.
</P>
<P>
   Most controls are housed in a warped-oval panel in the middle of
the dash, and everything about them is large: large buttons, dials,
even the digital numbers on the clock and radio are big. No
squinting needed to see which button or dial you are reaching for,
or what station you've dialed up on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   There are pockets in all four doors for maps and other storage,
a sunglasses holder that drops from center ceiling at the
windshield, and a console that folds down and divides the front
seat in the bench seat model. It has two cupholders up front and
its lid opens to reveal even more storage space.
</P>
<P>
   Get the Tundra out on smooth roads and the ride is superb; only
the fact you are sitting so high keeps reminding you that you are
in a truck. Even on bumps, where the truck gives you a gentle
awareness of what is going on, the ride is smooth and not at all
jarring.
</P>
<P>
   In a wonderful blend of past and present, Toyota has used
suspension control arms and coil springs up front, and leaf springs
in the rear, all bolstered by gas shocks.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise at highway commuter speed and what is striking is the
quiet. Feed it gas to pass and the V8 gives off a smooth and
throaty purr, but no big roar. This is as quiet and smooth a truck
as I have ever driven, almost luxury sedan-like in ride.
</P>
<P>
   It will carry 2,000 pounds of payload and with an optional hitch
has a top towing capacity of 7,200 pounds. And though the four-door
Access Cab model comes with a bed that's only 6.5 feet long, it is
wide enough to take a sheet of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   Offroad, the 315 lbs./ft. of torque make it formidable. Crawling
uphill in low-range, four-wheel drive or using the engine to brake
on steep downgrades let's this torque do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   On a steep gravel grade, the engine is so quiet you can hear and
feel the tires digging for purchase outside. This adds to a
wonderful sense of control.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this contrapuntal combination of power and quiet
is a 4.7 liter, dual overhead cam, 32-valve engine. It's a
variation of the engines found in Lexus and the Toyota Land Cruiser
(it trails the latter beast in torque by only 5 lbs./ft.). This
version has an iron block and aluminum heads and powers the Tundra
from 0-60 in just under 8 seconds, pretty quick for a big truck.
</P>
<P>
   It cruises at 80 at just 2,400 rpms and is not the gas-guzzler
that some other big trucks are. With a combination of highway
commuting (including much time spent in a couple of traffic jams),
running about town, and playing briefly in the woods, it got just
under 17 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The Tundra is available in two-door (with 8-foot bed) and
four-door (6.5-foot bed) models. You can also choose between the V8
and a V6 engine, though the latter would seem to defeat the purpose
of this truck.
</P>
<P>
   Afterall, it is the V8 that has successfully put Toyota trucks
out there where the big dogs eat, so chow down.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX) The two-panel window visors that separate and let you
block the sun coming in the side window and the usual spot atop the
windshield at the same time. No more adjusting as the angle of the
sun keeps changing each time you round a bend.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX) The bright cargo lights that illuminate the bed for a
brief period after you turn the truck off.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX) Toyota should find a way to give the Access Cab an 8-foot
bed. A big truck needs to be a big truck.
</P>
<P>

   But, as is common with parents who make similar choices, she
also has to worry about the financial cost of her decision. The
family lives in an unpretentious two-bedroom apartment in Boston
overlooking a parking lot, and her two sons, 8 and 4, share a room
with bunk beds.
</P>
<P>
   Her freelance status means that she and her husband have to
defer their dream of buying a house with a yard. ``Putting things
on hold is hard,'' she says, gently removing Rubin's arms from
around her neck. ``But I'm happier and we're happier as a

Lise Johnson &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a beautiful June morning, and Dr. Lise Johnson has the day
off, as she does every Thursday, to spend time with her three young
children. But Johnson, 37, a pediatrician in a group practice at
Newton-Wellesley Hospital just outside of Boston, doesn't look
particularly grateful. Kjartan, 5, is drawing pictures on the
kitchen table, Abraham, almost 3, is running around without pants,
and Lilly, the 1-year-old, is crying in Johnson's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crisis central,'' says Johnson wearily. ``We have two
sick kids, one with strep throat and another with an ear infection.
I was just about to take this one's temperature.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson works 3 1/2 days a week and has a supportive husband.
She says she is pleased with the balance she struck between career
and family demands. But she remains acutely aware of the
trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Educated at Harvard Medical School and trained at Massachusetts
General Hospital, she could have had a flourishing career in
academic medicine. But she chose to work reduced hours after she
had her first child, five years ago. And like many doctors who try
to lead a balanced life, she dropped right off the academic ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss teaching, but I don't think about it anymore,'' says
Johnson, as Lilly nestles in her lap drinking from her juice cup.
``I kind of have this attitude _ there's a time for everything, and
right now I want to spend time with my children while they're
young.''
</P>
<P>
   What bothers Johnson more than a lost opportunity to groom the
next generation of medical students is the high-wire act she
performs as a part-time doctor, between meeting the needs of her
patients and reserving time for her children, her husband, and
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a certain amount of guilt in not always being the
person who sees my patients,'' Johnson says. ``If there is an
acutely ill child I'm seeing one day, it's difficult to know you're
not going to be there the next day to follow up on him.''
</P>
<P>
   On the days when she is home, there are the inevitable phone
calls about work. ``My office tries not to bother me, but there are
times when I feel compelled to check on a patient,'' Johnson says.
``I had a kid who was having severe headaches'' and needed an MRI
to look for a possible brain tumor, and ``I wasn't going to be
there that day. I felt it was important to track down the results
of the MRI and communicate them to the parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I had to make at least four or five calls (the MRI proved
negative), and I was needing to do that in the middle of being at
home with a toddler and an infant. At times like that you feel
really torn and resentful.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Johnson is luckier than most, in that her colleagues
and her patients understand and support her arrangement. ``I find
that my patients really value my role as mother, and they want me
to be able to have that role,'' says Johnson, as Lilly finally
falls asleep in her lap. ``To be a mother as a primary care
pediatrician is actually thought of as an asset.'' &QL;

<P>
   The same, unfortunately, is not true of most other professions,
or even most other medical disciplines, according to studies by
Barnett and others. While a smattering of companies, particularly
high-tech ones, accommodate employees who work part time, a 1997
survey of 2,000 professionals found that supervisors and colleagues
do not typically take part-time employees as seriously as full-time
ones.
</P>
<P>
   And that is true for professionals who work less than their
peers but more than what many people would think of as part time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think you're a dilettante,'' says Dr. John Day, a
pulmonary critical care specialist who job-shares with his wife,
also a pulmonary specialist, in a private practice in Worcester,
Mass. Together they work 80 hours a week. ``Of course that's not
something people will ever tell you to your face.''
</P>
<P>
   But Day has seen the incredulous looks on other physicians'
faces when he tells them that he is leaving early to pick up his
children (he has three, ages 14, 12, and 5) and that his wife will
be seeing the patient for a consult. Their practice has felt the
pinch of not getting referrals from physicians who can't get used
to the idea that the same specialist won't be seeing their patient
every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have dreams of being penniless and standing naked in the
street,'' says Day, half-jokingly. ``But on the other hand, I know
my children very well. I have not missed a single ballet
performance of my daughter's and I have not missed more than one or
two of my son's soccer games.''
</P>
<P>
   Day adds, ``You don't get a lot of `attaboys' doing this. But
that's OK. It's the way I want to lead my life.''

 &HT;    Whales, calving glaciers just the tip of Alaska cruise iceberg
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 27.
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RESURRECTION BAY, Alaska _ At one point the boat seemed
surrounded by killer whales, and we all ran from side to side to
see their tall, black dorsal fins piercing the surface.
</P>
<P>
   We were on an Alaska day cruise through green bays ringed by
sharply cut brown mountains. And I was wanting whales.
</P>
<P>
   When the orcas came, they arrived gloriously in a group of four,
first seen in the distance, then cresting right by the boat. We
could see their shiny, leathery backs wheeling across the top of
the water. No matter how often they're on TV, seeing killer whales
firsthand will start the heart thumping.
</P>
<P>
   If you do only one thing in Alaska, a Kenai Fjords Tours cruise
of the Resurrection Bay area will fill your memory with mental
snapshots of glaciers, sea otters, bald eagles, mountain goats and
possibly even a giant humpback whale.
</P>
<P>
   As we pulled out of the harbor in the small port city of Seward,
sea otters were performing their morning grooming, floating on
their backs, keeping their heads and webbed feet above the icy
water.
</P>
<P>
   We were on the Alaskan Explorer, a 95-foot ship with outdoor as
well as indoor seating. The captain provided color commentary as a
Ranger Rick-type fellow, clad completely in forest green, brought
around items such as animal skins.
</P>
<P>
   At times, things happened so quickly. Four porpoises leaped from
the sea in formation and were gone in a flash. I fumbled trying to
hit the camera shutter, missing the moment completely.
</P>
<P>
   But stunning landscapes always enveloped us. We passed a steeply
sloped island, pristine and uninhabited. The tall, craggy walls
held countless seabirds _ eagles, puffins, cormorants _ all
crisscrossing in flight, bringing to mind the chaos of bats in a
belfry.
</P>
<P>
   On another mountain, a white mountain goat sat alone on an
outcropping so narrow the animal could hardly turn around. He
worked a chaw of grass with such nonchalance, you expected he would
soon spit out a line of juice. Or blow a bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Moving on, we saw huge Steller sea lions hauling themselves out
of the water onto rocks, where they clustered together. They seemed
to either rest quietly or bark madly at each other. A large male
can weigh a ton. When one male approached a female, they yelped at
each other like Ralph and Alice Kramden on ``The Honeymooners.''
You couldn't tell if they were fighting or flirting.
</P>
<P>
   It is a gifted tour guide who, while leading a captive audience
across a scene of natural beauty, knows when to be silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just stop here and listen to the glacier,'' said the
captain, pulling up to the Holegate Glacier. The mammoth hunk of
ice hung off the land, rising more than 300 feet above sea level.
It held mysterious blue highlights.
</P>
<P>
   The glacier loomed in the amphitheater-shaped bay that it has
created over time, presenting an awesome display of nature's power.
Our boat sat quietly as sheets of ice ``calved'' off the face of
the glacier into the water, sounding like thunder and gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped for lunch at Fox Island, and were greeted by whale
bones on the shore. Over a meal of grilled salmon the passengers
came to know one other. Some walked along the slate rocks of the
shoreline, trying to find heart-shaped stones and beat the
stone-skipping record of nine water jumps.
</P>
<P>
   This part of Alaska, by the Aialik Peninsula in the southern
part of the state, offers abundant natural wonders. Homeowners can
have a 3,000-foot mountain in their back yard. Bald eagles perch
atop telephone poles. The mountains, so huge and so near, climb
into the clouds and are veined with snow. They loom beside the main
highway winding south to the bay. Here, nature is the big
developer. And a visit, even for a day, allows you to experience
Alaska's deep bond with the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling stays long after.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Kenai Fjords Tours offers six cruise options,
from the three-hour Resurrection Bay Wildlife Cruise ($54 adults,
$27 children under 12) to a 9 1/2-hour Northwestern Fjord Cruise
($139 adults, $69 children under 12). The 7 1/2-hour package, which
includes the grilled salmon lunch on Fox Island, is $115 adults,
$57 children. It affords a better chance of seeing whales than some
of the shorter cruises. The $10 binocular rental is worth it. In
general, tours run from from March to November. But weather can be
a factor in the longer rides, which launch later in the year. And
from Oct. 1 through Nov. 3, a four-hour tour of the bay is offered,
including a trip to the Alaska Sea Life Center. Call
1-800-478-8068.

 &HT;    Unfolding America: From paper to computers, a century of maps
has gotten us there
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 27.
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before she wrote her famous etiquette book, Emily Post
was a bit of an adventurer. In 1916, she decided to brave the
Lincoln Highway, the first auto road that stretched from coast to
coast. Stopping at a Manhattan book store for some maps, she ran
into an acquaintance who had made the journey. Her advice: Don't
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get beyond the Mississippi, the roads are trails of
mud and sand,'' she warned. The Lincoln Highway might look neat and
navigable on paper, but the map was an illusion, the road an
imaginary line like the Equator.
</P>
<P>
   Today that line is Interstate 80 _ a 70-mph asphalt fact. You
can take it from the Hudson River to San Francisco Bay without so
much as peeking at Rand McNally.
</P>
<P>
   As millions of Americans hit the highways this summer, the last
of the automobile century, it's hard to appreciate how exciting
road maps once must have seemed. We take them for granted these
days, as we take for granted that highways will be paved, gas pumps
plentiful and rest stops mercifully located. But there was a time
when the humble map wasn't so routine, when that ink-webbed paper
unfolded with a tingle of romance and possibility, when the open
road really was, as William Least Heat Moon put it in ``Blue
Highways,'' ``a beckoning, a strangeness, a place where a man can
lose himself.''
</P>
<P>
   You could lose yourself, all right.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this century, thousands of people had local
bicycle maps but no one had automobile road maps as we know them.
With only 8,000 cars registered in the entire United States, who
needed such a thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't use maps the way we do. If they had to go any
distance, they took trains,'' says Jim Akerman, a cartographic
historian at the Newberry Library in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Akerman, 42, has been studying maps since he was a kid
navigating from the back seat on family vacations. (He loved Rock
City. ```See seven states' _ that's a very cartographic
attraction.'') While he lost his boyhood stash of maps when his
parents tossed them during a move to Atlanta, he more than
compensated by earning a Ph.D. and becoming director of the
Newberry's Hermon Dunlap Smith Center for the History of
Cartography, a repository of 70,000 rare maps. They're stored in a
separate building, in dark, chilly stacks where you half expect to
see a tagged toe sticking out. It's the Fort Knox of road maps.
</P>
<P>
   The first ones didn't look a thing like the ones you stuff in
the glove compartment now. Instead of displaying the highway
network, early road maps followed strip itineraries, with
directions keyed to odometer readings and pictures of landmarks.
The information was provided by ``pathfinders,'' camera-toting
motor enthusiasts hired by mapmakers and highway promoters to do
reconnaissance. Akerman finds an example of their work in the
stacks, the Automobile Blue Book of 1920 _ it looks more like a
hymnal than a map.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it took an element of faith to drive American roads
before the '20s. Surfaces were unpaved, and cars were so frail that
``automobilists,'' as they were called, were often advised to strap
chains on their tires to climb hills. One Georgia map warned
ominously that the road north of Dahlonega was ``not passable after
rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Government spent little money on highway construction in the
early years, so private road associations organized to improve
driving conditions and promote particular routes in the interest of
business. Soon the nation was crisscrossed with named highways like
the Lincoln and the Dixie, the first Great Lakes-to-Florida route.
You can still find outcroppings of the era; Atlanta's Bankhead
Highway, for instance, was part of a national road that ran from
Washington to San Diego. But most of the old names are as extinct
as a Stutz Bearcat. Few Georgians would remember the Woodpecker
Route that burrowed through the pine lands from Augusta to
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Named highways could be confusing. In some cities, so many road
logos were tacked to the same post that it looked like a telephone
poll on election day. A Rand McNally draftsman came up with the
idea of numbering the routes, and the federal government adopted
the system in 1926. Thus the Dixie Highway became U.S. 41 and the
Lincoln Highway became U.S. 60. Perhaps the only highway that grew
more renowned as a number was the Old National Trails Road, which
became part of Route 66.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, for an exhibition, Akerman was able to borrow
the map that Bobby Troup used in 1946 when he wrote ``Get Your
Kicks on Route 66'' during a drive from Chicago to Los Angeles.
Troup circled the jaunty succession of towns he ticked off in the
lyrics: ``Now you go through St. Looey, Joplin, Missouri, Oklahoma
City looks mighty pretty ... '' For a scholar who loves the
American road, artifacts don't get any sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   There's another class of map buffs who don't care so much about
cartographic history. They're in it for the pretty pictures.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, road map collecting has emerged as a small
but vigorous hobby, with its own association, national convention,
and newsletters and chat rooms. The maps that collectors prize
above all are the lavishly illustrated folding maps that oil
companies handed out by the millions, starting around 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Oil company maps present an idyllic world of colorized scenery,
speeding roadsters and crisply uniformed attendants checking under
the hood as they pump 29-cents-a-gallon Kant-Nock gasoline. The
motorists, who never sweat despite the lack of air conditioning,
look like Arrow shirt models out for a spin. It's potent nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this is time travel,'' says Ronnie Futch, a
48-year-old librarian at Georgia State University, as he shows off
his collection of 300 vintage maps. Futch has been crazy about
petroliana since he was a youngster pumping gas at Exxon. He's
always looking for maps put out by obscure regional companies like
Reed Oil, an Atlanta firm of the '20s that marketed a gasoline
called Blue Streak, so named because it was tinted blue.
</P>
<P>
   When Futch started collecting almost 20 years ago, people asked
him why he was spending good money on trash. Back then, he paid
trash prices, buying maps for as little as 50 cents apiece. Now he
pays $10 or more for a single Pennzoil or Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing. Peter Sidlow, a retired real estate developer in
Las Vegas, recently got $400 for a 1924 Shell that was part of his
5,000-map collection. He'll pay up to $250 _ but not for anything
from the last quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new maps are disposable,'' he says. ``Wrapping paper.''
</P>
<P>
   The free map era that collectors cherish ended abruptly. In
1972, petroleum companies distributed a record 250 million maps.
After the Arab oil embargo rear-ended the industry in 1973, they
stopped giving them away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet mapmakers believe more of their handiwork is in circulation
today than ever. State tourism bureaus hand out maps by the bushel.
The American Automobile Association publishes record millions every
year. Specialty publishers like DeLorme, a Maine company that
produces topographical road atlases, have flourished. And recent
times have brought the new technology of computer software mapping
and vehicle navigation systems.

   ATLANTA: vehicle navigation systems.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, one company has remained the largest commercial
map publisher in the world: Rand McNally.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1856 as a printer of railroad tickets, Rand McNally
has been intimately involved in auto mapping since 1904. (Very
intimately; in 1909, Andrew McNally II devoted his honeymoon to
pathfinding for a Chicago-to-Milwaukee guide.) This year, the
company is celebrating the 75th anniversary of its first U.S. road
atlas. With more than 15 million copies sold a year, the annually
updated atlas easily ranks as the nation's most popular
cartographic product.
</P>
<P>
   Rand McNally's headquarters looks exactly like it ought to.
Located in the leafy Chicago suburb of Skokie, the company occupies
a two-story brick-and-limestone complex that resembles an
Eisenhower-era high school, down to the globes visible through the
windows. Inside, a maze of hallways is marked with street signs so
new employees can find their way around. At the end of North
Avenue, just past Central, you'll find Michael W. Dobson, chief
cartographer.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson, a white-bearded former professor of 53, is Rand
McNally's resident geographical philosopher. He's as likely to
mention Lewis Carroll as the highway department when he discusses
the art of rendering ``spatial diversity'' on paper.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, mapmaking has changed radically. Artists used to
sit at tables etching with styluses, a laborious engraving process
called scribing that would require 60 to 100 films for a solitary
map. The task got easier in 1992 when the process went digital. Now
most Rand McNally maps are produced from a master database, with
graphic artists guiding mouses in front of computer screens. The
highway matrix may not be altering as drastically as it did in
Emily Post's day, but there's always a new bypass or bridge to add
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think long and hard about what we put on a map,'' Dobson
says. ``We convene committees and hold focus groups _ we've even
been known to interview travelers at rest stops. Because whenever
we put something on a map, it means that something else will be
left off. It's relative. If you're a small town in Montana, you'll
probably make it. If you're a small town in Pennsylvania, you might
not.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs. ``Geography isn't fair.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one thing that Rand McNally would never put on a map:
something that isn't there. Mapmakers have been known to invent
places so they can prove the originality of their work in copyright
infringement cases. Dobson once met a cartographer in Florida who
admitted that he had been working on a city map while he was
watching ``The Sound of Music'' on TV. Bingo, Clearwater had a new
thoroughfare _ Von Trapp Street.
</P>
<P>
   As if getting lost wasn't easy enough.

   Put that car in drive and see america's scenic vistas
</P>
<P>
   Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 27.
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Auchmutey
</P>
<P>
   All this talk about maps makes you want to just GO. Here are
some ideas from ``The Most Scenic Drives in America'' (Reader's
Digest, $30):
</P>
<P>
   1. Columbia River Road. Washington 14 from Portland to The
Dalles. 140 miles. Along the majestic gorge Lewis and Clark
traveled.
</P>
<P>
   2. Big Sur. California 1 from San Luis Obispo to Monterey. 125
miles. The cliffs, the waves, Hearst Castle _ perhaps the
continent's most dramatic drive.
</P>
<P>
   3. Beartooth Country. U.S. 212 from Yellowstone National Park to
Red Lodge, Mont., and beyond. 120 miles. One of the highest roads
anywhere, crossing the Beartooth Pass at 10,947 feet above sea
level. You'll see snow banks in June.
</P>
<P>
   4. Colorado Springs Loop. 220-mile circuit on several roads,
past Pikes Peak and the Cripple Creek mining camps.
</P>
<P>
   5. Texas Hill Country. 310-mile wandering route from San Antonio
to Austin that takes in the limestone bluffs and bluebonnet meadows
at the heart of the state.
</P>
<P>
   6. Ozarks. Arkansas 7 from Hot Springs to Harrison, U.S. 62 to
Eureka Springs. 200 miles. White water and magnificent rock
formations, ending in one of the prettiest Victorian towns
imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   7. Upper Peninsula Drive. From the Wisconsin-Michigan border to
Mackinac Bridge. 395 miles. The serene north woods in between two
of the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   8. Heart of Kentucky. 270 miles. Bowling Green to Lexington,
from cave country to the lush pastures and white-rail fences of the
bluegrass region.
</P>
<P>
   9. Lookout Mountain Parkway. Gadsden, Ala., to Chattanooga along
several routes.120 miles. We've all seen the head of the mountain
in Tennessee, but how many of us have driven its 80-mile spine?
</P>
<P>
   10. Overseas Highway. U.S. 1 from Key Largo to Key West, Fla.
127 miles. Like sailing away. Sunset is the best time.
</P>
<P>
   11. Blue Ridge Parkway. Waynesville, N.C. to Waynesboro, Va. 469
miles. The low speed limit and lack of commercial vehicles make
this one of the greatest mountain drives.
</P>
<P>
   12. Outer Banks. Kitty Hawk to Nags Head to Ocracoke, N.C. 115
miles. The Wright Brothers, Cape Hatteras, miles of sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   13. Pennsylvania Dutch Country. 80-mile swing through the
beautiful Amish farmlands around Lancaster. Intercourse,
Bird-in-Hand, Paradise _ where did they get these town names?
</P>
<P>
   14. Hudson River Valley. From the George Washington Bridge to
Hyde Park, N.Y. 75 miles. The mighty Hudson looks like an inland
sea as it rolls past West Point, ``Rip Van Winkle'' country, and
the mansions of Franklin D. Roosevelt and John D. Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   15. Maine Coast. U.S. 1 from Brunswick to Ellsworth, with
several detours down peninsulas. 300 miles. Lobsters, lighthouses,
miles of craggy shoreline.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Talk about the fighting Irish. Or at least, the
squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the University of Massachusetts announced it would
help fertilize the seeds of peace with a conference on economic
development in Northern Ireland, to be held in Derry.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College, which prides itself on being the uber-Irish of
Boston institutions, quickly began planning its own conference on
the same topic the very same week, in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as two delegations of Massachusetts officials and
university types descend on Northern Ireland, the close quarters
are producing some sniping and suspicion. BC officials are grousing
that UMass is trying to upstage them in their role as chief link
between Ireland and the largest Irish community outside the Emerald
Isle. And UMass, with South Boston's own William M. Bulger at the
helm, is flaunting enough Irish political connections to suggest
that the once-backwater State U just might prove a fair rival.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this being Boston, it's not quite as clear as two
sides. Many of the UMass delegation are BC grads _ Bulger, a Triple
Eagle, no less _ BC High, BC, BC Law. His spokesman and the
spokesman for BC President William P. Leahy are cousins. All this
only adds more grudge to the match.
</P>
<P>
   Both are trying to establish their Irish bonafides, trotting out
press releases with the names of political celebrities who will
appear at their conferences, the details of events, and affiliation
agreements signed with various Irish entities. Observers back home,
meanwhile, are bewildered that a people once so ashamed of their
heritage would now be competing to show it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly being Irish in Boston has become the in thing; it's
suddenly fashionable,'' said Thomas O'Connor, a professor of
history at BC. ``Fifteen or 20 years ago, if some university said
we want to hire someone in Irish studies, people would have looked
at you twice. The Irish people were loath to be characterized as
Irish _ there was something second-class citizen about it. The
connection with Ireland is now something that enhances your
reputation. `No Irish need apply' is no longer relevant. Now it's
`Only Irish need apply.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Both conferences hold out the same goal: to facilitate economic
growth and job creation in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Both conferences feature Governor Paul Cellucci (BC, BC Law), in
Europe on a trade mission, as well as Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern. House Speaker Thomas Finneran (BC Law) was also expected to
drop by both events.
</P>
<P>
   But UMass also scored visits from Protestant Leader David
Trimble and Ireland's Secretary of State Mo Mowlam, as well as
Social Democratic party leader John Hume, who has been a close
friend of Bulger's since the two met 11 years ago at the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta, when another Massachusetts
politician who doesn't happen to be Irish was nominated as his
party's candidate for president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The current US president, too, sent a delegate to Bulger's
conference. And UMass drummed up enough attention that British
Prime Minister Tony Blair was said to be ``50-50'' on attending
until just a few weeks ago, when he, too, decided to send a
representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Bulger's political connections, it's hard for us to
compete,'' said Jack Dunn, a cousin of Bulger spokesman Robert
Connolly, and a close friend of Bulger's youngest son from their
days at BC High. ``They could really move in on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only Bulger, the former State Senate president, could
make BC insecure in its Irishness, which is, after all, fairly well
established. BC's Irish Institute has long run seminars for Irish
entrepreneurs and political leaders at the Chestnut Hill campus;
its academic program in Irish studies is recognized as the best in
the nation. This winter, BC purchased a house in St. Stephen's
Square in Dublin, and some professors say they worry the university
has gone a little overboard in emphasizing its Irish Jesuit roots.
</P>
<P>
   But there is apparently no fear of overemphasis this week, as BC
publicizes its flurry of events in Belfast and Dublin. There was
the reunion for Irish alumni at the National Gallery, which, BC
officials note, lent the college a Caravaggio. There was the
signing of a memo of understanding between Linen Hall Library and
the BC Library, which allowed the two to boast of being the largest
repository of Irish publications in the world. Father Leahy was
invited to a luncheon at the Parliament building in Stormont, seat
of the British government in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said BC knew about the UMass conference, but that it was
merely a coincidence that the two were planned for the same week.
</P>
<P>
   From the Irish perspective, the timing adds to the amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always amazing to the native Irish that Ireland can be so
significant in people's consciousness outside of Ireland,'' said
Thomas Groome, a professor of theology and education at BC who
arrived here from Ireland 30 years ago. ``The native Irish have a
bit of a wink and a nod and a wink to it all. They welcome them, as
they always do, of course. But for the Americans, there's a bit of
self-interest, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Both universities want to encourage development in Ireland. But
for BC, enhancing the connections between the two lands has also
enhanced the university's own reputation. BC's extensive outreach
to Ireland, BC officials hope, means the Irish will consider BC
first when looking for a place to send their students or for help
in their economic or political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is that UMass has figured out the same equation.
``With Bulger,'' one professor noted dryly, ``things like
coincidences don't come easy.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass officials, though, insist they are not competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have a presence, an impact, but we don't see it as
one school looking over its shoulder,'' said Connolly, Bulger's
spokesman. ``BC is distinguished when it comes to this stuff;
they're a good role model. But there is enough work here for at
least two universities.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger, of course, is that all the jockeying for position
might backfire for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch,'' Dunn said, joking. ``We'll be so obnoxious, the Irish
will all go to Notre Dame.''

 &HT;    High-tech options: trumping the compass?
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 27.
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The latest thing in personal navigation seems a lot
like the oldest thing: asking directions.
</P>
<P>
   OnStar, the General Motors program that links your car with a
navigator looking at a computerized map somewhere in Michigan, is
like having a gas station attendant available for questioning 24
hours a day. During a recent test drive, my wife and I enjoyed the
novelty of being guided through North Georgia by a disembodied
voice named Angie. But would we pay the regular price of $1,000 for
the hardware plus $22.50 a month for the subscription fee?
</P>
<P>
   There are cheaper options, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular paperless road maps are software programs like
DeLorme's Map'n'Go and Rand McNally's TripMaker. They combine roads
with guidebook listings, letting you plot personalized routes and
check restaurants and accommodations along the way. For full techie
portability, you can buy a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver
_ no bigger than a mouse _ that tracks your vehicle by satellite
and allows you to follow your progress on a laptop. Rand McNally
sells software and receiver for $99.95.
</P>
<P>
   We tried Microsoft's Expedia Streets &AMP; Trips 2000, mapping a
drive from Atlanta to my mother's home near Sandersville (Ga.). The
program chose a 130-mile route through Milledgeville, with times
and odometer readings for each turn (right). The military precision
of it all reminded me of my father's Durham-by-lunch vacation
timetables. I didn't care for the routing; I can get there faster
through Sparta. But I enjoyed the travel tips. Microsoft told me
about a restaurant I had never noticed in all my treks to the old
sod _ Mary's Kountry Kitchen. Unfortunately, it also showed the
demolished Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. Streets &AMP; Trips '96?
</P>
<P>
   The logical next step in navigational technology is integrating
map and vehicle. GM pioneered the field with its OnStar program.
</P>
<P>
   A computer chip in the car tells a satellite where you are,
while a cell phone built into the roof keeps you in touch with
``advisers'' sitting hundreds of miles away at computer screens.
There's a microphone in the roof and three buttons above the
rearview mirror _ two to start and end calls, another to summon
emergency road help.
</P>
<P>
   We climbed into a blue '99 Envoy SUV and pushed the start
button. After a startling electronic flourish, we were connected to
the pleasantly helpful Angie. We wanted to drive from Atlanta to
New Echota, the state historic site marking the capital of the
Cherokee nation. She asked me to spell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the New Echota Grocery,'' she said, ``but I'm having
trouble finding the historic site. Can I give you a call back?''
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later the roof rang. Angie had directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if we take a wrong turn?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't watching you the whole time. I mean, we don't care
if you stop for breakfast at Bob Evans.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it was up to us to determine whether we were
lost. As any wife knows, that's easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting New Echota, we called back and asked another
OnStar adviser how to get to Howard Finster's place near
Summerville. She clearly had no idea who the folk artist is, but
once we mentioned that his environment is called Paradise Garden,
she found it on her database and laid out the best route.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's the best route because I had a $15 road atlas in my
lap.

GENZYME TRACKING STOCKS ARE OFF TRACK ON RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do you do with a promising business division that isn't
really in the same line of work as its much bigger corporate
parent?
</P>
<P>
   In growing numbers, large companies are creating ``tracking''
stocks that trade in public markets even though the business
continues to be attached to its parent in many important ways.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme Corp., the Cambridge, Mass. biotech company, was
creating tracking stocks long before it came into vogue. It will
launch its fourth, Genzyme Surgical Products, on Monday. An implied
$400 million value for the new stock is more than twice the actual
market value of Genzyme's three other tracking stocks combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (a tracking stock) is fundamentally different from the
subsidiary approach, spinning off 10 or 15 percent,'' said Genzyme
Corp. chief executive Henri Termeer. ``These companies are still
very much connected; they're still very much part of Genzyme. They
are visions, where shareholders have a specific interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But as pure investments, Genzyme's existing tracking stocks have
left a lot to be desired. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   --Genzyme Molecular Oncology, which finished its first day of
public trading at 7 3/4 in November, has not been able to match
that price since. The stock slumped almost immediately and finished
Wednesday at 3 1/32.
</P>
<P>
   --Genzyme Tissue Repair lost two-thirds of its value in the last
year. The stock, which peaked at 25 1/8 in 1996, never finished
above 6 5/8 in the last year. It was valued at 2 3/32 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   --Genzyme Transgenics Corp., the elder tracking stock in the
Genzyme family, is down 40 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stocks usually follow the financial ups and downs of
its business operations, but the parent company continues to own
its underlying assets. That makes expenses lower, particularly when
it comes to borrowing money.
</P>
<P>
   The tracking stock is spun off to shareholders of the parent
company, who can keep it or sell it at any time once it goes
public.
</P>
<P>
   Large, mature companies sometimes create tracking stocks to
unlock market value for a small unit in a relatively glitzy field,
like the Internet. The stock market may accord the business no
value as a financial footnote to its giant parent, but reward it
handsomely if broken out into a stock that can trade on its own.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors created the earliest and perhaps best known
tracking stocks for two hot businesses that had nothing to do with
automobiles: Electronic Data Systems and Hughes Electronics Corp.
Even Microsoft Corp. has more recently considered rolling out a
tracking stock for its Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Genzyme's tracking stocks have not captured any waves
of investor euphoria. But, said Termeer, that was not the driving
point anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He sings the praises of tracking stocks as vehicles to create an
entrepreneurial environment (most importantly, stock options
targeted to the specific business units), a following among
investors focused on their particular business, and corporate
support from a larger parent all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   As for the performance of Genzyme's other tracking stocks,
Termeer described that as a reflection of the poor equity market
for small and speculative technology stocks that are not
Internet-related. Some others agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put that in the context of how small caps in the
biotechnology sector have done,'' said analyst Meg Malloy of
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. ``By and large, those kinds of stocks have been
out of favor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Genzyme tracking companies are nothing if not small and
speculative. Genzyme Molecular Oncology develops gene-based
diagnotics and therapies for cancer. Genzyme Tissue Repair develops
biological products for severe burns and other serious skin
problems as well as other disorders.
</P>
<P>
   But size is a serious issue for tracking stocks. How many
investors or analysts, no matter how specialized, are going to
bother following a stock with a stock market value of less than
$100 million? How much better off will shareholders be if they own
a new tracking stock that no one cares to buy?
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme Surgical Products is two businesses in one: a surgical
instruments venture it bought from Deknatel Snowden Pencer Inc. of
Taunton in 1996 for $250 million and its own Seprafilm product, a
thin film surgeons apply to organs to reduce adhesions after
surgery. The instruments business is established and generating
cash flow but Seprafilm is still developing, according to Termeer.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme is cashing out fraction shares of Surgical Products at a
rate of $25 per share, creating an implied value of $400 million
for the entire company. That value is based on the price paid for
Deknatel Snowden Pencer and $150 million Genzyme has promised to
pump into the new tracking company.
</P>
<P>
   Termeer may be a big fan of tracking stocks, but don't look for
Genzyme to spin off many more new units soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should do many more,'' said Termeer. ``We
have a very effective, overseeable situation right now where
investors understand what we're doing. For the time being, this
feels very good.''
</P>
<P>
   It would feel better if Genzyme's other tracking stocks would
gain back some ground.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   --Marsh &AMP; McClennan Cos., parent firm of Putnam Investments, is
slogging through the application process to create an Internet bank
based in Natick, Mass. MarshMac applied for a thrift charter with
the US Office of Thrift Supervision in the spring. It would be the
first Internet banking institution headquartered in the state. A
review is expected to be completed late this year.
</P>
<P>
   --Two top executives who recently resigned at PanAgora Asset
Management in Boston to start their own firm have taken on a unit
of Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP; Thornton, as a minority investor.
Highcrest Capital Partners is investing an undisclosed sum in
Arrowstreet Capital, newly created by former PanAgora chief
executive Bruce Clarke, chief investment officer Peter Rathjens,
and Harvard University professor John Campbell.

SANDLER PLAYS FATHER FIGURE TO THE HILT IN `BIG DADDY'  
</HEADLINE>
 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Adam Sandler's latest flush of the pop-culture
plumbing, ``Big Daddy,'' is actually a sweet little rip-off of
Charlie Chaplin's ``The Kid'' and its 800 or so imitators.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler is back in the lovable loser mode of ``The Wedding
Singer,'' which is always a welcome change from his other
Neanderthal screen persona. The boy, played by 6-year-old identical
twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse, is suitably sad-eyed and adorable _
and good at substituting w's for r's (``wock n' woll'') in the way
that makes women go ``aw.'' Even the inevitable upchuck is
attractively candy-colored.
</P>
<P>
   But since originality and sophistication never figured into the
equation here, the only way to judge the success of this thing is
by how long it allows Sandler's no-account slacker, Sonny Koufax,
to set bad examples for the orphaned urchin in his charge. Happily
enough, most of this mercifully brief slob comedy's running time is
devoted to spitting instruction, Hooters references and
bladder-relief jokes. Sentimentality and responsible attitudes
don't reach egregious levels until the inevitable, climactic
courtroom scene.
</P>
<P>
   Koufax is an apparently brilliant law school graduate (the
film's smartest joke, considering who plays him) who's opted for a
one-day-per-week job as a New York toll booth attendant. He doesn't
even need that work, since he's apparently invested the $200,000
settlement from a taxi accident lawsuit well.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than appreciate his layabout logic, Sonny's girlfriend
Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) frets about his lack of ambition. Shortly
after his roommate Kevin (Jon Stewart) takes off for a long
business trip to China, the illegitimate child Kevin didn't know he
had appears at the bachelors' apartment. Naturally, Sonny figures
pretending to adopt the kid will show Vanessa he's matured. Things
don't work out as planned, but bonding ensues regardless.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler and his regular writing partner Tim Herlihy worked
consistently amusing behavioral humor into Steve Franks'
screenplay. The clueless surrogate dad's solution to all spills,
whether of container or bodily origin, is to cover them with
newspaper; when the kid gets upset, Sonny makes him laugh by
inflicting grievous bodily harm upon himself; uncertain what the
rules are these days, he makes Julian wear swim trunks at bath time
just to be on the safe side, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout all of this, Sandler works his doofus charm to the
limit, then punctuates the proceedings with judicious explosions of
his signature, psycho-comic anger. There's enough of both schticks
here to satisfy fans of each gender. Indeed, Sonny's patient but
persistent courting of a likable environmental lawyer (played by
the always winsome Joey Lauren Adams) is almost romantic enough to
raise the film a notch or two above pure infantilism.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprouse twins strike a similarly nice balance between cuddly
cute and obnoxious. And director Dennis Dugan improves here on both
of his previous brat comedies, ``Problem Child'' and the
Sandler-starring ``Happy Gilmore,'' letting more than an inkling of
wit inform his obsessional interest in bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Consistently chucklesome if hardly great comedy, ``Big Daddy''
suggests _ in its superficial, overcalculated way _ that Adam
Sandler could even be funny once toilet trained.
</P>
<P>
   Someday. When he grows up. &QL;

IMPROVED NIGERIA SEEKS A FOOTHOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Americans already tried the hair-dyeing thing.
``We did blue,'' says Brandi Chastain, ``but it didn't take.'' So
how do the Nigerians do it? Blue is Crayola-basic for them.
Marvelous Mercy Akide has green and silver ringlets. Florence
Omagbemi, the captain, tints her locks burnt orange, like the Texas
school colors. Ann Chiejine, the keeper who runs a hair salon back
home, wraps her white hair in a neon-orange bandanna.
</P>
<P>
   The US women's soccer players see Nigeria play on TV and they
shake their sun-streaked ponytailed heads in amusement and wonder.
``They're fun,'' says Michelle Akers. ``I've been reading about
them and watching them. They're definitely a colorful team with a
lot of energy and a lot of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, inside sold-out Soldier Field, the flamboyant
Super Falcons will be standing between the Americans and the World
Cup quarterfinals. ``Very big game,'' says US coach Tony DiCicco,
whose squad shut out Denmark in its opener last weekend. ``Big game
for Nigeria, too. The winner gets 3 points, gets into the second
round, and goes to the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   The form sheet says that the Americans, who've already been
places the Nigerians can only dream about, should win. They're
11-1-1 lifetime in Cup play and they've won 58 of their last 59
matches at home. But they've never played the Nigerians (or any
African side) before and they've seen enough of them to know
they're dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look very good, better than I'd hoped they would,'' says
DiCicco, who had his assistants scout Nigeria's 2-1 victory over
North Korea in the Rose Bowl Sunday. ``They're very athletic, they
play physical, and they've got a lot of speed all over the place.
So we've got our work cut out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, do the Super Falcons, who rarely face rivals who have
the experience, depth, and tactical sophistication that the US
does. Though they've dominated Africa for years, they've finished
10th and 11th in the previous two Cups and hadn't managed a victory
until they edged the Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Nigerians are decidedly on the rise. They beat the
Chinese (who've handled the US twice this year) in a recent tuneup
and profess to be uncowed by their hosts' international resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they are one of the favorites to win the championship,
but we are still in the race,'' says coach Ismaila Mabo. ``I will
not be intimidated by their record. It is going to be a fight to
the finish. Nigeria will play its game. Nigeria will play to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerians, both for better and worse, play the same way
against everybody. ``We believe in attacking football and we will
always play that way,'' says Mabo. ``We don't care who we play. If
we play the Brazilian male team, if we play the American male team,
we would play exactly the same. We don't believe in negative
football. We will be taking risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The subtext is that the Super Falcons don't believe much in
defending, either, which is why the Americans believe they will
prevail over 90 minutes. ``They'll be coming at us, coming at us,
coming at us,'' says keeper Briana Scurry. ``But if they don't
succeed on a corner kick, we'll be right back at them. It could be
a field day for our forwards. The Nigerians won't be able to hold
Mia (Hamm) and the rest of them all game. There's no way.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Americans must do is absorb the shock of the Nigerian
attack, keep their shape, and not fret if they give up a goal in
the first five minutes. ``That'd be a nightmare,'' nods Tiffeny
Milbrett. ``But it would slap us in the face and get us in gear a
lot faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it may take Milbrett and her teammates a while to get to
cruise control, they figure they'll have another three points by
night's end. But they've already conceded the style competition.
Red and blue fingernails can't match the day-glo rainbow the
Nigerians have in their every-day paintbox. ``We're plain Janes,''
shrugs Scurry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With defender Kate Sobrero doubtful for Thursday's match after
spraining an ankle in Wednesday's practice, Natick-born Sara Whalen
could start. DiCicco said that Whalen, Christie Pearce, Lorrie
Fair, and Tiffany Roberts were all options, depending on which
formation he uses. But if he wants speed against the fleet
Nigerians, Whalen's the one. ``She could be our fastest player,''
DiCicco says. ``She's one of the fastest I've ever seen coming up
the field with a soccer ball. And she's been playing with a lot of
bite recently.'' Whalen, a 23-year-old University of Connecticut
grad, has played in 10 of the squad's 19 matches this year and
started three.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sellout of 65,000-plus at Soldier Field will make it the
third-largest paid crowd in women's soccer history, behind last
Saturday's US-Denmark opener at Giants Stadium (78,972) and the
1996 Olympic final between the US and China (76,489).

   BOSTON -- He wasn't surprised. Not even a little. The issue had
been talked about, discussed, and dissected long before it became
official.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Tallas had plenty of warning that the Bruins were going to
protect goalie Byron Dafoe and expose him in Friday's expansion
draft that is being used to stock the National Hockey League's most
recent entry, the Atlanta Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   So when the news finally came with the league's announcement
Tuesday afternoon, the ever-upbeat Tallas gave it the proverbial
shoulder shrug and said he'll deal with whatever life brings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to happen,'' said the 26-year-old Tallas.
``There are a lot of goalies out there who are unprotected this
year. It's a tough situation (the Bruins are in). To protect me
means they couldn't protect one extra forward or one extra
defenseman. That's big this year. I'd heard rumors since the last
month of the season about them not protecting me, so it came as no
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas has been one of the better Cinderella stories in the
Bruins' organization. He first came to training camp in 1994,
arriving as a tryout. No one had ever heard of him, and he turned
out to be the player everyone was talking about in the end.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a contract with Charlotte of the East Coast League and
worked his way up through the ranks before playing 24 games with
the Bruins in the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back and I'm very thankful, and there's not a day that
goes by that I've stopped thinking about how I did get here,'' said
Tallas. ``But it's one of those times in life, again, that whatever
happens, it happens for the best. If I do stay here, then great.
This is my team, this is my home, they know exactly what I can do.
They know how me and Byron get along.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do go, I'll miss my relationship with Byron. There aren't
too many times when you have two goalies who get along as well as
we do. Sometimes it's a competition between the two goalies, but
with us, it's not like that. We get along great. I think that will
be the biggest thing. But it might be time for me to play. Now that
I've got confidence in this league and know that I can play at this
level, I'd like to try it as the No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that there will be 28 teams in the NHL next
season, that chance is actually more difficult to come by. Perhaps
because of the big salaries starting netminders command, teams have
begun playing their top guys more often, meaning less work for the
backups. Tallas was odd man out down the stretch with Dafoe playing
virtually every game. The Bruins were in a sprint for a playoff
spot, and Burns felt he had to use Dafoe just to make it to the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's being a backup goalie,'' said Tallas. ``I remember
talking to Byron right at the end of the season about how being a
backup in some ways is tougher than being the No. 1 guy. When you
have a bad game, as the No. 1, you know you're going to play the
next night and redeem yourself and continue. When you're a backup,
if you play once a week or once every two weeks or you sit out 20
straight games, there's a lot that goes through your mind. Practice
becomes frustrating. You see the team having success and you don't
feel quite a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas played in 17 games last season, compiling a 7-7-2 record
with a 2.61 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas said he has seen plenty of his fellow backups go through
the difficulty of sitting and waiting for their turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Rick Tabaracci, and he told me to hang in there,''
said Tallas, referring to the much-traveled Washington netminder.
``He said, `Hey, I did 22 games straight (without playing). But
they want to expose me so now they won't stop playing me.' It has
happened to others. Same with Chris Terreri. He's played the least
amount of games and here's a guy who's been around longer than
anyone else. That's just part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas is set to become a restricted free agent July 1, so if he
is picked by Atlanta, he'll negotiate with the Thrashers. If he
remains in Boston, he'll try to work out a contract with the
Bruins. As was the case last year, Tallas has arbitration rights
and said he would file. Last summer, it wasn't a fight over money,
it was over a one-way contract. Tallas felt he earned the right to
be paid NHL money for the entire year. The Bruins wanted to give
him a two-way contract meaning he'd be paid less if he wound up in
the minors. Tallas got what he wanted and earned $625,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to be here forever,'' said Tallas. ``I know
(coach) Pat Burns likes me. I know Byron is going to play 65 games
again next year. That's what they expect of him. Hopefully, I can
get more games in. We'll see what kind of contract they give me. If
it's a two-year deal, make the best of it. If it's another one-year
contract, I've got to also look that next year, there are two more
teams coming into the league. There is another year where they're
going to expose me. But I do want the challenge of being a No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   As frustrating as it was last season for Tallas, he said it
would never make sense for him to be satisfied being No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only practice so much,'' he said. ``You want to be out
there and in a game and a part of it. If I wasn't frustrated, I
wouldn't be a competitive guy. I wouldn't have that edge. If you
were satisfied with being a backup, that's not good enough. Not at
this level.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he realizes even Dafoe had to pay his dues,
which he did in Los Angeles and Washington prior to being traded to
Boston. Tallas paid his dues here and is hoping that will lead to
an opportunity whether it be here, in Atlanta or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to be a good goalie in this league and to last a long
time, (Philly netminder) John Vanbiesbrouck said it best,'' Tallas
said. ``You're always a student of the game. Every year is
different. You can never be relaxed. You're always learning. I feel
I've come along comfortably. I've come through some hard times and
some great times.''
</P>
<P>
   And now it's an uncertain time. But not for much longer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I walked into my bank the other day and discovered that all of
the tellers' old-style computer terminals had been replaced with
laptops. These weren't just any laptops, mind you: They were sleek,
black, IBM ThinkPads. The teller told me the laptop computers took
up less room than the old terminals, they were easier to replace
when they broke, they were cheaper, and the software was easier to
use. She loved her new laptop, even if she couldn't take it home
every night.
</P>
<P>
   My bank isn't alone. In the past few years, there's been a
laptop craze. Portability and size have their advantages, of
course. But laptops are also expensive. Their prices, combined with
their attractive styling, have made them a mark of wealth and
sophistication. The use of laptops in movies and television shows
have further increased demand. Many people who would be better
suited by a desktop computer have instead bought laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Before you buy a laptop, remember that the machines are
generally slower than desktops and less expandable. They are also
more fragile. These days it is rare to have a desktop computer
physically malfunction. Laptops, on the other hand, routinely
suffer a range of physical maladies, from damaged screens and
missing parts to inoperable hard drives and failed components.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this higher mortality rate: the beatings they
take because of their portability. Laptops are constantly being
picked up, dropped into bags, and carried around. There's also far
more opportunity for laptop computers to receive a static
discharge, something many of them cannot handle. All in all,
laptops make a poor choice for a first-time computer user.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many people want the machines.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past month I've had the opportunity to review two new
laptops: IBM's ThinkPad 570 and Acer's TravelMate 332T. Comparing
these machines with last year's laptops, and with each other, is a
good way to point out the features any potential laptop user should
consider.
</P>
<P>
   The ThinkPad 570 is an ultraslim (1 inch thick) computer that
weighs just 4 pounds. The machine is available in two basic
configurations. With an 800x600 screen, a 300 Mhz Pentium II
microprocessor, and a 4GB hard drive, the computer costs roughly
$2,700. Substitute a 1024x768 screen and a 333 Mhz Pentium II, and
the price jumps to $3,200. You'll also need to buy the $130
ThinkPad 570 Ultrabase, which gives you a CD-ROM/DVD drive and a
place to put the 570's external floppy.
</P>
<P>
   The Acer TravelMate is a better value. It weighs 4.1 pounds and
gives you a 366 Mhz Pentium II, an 800x600 display, and a 6.4 GB
hard drive for $2,700. An external floppy disk/CD-ROM/DVD drive is
part of the package. Although the case is smaller and thinner than
the IBM, the screen and keyboard are the same size.
</P>
<P>
   Both laptops have an infrared port, USB port, built-in V.90
faxmodem, and a sound card. They can both drive external video
monitors at resolutions of up to 1280x1024 _ last year, most
laptops I saw could drive external monitors at only 1024x768.
Another feature both of these machines share is the ability to
drive two displays at the same time. That is, they can take
advantage of Windows 98's ability to run two monitors at the same
time by showing one image on the LCD screen and sending another
image out the video port.
</P>
<P>
   One important difference between these machines is the pointing
device. The TravelMate has a touch pad, while the IBM uses a
TrackPoint, which looks like a little red pogo stick that's mounted
in the center of the keyboard. I prefer the touch pad, but be
advised it won't work if your fingers are wet or greasy.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a big fan of laptop docks, which are sometimes called port
replicators. A dock gives you a place to plug in your full-sized
keyboard, external mouse, video monitor, and other devices,
effectively turning your laptop into a desktop machine. Then, when
you want to go mobile, you just pop the laptop out of the dock and
take it with you. Unfortunately, you can't get a dock for either of
these laptops. (The ThinkPad's UltraBase isn't a dock because it
doesn't replicate any of the ThinkPad's ports.)
</P>
<P>
   Both of these laptops have sleep modes, which let you save
batteries by closing the lid and temporarily suspending operations.
A bit of power keeps flowing to keep the memory fresh. Open the lid
and press a key, and it takes between 15 and 30 seconds for the
machine to come back up. The Acer also supports a suspend mode, in
which it stores the contents of memory onto the hard drive. This
can take as long as two minutes, but it's still faster than doing a
shutdown and rebooting the computer later.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep mode is one of the things laptop makers usually implement
poorly. A friend of mine has a Dell laptop. When its battery runs
low, the machine is supposed to automatically go into sleep mode,
but instead it goes catatonic. The only recourse is to unplug the
power cord and pull out the computer's battery. IBM's
implementation of sleep, on the other hand, is the best I have ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy a laptop, be sure to factor in the cost of an extra
battery, for long trips, and possibly an extra power supply. Power
supplies take up a lot of space: if you routinely carry a laptop
from home to office, it's awfully nice to have a power supply at
both ends.

<P>
   BOSTON -- Talk about the fighting Irish. Or at least, the
squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the University of Massachusetts announced it would
help fertilize the seeds of peace with a conference on economic
development in Northern Ireland, to be held in Derry.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College, which prides itself on being the uber-Irish of
Boston institutions, quickly began planning its own conference on
the same topic the very same week, in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as two delegations of Massachusetts officials and
university types descend on Northern Ireland, the close quarters
are producing some sniping and suspicion. BC officials are grousing
that UMass is trying to upstage them in their role as chief link
between Ireland and the largest Irish community outside the Emerald
Isle. And UMass, with South Boston's own William M. Bulger at the
helm, is flaunting enough Irish political connections to suggest
that the once-backwater State U just might prove a fair rival.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this being Boston, it's not quite as clear as two
sides. Many of the UMass delegation are BC grads _ Bulger, a Triple
Eagle, no less _ BC High, BC, BC Law. His spokesman and the
spokesman for BC President William P. Leahy are cousins. All this
only adds more grudge to the match.
</P>
<P>
   Both are trying to establish their Irish bonafides, trotting out
press releases with the names of political celebrities who will
appear at their conferences, the details of events, and affiliation
agreements signed with various Irish entities. Observers back home,
meanwhile, are bewildered that a people once so ashamed of their
heritage would now be competing to show it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly being Irish in Boston has become the in thing; it's
suddenly fashionable,'' said Thomas O'Connor, a professor of
history at BC. ``Fifteen or 20 years ago, if some university said
we want to hire someone in Irish studies, people would have looked
at you twice. The Irish people were loath to be characterized as
Irish _ there was something second-class citizen about it. The
connection with Ireland is now something that enhances your
reputation. `No Irish need apply' is no longer relevant. Now it's
`Only Irish need apply.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Both conferences hold out the same goal: to facilitate economic
growth and job creation in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Both conferences feature Governor Paul Cellucci (BC, BC Law), in
Europe on a trade mission, as well as Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern. House Speaker Thomas Finneran (BC Law) was also expected to
drop by both events.
</P>
<P>
   But UMass also scored visits from Protestant Leader David
Trimble and Ireland's Secretary of State Mo Mowlam, as well as
Social Democratic party leader John Hume, who has been a close
friend of Bulger's since the two met 11 years ago at the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta, when another Massachusetts
politician who doesn't happen to be Irish was nominated as his
party's candidate for president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The current US president, too, sent a delegate to Bulger's
conference. And UMass drummed up enough attention that British
Prime Minister Tony Blair was said to be ``50-50'' on attending
until just a few weeks ago, when he, too, decided to send a
representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Bulger's political connections, it's hard for us to
compete,'' said Jack Dunn, a cousin of Bulger spokesman Robert
Connolly, and a close friend of Bulger's youngest son from their
days at BC High. ``They could really move in on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only Bulger, the former State Senate president, could
make BC insecure in its Irishness, which is, after all, fairly well
established. BC's Irish Institute has long run seminars for Irish
entrepreneurs and political leaders at the Chestnut Hill campus;
its academic program in Irish studies is recognized as the best in
the nation. This winter, BC purchased a house in St. Stephen's
Square in Dublin, and some professors say they worry the university
has gone a little overboard in emphasizing its Irish Jesuit roots.
</P>
<P>
   But there is apparently no fear of overemphasis this week, as BC
publicizes its flurry of events in Belfast and Dublin. There was
the reunion for Irish alumni at the National Gallery, which, BC
officials note, lent the college a Caravaggio. There was the
signing of a memo of understanding between Linen Hall Library and
the BC Library, which allowed the two to boast of being the largest
repository of Irish publications in the world. Father Leahy was
invited to a luncheon at the Parliament building in Stormont, seat
of the British government in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said BC knew about the UMass conference, but that it was
merely a coincidence that the two were planned for the same week.
</P>
<P>
   From the Irish perspective, the timing adds to the amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always amazing to the native Irish that Ireland can be so
significant in people's consciousness outside of Ireland,'' said
Thomas Groome, a professor of theology and education at BC who
arrived here from Ireland 30 years ago. ``The native Irish have a
bit of a wink and a nod and a wink to it all. They welcome them, as
they always do, of course. But for the Americans, there's a bit of
self-interest, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Both universities want to encourage development in Ireland. But
for BC, enhancing the connections between the two lands has also
enhanced the university's own reputation. BC's extensive outreach
to Ireland, BC officials hope, means the Irish will consider BC
first when looking for a place to send their students or for help
in their economic or political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is that UMass has figured out the same equation.
``With Bulger,'' one professor noted dryly, ``things like
coincidences don't come easy.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass officials, though, insist they are not competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have a presence, an impact, but we don't see it as
one school looking over its shoulder,'' said Connolly, Bulger's
spokesman. ``BC is distinguished when it comes to this stuff;
they're a good role model. But there is enough work here for at
least two universities.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger, of course, is that all the jockeying for position
might backfire for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch,'' Dunn said, joking. ``We'll be so obnoxious, the Irish
will all go to Notre Dame.''

TOYOTA REALIZES: HEY, WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A V-8! 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was some time in coming, but the folks at Toyota have
realized that if they want to break into the big truck market in
North America, they need a V8-powered truck in their stable.
</P>
<P>
   With the new Tundra, they have produced just such a truck, a
truck that can roam the range with the big Chevys and Fords and
Dodges _ out where the big dogs eat.
</P>
<P>
   The Tundra, all full of horsepower and torque, is a big step up
from the Tacoma (a fine, but small truck) and the six-cylinder T100
(which should have been this truck in the first place).
</P>
<P>
   The Tundra is the first Japanese entry into the North American
big truck market, which is exploding particularly with four-door,
five- and six-passenger trucks.
</P>
<P>
   And given that big, V8 pickups are virtually unique to North
America, it comes as no surprise that, when you look at the Tundra,
you see hints of domestic trucks: the rounded roofline and fenders
reminiscent of Dodge; the grill, pure Ford F-series; the pickup bed
more angular, with chrome accents above the wheel wells, looking
like a Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   The market at which the Tundra is aimed _ faithful to brand and
country _ has long been the core of the ``buy-American'' faction of
US customers. To help gain access, Toyota is building the Tundra in
Princeton, Ind., where it hopes to produce 100,000 of the trucks in
the first year and 50,000 new SUVs, built on the same platform, in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell you are dealing with a serious truck simply by
opening and closing the doors, front and rear. They are heavy and
slam with a thud that gives confidence. Getting in and out,
particularly with optional running boards, is easy. The smaller
rear doors open back and past a right angle to make reaching the
rear seat easier.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the seats are very firm. A 60-40 bench or buckets are
options in front, while the rear is a low, vertical-back bench.
With benches front and rear, this is billed as a six-passenger
truck, but adults would not want to do long trips in the back seat
because leg room is tight. Three kids would be fine back there,
though the straight-backed seats might prove uncomfortable on long
trips even for them.
</P>
<P>
   Most controls are housed in a warped-oval panel in the middle of
the dash, and everything about them is large: large buttons, dials,
even the digital numbers on the clock and radio are big. No
squinting needed to see which button or dial you are reaching for,
or what station you've dialed up on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   There are pockets in all four doors for maps and other storage,
a sunglasses holder that drops from center ceiling at the
windshield, and a console that folds down and divides the front
seat in the bench seat model. It has two cupholders up front and
its lid opens to reveal even more storage space.

<P>
   Get the Tundra out on smooth roads and the ride is superb; only
the fact you are sitting so high keeps reminding you that you are
in a truck. Even on bumps, where the truck gives you a gentle
awareness of what is going on, the ride is smooth and not at all
jarring.
</P>
<P>
   In a wonderful blend of past and present, Toyota has used
suspension control arms and coil springs up front, and leaf springs
in the rear, all bolstered by gas shocks.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise at highway commuter speed and what is striking is the
quiet. Feed it gas to pass and the V8 gives off a smooth and
throaty purr, but no big roar. This is as quiet and smooth a truck
as I have ever driven, almost luxury sedan-like in ride.
</P>
<P>
   It will carry 2,000 pounds of payload and with an optional hitch
has a top towing capacity of 7,200 pounds. And though the four-door
Access Cab model comes with a bed that's only 6.5 feet long, it is
wide enough to take a sheet of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   Offroad, the 315 lbs./ft. of torque make it formidable. Crawling
uphill in low-range, four-wheel drive or using the engine to brake
on steep downgrades let's this torque do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   On a steep gravel grade, the engine is so quiet you can hear and
feel the tires digging for purchase outside. This adds to a
wonderful sense of control.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this contrapuntal combination of power and quiet
is a 4.7 liter, dual overhead cam, 32-valve engine. It's a
variation of the engines found in Lexus and the Toyota Land Cruiser
(it trails the latter beast in torque by only 5 lbs./ft.). This
version has an iron block and aluminum heads and powers the Tundra
from 0-60 in just under 8 seconds, pretty quick for a big truck.
</P>
<P>
   It cruises at 80 at just 2,400 rpms and is not the gas-guzzler
that some other big trucks are. With a combination of highway
commuting (including much time spent in a couple of traffic jams),
running about town, and playing briefly in the woods, it got just
under 17 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The Tundra is available in two-door (with 8-foot bed) and
four-door (6.5-foot bed) models. You can also choose between the V8
and a V6 engine, though the latter would seem to defeat the purpose
of this truck.
</P>
<P>
   Afterall, it is the V8 that has successfully put Toyota trucks
out there where the big dogs eat, so chow down.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX) The two-panel window visors that separate and let you
block the sun coming in the side window and the usual spot atop the
windshield at the same time. No more adjusting as the angle of the
sun keeps changing each time you round a bend.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX) The bright cargo lights that illuminate the bed for a
brief period after you turn the truck off.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX) Toyota should find a way to give the Access Cab an 8-foot
bed. A big truck needs to be a big truck.
</P>

in the V-6?

 Dietary vitamin C link to lead levels elusive
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A study associates high vitamin C levels in blood with decreased
high blood-lead levels. But while the research, published Wednesday
in the Journal of the American Medical Association, established the
inverse relationship, the authors found in questioning study
participants that there was no ``significant relationship'' between
the amount of vitamin C that people ate and their blood-lead
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the University of California at San Francisco
studied data collected from 19,578 participants, ages 6 through 90,
who did not have a history of lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The participants had taken part in a national health survey from
1988 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Co-author of the study, Dr. Joel S. Simon, said that previous
studies have found increased dietary amounts of vitamin C linked
with lower blood-lead levels. He said that his and his colleagues'
inability to find a dietary relationship may have been attributable
to ``imprecise'' questionnaire wording. He also suggested that high
lead levels flush ascorbic acid out of the system more quickly,
lowering the ascorbic acid level in the blood.

</P>

   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Checking the body's blood sugar levels at home could get less
painful for people with diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   GlucoWatch biographer, an experimental watch-like device, has
been shown to be as effective as current self-monitoring techniques
that require pricking a finger to get blood samples, according to a
report released Tuesday at the American Diabetes Association
meeting in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The device, which is worn on the arm, electrochemically measures
the glucose levels in tiny amounts of fluid found between cells
beneath the skin's surface.
</P>
<P>
   A AAA battery attached to the GlucoWatch releases an electric
current into the skin that enlarges the pores and causes the fluid
to seep out.
</P>
<P>
   When the fluid reacts with an enzyme on a small disposable pad,
a glucose measurement can be made.
</P>
<P>
   The device would allow people with diabetes to check their
glucose levels up to 36 times a day.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the readings were nearly identical with those
done by pricking the finger to draw blood.
</P>
<P>
   GlucoWatch awaits US Food and Drug Administration approval, and
is unlikely to be made commercially available for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   The device could cost about $300 and the disposable sensor pads
about $4.

 &UR; ADHD report promotes treating with stimulants
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stimulants, such as Ritalin, that are prescribed for youths with
attention-deficit hyperactivitiy disorder may be underprescribed,
according to a new study, and not overprescribed, as suggested by
media reports and public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Peter S. Jensen, a child and adolescent
psychiatrist from the National Institute of Mental Health, found
that fewer than one in eight children with ADHD were prescribed the
stimulant medications.
</P>
<P>
   It will appear in the July 1999 Journal of the American Academy
of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   The results came from a 1992 sample of nearly 1,300 children and
their parents in Atlanta, New Haven, Westchester, N.Y., and San
Juan.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 percent of the children met all the criteria of ADHD,
and 12 percent of those ADHD-diagnosed children had been treated
with stimulant drugs in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that ADHD children were generally more likely
to receive other forms of treatment, such as in-school services or
mental health counseling, than medication.
</P>
<P>
   Stimulants are considered the best treatment, according to
Jensen's study. His report acknowledges that there have been
well-documented studies showing that the number of children
receiving stimulants is increasing, although little information is
known as to why that is occurring.
</P>
<P>
   But his report suggests that there are ``many children with ADHD
going unidentified and untreated.''

WEB-SITE PARODY GETS BUSH REACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zack Exley considers himself a rather dull fellow, a typical
computer geek with a modest consulting practice and a ``small,
boring social life.'' He insists he just wanted to have a little
fun when he bought a certain domain name and set up a Web site a
few months ago. He never expected to incur the wrath of Washington
legal eagles nor to be called a ``garbage man'' by a well-named
politician.
</P>
<P>
   But now that his Web site has garnered national notoriety,
Exley, 29, savors the spotlight. ``I hope my 15 minutes aren't over
yet,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site in question is www.gwbush.com, a parody of the
official campaign site (www.georgewbush.com) for Texas Governor
George W. Bush, who announced his bid for the presidency last week.
Political parody sites on the Web are as common as vanity sites and
personal pages: They're usually frequented only by a small coterie
of friends and fellow devotees. But the story of this particular
site is textbook example of a wrong-headed strategy for countering
on-line critics and a fundamental misunderstanding of how the
Internet works.
</P>
<P>
   Back in December, Exley bought the domain name on a lark. A
self-described mainstream centrist, he figured he might annoy Bush
or make a few dollars selling the name back to the campaign, a
popular practice known as ``cyber-squatting.'' In April, Exley
posted a mirror, or a copy, of the official Bush site on his page;
the site went unnoticed in cyberspace until the Bush campaign sent
him a cease-and-desist letter, accusing him of copyright
infringement, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Exley took down the copy and posted material criticizing Bush.
In May, the campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election
Commission, contending that Exley is required to print a disclaimer
and to file reports of expenditures to the commission. The
candidate himself entered the fray a few weeks ago, saying ``there
ought to be limits to freedom'' and castigating Exley as ``a
garbage man.''
</P>
<P>
   But in cyberspace, the slightest bit of attention can turn a
nobody into a celebrity, a parody into a phenomenon. Last month
alone, the site received more than 6 million hits, compared with a
handful before the controversy erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was thin-skinned, and it was also stupid,'' says Michael
Cornfield, associate research professor at George Washington
University who studies on-line politics. ``All (Bush) did was get
the site more attention. And now he has to account for that `limits
to freedom' statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Exley's site now describes Bush as ``the only candidate with the
courage to take on excessive freedom on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign isn't backing down from its complaint. ``The
first thing he did was appropriate our graphics and our text; he
ripped us off,'' says David Beckwith, communications manager for
the campaign, who was in Boston Tuesday with the governor. ``He is
ignoring the election laws and the libel laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Stirton, election commission spokesman, declined comment on
the complaint, citing confidentiality. ``New technology spurs
questions, and I'm sure we'll get more and more of them,'' he says.
Individuals who spend more than $250 advocating an election must
file an expense letter with the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Exley originally shelled out $70 for the domain name and about
$20 a month to maintain the site. But his server costs have
skyrocketed since the hooplah began, and he expects that the bill
from his Internet service provider will put him well over the $250
limit; the same goes for lawyer fees. As such, he's representing
himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Exley may end up registering as a political committee in the
end. He's now selling ``Limits to freedom'' T-shirts on the site
and has received hundreds of e-mails from people who want to
organize anti-Bush rallies during the campaign. They stayed away
from the Park Plaza on Tuesday, when Bush was in town for his first
official campaign tour. ``The American people deserve a chance to
hear what Bush has to say before I weigh in,'' Exley says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Beckwith insists that he and Bush don't lack the
humor gene. ``If you can't have fun in politics, what are you
doing?'' he says. ``I'm all for a good parody site. We may well put
one up on (Vice President Al) Gore.'' There already is a Gore
parody site, at www.allgore.com. But it's unlikely that Gore will
protest. He invented the Internet, after all.

has joined forces with on-line bookseller amazon.com. The partners
will launch an on-line auction site that will sell collectibles and
antiques. It will debut later this year with a sale of baseball
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum launched a Web site
June 16 offering its archives to the on-line public for the first
time. The debut of the site coincided with the groundbreaking
ceremonies for the museum's new $47 million facility in Nashville.
The site includes video and audio clips, as well as biographies of
69 members of the Hall of Fame, from Hank Williams to Willie Nelson
and Uncle Dave Macon to Grandpa Jones. The archives are hosted at

Pig Latin, and Elmer Fudd. If you translate the first sentence of

   HEMINGWAY-KC: In one of the short stories that Ernest Hemingway
set in Kansas City, he writes that the city was ``very like
Constantinople.'' Some never-before-published manuscript fragments
of ``God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen,'' showing early drafts of the
opening passages of that story, reveal Hemingway's struggle to put
down on paper just what he thought of Kansas City. And what did he
really mean by the Constantinople comparison? At a time when a
previously unpublished book by Hemingway is making literary waves,
The Kansas City Star adds insult to injury by publishing these
``new'' Hemingway paragraphs about Kansas City. Steve Paul. 71

MAKING A SILK PURSE FROM A SOW'S DROPPINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The stink will stay, at least for now, but in a
biotech breakthrough Canadian scientists have created a pig whose
manure is expected to do far less harm to the environment than the
poop of ordinary porkers.
</P>
<P>
   The Enviropig, an achievement of genetic engineering by
researchers at Ontario's University of Guelph, could go a long way
toward making modern hog operations cleaner and more cost
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic tinkering with creatures and plants is nothing new. But
the ``transgenic'' Yorkshire pigs _ their cells containing DNA
spliced from mice and a strain of bacteria _ produced in labs at
the university over the past two months are thought to be the first
animals designed specifically to combat an environmental problem.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and farmers hope the three little Enviropigs, named
in best Canadian tradition after hockey stars _ Wayne, Gordie, and
Jacques _ will become progenitors of vast grunting herds yielding
environmentally friendly excrement as well as pork chops, ham, and
bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Pig manure is heavy in phosphorus, and runoff from hog farms is
a cause of pollution in rivers, streams, ponds, and lakes across
Canada and the United States. Phosphorus robs water of the oxygen
that sustains fish and other aquatic species, turning waterways
into foul green pools of algae.
</P>
<P>
   But the Enviropig, an official trademark taken out by the
university, digests the phosphorus in cereal feed with much greater
efficiency than run-of-the-mill swine.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Pig poop that is cleaner, at least in the
environmental sense. That makes it safer to spread on fields as
fertilizer, and should reduce the contamination of surface water
and underground springs caused by hog operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk to a hog farmer, and you'll find that the environmental
problems caused by pigs are just a huge, huge headache,'' said John
Phillips, molecular biologist and one of three lead researchers on
the Enviropig project, along with microbiologist Cecil Forsberg and
doctoral student Serguei Golovan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manure from our animals is superior,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound amusing to a layperson, but for pig farmers the
human-engineered breed of hogs may mark the biggest breakthrough
since the invention of the feed trough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of farmers going around today with big, happy
smiles on their faces,'' said Harry Stam, who raises 12,000 pigs on
his family farm in Jarvis, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pork producers take a heavy rap, and if we can make ourselves
better stewards of the land, that's cause for celebration,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, for all the efforts of modern science, pig farms will
still retain their most distinguishing characteristic: foul odor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't eliminated the smell,'' acknowledged Phillips.
``That's the next big step. But don't hold your breath, it's a long
way off.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding proud as any new papa, Phillips described the enviro
piglets as ``fine-looking pigs . . . saucy, assertive, and eating
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, the Envropigs look like any other pig of the
Yorkshire breed. They are as pink and cute as ``Babe'' of movie
fame.
</P>
<P>
   But the inner Enviropig is a whole different story. In a surreal
bit of genetic engineering, the University of Guelph scientists
took a portion of gene from a common intestinal bacterium, E. coli,
and fused it to a fragment of mouse gene, creating a so-called
transgene.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse gene contained material controlling production of a
protein secreted by salivary glands. The bacteria gene manufactures
a fungal enzyme called phytase, which aids in the digestion of
phosphorus found in ordinary plant foods. Together, they should
allow the new breed of pigs to absorb the phosphorus contained in
natural food _ a quality possessed by no other pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse-bacteria transgene was microscopically injected into
fertilized pig embryos, which, in turn, were transplanted into sows
that became mothers of the Enviropigs.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips and his colleagues want to engineer a total of 10
``founder'' pigs that will mate with regular Yorkshire sows, but _
in theory _ produce piglets with the designer transgene. This first
trio of pigs will reach sexual maturity in late December, and be
put to breeding the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely to be three to five years before the Enviropigs
become available to hog farmers _ and there are still lots of
practical questions beyond the broad scientific-moral questions
raised by genetic engineering itself. Will successive generations
of Enviropigs be as plump and tasty as ordinary pigs? Will they
consistently pass on the artificially-created
``phosphorus-digesting'' gene to offspring?
</P>
<P>
   The new breed will have to be approved by Canadian
environmental, health and food safety regulatory agencies before it
is released to hog raisers in North America and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize there are lots of people who are going to be
worried by this sort of science, and we want to put safety first,''
said Stam, who also serves as chairman of the research committee of
the Ontario Pork Producers' Marketing Board, an organization of
farmers that paid for some of the Guelph research.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the environmental benefits, pig producers see a big
potential payoff from the Enviropig. Since the animals digest the
phosphorus found in ordinary feed, there should be no need of the
pricey mineral phosphorus additives fed to hogs on commercial farms
in order to boost growth.
</P>
<P>
   Ontario Pork officials calculate that raising Enviropigs could
save the farmer an average of $1.19 in feed costs for each animal _
a sum that translates into tens of millions of dollars a year in
savings for the North American pork industry.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there's a possible benefit for the developing world,
where farmers cannot afford additives and therefore tend to produce
scrawnier pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Ontario Pork has exclusive license to distribute the pig to
swine breeders and producers worldwide. ``We're hoping this will be
one special pig,'' said Stam. ``These are pretty exciting days on
the farm.''

JET: BLACK AND READ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In a recent documentary on the history of America's
black press, one veteran journalist eloquently explained its
function. Blacks ``were truly invisible'' in the media, he said.
``But in the black press, we did get married.''
</P>
<P>
   The film concluded that the 140-year-old black newspaper
business essentially died in the 1960s when the mainstream press
began hiring away black reporters. But John Johnson, the feisty
81-year-old multimillionaire magnate who publishes Jet and Ebony
magazines, offers another theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black newspaper thrived on protest, they thrived on
getting rights for black people,'' he says. When those rights were
officially won, ``the black newspapers failed to make that
transition.'' But ``we didn't forget that people had to lead normal
lives. They had to get married.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why 48 years after Jet's founding, one of the magazine's
enduring features is ``Society World,'' a photo collage of nuptials
and anniversaries. A black person has to be ``real hoity-toity to
be in the wedding section of white publications,'' says Johnson
with a smile. But not in Jet magazine.
</P>
<P>
   An Arkansas native and robust octogenarian (regular exercise, no
tobacco or alcohol), Johnson did not become one of the most
powerful black businessmen in America by misjudging his market. The
holder of 30 honorary degrees and 1996 recipient of the
Presidential Medal of Freedom, he runs a company _ which includes
the magazines and a major cosmetics operation _ that is the
nation's second-largest black business, with nearly $372 million in
annual sales, according to the latest issue of Black Enterprise
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Started with a $500 loan Johnson took against his mother's
furniture, the 57-year-old Chicago-based Johnson Publishing Co. is
a private family enterprise. Its boss has a simple theory for the
success of Jet, a no-frills, apolitical, pocket-size, retro-looking
weekly digest of news: ``It's just having a sensitivity about what
black people want to know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the magazine's reputation for being chock-full of
short and tidy tidbits of information, longtime reader Vicki Jones
says, ``USA Today is white people's version of Jet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a saying,'' adds senior editor Sylvia Flanagan. ``If
it wasn't in Jet, it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While the standard-size, glossier, more feature-oriented Ebony
has the larger circulation _ 1.75 million to Jet's 927,000 _ there
is one stunning figure that best illustrates the fanatic loyalty
Jet seems to inspire. There is a stratospheric pass-along rate of
9.7 readers per copy, meaning that each issue is seen by about 9
million people. Flanagan attributes the pass-along phenomenon to
Jet's compact size, and thus easy portability and readability,
noting ``we're like a family member.'' (Interestingly, Jet's
penetration of Boston's black population is the second-lowest of
any of the nation's top 100 black-census cities.)
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's editorial content starts with the staff's regular
perusal of about 50 newspapers, Associated Press stories and the
offerings of dozens of photo agencies. Some pieces are rewrites of
news stories, others entail more thorough follow-ups. The stories
are short, basic, and mostly without bylines. The common thread is
that it is news for and about black people.
</P>
<P>
   That style hasn't changed dramatically since the inaugural Nov.
1, 1951 issue featured Edna Robinson _ wife of boxing great Sugar
Ray Robinson _ on the cover. Today's cover subjects include Aretha
Franklin, Samuel L. Jackson, and Deion Sanders. Inside are popular
items like ``This Week in Black History,'' ``Society World,'' and
``People'' as well as features on music, movies, and television.
Another traditional element, and one that is printed in color in an
otherwise predominantly black-and-white magazine, is the
pinup-style ``Beauty of the Week'' photo.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leads to questions about Jet's editorial
philosophy, which seems to lie somewhere between Sgt. Friday's
``just the facts, ma'am,'' approach and a Dale Carnegie dose of
feel-good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to be positive,'' notes managing editor Malcolm
West, a goal manifest in much of the upbeat information about black
movers and shakers. But Johnson also contends that ``we report the
news,'' and Jet does run its share of stories featuring the kind of
violence, mayhem, and racial strife you'd find on Page 1 of any
American newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But ``deep down, at the end of the day, we're trying to give
people hope,'' Johnson explains.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the temptation is to view Johnson and his upbeat
magazine that chooses not to rock the boat as throwbacks to the bad
old days in America's racial history. (With a chuckle, he explains
how southern blacks knew which white candidate to vote for when
both used the N-word on the campaign trail: The one who said it
more quietly.)
</P>
<P>
   But then, with vivid clarity, he recounts a 40-year-old story
about being denied a reservation in a tony Washington hotel and a
different philosophy emerges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have ever known discrimination and humiliation, it
never goes away,'' Johnson says. ``Everything I do is a response to
discrimination.''

HEMINGWAY ON KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
 CITY-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PAUL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Kansas City was a strange and wonderful place,'' Ernest
Hemingway once wrote but never published.
</P>
<P>
   It was a place where ``the food was good,'' where the people
spoke ``the purest American'' and where, frankly, some years later
he found it dull.
</P>
<P>
   To him, the city's memorable images included the warmth of
winter-time lunch wagons, the varied inventory of Downtown pawn
shops and the clouds of smoke and steam that rose from the
railyards outside the new and impressive Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway put these Kansas City observations on paper about
1932, when he was already one of the most celebrated of American
writers. They are being published below for the first time, on the
verge of the 100th anniversary of Hemingway's birth on July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Amounting to just a few paragraphs, these fragments don't
compare in scope with the unfinished Hemingway book, True at First
Light, that is being published in July.
</P>
<P>
   But they do something rarely seen in Hemingway's novels, essays
and short stories: They give character and a sense of place to
Kansas City, where Hemingway spent six and a half months at this
newspaper and to which he returned from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   They also provide a small but valuable piece of evidence that
can help a reader solve a long-standing puzzle: Just what exactly
did Hemingway mean when, in one notable short story, he compared
Kansas City to Constantinople?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the literary world at large has not been awaiting
this fresh Hemingway. They will find little to chew on in these
passages. But for those with an interest in how Hemingway and
Kansas City go together, these nuggets, however small, will be a
treat.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway long appreciated the writing advice and the
shoe-leather experience he got cranking out police and
emergency-room items at The Kansas City Star in 1917-18. To a
Kansas City reporter in 1940 he declared the newspaper's style-book
admonitions _ ``Use short sentences,'' ``Eliminate every
superfluous word,'' for example _ to be ``the best rules I ever
learned for the business of writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, of all the places associated with Hemingway, Kansas City
ranked relatively low on his inspiration scale. This essentially
was a layover in the 18-year-old Hemingway's exuberant journey from
boyhood to the writing fame he so urgently sought.
</P>
<P>
   When Kansas City appears in the short stories, novels,
non-fiction books and journalism Hemingway wrote in the 40-odd
years after leaving here, it's more often as a name than as a place
_ neither the place he saw nor the place he might have created in
his imagination. Hemingway never preserved Kansas City's character
in print as he did with, say, Paris or Pamplona or the woods of
upper Michigan. Hemingway likely had some Kansas City stories on
paper as early as 1922, but they would have met the same fate as
the rest of his manuscripts in progress at the time: The valise his
wife, Hadley, had packed them in was famously stolen in a Paris
train station.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there one of Hemingway's characters admitted, without
obvious derision or hometown pride, to hailing from here. But
overall, Kansas City was _ to borrow a phrase long associated with
the importance of the unstated in Hemingway's writing _ ``the thing
left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Green archival document boxes line part of one wall in the
triangular Hemingway Room at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston.
The library holds the largest collection of Hemingway manuscripts,
letters and other memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   In one box is a folder relating to the short story ``God Rest
You Merry, Gentlemen.'' Along with ``A Pursuit Race,'' the story is
one of two (out of 50-some published in his lifetime) that
Hemingway set directly in Kansas City, not counting one
paragraph-long vignette.
</P>
<P>
   In ``God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen,'' a journalist-narrator
recounts a tale he heard while visiting two doctors: A young man
arrives at the hospital on Christmas Day and begs the doctors to
castrate him because of his constant sinning. The doctors send the
boy off, but overnight he is brought back in, bleeding profusely
from the amputation he performed on himself with a razor.
</P>
<P>
   The archive folder contains two typescripts of the finished
story, which first appeared in print in 1933, and some manuscript
pages written in Hemingway's generally neat and readable hand. It's
on those latter sheets of paper that this new Kansas City material
appears. One can easily see how they relate to the opening lines of
``God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen,'' in which Hemingway, as he often
did at the beginning of a story, sets a scene.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how the story, as published, begins:
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days the distances were all very different, the dirt
blew off the hills that now have been cut down, and Kansas City was
very like Constantinople. You may not believe this. No one believes
this; but it is true.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator goes on to describe a snowy afternoon walk from
``Woolf Brothers' saloon'' to the hospital, ``which was on a high
hill that overlooked the smoke, the buildings and the streets of
the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway had spent three weeks in the Turkish seaport of
Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1922, four years after his Kansas
City stint and 10 years before he finished ``God Rest You Merry,
Gentlemen.'' He was covering Europe for the Toronto Star in the
early 1920s and got to ``Constan'' in time to witness the Greek
army's retreat during the Greco-Turkish flareup.
</P>
<P>
   How true was Hemingway's comparison of Kansas City and
Constantinople?
</P>
<P>
   To read some of these manuscript fragments is to wonder; and to
raise such questions as, What's the difference between literal
truth and a writer's truth? (``A writer of fiction is really ... a
congenital liar,'' Hemingway writes in the soon-to-be-published
True at First Light, ``who invents from his own knowledge or that
of other men.'')
</P>
<P>
   One caveat about what follows: Unpublished fragments show a
writer at work, and sometimes it's not pretty. Awkward sentence
constructions occur as images make their way from brain to finger
to pencil to paper. Sometimes a writer's impulse is to just get it
down and save the polish for later. Good writers frequently note
that the real writing is in revision. Hemingway was a famous,
perhaps compulsive reviser. Early drafts were never meant to see
print. Hemingway's widow, Mary, recognized their value to students,
scholars and readers when she gave the JFK Library the thousands of
pages of writing and scraps that make up the heart of the archives.
</P>
<P>
   Item No. 426 in the archives represents a false start to the
story:
</P>
<P>
   NOTE TO PAGINATORS: INDENT THIS GRAF ON BOTH SIDES:
</P>
<P>
   All of the distances are changed in Kansas City now and many
streets have died to nourish the new skyscrapers and it no longer
seems as much like Constantinople since they have cut down the
hills, although the organization is the same ...
</P>
<P>
   END INDENT
</P>
<P>
   After a crossed-out phrase and an unreadable word, Hemingway
went on:
</P>
<P>
   INDENT ONE GRAF HERE:::
</P>
<P>
   ...the people still speak the purest American, with no local
accent or provincial turns, (begin crossed-out passage) and this is
the size town where people have time to remember things that have
occurred (end cross-out) and the food is good, and there are many
friends, yet it seems dull now.
</P>
<P>
   END INDENT
</P>
<P>
   The second and longest fragment in the folder, Item No. 427,
yields better information about the Kansas City-Constantinople
connection as well as some vivid descriptions of a street scene and
of Union Station, which at the time Hemingway first saw it, was
only two years old.
</P>
<P>
   He crossed out his first try, then started again but quickly
gave up:
</P>
<P>
   INDENT GRAFS BEGINNING HERE
</P>
<P>
   (Begin cross out) In those days Kansas City was a strange and
wonderful place. (End cross out)
</P>
<P>
   There were bare dusty hills above the new Union Station that
were later the bare brown dusty hills of Constantinople. In those
days Kansas City ...
</P>
<P>
   END INDENT
</P>
<P>
   Here Hemingway interrupted himself. He drew a line across the
page before going on.
</P>
<P>
   But before we get back to what he wrote, it's a convenient time
to return to Constantinople.
</P>
<P>
   That line -- how the bare dusty hills ``were later the bare
brown dusty hills of Constantinople'' -- disappeared before
publication of the story, but it helps make clear how physically
Kansas City appeared to be ``very like Constantinople.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the fragment soon states that a viaduct near Union
Station ``later was the Galata Bridge,'' meaning one reminded him
of the other in some unstated way.
</P>
<P>
   The Galata section of Constantinople was the merchant district,
and, as can be seen below, the Kansas City viaduct in Hemingway's
memory had a bustling, mercantile quality to it. But the Galata
district also offered many late-night attractions, Hemingway
suggested in stories he published elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   To make the Kansas City-Constantinople comparison even clearer,
it's necessary to piece together this fragment with those other
writings. One was a dispatch for the Toronto Star in 1922; the
other was a section of Death in the Afternoon, Hemingway's
non-fiction book about bullfighting, published in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from those brief published accounts, Hemingway must have
spent more than one late night driving down to the Bosporus River
of Constantinople to ``sober up and watch the sun rise.''
</P>
<P>
   In Death in the Afternoon, while commenting on the after-hours
attractions of Constantinople and Madrid, he is quickly reminded of
Kansas City. In that section, Hemingway implies a late-night revel
occurred after he visited the Republican National Convention here
in 1928. Then, he was motoring back to his cousins' place ``in the
country'' _ they lived on Indian Lane in Mission Hills _ and he saw
what looked to be a fire in the distance. He drove in that
direction, topped a hill and witnessed a glorious sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   All of that imagery _ the late nights, the sobering up by the
river, the sunrise, and, of course, the bare dusty hills _ can now
very much be brought to mind when one reads that ``Kansas City was
very like Constantinople.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the line he drew across the page, Hemingway had another
false start, followed by an extended description of what he saw
here:
</P>
<P>
   In those days Kansas City was a strange and wonderful place and,
later, (begin crossout) The New Union Station was a wonderful
building (he placed four words above this scratched-out line:) the
finest in America (end crossout).
</P>
<P>
   You came to the Union Station from the Fifteenth Street Police
Station across a long viaduct that later was the Galata Bridge and
on the viaduct were the pawn shops with shotguns and banjos and
field glasses in the windows and many kinds of watches and all
sorts of jewelry and fur coats on (racks) on the sidewalk and the
proprietors always outside the door to make a sale. Even in the
coldest weather when some of them would be inside you could not
look in a window without bringing the proprietor out. Between the
pawnshops were the cut rate ticket agencies with long lists of
destinations and their prices Tulsa, today $2.00, Tucson, Arizona
$5.40, Fort Worth, $3.50 and places further away (...)
</P>
<P>
   There were lunch wagons too off the viaduct lit up at night and
warm inside (begin crossout) but the warmest places and the best to
be in were the saloons (end crossout) and as you crossed the
viaduct trains passed underneath and you would see ahead a cloud of
smoke and steam puffing up on each side of the viaduct as an engine
passed.
</P>
<P>
   The new Union Station was (word crossed out) built (end
crossout) all of marble inside and high and vaulted in different
corners were drug stores and restaurants and a book store and the
waiting room was back out of sight and what was in sight was great
space with an information bureau in the center with a roll of white
paper and an instrument that did automatic writing in purple ink.
</P>
<P>
   END INDENT
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, we see more of Kansas City in those three
previously unpublished paragraphs than we ever have in Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   An exception is one delightful but little-known story about his
gastronomic adventures that he wrote for the Toronto paper. The
story, published in November 1923, has an entertaining anecdote
about how Hemingway first ate sea slugs in Kansas City, while
making his way down the menu of a Chinese restaurant. It mentions
an after-work fight between a reporter and a waiter at a lunch
counter near The Star. And it also reverberates with an image from
these unpublished fragments, offering evidence of what he liked
about the nearby lunch wagons:
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City was a live town in those days, and the glory of
its nocturnal life was the all-night lunch wagon,'' Hemingway
wrote. ``Many a night I have stood in the shelter of an all-night
lunch wagon while the blizzard swept down from the great cold
funnel of the Missouri River valley and eaten chili con carne,
brown, red and hot all the way down, and real chilmaha frijoles
while I learned about life and Mexican home cooking from the keeper
of the wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   But did Hemingway sample the barbecue?
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of this story today, that will have to be the
thing left out.

MUSLIM SILENCE ABOUT ISLAMIC CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do American Muslims have to say about the ominous roundup
of Jews in Iran?
</P>
<P>
   Word reached the West earlier this month that at least 13
Iranian Jews _ and possibly as many as 30 _ have been held
incommunicado since March. They are accused, almost certainly
falsely, of spying for Israel and the United States. The prisoners
are from the poor Jewish communities of Shiraz and Isfahan; among
their number are rabbis, kosher butchers, a cemetery guard, and a
16-year-old boy. According to the independent Iran Press Service,
they have not been allowed to see their families or meet with
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In the anti-Semitic Islamic Republic of Iran, to be accused of
aiding Israel is practically to be sentenced to hang. ``The Jewish
spies for Israel will be tried for treason according to Islamic
law,'' Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi, the head of Iran's judicial
system, promised thousands of cheering worshippers in a prayer
sermon on June 11, ``and they may be sentenced to death _ not once
but several times.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Iran's Jews fled when the Islamic fundamentalists seized
power in 1979. The 25,000 Jews who remain are subject to severe
persecution. Calls for the release of the Jews who have been
arrested have come from around the world. The governments of
Argentina, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, Russia, and the United
States have expressed concern; so has the European Union, Amnesty
International, and the Dalai Lama. An Internet petition for the
Jewish captives' freedom (www.vjnews.com/iranpetition.htm) has
gathered more than 27,000 signatures. Even Jesse Jackson has
offered to intercede.
</P>
<P>
   But from America's Muslim community there is silence. There have
been no statements of outrage at Iran's persecution of a religious
minority. No full-page ads condemning Ayatollah Yazdi's invocation
of ``Islamic law'' to justify Jew-hatred. No pleas for the
prisoners' freedom from leading Muslim organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, this is typical.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan under the Taliban theocracy has become a vast
dungeon for women. In the name of Islam, Afghan women are no longer
allowed to work or go to school. They are forbidden to leave their
homes unless accompanied by a close male relative. In public they
must be covered from head to toe in a heavy shroud; let a glimpse
of ankle or wrist show, and the religious police may flog them on
the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The health of Afghan women has drastically worsened, since
examinations by a male doctor are now illegal and most female
physicians have been fired. Barred from the workforce, many women
have been plunged into poverty _ especially those whose husbands or
fathers died during Afghanistan's 20 years of warfare. The Taliban
say they are only doing what Islam demands.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations have denounced Afghanistan's sexual
apartheid. No doubt many US Muslims are privately appalled at the
Taliban's vicious oppression. But where are the public groans of
anguish that the teachings of Islam should be perverted so cruelly?
Why do American Muslim spokesmen _ so quick to cry foul if
Hollywood portrays a Muslim unflatteringly _ say nothing about the
crimes being committed by the Muslims who rule Afghanistan?
</P>
<P>
   Last August, terrorist bombings at the US embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania murdered 224 people. It seemed instantly clear that the
mastermind behind the attacks was Osama bin Laden _ a
multimillionaire Islamic fanatic who preaches that it is ``the duty
of Muslims to confront, fight, and kill'' Americans and their
allies. On that occasion, prominent Islamic voices in the United
States did speak out. But their chief message was not one of
horrified sympathy for the victims and their families, or of shame
that anyone calling himself a Muslim could perpetrate such an
atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   No _ what Muslim leaders were eager to communicate was a warning
to the media not to speculate about a possible Islamic connection
to the slaughter. A release issued by the Council on American
Islamic Relations was typical: ``American Muslims ask journalists
to exercise restraint in reporting on embassy bombings,'' ran the
headline. To this day, America's major Islamic groups have not
ostracized bin Laden _ or even labeled him a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   CAIR and organizations like it _ the American Muslim Council,
the Muslim Public Affairs council, the Arab-American
Anti-Discrimination Committee _ routinely issue ``action alerts''
to protest unflattering references to Muslims and Arabs in the news
and entertainment media. Sometimes these protests go to farcical
extremes. Earlier this spring, the ADC went after the Associated
Press for using the word ``terrorists'' to describe Hezbollah, a
homicidal Muslim militia that routinely fires missiles at Israeli
homes. About Hezbollah's ``Islamic'' policy of targeting civilians,
the ADC is silent.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim-Americans hate being stereotyped as supporters of
violence and jihad. Yet they keep quiet when violence and jihad are
waged by evildoers professing Islam. In Sudan, Arab raiders capture
non-Muslim blacks, then sell them to slavemasters who force them to
convert. In New York, Muslim extremists have bombed the World Trade
Center and opened fire on tourists in the Empire State Building.
But wait for American Muslim organizations to cry out against the
perpetrators of such enormities, and you are likely to wait in
vain.
</P>
<P>
   If US Muslims demanded the release of Iran's 13 innocent Jews,
Teheran would pay attention. But Muslims in America have their
priorities. Justice for the victims of Islam is apparently not
among them.

DEMOCRATIC DECEPTION ON GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1968, the average American voter was a white Midwestern male
who worked in manufacturing. He was married to a woman who worked
part time or stayed home with her two, three or four children. He
went to church on Sunday and believed in the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   He was liberal on economic issues, conservative on social
issues, and supportive of Cold War national security policies. He
was unwaveringly anticommunist. And he believed that, in the main,
American elites acted in the best interests of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the average American voter is a white Sun Belt woman who
works in the service industry. She is just as likely to be divorced
as married. She works full time and does not stay home with her one
or two children. She goes to church on Sunday and she worries that
her kids will be left behind in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   She is conservative on economic issues (she works hard for the
money), tolerant on social issues and deeply skeptical of
interventionist US national security policies. She is, above all,
worried about her parent's health (Who's going to pay for it?), her
own health, her children's education, and a culture run amok. She
believes that American elites are, in the main, self-interested.
</P>
<P>
   This woman will decide the outcome of the year 2000 presidential
and congressional elections. One can predict how virtually every
other demographic group will vote just by scanning their previous
vote patterns. But this baby-boom woman (who has been trending
Democratic in the last two elections) is not so predictable and
much more open to political dialogue and debate.
</P>
<P>
   She voted for Clinton in 1996, but actually agreed with Dole on
most issues. Lose her and you lose the election. She holds the
balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats believe they can win her allegiance in 2000 by
exciting her fears. Her deepest fear is that something will happen
to her children while she is at work. Littleton, Colo., was
emblematic of that fear. She could imagine herself on the other end
of that phone call from police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   This fear is what the political issue of ``gun control'' is all
about. It has nothing to do with gun control, per se. There are 200
million guns in circulation in America and over 220,000 laws
regulating their use. These laws range from the very strict
(they're basically illegal in New York City) to the very lax (There
aren't any state laws to speak of in Montana regulating gun
ownership).
</P>
<P>
   The notion that background checks at gun shows will somehow
prevent future Littletons is ludicrous on its face. In the age of
the Internet, the notion that those background checks can't be done
in one hour is equally ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing future Littletons, however, is the last thing
Democratic congressional leaders care about. Their interest is
self-interest. They want to regain their majority status in the US
House of Representatives. They think ``gun control'' may be their
leverage back in.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Democratic members chanted ``six seats, six seats''
during last week's ``gun control'' vote, as it went down to defeat.
Six is the number of seats they need to win back to control the
House.
</P>
<P>
   This why House minority leader Richard Gephardt, Democrat of
Missouri, said to his colleague John Dingell, Democrat of Michigan,
whose amendment doomed the proposed gun-control legislation,
``thank you.'' Had Gephardt truly cared about the issue, he would
have been livid at Dingell's parliamentary maneuvering. But in the
inside-out world of issue management, what Dingell had done was
hand his Democratic colleagues in suburban districts a a ``hot
button issue'' with enormous appeal to the new average Amercian
voter.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Bill Clinton has used the gun-control issue
repeatedly throughout his presidency and three presidential
campaigns (two of his own and the nascent Gore effort). Clinton was
governor of Arkansas for 12 years. During that time, he did exactly
nothing to strengthen gun laws because statewide polling showed it
would cost him votes. Only when he moved to the national stage did
he adopt the issue. He did so because focus groups told him it
scored well with average American voters.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly enough, ``gun control'' may well improve the
Democratic Party's fortunes in 2000. This is largely due to the
inability of the Republican congressional leadership to formulate
and articulate a serious agenda that appeals to the new average
American voter.
</P>
<P>
   Absent a serious GOP agenda, the president and his Democratic
allies drive the national debate. The fact that the issues raised
by the president and his Democratic colleagues are almost entirely
synthetic matters less than the fact that the GOP congressional
leadership has nothing to say.
</P>
<P>
   The old adage that ``you can't beat something with nothing''
applies. Even when that something is as cynical as Democratic
posturing on ``gun control.''

PORN CASES RAISE ISSUES OF WORKER PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- To the outside world, Erik Butler appeared at the top
of his game. The homeless shelter he ran had just been the subject
of glowing features in newspapers from Washington, D.C., to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Tuesday, Butler resigned abruptly from his position as
the Pine Street Inn's executive director amid allegations that he
had stored pornography on his office computer last year. The
allegations, coming on the heels of the November resignation of the
dean of Harvard Divinity School under similar circumstances,
reignites a debate about whether peeping at porn at the office
should be a firing offense.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who say that privacy is sacrosanct, and that
what is done on a productive employee's office computer should be
of no concern to the boss. But employers who are having to grapple
with the issue more frequently say what is done on office equipment
reflects the integrity of the company or institution.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, companies have had to develop strict policies about
Internet usage at work. Some have even begun monitoring where their
employees surf during business hours.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, though, continues to ensnare employees as the
tolerance for such behavior declines.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight employees were disciplined last month at St.
Louis-based Edward Jones &AMP; Co., a brokerage house, for sending
e-mail that contained pornography or offensive jokes. Another 19
were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the chief executive officer of Florsheim Group Inc.
was forced to resign amid allegations of lewd behavior that
reportedly included viewing pornography in his Chicago office.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republican Senator James Inhofe, of Oklahoma, was
embarrassed this month when two of his aides had to be disciplined
after they downloaded so much pornography onto their office
computers that the entire office network crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the presence of the Internet in the workplace raises a
host of questions: Are computer technicians being put in the
awkward position of becoming workplace cyber-police? Where is the
line drawn between one employee's right to privacy and another
employee's right to work in a harassment-free workplace?
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been muddied by the murkiness of the
circumstances surrounding the resignations of Butler and the
Harvard Divinity dean, Ronald Thiemann. Neither Thiemann, who lost
his deanship but remains on Harvard's faculty, nor Butler will
comment on the allegations made against him. Their employers,
Harvard University and the Pine Street Inn, aren't talking either.
</P>
<P>
   According to people familiar with the cases, the pornography
allegedly on Butler's computer was discovered by a coworker last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sources at Harvard say the pornography on Thiemann's computer
was discovered in October after he asked an information technology
specialist to transfer files from his hard drive, which was filled
with thousands of pornographic images, to a new hard drive. Harvard
Divinity School policy states that use of ``inappropriate, obscene,
bigoted or abusive material is prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Thiemann in recent weeks has been portrayed by
civil libertarians as a victim of nosey information technology
workers who should not have reported his alleged pornography use to
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the biggest issue in the Harvard case is why the
technicians were not disciplined for disclosing the content of the
computer files,'' said Alan Dershowitz, a law professor at Harvard.
``The computer technicians didn't have to look at the content of
the files they were transferring. These were snoops. These were
Peeping Toms.''
</P>
<P>
   While declining to discuss the details of the case publicly, a
Harvard spokesman rejected Dershowitz's assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We emphatically reject the idea that there was an invasion of
privacy,'' said spokesman Joe Wrinn. ``The information staff acted
entirely appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   Another question raised was whether Thiemann's position as dean
of the Divinity School should weigh into the equation. Robert Ellis
Smith, the publisher of the Privacy Journal, a Providence
publication, who is usually a staunch defender of privacy rights,
said he believes it should. He cited the example of a Massachusetts
bus driver who was fired after he drove the school bus during off
hours to an adult bookstore, emerging with a brown paper bag _ a
termination that Smith said was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's reasonable for the employer to act to protect the
reputation of the organization or the integrity of the job,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another question raised is whether there is something about
Internet pornography that makes employers especially uneasy. Are
they, for instance, more likely to punish an employee for use of
cyber-porn than they would be if a Playboy magazine were found in
an office desk?
</P>
<P>
   Eric Krause, a spokesman for Gillette Co., said the company
considers the display of any sexually suggestive material in the
workplace as a possible form of harassment _ be it on the computer,
in a magazine, or in a calendar on the office wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What may have been appropriate once in the manufacturing
environment is definitely not appropriate now,'' Krause said.
``Those tool calendars may have been up years ago, but if it
creates a threatening work environment, it's inappropriate and
unacceptable now.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in office mores is being driven by several factors,
experts say, such as the larger numbers of women in the work force
and the fact that most women no longer accept that harrassment must
be endured.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of Anita Hill against Supreme Court nominee
Clarence Thomas in the early 1990s prompted many companies to
develop sexual harassment policies. And the rapid proliferation of
computer and Internet technology has forced companies to scramble
to develop clear rules regarding Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Greenberg of the American Management Association said
employees should assume that anything on their computer could be
viewed by their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own personal advice is, don't be stupid,'' Greenberg said.
``If you're going to call a bookie, don't do it from your office.
If you're going to surf for porn don't use your office
connection.''

MAKING VACATION WORK AFTER DIVORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Second of two parts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If you're a parent getting ready to send your kids to visit
their father or mother for part of the summer, especially for the
first time since your separation or divorce, give yourself a break.
Just because you know this is important and special for your
children doesn't make it any easier for you. On the other hand, you
don't want to make it any harder for them.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tough transition for children of any age. Leaving
behind the parent they live with most of the year to visit a parent
they see only occasionally is anxiety-producing. A 5- to 7-year-old
wonders, ``What will Daddy be like? Will he still like me? Will I
still like him?'' An older child is more likely to focus on what
they'll do together: ``Will we do things that I like? Will Daddy be
fun to be with?''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do you need to help a child with his concerns, but you
also need to deal with your own.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sheehy, whose 14-year-old son, John, typically spends five
or six weeks each summer with his father in Seattle, remembers that
when he first started to make the trip, she would grow anxious as
the time approached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel myself getting more and more tense,'' she says.
``I was conscious of having to hold my feelings in.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing that she could.
</P>
<P>
   Children who have a sense that this visit is a threat to the
custodial parent are more anxious. ``They don't feel free to look
forward to it or to have a good time,'' says family therapist
Suzanne Midori Hanna of the University of Louisville in Kentucky, a
specialist in custodial issues.
</P>
<P>
   She tells parents to give children figurative and literal
permission to enjoy the time with their other parent. If parents
are in contact all year long sharing information, symbolic
permission is implied. The less collaboration and the more
hostility there is, the more children feel they are betraying the
primary parent by visiting the other one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They anticipate being caught in the middle, having to tell one
parent about the other. Kids hate that,'' says psychologist Carol
Philpot, dean of the School of Psychology at the Florida Institute
of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   While it's OK for a parent to ask questions about the child's
life, she tells both parents to stay away from questions about each
other, even if they are only an attempt to get factual information:
Is your mother dating? Did your father cook or do takeout every
night?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Setting the stage
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the time for the visit approaches, whether your child is
forthright in saying he doesn't want to go, whether you just sense
ambivalence, or even if he's expressing excitement, Hanna urges
getting the topic out in the open, preferably by asking questions.
To a child under 8: ``What do you think it's going to be like when
you get to your dad's?'' or ``Do you remember when you visited last
year?'' To an older child: ``What was good and bad about last time?
What would you like to see happen while you are there this time?''
</P>
<P>
   Even a 6-year-old has a vision of what she wants to happen, says
Hanna. The young child not only will have very concrete ideas _ ``I
want to go to the amusement park'' _ but will likely remember a
detail that surprises you: ``I didn't like the cereal Daddy had.''
The older child may be more abstract: ``Mom treats me like a baby.
She makes me go to bed too early.'' With either kind of response,
says Hanna, a good reply acknowledges a child's need and fosters
adaptability: ``The amusement park would be fun. I don't know if
your dad has that planned, but you could certainly tell him you
want to do that''; ``When you feel as if you're being treated like
a baby, it's not a good feeling, is it? Have you ever told your mom
that?''
</P>
<P>
   A preteen is the child least likely to want to talk to the other
parent about an issue that involves that parent, especially if he
feels the issue shows him to be babyish _ he wants a light left on
at night _ or needy: He wants more time alone with Dad without
Dad's girlfriend around.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna tells parents not to leave a child of any age alone on a
limb by saying something like, ``That's the way your dad is; you
just have to get used to it.'' Instead, we should act as a broker.
Preteens, for instance, may not want to make their dependency needs
known but they're happy to have your help as long as it's done in a
face-saving way: ``I could tell your dad that I'm worried about
this . . .'' Then say to the other parent, ``It'll embarrass Tim if
he knew you knew he was worried about this . . .''
</P>
<P>
   For the 9- to 13-year-old, ambivalence about going may have to
do with feeling inconvenienced or angry at being separated from
friends. As selfish as this may seem, it's a normal developmental
response, says psychotherapist and author Isolini Ricci, who heads
the office of family court services for the Family Court System of
California. Her book, a classic in divorce literature, is ``Mom's
House, Dad's House (Revised Edition)'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster).
</P>
<P>
   Rather than come down on a child for her feelings, Ricci
suggests acknowledging them and sympathizing: ``It's too bad we
live in different cities. It's too bad you can't see your friends
and your dad during the summer. Is there anything you'd like to see
happen to make this go a little easier?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding trust
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ricci says PPV _ phone, pictures, and videos _ can ease the
transition between homes. Before the trip, conversations about the
vacation by phone or e-mail can help a child feel in control. But
she cautions parents: ``Be sure to only offer choices you can live
with.'' It also helps a 5- to 10-year-old to see a video of Dad's
new apartment or of the new lamp Dad put in the child's room. If
nothing is new or different, what about a video of the office, or
of the new puppy at the neighbor's?
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anything serves as a connection, a reminder, a
refamiliarization,'' says Ricci. ``It rebuilds a sense of trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, it helps if the child takes videos or pictures with
him of classmates, teachers, and teammates. (It helps even more if
the parent requests these.) Says Ricci, ``It creates a connection
while the child gathers these materials because of the anticipation
of sharing them, and then it becomes a bonding activity once she's
there.''
</P>
<P>
   When a child is sad just before leaving the parent who's the
primary caregiver, try to find out why. Is it anxiety about being
there or worry at leaving you?
</P>
<P>
   For the former, a good response might be, ``Is there anything
you can take that will help cheer you up if you feel sad?'' Give
her something with good-luck charm quality: ``If you feel sad, this
will remind you of how much I love you.'' That sends a message of
reassurance as well as confidence in her ability to handle this.
</P>
<P>
   If she's worried about you, she's likely picking up on your
anxiety. Avoid saying things like, ``I hate to see you go, too,''
or ``The house will be so empty without you!'' This is the time to
give literal permission, says Hanna: ``I'll be hoping every day
that something fun is happening for you''; ``This is a time for
both of us to do some things we enjoy. You're going camping, and
I'm going to go to the movies every night! We'll have lots to tell
each other about!''
</P>
<P>
   The parent left behind
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You may also have to bite your tongue when your child calls from
the other parent's. Sue Sheehy remembers years when she practically
slept at her office rather than come home to an empty house, and
she counted the days until John returned, but she never let any of
that out over the phone. Now that John is 14, they are both
accustomed to the separation, but it helps that they got a dog a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me something to come home to,'' Sheehy says.
</P>
<P>
   With so much angst and preparation involved, a custodial parent
may well wonder if the visit is worth it. Hanna and Philpot are
quick with reassurances that it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for children to have both genders represented
in their life and to see the role model of both parents,'' says
Philpot.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna says all children have natural questions about their
parents. ``Whenever a child has the opportunity to answer them for
him or herself rather than to have to rely on someone else's
stories or opinions, it gives them peace of mind and a sense of
their own identity,'' she says. ``You're giving your child a
gift.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Encourage the other parent to provide details of what the
vacation will be like in advance. If she isn't forthcoming and you
know where they are going, get a book from the library: ``Since
you're going to the Grand Canyon, let's check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   --Encourage your child to bring souvenirs back to you. It's a
way for her to connect the two worlds.
</P>
<P>
   --While it's good for there to be some consistency between
households, especially around values and bedtimes, it's also OK for
there to be differences: ``In your father's house you go to bed at
10. In this house, bedtime is 9.''
</P>
<P>
   --The less you bad-mouth the other parent all year round, the
easier the transition to vacation will be for your children.

A WONDERFUL `WIZARD OF OZ' AT PANTAGES   THEATRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NANCY HEWITT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Many film classics do not translate well to the
stage. ``The Wizard of Oz,'' happily, is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   This ageless tale of a young girl who learns the true importance
of family and home after being transported to a fairy-tale land
over the rainbow, takes on an upbeat and spirited life on the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wizard of Oz'' is playing at the Pantages Theatre through
July 4. This production is broader and campier than even L. Frank
Baum could have imagined when he wrote his tale in 1900. Expect to
laugh _ and laugh and laugh and laugh!
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Rooney, JoAnne Worley and cast have taken camp to a new
level. Familiar scenes become fodder for their lively
interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   Worley is delightful as the Wicked Witch of the West. She's
zany, funny and just a tad intimidating. Her exaggerated movements
_ such as when she tells Uncle Henry (Tom Urich) about Toto biting
her _ have the audience in stitches.
</P>
<P>
   And Rooney zestfully plays three roles: Professor Marvel in
Kansas, the doorman in Emerald City and, of course, the mysterious
and powerful Wizard of Oz.
</P>
<P>
   As the Wizard, he is just as intimidating as Frank Morgan is in
the film. It is here that Rooney shines. Between the flashing
lights and shooting sparks, and that booming voice echoing through
a huge mask suspended in front of the curtain, it wasn't surprising
to hear shrieks _ but they weren't shrieks of fear. Kids and adults
alike responded with shrieks of laughter and thunderous applause.
</P>
<P>
   Accolades go to Francis Ruivivar, who takes the best mannerisms
of Bert Lahr, the original Cowardly Lion, and updates this
character's appeal with wit and panache. His lapses into an Elvis
Presley impersonation, ``Thank you, thank you very much,'' and
Austin Powers' ``Oh, behave'' have the right clout with today's
audiences. And that high-pitched whine, especially after Dorothy
(Jessica Grove) hits him on the face, is hysterical.
</P>
<P>
   And dear Toto, played by Plenty, is a delightful dog that
performs on cue and really seems to enjoy cavorting with his stage
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Young Grove has a beautiful voice, the kind that is sweet, full
and rich, like that of her predecessor Judy Garland. She is
credible as a young girl trying to find her way home.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Cogan (The Scarecrow) and Dirk Lumbard (The Tinman) also
have voices worth listening to. Lumbard's sentimental Tinman is a
surprisingly good tap dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johanson, who adapted and directed this stage production,
left no doubt he was trying to re-create a classic. The production
follows the film scene for scene but omits some of the details that
will not translate well to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   To re-create the scene of the four pals running through a field
of poison poppies, 14 dancers, costumed in green, each sporting a
huge red poppy headpiece and smaller poppy hand pieces, cavort on
stage. It works _ if you have a good imagination.
</P>
<P>
   A little disappointing was Glinda's (Judy McCauley) entrance in
the bubble. It wasn't a full bubble but a half one. But McCauley
was a refreshing change from Billie Burke, whose warbling voice
grated.
</P>
<P>
   Engineering a believable cyclone on stage, complete with
lightning, wind and a spinning house was done effortlessly by Ian
O'Connor and crew for the opening scenes of the musical. Missing
were the flying cow and the chicken coop but not Alvira Gulch
pedaling away on her bicycle _ then, before your very eyes _
changing into a witch on a broomstick. All the flying sequences
were ably done by Peter and Garry Foy.
</P>
<P>
   The lush scenery by Michael Anania _ including the yellow brick
road, the backdrops and the stormy sky in Kansas _ the colorful
costumes by Gregg Barnes and the exuberant dance numbers by Jamie
Rocco make you feel like you are in Oz.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from Oz back to Kansas features flashes of images
behind the house and snippets of dialogue from each of the
characters. This whole transition allows the characters playing
dual roles to change costumes without interrupting the flow of the
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wizard of Oz'' is destined to remain a classic _ both on
film and now on stage. &UR;  &QL;

 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Andy Epstein, a Harvard Law School graduate who joined a
prestigious New York firm before practicing at a big firm in
Boston, had an awful realization one afternoon: He hated his work.
It felt like an endless grind, and he worried that he was not
devoting nearly enough time to his two young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd made a terrible mistake in becoming a lawyer,''
Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He quit big firm life and took a job as an in-house attorney for
Lotus Development Corp. in Cambridge, Mass. Now he works out of his
house as a solo practioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed my life,'' he said. ``Being out of the firm,
suddenly I enjoyed being a lawyer. It was like a revelation. You
realize your life doesn't have to be your work and your work
doesn't have to be your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, so many young attorneys are leaving Boston firms in
search of fulfillment and a better family life that the legal
profession must consider ``revolutionary'' changes in the way it
operates, a Boston Bar Association panel said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-month study by the bar association's Task Force on
Professional Values and Family Needs found that 43 percent of new
associates quit within three years, largely because they felt they
had to choose between a career and a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were all surprised to see a number that big,'' said
Nancer Ballard, who chaired the panel and is a partner at Goodwin
Procter &AMP; Hoar.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new about lawyers working long hours. But the
study said that firms have become so demanding that for many
lawyers ``private practice is incompatible with daily involvement
in family life.'' Such sentiments are shared by both partners and
associates _ the junior lawyers who typically join firms
immediately after finishing law school and work for seven or eight
years before they become eligible for partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in danger of seeing law firms evolve into institutions
where only those who have no family responsibilities can thrive,''
said Lauren Stiller Rikleen, the bar association's president.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on a survey of 30 large and midsized Boston
firms and interviews with about 100 lawyers. Even though many firms
have adopted ``family friendly'' policies for those who want to
devote more time to domestic life, few lawyers take advantage of
them, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture at law firms is such that you are marginalized,''
Ballard said. ``Virtually no men opt for those packages and the
women who do are outcasts. They're perceived as not being real
lawyers anymore. What we hope will happen is that every single law
firm will read this report and take a good, hard look at itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The study comes at a time when attorneys are increasingly
questioning their profession. An earlier Boston Bar Association
study, released in 1997, found that attorneys at virtually every
sector of the legal community felt underappreciated, underpaid,
overworked, isolated, and sometimes blocked from advancement by
racial and gender biases.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the National Association of Law Placement
found two-thirds of all new associates quit their firms within six
years and that one-third quit in less than three.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Boston survey is among the first to pinpoint
family issues as a major cause of attorney unhappiness, the study's
authors said. And it may come as a surprise to local firms, many of
which have earned a reputation for treating associates better than
law firms in other big cities.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, according to the study, is that discontented
lawyers rarely communicate problems they are having with senior
members of the firms. ``Change will only come if people on the
inside are willing to be vocal,'' said Stiller Rikleen.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors said firms should change not only because
lawyers are discontented but because the defections may be
expensive. According to an analysis of law firm costs in Boston
conducted as part of the study, firms lose money when young lawyers
leave, mainly because they must gain several years experience
before they begin making money for the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first anybody has looked at the economics like
this,'' Ballard said. ``We're trying to tell these firms that they
have an economic model that doesn't work as well as they think it
does. We're trying to say that this isn't just a touchy-feely
issue. It's a matter of money for the firms.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, many firms reward attorneys who bring in
the most business without considering how much the work cost the
firm to perform, the study said. That means part-time lawyers who
generate profits but bring a relatively small amount of work to a
firm go unrecognized.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein has no regrets about leaving big-firm practice, and he
thinks that many firms are at least attempting to change their
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of firms are trying to get a lot better about
some of these issues,'' Epstein said. ``But in the meantime they're
losing some really good people.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Katy Abel, trying hard to ignore the fact that her 4-year-old
son has a death grip on her neck, is enjoying an ice cream. Six
months ago, faced with a hectic workload that kept her from
spending enough time at home, Abel left her part-time job as
features reporter for a Boston television station.
</P>
<P>
   But as Abel tries to keep cool with Rubin heading for a meltdown
in the ice cream parlor, she has no regrets. Abel, 40, has
discovered what a growing number of parents are realizing: Working
part time is no panacea for people struggling to juggle the demands
of career and family.
</P>
<P>
   For many, working part time actually increases the stress of
balancing job and family demands, and also exacts a toll on career
aspirations. Even those who have successfully adjusted to a reduced
schedule often pay a price for the privilege _ in one way or
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks that working less is the ideal solution to all
the stress in today's world, but it may in fact cause you more
distress,'' says Rosalind Barnett, a senior scientist in the
women's studies program at Brandeis University who has studied the
issue. ``You have to give up a lot in career advancement, in pay,
in benefits, and a lot of people don't realize that going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett is not talking about people who work part time in
low-paying jobs and would gladly give up free afternoons for
permanent full-time jobs. While the percentage of these
second-class part-time jobs has not substantially increased since
the 1960s, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics, neither has the
number of better-paying part-time positions for professionals such
as Abel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a lot of choice out there,'' Abel says. ``You can
work part time at a full-time pace, resulting in such stress and
anxiety that your children suffer, which did happen to me to some
extent. Or you can work full time and try to carve out a more
leisurely pace that allows you to be less burnt-out with your
children. I'm not sure either option is ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lip service paid to the need for more
family-friendly work arrangements, habits long ingrained in
corporate life make it hard for most professionals to work reduced
hours, even though surveys show that the vast majority wants to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that those who succeed at this kind of part-time
arrangement, usually professional women, do so against substantial
odds. Here are some of their stories, beginning with Abel's tale in
TV land. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Katy Abel &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even before she had children, Katy Abel was the type of reporter
who had no burning ambition to top the 6 o'clock news. Bright,
hard-working, and blessed with the kind of sculpted looks and big
blue eyes that are ready-made for television, Abel came to WHDH-TV
(Channel 7) from WBCN-FM as a freelance producer 10 years ago, to
work on children's programming. In 1991, she was promoted to
education reporter, and three years later began covering parenting
issues. Channel 7 offered Abel a three-year full-time contract.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, Abel and her husband, a benefits consultant, who
works with unions, were raising two young sons _ and Abel didn't
want to work more. ``I said no. I liked things the way they were,''
Abel recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Although working reduced hours was unusual in the frenetic world
of television news, she made the arrangement work by filing stories
in advance, coming in after her children's bedtime to edit them,
and choosing to remain a relatively low-paid talent in a field
where the big money goes to those with contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people I worked with were very accommodating. They
were willing to roll with the punches of my family life,'' Abel
says. ``There were times when I would get a call at 1:30 p.m. from
my son's school: `Sam is in the nurse's office with a fever. Can
you come get him?' ''
</P>
<P>
   If Abel's husband couldn't get away from his work, it was up to
her to tell the producers of the 5:30 news that her story had just
evaporated. ``They would either rearrange the show or they would
look at me desperately and say, `Is there anything you can do
quickly?' ''
</P>
<P>
   And Abel would try to pull a rabbit out of a hat, as it were.
``The parenting issues I covered were often seen as the Fluff of
the sandwich. There were the murders, the accidents . . . and then
what Katy is going to do today.''
</P>
<P>
   There were times, Abel admits, when she felt as if she were
``throwing garbage on the air because I didn't have time to do
great work.'' But that was the trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last fall, things changed. An incoming news director,
recognizing the value of stories aimed at viewers struggling to
balance child-rearing and dual careers, pressed Abel to do more on
her beat, on a tighter schedule. ``At first blush, I was very
excited about this,'' she says. ``But the demands on my time
increased and got to the point where I no longer had control over
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Abel says she was coming home at night ``very tired and stressed
out,'' and her children reacted predictably: They grew ever more
needy of her attention.
</P>
<P>
   One night, when her younger son pulled her down on the floor to
do a puzzle, Abel burst into tears. ``Rubin asked, `Are you mad at
me?' That's when I realized enough was enough,'' recalls Abel,
blinking away tears.
</P>
<P>
   She asked Channel 7 for more money so she could hire a baby
sitter to pick up the children and provide after-school care so
that neither parent would need to leave work early. And when
management declined, Abel left a secure on-air job for the
uncertainty of freelance work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all happened within a week of my 40th birthday,'' Abel says
ruefully. ``But I don't want this to be Katy Abel bashing Channel
7; it just wasn't a good fit for me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Since December, Abel says she has been enjoying extra time with
her children and has kept busy working on a book proposal and
shooting a story for ``CBS This Morning,'' which will air at the
end of this month.

DEE DEE AT THE HEIGHT OF HER POWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dee Dee, our all-purpose advice columnist, hesitates to take on
the word ``shag.'' However her hotline has been ringing day and
night, with calls from anxious citizens confused by the title of
Mike Myers's new Austin Powers movie, ``The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
Who else but Dee Dee can answer their questions and calm their
mounting hysteria?
</P>
<P>
   Here in America the word ``shag'' refers to a haircut, a dance,
a bird, and a carpet, among other things. However, in Britain,
``shag'' is a no-no, a nasty euphemism for what Dee Dee prefers to
think of as The Act of Love. Over there, its appearance in the
movie's title has caused something of a stir. An English friend of
Dee Dee's explains, ``It's not quite the F-word, but it's very
rude. For instance, you'd never say it to your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he might never say it to his mother. Dee Dee's mother has
heard it all, and then some. But now to today's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   I went to see ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' because I thought it
had something to do with baseball. I thought maybe it was about Moe
Berg, the World War I spy who later played for the Red Sox and
several other major league teams. But there was nothing in the
movie about baseball, or about anything, really. What gives? _ Left
Out, Ragtag, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shagging of baseballs in the new Austin Powers
adventure. Actually, there's none of that other kind of shagging,
either, just a lot of suggestive talk about it, because the
producers wanted a PG-13 rating. Dee Dee saw the movie in a theater
full of 12-year-olds, all of them laughing in the right places,
too. Dee Dee thinks they should be grounded indefinitely, and the
same goes for the movie's producers.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   Our rural idyll here in coastal Canada has been shattered by the
release of ``The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' Our tiny community has
become the subject of endless callow joking, even though its name
has nothing to do with the sort of shag associated with the movie.
As far as we know, anyway. What can we do? _ Seething in Shag
Harbour, N.S.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee understands your distress. She once passed through Shag
Harbour and a less shag-a-delic spot would be difficult to imagine.
She advises you to ignore the taunts and capitalize on the
connection. Invite tourists to stop and savor the atmosphere of
``The Town That Put the Word Shag on the Map.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   At this point I may be more sag-tastic than shag-tastic, but I
have enough long-term memory to recall the horror that followed the
release of the first Austin Powers film, when I was forced to
endure so many idiots repeating catch-phrases like
``Shag-alicious!'' and ``Behave!'' It's happening all over again.
What can I do? _ Plainspoken, Ridgeback, MA
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee suggests you practice saying the same phrases in the
most obnoxious manner possible, repeat them over and over again and
hope your tormentors take the hint.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   I purchased a talking Austin Powers doll for my 8-year-old
daughter and the first words out of its snaggle-toothed little
mouth were, ``Shag me, baby!'' I understand this is a smutty remark
of some sort, so I am thinking of suing the doll's manufacturer,
the producers of the movie, and everybody involved in project right
down to the gaffer, whatever that is. Do you know a good lawyer? _
Hopeful, Red Tide, ME
</P>
<P>
   What did you expect an Austin Powers doll to say? ``Honor thy
father and thy mother''? Dee Dee suggests that you have the doll
re-programmed to recite excerpts from ``The Book of Virtues for
Young People.''

DEER TICK   THREAT   IS SERIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When summer comes, so do the bugs that bite. Some, such as deer
ticks, carry serious diseases, one of which is Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   The East Coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota account for 90 percent
of reported cases, although Lyme disease has occurred in 43 states.
Where it is endemic, such as on the Massachusetts shore and
islands, many residents carry antibodies even though they may not
be aware of having been infected.
</P>
<P>
   Bambi and her deer kin are the ticks' favorite hosts, but when
looking for a blood meal, they will latch onto any warm-blooded
mammal, even us as we walk in tall grass, brush, and woods, on golf
courses, and along rustic paths.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of Lyme disease infections occurs between June and
August, when the adult ticks are looking for blood before laying
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 12 percent of human cases occur from March through
May. However, not all ticks are infected all the time. The woods
and fields are relatively safe for about two weeks in August before
the eggs hatch and during winter when the ground is frozen.
</P>
<P>
   A deer tick, which is the size of a period on this page, has to
be attached for 24 to 48 hours to transmit the disease. The ticks
crawl to protected areas under cuffs, collars, and waist bands, and
they will hide in hair. They should be removed with tweezers, after
being stunned with alcohol to get them to let go. Don't crush them
or leave the head attached. Check pets, too.
</P>
<P>
   If flu-like symptoms develop in 2 to 20 days, or if a red ring
develops around a bite, see a doctor. When diagnosed early, Lyme
disease can be treated with antibiotics, so get treatment because
Lyme disease can affect victims long-term and can be debilitating.
</P>
<P>
   Precautions are worthwhile! Apply repellants containing DEET to
either skin or outside clothing. (Works for mosquitoes and black
flies, too.) Wear long pants tucked into socks, and each day, check
the family for ticks, especially children.
</P>
<P>
   DEET is absorbed through the skin, and a concentration of 10
percent to 35 percent is enough for adults. A concentration of 12
percent should last about four hours, 7 percent about 3 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Older children should have concentrations under 10 percent,
specialists say, and small children less. DEET should not be used
on babies, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Polymer extended-release products are absorbed less. Skedaddle
(6.5 percent and 10 percent) was formulated for children but can be
used by adults. HourGuard's 25 percent spray (which is supposed to
last eight hours) and the 35 percent cream (12 hours) was developed
by the Army for adults (available from Amway, 800-544-7167).
Skin-So-Soft does not deter ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Higher concentrations of DEET make it last longer, not work
better. It has been used for 40 years with some rare incidents of
sensitivity usually associated with overuse and sweating. So
carefully follow the directions on the label.
</P>
<P>
   One can also spray tents and clothing (but not people) with
permethrin, a synthetic pyrethrum, which will last for several
weeks, even through a few washings.
</P>
<P>
   Lawns can be sprayed with it, too, and that will last a few
weeks. Be aware, though, that a dog will carry whatever chemical
you put on your lawn into the house on its fur, not just the less
toxic pyrethrins but the more toxic grub and crabgrass pesticides
as well.
</P>
<P>
   A new Lyme disease vaccine is being advertised directly to the
public through television and magazines. However, serious
reservations remain in the medical profession.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that even after the necessary three doses of
vaccine (given over the course of a year), it gives only about
70-80 percent protection, according to the state Department of
Health. The first two doses, taken a month apart, provide
protection only 49 percent of the time, the department says.
</P>
<P>
   Length of protection is unknown at this time, but booster shots
may be needed. The vaccine is expensive ($180) and is only approved
for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Another worry, according to the Medical Letter on Drugs and
Therapeutics, a nonprofit review of drugs published for doctors, is
that though the few minor side effects are well tolerated, its
long-term safety is unknown. Of most concern are development of
antibiotic resistance if one is later infected and its effect on
rheumatoid arthritis and some other neurological conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Department of Public Health says it is
concerned because the vaccine does not protect against other
tick-borne diseases, and is not 100 percent effective against Lyme
disease but may give people a false sense of security so they do
not take preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Partners Healthcare Newsletter suggests that, at this time,
the vaccine be given only to people in endemic areas who have
intense, long-term exposure such as landscapers, gardeners,
forestry workers, serious hikers, and campers.
</P>
<P>
   Partners says people who vacation for less than one to three
months have a less than 1 percent chance of getting Lyme disease,
and prompt treatment with antibiotics cures more than 90 percent of
patients with early stages of the disease, doctors say.

JACKIE COLLINS' HOLLYWOOD LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Hollywood Stars, a
weekly entertainment column with color and black-and-white art.)
 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of novelist Jackie
Collins. 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    With 200 million copies of 21 books sold in more than 40
countries, Jackie Collins is the McDonalds of the best-seller
lists.
 &HT;    The 50-something, British-born author, younger sister of actress
Joan Collins, has been a star in her own right since she published
her first novel, ``The World is Full of Married Men,'' in l968.
 &HT;    Its success spelled the end of her fledgling acting career, and
led to ``The Stud'' (l969) and ``The World is Full of Divorced
Women'' (l975). All three were turned into British films,
controversial for their steamy sex scenes and perfectly geared to a
celebrity-obsessed public.
 &HT;    By the 1980s Collins had settled in Hollywood and begun making
novelistic hay from her show-business connections. Such provocative
tales as ``Hollywood Wives'' (1983) give her readers the delicious
illusion of getting the inside dope on Tinseltown's dirty little
secrets and the big, bad and beautiful people who keep them.
 &HT;    Widowed in l992 after a 23-year marriage that produced three
now-grown daughters, Collins lives in a 16,000-square-foot mansion
in Beverly Hills _ white with leopard-skin accessories _ where she
continues to churn out her racy, thinly veiled romans-a-clef,
drawing on her insider's knowledge of the goings-on in Hollywood.
Several of these have in turn become hit television miniseries _
``Chances'' (l981), ``Hollywood Wives'' and ``Lucky'' (l985).
 &HT;    ``Dangerous Kiss,'' published this month by Simon and Schuster,
returns to the glitzy life of Lucky Santangelo, a woman who has it
all _ children, a great marriage and a lucrative career as a
Hollywood studio chief.
 &HT;    The other day I dropped by for a chat with Collins. Clad in
black pants, Robert Clergerie shoes and a black Armani jacket with
a lipstick-red collar, the author _ who is recently engaged to
real-estate pro Frank Calcagnini _ sat down amid her walls of David
Hockneys, tabletops crowded with her signature leopards and shelves
laden with translations of her books in a dozen different languages
to offer some no-holds-barred insight into her world. 
 -0- 
 &HT;    IVOR DAVIS: How did you get into writing?
 &HT;    JACKIE COLLINS: I grew up intrigued by the novels of Harold
Robbins and Mickey Spillane. Their books seemed very exciting, but
women were always stuck in the bedroom or kitchen and didn't seem
to do much at all.
 &HT;    So I decided I'd put my women out there doing everything men can
do _ only better.
 &HT;    Q: Are your characters based on real people?
 &HT;    COLLINS: Real life is much stranger than fiction, so although I
write about Hollywood I have to tone my characters down. How could
I match the stories of O.J. Simpson, the Menendez brothers or Heidi
Fleiss?
 &HT;    Some of my characters are quite recognizable, although they are
composites of actual people, not one person in particular.
 &HT;    Q: Let's get personal. Is marriage in your future?
 &HT;    COLLINS: I like being engaged. As an engaged couple they still
sit us together at Hollywood dinner parties. If we were married
they'd seat us apart. We don't like to be separated.
 &HT;    But we both feel marriage is just a piece of paper. If we're in
a romantic place and feel like it, we'll get married. To me being
married is having kids _ and I've got my family.
 &HT;    Q: So whose house is home?
 &HT;    COLLINS: We're perfectly happy the way we are. He has his house,
I have mine. We live together in whichever house is convenient for
that particular night.
 &HT;    Q: Who was the first person to break your heart?
 &HT;    COLLINS: When I was about 13 I looked about 18, and I made a
date with this American guy in London whose name was Cliff. He
looked exactly like Rock Hudson, and was supposed to meet me at
Baker Street underground station. I turned up but he didn't _ I
think he found out I was only 13.
 &HT;    Q: When was the last time you cried?
 &HT;    COLLINS: Last week I threw my shoulder out lifting weights. I
was in tears, absolute tears from the pain.
 &HT;    Q: What's in your handbag?
 &HT;    COLLINS: A camera. A phone. Makeup. A notebook, three or four
felt pens. Peppermints and Angel perfume.
 &HT;    I always snap a lot of photos at Hollywood parties, because I
worry that something might happen and I won't be able to photograph
it. I've got some great stuff. Maybe I'll do a picture book called
``Hollywood Snaps.'' It could be fun.
 &HT;    Q: What's your most shameless indulgence?
 &HT;    COLLINS: Chocolate and traveling first class. Not just any
chocolate _ it has to be those great orange-peel sticks covered
with milk chocolate.
 &HT;    Q: What would you do if you ruled the world?
 &HT;    COLLINS: I'd make sure that everybody had enough food _ and
chocolate _ and that things were fair for people.
 &HT;    Q: What turns you on?
 &HT;    COLLINS: A man in a suit with his tie slightly loosened. I go
for a slightly rumpled look in a perfect man. I prefer older men.
 &HT;    Q: What's your biggest fear?
 &HT;    COLLINS: Spiders. I hate them. If I find one, I drop a
wastepaper basket over the spider until I can find somebody who
will take it out and throw it away.
 &HT;    In these parts there are black widows that have a deadly bite _
but I don't examine them closely enough to check their identities.
 &HT;    Q: If you could meet one person on earth, who would that be?
 &HT;    COLLINS: Probably Bill Clinton, and I'd like to say to him,
``Why?''
 &HT;    Q: What's the most surprising thing about you?
 &HT;    COLLINS: When people meet me, they have my image confused with
the characters that I write. So they expect me to be more of a
bitch.
 &HT;    I don't think I am. I'm quite down to earth. People don't expect
me to be nice.
 &HT;    Q: What do you do for kicks?
 &HT;    COLLINS: Travel. I'm taking a trip on a private yacht with
friends this summer. We leave from Antibes to ports like Portofino
and Capri. Maybe I'll also be taking notes.
 &HT;    Q: Where do you go to shop?
 &HT;    COLLINS: The Serpette flea market in Paris. I don't shop for
clothes _ I've picked up an Art Deco desk and a fabulous
leopard-skin couch and chairs from the '20s. I get paintings and
beautiful old furniture.
 &HT;    Q: What do you despise and love about Hollywood?
 &HT;    COLLINS: I despise the phoniness of some people in Hollywood,
and I love the fact that it's really a little village.
 &HT;    Q: What are you plotting next on the book front?
 &HT;    COLLINS: A ``Hollywood Wives'' for the new millennium. It has
changed completely since my first ``Wives'' book in l983.
 &HT;    Then the women were behind their husbands, pushing and doing
what they could to help them. Today the Hollywood wives are the
Kate Capshaws and the Rita Wilsons. They have seven or eight kids,
maybe one nanny. They are looking after the house, looking after
the kids and have a career as well.
 &HT;    They are very equal with their husbands and do everything
together. It's a whole different dynamic.
 &HT;    Or they are Roseanne, paying their husbands the alimony.

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of novelist Jackie
Collins. 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    With 200 million copies of 21 books sold in more than 40
countries, Jackie Collins is the McDonalds of the best-seller
lists.
 &HT;    The 50-something, British-born author, younger sister of actress
Joan Collins, has been a star in her own right since she published
her first novel, ``The World is Full of Married Men,'' in l968.
 &HT;    Its success spelled the end of her fledgling acting career, and
led to ``The Stud'' (l969) and ``The World is Full of Divorced
Women'' (l975). All three were turned into British films,
controversial for their steamy sex scenes and perfectly geared to a
celebrity-obsessed public.
 &HT;    By the 1980s Collins had settled in Hollywood and begun making
novelistic hay from her show-business connections. Such provocative
tales as ``Hollywood Wives'' (1983) give her readers the delicious
illusion of getting the inside dope on Tinseltown's dirty little
secrets and the big, bad and beautiful people who keep them.
 &HT;    Widowed in l992 after a 23-year marriage that produced three
now-grown daughters, Collins lives in a 16,000-square-foot mansion
in Beverly Hills _ white with leopard-skin accessories _ where she
continues to churn out her racy, thinly veiled romans-a-clef,
drawing on her insider's knowledge of the goings-on in Hollywood.
Several of these have in turn become hit television miniseries _
``Chances'' (l981), ``Hollywood Wives'' and ``Lucky'' (l985).
 &HT;    ``Dangerous Kiss,'' published this month by Simon and Schuster,
returns to the glitzy life of Lucky Santangelo, a woman who has it
all _ children, a great marriage and a lucrative career as a
Hollywood studio chief.
 &HT;    The other day I dropped by for a chat with Collins. Clad in
black pants, Robert Clergerie shoes and a black Armani jacket with
a lipstick-red collar, the author _ who is recently engaged to
real-estate pro Frank Calcagnini _ sat down amid her walls of David
Hockneys, tabletops crowded with her signature leopards and shelves
laden with translations of her books in a dozen different languages
to offer some no-holds-barred insight into her world. 
 -0- 
 &HT;    IVOR DAVIS: How did you get into writing?
 &HT;    JACKIE COLLINS: I grew up intrigued by the novels of Harold
Robbins and Mickey Spillane. Their books seemed very exciting, but
women were always stuck in he bedroom or kitchen and didn't seem
to do much at all.
 &HT;    So I decided I'd put my women out there doing everything men can
do _ only better.
 &HT;    Q: Are your characters based on real people?
 &HT;    COLLINS: Real life is much stranger than fiction, so although I
write about Hollywood I have to tone my characters down. How could
I match the stories of O.J. Simpson, the Menendez brothers or Heidi
Fleiss?
 &HT;    Some of my characters are quite recognizable, although they are
composites of actual people, not one person in particular.
 &HT;    Q: Let's get personal. Is marriage in your future?
 &HT;    COLLINS: I like being engaged. As an engaged couple they still
sit us together at Hollywood dinner parties. If we were married
they'd seat us apart. We don't like to be separated.
 &HT;    But we both feel marriage is just a piece of paper. If we're in
a romantic place and feel like it, we'll get married. To me being
married is having kids _ and I've got my family.
 &HT;    Q: So whose house is home?
 &HT;    COLLINS: We're perfectly happy the way we are. He has his house,
I have mine. We live together in whichever house is convenient for
that particular night.
 &HT;    Q: Who was the first person to break your heart?
 &HT;    COLLINS: When I was about 13 I looked about 18, and I made a
date with this American guy in London whose name was Cliff. He
looked exactly like Rock Hudson, and was supposed to meet me at
Baker Street underground station. I turned up but he didn't _ I
think he found out I was only 13.
 &HT;    Q: When was the last time you cried?
 &HT;    COLLINS: Last week I threw my shoulder out lifting weights. I
was in tears, absolute tears from the pain.
 &HT;    Q: What's in your handbag?
 &HT;    COLLINS: A camera. A phone. Makeup. A notebook, three or four
felt pens. Peppermints and Angel perfume.
 &HT;    I always snap a lot of photos at Hollywood parties, because I
worry that something might happen and I won't be able to photograph
it. I've got some great stuff. Maybe I'll do a picture book called
``Hollywood Snaps.'' It could be fun.
 &HT;    Q: What's your most shameless indulgence?
 &HT;    COLLINS: Chocolate and traveling first class. Not just any
chocolate _ it has to be those great orange-peel sticks covered
with milk chocolate.
 &HT;    Q: What would you do if you ruled the world?
 &HT;    COLLINS: I'd make sure that everybody had enough food _ and
chocolate _ and that things were fair for people.
 &HT;    Q: What turns you on?
 &HT;    COLLINS: A man in a suit with his tie slightly loosened. I go
for a slightly rumpled look in a perfect man. I prefer older men.
 &HT;    Q: What's your biggest fear?
 &HT;    COLLINS: Spiders. I hate them. If I find one, I drop a

will take it out and throw it away.
 &HT;    In these parts there are black widows that have a deadly bite _
but I don't examine them closely enough to check their identities.

STUBBORN CASEMENT MAY NEED NEW ARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETEER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My Andersen casement windows are very hard to operate, and
they are only 12 years old. I sprayed WD-40 and other dry lubes on
the tracks and operating arms, which helped some, but they are
still hard to move. What else can I do?
</P>
<P>
   GLENN MILLEY, Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Call the manufacturer or the dealer. Andersen, like most
manufacturers of building components, is very sensitive to any
malfunctions or complaints, and might be able to do something.
</P>
<P>
   What has probably happened is that the operating arms are bent,
possibly by trying to force-crank the windows closed, particularly
if the windows are tight in their frames. This would account for
the dry lube helping some, but not a lot. You can buy replacement
arms at virtually any dealer or building supply house. The handyman
had just that problem with one of his casements, so he undid the
arm and took it to a store where he found a replacement. Worked
like a charm. The arms are relatively easy to remove and install.
If the handyman can do it without messing things up, anyone can.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My patio roof, of corrugated fiberglass, is outside my
bedroom window, and when nuts from an overhanging tree start
falling, it's like it's hailing baseballs; a real sleep disturber.
What can I put on the roof to muffle those cannonball impacts?
</P>
<P>
   JIM FITZPATRICK, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Hmm. You could put Astroturf or indoor-outdoor carpeting on
the roof. Either will provide good padding to deaden the sound of
the falling nuts. Both are breathable; that is, when they get wet,
they will dry out quickly. And, since the nut storm is seasonal,
you can take off the covering for most of the year. Or, suspend a
tarp over the roof, raising it a few inches. Or, put plywood on top
of the roof, then cover it with roll roofing. It all depends on the
size of the roof.
</P>
<P>
   The ony problem with the above is that anything you cover the
roof with will cut out a lot of light coming through the
translucent fiberglass panels. I don't advocate cutting down the
tree but you could cut some of the overhanging branches, which
would be a good idea anyway if they are that close to the house.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My pull-down attic stairs have some cheesy braces; in fact
the whole thing is cheesy, from a chain lumber store. Where can I
get quality folding stairs?
</P>
<P>
   DOUG BAIRD, Charlestown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Brockway-Smith, a large distributor of windows, doors,
staircases, and a million other manufactured house items, offers
three grades of folding stairs, which might be called good, better,
and best. You can order one from any local (not chain) lumber
store. The chains sometimes offer a middle-grade product.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I live in a 1750 house with soft pine floorboards. How can I
preserve them? Should they be sanded?
</P>
<P>
   PATSY REYNOLDS, Wilmington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Floors were often never finished in Colonial days, or were
painted. If yours were never finished, they are pretty dirty, and
there is no way you can clean them, or get them back ``new''
looking without sanding. But you can sand softwoods such as pine,
hard pine, fir, and cedar. Some people say you can't sand
softwoods; yes you can, but you want to be a little careful that
you don't get carried away.
</P>
<P>
   So, you can sand, and apply several coats of oil-based
polyurethane varnish. Or, if the floor is relatively smooth and
only dirty, you can clean it with paint thinner, then apply a floor
paint.
</P>
<P>
   I have never liked painted floors, mainly because paint does not
stand up well under wear and tear, and it peels more readily than
properly applied varnish. I have sanded my 1768 wide pine floors,
some with a belt sander (never again!) and some with a floor
sander, and they came out wonderfully.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I notice you recommend putting up cedar clapboards rough side
out. Why?
</P>
<P>
   STEPHEN WACHMAN, Milton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Three reasons: 1. They do not look different from
smooth-side-out clapboards. 2. The rough side holds stain, primer,
and paint better (stain is better than primer and paint). 3. It is
difficult for anything to stick to the smooth, planed surface,
partly because the planers at the factory sometimes heat the wood,
melting resin to form an impenetrable surface glaze.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Several weeks ago I heard squirrels scampering in the attic.
I can see the hole where they entered. I tried repellents, which
made them scamper even more, but not out. I tried an ultrasound
machine without success. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR JONES, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Wait. Check the attic in the daytime; squirrels usually go
back to their nests (in this case, your attic) at night. When you
know they are all out, plug the hole and cover with galvanized
steel plates. If the wood around the hole is soft and punky,
replace it. Squirrels may leave sound, well-painted or stained wood
alone, but once they get have gotten into the attic, they might try
again, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   Making sure all the squirrels are out of the attic is critical.
If they have babies, they're not going to leave for a while, so you
have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in a hurry, call a pest control specialist who will
remove the rodents. You can find such persons in the Yellow Pages
under ``Exterminators.''

INVENTED RITUAL FILLS A NEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ours is a culture with few rituals.
</P>
<P>
   We move around so much that it's considered perfectly natural
for people to come and go without any ceremony at all. In order to
make life's transitions meaningful, people often have to invent
their own rituals, imagining the details as they go along. That's
what my friend Kaiya did when her older daughter, Shannon, was
about to move from Marblehead, where she and her husband had lived
all their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying to my younger daughter,'' Kaiya tells me, ``that
in other cultures they might pass the hat as a way of saying, `We
give you our blessings.' I wanted to give Shannon and Mark some
kind of send-off, and Ali said that at Esalen, a personal growth
center in California where she lived for a while, that when someone
left, they had an auction to raise money for them. That's what
started us off.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiya and Ali put their heads together, and this is what they
came up with: a potluck supper at a local church, along with a
silent auction, a storyteller to entertain the kids, an altarlike
table with candles, flowers, and photographs, including a collage
of all the families in Shannon's mother's group, a book in which
people could write down memories for Mark and Shannon to take with
them, and a ceremony during which guests could reminisce about
their relationship with the departing couple.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon's dad made up a sheet of paper for each item offered in
the silent auction, and since guests could write down their bid at
any time during the evening, they were put under no pressure. The
auction featured items like an afternoon sailboat ride, a car
cleaning, a night at a bed and breakfast owned by a guest, and a
massage; objects that people had but no longer enjoyed, like a step
machine and antique prints; and creative endeavors, such as
notecards made out of photographs. One of the offerings, a flight
in a small plane, which was purchased for $85 at a previous
auction, was sold for $55 to someone who plans to resell it at an
upcoming church auction.
</P>
<P>
   You might call this item a flight of the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raised enough money to pay moving expenses,'' Kaiya says,
``and everyone ended up with something they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a group that eats organic, that dotes on vegetarian
dishes, that expresses its love through food. The food was
delicious. As his gift, Tony Toledo, a local storyteller, kept the
kids entranced with his tales.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the evening was a sharing ceremony, using an
American Indian talking stick. The stick itself was 7 feet tall _
Erica, who'd volunteered to make it, had misunderstood the
directions and thought she was making a ``walking'' stick _ and it
was decorated with bittersweet vines, pods, sticks, flowers,
feathers, and even bits of plastic trash collected at Mark and
Shannon's favorite conservation spot. The person holding it spoke
without interruption as the group stood in a circle for more than
an hour, listening to tributes from folks who had shared with the
two of them the work of raising children, preserving the
environment, creating an organic food co-op and a nature camp, and
raising public consciousness about the value of the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how proud you are of your kids,'' says Pete,
Shannon's dad. ``Well, it's different when you stand back and
listen to other people speak about your child as an adult. It was
very exciting to hear what other people had to say, and now I feel
as if my children are my peers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a little more difficult for Mark. ``It's very unusual to
be in the position of receiving, and receiving without giving
anything back. During the sharing, I felt a bit uncomfortable at
first, but it was such a touching experience to have people gather
together to honor who you really are. It was really moving for us.
No pun intended,'' Mark says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   This is what it means to be embedded in a supportive community
working together on cooperative endeavors, and why it is so
enriching to ground yourself in a larger reality than just your
nuclear family and your work. This is what it means to have made a
difference. When there are so many caring people in your life, it
takes a minimum of effort for each of them to provide something to
eat, something to auction, something to think about, and something
of sustaining value to take with you when you leave a fruitful
phase of your life behind.

HELP SEEN FOR EPILEPSY PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maureen Horrigan, 17, has suffered epileptic seizures since she
was 4 1/2 years old. For years, she woke up every morning with a
seizure and often got them when she was tired, losing
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   After years of trying different medications, she and her parents
opted for surgery at Children's Hospital in Boston in 1998. Doctors
shaved off her long, brown hair and implanted 148 monitoring
electrodes for two weeks in order to locate where in her brain the
seizures originated. Once surgeons located suspect areas, they
removed them.
</P>
<P>
   But the monitoring period offered an opportunity to Brandeis
University neuroscientists. While they would never subject even a
volunteer to such invasive testing, they asked the Windham, N.H.,
teenager if she would play a computer maze game during the
presurgical monitoring period. During the video game, they observed
the electrical activity in her brain to test a hypothesis that
certain brain waves are associated with navigational and spatial
learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have anything better to do. I could give up Jerry
Springer to help them out,'' said Horrigan.
</P>
<P>
   While Horrigan and other presurgical epileptic teenagers
maneuvered around the virtual mazes, Michael Kahana, an assistant
professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brandeis, found
episodes of a slow brain wave activity, called theta oscillations.
</P>
<P>
   Normal brain waves occur at different frequencies that are
linked to various brain functions. One rhythm of about 10 cycles
per second, the alpha wave, is associated with relaxation. The
theta wave is about four to seven cycles per second.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that although there have been many animal studies
linking these brain waves to spatial learning and navigation, there
have not been studies showing the link in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the first to establish this link in humans, is
published in this week's Nature magazine.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kahana, the theta oscillation brain waves may be
the key to learning and remembering how to find our way from one
place to another.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gyorgy Buzsaki, a professor of neuroscience at Rutgers
University who has done many studies on theta oscillations in
animals, said that proof of theta activity in humans is
significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If theta waves were absent in humans, then these theories and
studies done on animals would not apply to the human brain,''
Buzsaki said.
</P>
<P>
   In the video game, the researchers first led players through the
mazes with arrows placed at junctions. In a second round of trials,
they removed the arrows, leaving the teenagers to rely on their
memory to find their own way through the complex set of twist and
turns.
</P>
<P>
   Watching electrical signals, Kahana and his colleagues found
that various parts of the brain, including some not related to
seizure activity, produced the theta oscillations during both sets
of trials.
</P>
<P>
   During the experiment, theta oscillations occurred more
frequently and were more pronounced in mazes of greater complexity,
and they were more frequent during the recall trials than the
learning trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't simply show that there were theta oscillations, but
also the degree to which you see them,'' Kahana said. ``By
manipulating the task demands and complexity, you can modulate the
oscillations, which makes the evidence much stronger that
oscillations have something to do with our learning tasks.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Joseph Madsen, a neurosurgeon at Children's
Hospital and one of the study authors, the findings could help
neurosurgeons operating on epileptic patients do a better job of
removing parts of the brain without disturbing healthy parts
important for memory and other critical brain functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't really come up with a definitive test of where
memory is,'' said Madsen.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are also noninvasive methods for detecting
functional areas of the brain, such as functional magnetic
resonance imaging, which shows where the brain is activated in an
anatomic fashion, said Dr. Steven Schachter, an epilepsy specialist
at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The new study ``is an important finding in its own right,''
Schachter said. ``I don't see it necessarily helps doctors now, but
perhaps, maybe there is a long-term spinoff for epileptic
patients.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The pope wears it religiously. So does ``A Man in Full'' author
Tom Wolfe. Tennis fanatics court it faithfully. Brides and
debutantes also slip into it on their big day.
</P>
<P>
   It's the color white, the hottest shade for warm-weather
dressing and the perfect antidote to endless seasons of black.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's called a color, white technically is not. It's
simply a shade caused by the reflection of all the sun's rays that
do produce color.
</P>
<P>
   Every fashion look this season _cargo trousers, pretty peasant
petticoats and blouses, a simple T-shirt _ is represented in white,
in such fabrics as ribbed cottons and nubby linens, as well as
high-tech synthetics and open-weave silks. Designer Donna Morgan
did a series of white dresses for summer, ranging from a sleek
sleeveless sheath to a laced-back sundress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple styles make white as easy to wear as black,'' said the
designer. ``And on a hot day, white just feels fresh and clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill Hinson, Nordstrom's East Coast fashion director, thinks
white makes the most modern statement when worn head to toe. ``But
women will also find it easy to combine the many shades of white,''
she said, ``such as bright white, ecru, ivory and cement, for
maximum versatility.''
</P>
<P>
   These shades of white complement each other and work well with
darker colors. They also give a woman options when choosing the
most flattering white for her skin tone. According to Hinson,
brunettes with olive skin look best in bright white, while those
with fair skin and light hair look best in creamier shades.
</P>
<P>
   New York color forecaster Carole D'Arconte of Color Portfolio
Inc. refers to white as ``the silent color'' and ``the flavor of
the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fashion,'' she said, `` we've gone through the baby colors
of blue and pink. Now, we are starting all over with white. It's
virginal. It's pure. And white will take us into the year 2000 and
beyond, along with silver.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep your whites bright
</P>
<P>
   White clothing can get downright dirty in a hurry. If your
whites are cottons and cotton blends, simply throw them into the
washer. If they are cut from silk, rayon or linen, have them
dry-cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Allsbrooks of the International Fabricare Institute in
Maryland suggests the following ways to keep clothes bright and
white:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  White clothing should not be stored or hung in direct
sunlight. Most whites contain brightening agents that are broken
down by exposure to light. This contributes to yellow streaks or
discoloration. Unfortunately, once an item has been discolored due
to loss of brightener, there's no way to return it to its original
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't overuse chlorine bleach. It can break down the
brighteners in white garments. And never pour bleach directly onto
fabrics. Always dilute in wash water or a spray water bottle before
using.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If possible, remove stains when ``fresh'' by using home stain
removal products followed by washing. The longer a stain remains in
a fabric, the greater the chance that it will become permanently
``set.'' Incidentally, seltzer water makes a good stain remover.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure you don't overload your washing machine. If you cram
too much in, there may not be enough water flow for soil removal.

BANKS UNITE IN ON-LINE BILLING VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In another leap forward for electronic commerce,
three of the nation's largest banks have formed a new venture to
deliver bills electronically to on-line consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The system, known as the Exchange, will serve as a hub to route
electronic bills to 60 million potential bank customers and 59,000
businesses that mail mountains of bills each year.
</P>
<P>
   The executives of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co., Chase Manhattan Corp. and
First Union Corp. hope the venture will help them establish a
stronghold in the young and untested market for on-line bill
delivery, known in the industry as bill presentment.
</P>
<P>
   On-line banking has grown slowly because of consumer fears about
technology, security and privacy. Bank executives argue that banks,
as trusted financial institutions with longstanding ties to
customers, are the best business creatures to usher in the on-line
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Bank executives said the Exchange would be a great convenience
for consumers who want to view and pay all of their bills in one
simple format by using their personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The system also will save billions of dollars for corporations,
such as telephone, utility and cable companies, which spend $1.50
to $2.70 to deliver each bill statement in paper form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the very beginning of a very important, emerging
business,'' said Sharon Osberg, head of Wells Fargo Online
Financial Services. ``We believe we're filling a gap in the
marketplace, and the Exchange is the missing link.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Braco, a Chase Manhattan executive, added: ``Easy access
to a critical mass of billers and consumers is fundamental to the
wide-scale growth of electronic bill presentment and payment.''
</P>
<P>
   The banks teamed up on the venture in January. They will test
the new system in the next few days, then roll it out nationwide in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Bank executives declined to say how much the venture is costing,
but they said each bank is investing an equal amount and will share
any profits in the venture.
</P>
<P>
   New York City-based Chase Manhattan is the nation's second
largest bank, with $368 billion in assets. First Union, based in
Charlotte, N.C., is the sixth largest, with $223 billion in assets.
San Francisco-based Wells Fargo is the seventh biggest bank, with
$201 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The Exchange will use software and other technology from Sun
Microsystems Inc. and Visa USA Inc. The technology will be
developed by Sun, while Visa will supply several software
components and support to the system.
</P>
<P>
   The Exchange will compete for customers with other similar
ventures, such as Integrion Financial Network, partly owned by
BankAmerica Corp., and TransPoint, formed two years ago by the
Microsoft Corp., First Data Corp. and Citigroup Inc.

UNITED TO START DIRECT FLIGHTS TO SHANGHAI 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ United Airlines plans to begin nonstop service
from San Francisco to Shanghai next spring. It would be the first
nonstop service for an American carrier to the Chinese city since
United suspended summertime-only flights three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Department of Transportation awarded five
``frequencies,'' or scheduled flights, to United for use between
the United States and China, according to United spokesman Matthew
Triaca. United has elected to use all five to serve the
Shanghai-San Francisco route, which means it will fly between the
two cities nonstop five days a week, year-round. The exact launch
date and days of service are to be decided, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is regarded as the industrial and financial center of
China, and Silicon Valley and the Bay Area are key business
centers,'' Triaca said. ``There is also a large Chinese community
in the Bay Area. We're going to link these two complementary
business centers.''
</P>
<P>
   United is the biggest carrier at San Francisco International
Airport, with half of all flights and passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Air China, China's flag carrier, flies twice a week nonstop
between San Francisco and Beijing and Shanghai. Other major
carriers, such as Northwest, fly to Shanghai via Tokyo or Beijing,
with a change of planes required.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco airport's director of international
development, Greg Moix, said the airport vigorously lobbied the
Department of Transportation for the new service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business travelers will be a large portion of the
passengers,'' Moix predicted. Business travelers require frequent
flights, pay high fares and often fly on short notice, making them
lucrative customers for airlines that can offer frequency and
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Chicago-based airline, which is owned by the
UAL Corp., said: ``More than 30 business and community
organizations _ including a number of high-tech companies based in
Silicon Valley _ sent letters in support of the new service to the
Clinton administration.''

MEDIAN HOME PRICE SURGES IN SAN FRANCISCO AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The median price for a home in the San Francisco
Bay Area has passed the $300,000 milestone.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, homes resold in the nine-county region in
May edged past that figure to reach a median of $301,000, according
to Acxiom/DataQuick, a real estate information service.
</P>
<P>
   No other region in the state comes close to the Bay Area
figures, Acxiom/DataQuick analyst John Karevoll said. The next
closest area was Orange County, where the median price of a home
was $262,000. Overall, the median price for a home in California
was $181,000 last month.
</P>
<P>
   The rising prices in the Bay Area are caused by a robust economy
and a dearth of homes. Yet Karevoll said it could be _ and has been
_ worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are high and it does give you sticker shock. But
when you take into account the mortgage rates that are prevailing
now, you still pay less money each month than you were 10 years
ago,'' he said. ``Homes seem horrendously expensive and an
increasing number of people are being priced out of the market, but
it is still much better than the frenzy of '88, '89 and '90.''
</P>
<P>
   The median price for a Bay Area home in May increased 3.1
percent from the $292,000 reported in April. The May figure was up
7.5 percent from $280,000 in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
   The highest median home price by county were:
</P>
<P>
   _ $450,000 in Marin, up 20 percent from May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _ $420,000 in San Mateo, up 14.4 percent from the year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   _ $372,000 in San Francisco, up 8.5 percent from May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of resale homes sold in the Bay Area in
May dipped to 7,331 from 7,849 in April, a 6.6 percent drop.
Karevoll said this was a normal fluctuation in the market, which
saw a 5.3 percent increase in the number of homes resold a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest increase in sales is happening in Solano County as
well as some of the cities on the outskirts of Alameda and Contra
Costa counties, Karevoll said. Solano County experienced the
greatest percentage increase in homes sold _ a 28 percent jump from
last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing now is that the entry-level market is coming
back on line with the rest of the markets,'' Karevoll said,
explaining the more affluent sectors responded more quickly to the
economy's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate service expects sales counts to stay at current
levels through the rest of the summer and into fall.

JUDGE RULES IN NEWSPAPERS' FAVOR ON NEWS RACK LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal judge has temporarily blocked the city
of San Francisco from launching a program to banish thousands of
old-style news racks and replace them with new vending devices in
designated places.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong of Oakland issued a
preliminary injunction on Wednesday against the city's new ``Fixed
Pedestal Newsracks'' ordinance, saying the plan intended to tidy up
crowded street corners posed a threat of censorship.
</P>
<P>
   In a 47-page ruling, Armstrong concluded that the Department of
Public Works had the right to ban individual news racks from parts
of San Francisco, and to require publishers to apply for permits to
distribute newspapers from news pedestals for a $30 annual fee.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said a group of publishers who challenged the
ordinance had raised ``a serious question concerning the adequacy
of procedural safeguards'' that were necessary to ensure that the
city could not indefinitely delay decisions on granting permits.
</P>
<P>
   On that basis she prohibited the plan from proceeding, pending
further hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ordinance fails to prescribe adequate time limits by which
cubicle permit decisions are to be made, and also fails to provide
for adequate judicial review of permit decisions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This potential for delay is one of the dangers of prior
restraints,'' she said, noting that the ordinance specifies no time
limits for city officials to respond to appeals from publishers
denied access to the pedestal vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Under an ordinance approved a year ago by the Board of
Supervisors, the city plans to replace 12,000 free-standing news
racks with 1,000 ``fixed pedestal'' news racks containing cubicles
offering multiple publications.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Works director would designate pedestal-only zones in
``highly congested areas, or areas with particular public safety,
aesthetic, historical or economic concerns,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers became concerned that too few, or poorly located,
cubicles would cut into revenue and the free flow of information.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in January by the San Francisco Newspaper
Agency, the business arm of he San Francisco Examiner and the San
Francisco Chronicle; SF Weekly; the San Francisco Bay Guardian; the
New York Times; the Los Angeles Times; and the San Jose Mercury
News.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers agree that the city has a legitimate interest in
promoting urban aesthetics and safe sidewalks, and that the
profusion of news racks can be a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   But their suit contends _ and the city denies _ that the
ordinance is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers hailed the ruling and said they hoped to work with
city officials to revise the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted that a federal judge has recognized the
constitutional problem that we saw with this ordinance,'' said
Steven Falk, president and chief executive officer of the San
Francisco Newspaper Agency.
</P>
<P>
   James Rizzi, publisher of the SF Weekly, said: ``We feel like we
have very deliberately been kept out of the process. Hopefully,
we'll be a little bit more involved.''

`THIN RED LINE': A MEDITATION ON MEN AND WAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A lot of critics praised Terrence Malick's ``The
Thin Red Line'' last year, with the film picking up seven Oscar
nominations. A number of others, though, felt the film was a bore
and that writer/director Malick was just diddling around with
endless nature shots. (Malick never met a leaf he didn't like,
remarked one wag.)
</P>
<P>
   But those nature shots _ though overdone at times _ were
integral to the film's themes, and ``The Thin Red Line, which comes
out on video Tuesday, possesses a flawed but worthy artistic
vision.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins with two soldiers who have gone AWOL and are
living contentedly with a tribe on a Pacific island. The two are
then captured and returned to their Army company for the assault on
what is being called a strategically important hill on Guadalcanal
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world a man himself is nothing and there is no world
but this one,'' Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) tells one of the AWOL
soldiers, Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) before the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're wrong,'' Witt replies. ``I've seen another world.
Sometimes I think it was my imagination,'' he says, referring to
the island idyll where he lived within nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you've seen things I never will,'' says Welsh.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing and not seeing is at the heart of the film. Unlike last
year's other war film, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``Line'' isn't
directly about heroism and sacrifice _ though both occur. In fact,
when a few of the characters are cited for bravery, they want to
shun the honor. But, ironically, when another is cited so that his
commander can get rid of him for caring too much about his men, he
accepts gladly, which is contrary to what you would expect in a
typical war film.
</P>
<P>
   Malick, for the most part, is trying to create a transcendental
experience as he did in his last film, 1978's ``Days of Heaven.''
Despite a stellar cast _ Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson,
John Cusack _ the characters are not fully formed. We get to know
bits about them through their internal monologues, though at times
it is unclear whose thoughts are being voiced. At other times, they
all seem interchangeable with names like Fife, Gaff, Bell, Tall,
Witt.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the thoughts are philosophical, but mostly they are
bits of memories, fears, rationalizations, justifications and the
fragility of life. Not for a moment do you believe that what you're
hearing would be the real voices of the men _ the thoughts are too
sculpted, too poetic to be those of anyone in a combat zone. Malick
has meant them to be _ as in a novel _ a distillation of the
characters' frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Around them as they try to take a grassy hill from a hidden
enemy, nature remains indifferent. It goes on whether man looks up
from his endeavors _ in this case, battle _ long enough to think
about his place in it or not. That's what those nature shots are
about. They are in contrast to characters like Nolte's Col. Tall, a
career soldier who sees the battle as his one chance for glory
after having studied war for so long, including reading Homer in
Greek while at West Point.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte gives one of the film's few full-blooded performances.
``You are not gonna take your men around in the jungle to avoid a
goddamn fight,'' he snarls at a subordinate after his troops have
been bloodied badly.
</P>
<P>
   What Malick captures is the confusion _ the chaos _ of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be the best friend you've ever had,'' Welsh tells Witt
during a respite in the fighting, ``and you don't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this is overly profound. At times, Malick doesn't seem
to have a handle on what he's trying to do. And ``Line'' is a bit
too arty for its own good.
</P>
<P>
   But what Malick has done is give us a film that creates a
cinematic sense of the mind-set of war. It may not be totally
successful, but with so many literal and simple-minded films out
there these days, Malick should be commended. &QL;

IT DOESN'T TAKE AN ARMY TO MAKE, OR EAT, POTATO SALAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Who says making potato salad means peeling
potatoes? And who decreed you have to make enough for an army? And
what law requires potato salad to contain mayonnaise? Thanks to the
grab-and-go nature of products in the supermarkets, making recipes
that were once labor-intensive, like potato salad, are now fast,
easy and flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   In the produce department, start by buying little plastic net
bags of baby potatoes. Available in red, white and Yukon gold
varieties, the bags save the time you'd spend in the store
selecting potatoes. And since there are only 28 ounces of spuds in
a bag, each one makes enough salad for eight people, not 80.
</P>
<P>
   Baby potatoes have thin skins so you don't need to peel them
before, or after, cooking them. And since the bags usually contain
potatoes of similar size, they'll all cook in roughly the same
amount of time (about 30 minutes on a simmer), so you needn't spend
time cutting the big ones.
</P>
<P>
   To buy other salad ingredients, take a stroll down the salad
bar. Celery, carrots, pickles, hard-cooked eggs, olives ... they're
all there, washed and ready to be cut and tossed into the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Want bacon in your salad? Run to the packaged meat section and
pick up a box of heat-and-eat bacon. These precooked products make
adding bacon to potato salad, baked beans or BLTs much easier by
letting you leave the frying pan in the cabinet. Just cut the bacon
into bite-size pieces and add them in. If you want your bacon warm,
you can heat it in the microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Once all your ingredients are chopped, dress your potato salad
with something to hold it together. At one time mayonnaise mixed
with salt, pepper and a splash of cider vinegar was the preferred
dressing. Then came the practice of adding mustard to the
mayonnaise to make a tangy binder. But don't be shy about adding
other ingredients to suit your taste. A teaspoon of sugar can go in
if you prefer a sweeter dressing. Use sour cream for a more tart
dressing, or a spoonful of fresh snipped chives or dill for an
herbal flavor.
</P>
<P>
   For a Mediterranean flavor, dress them with oil, vinegar and a
tablespoon or two of toasted mustard seeds such as in the following
recipe. If you want to convert your side dish potato salad into
cool entree, toss is a can of tuna, too.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LIGHT POTATO SALAD
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 6 to 8 servings)
</P>
<P>
   1 (28-ounce) bag baby red or baby Yukon gold potatoes
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons mustard seeds
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup white-wine vinegar

<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh snipped dill
</P>
<P>
   1 (6.5-ounce) can tuna, drained and flaked (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Place potatoes in a 3 1/2-quart saucepan and add water to cover.
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Let
potatoes cook for about 30 minutes or until a meat fork will poke
through a potato easily. Drain and run under cold water to stop the
cooking process. Cut potatoes into bite-size pieces. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place mustard seeds in a skillet and heat over medium heat,
shaking pan occasionally, until seeds begin to lightly brown and
release their aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Combine vinegar, oil, dill and mustard seeds in a large bowl and
whisk to combine. Add potato chunks, and tuna if using, and toss to
combine.

CALIFORNIA'S PLUNGE INTO PERVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hats off to the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce for stating loudly, clearly and officially that the
Definition of Marriage initiative is a nasty piece of work that is
no good for California.
</P>
<P>
   A March 2000 election might seem a long way off, but in
political time it is dead ahead. Fair-minded folks all over the
state need to get off their complacent duffs and start working to
defeat this gratuitous, wasteful and reactionary ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   As Rhea Serpan, president and chief executive of the chamber,
said: ``The Knight initiative is a mean-spirited attack that is
meant to be divisive, not to help California come together to grow
and prosper and celebrate its diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The creation of state Sen. Pete Knight, a Republican from
Palmdale, the marriage initiative is the sort of law they just love
to pass in progressive states like Oklahoma, Mississippi and
Indiana. It is based on a faulty premise _ heterosexual marriage is
in danger of losing its long-dominant standing in society _ and
blames gays and lesbians for the non-attack.
</P>
<P>
   Like the many ``family values'' members of Congress who felt
compelled to pass the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, Knight and
his supporters want to legislate as though marriage is such a
fragile institution, it cannot survive woman-woman or man-man
versions.
</P>
<P>
   When they are talking about marriage between heterosexuals, of
course, the institution is the ``backbone'' of society and a
powerful stabilizing force for the future.
</P>
<P>
   But, in their view, when a woman pledges to take a woman as her
lifelong partner or a man promises himself to a man until death do
they part, marriage is a threat to the very fabric of America.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's initiative, which twice failed in the state
Legislature, seems to some a simple and harmless declaration of the
status quo. Since 1977, the state's Family Code has defined
marriage as ``a personal relation ... between a man and a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   But anti-gay rights folks like Knight are worried that some
other state _ Hawaii, Vermont or Alaska _ might do the unthinkable
and include homosexual unions under the definition of marriage.
Then gay people could move to California and their marriages would
be recognized as valid _ just as the state recognizes marriages
between cousins from states where that combination is legal.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Knight's March ballot measure asks voters to affirm or
reject this: ``Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or
recognized in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining gay and lesbian activists and a shipload of straight
sympathizers, the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce sees the
marriage initiative as anything but harmless. Serpan terms it
``discrimination,'' which the chamber ``has a proud history of

   Knight's missionaries collected 650,000 signatures to
over-qualify the measure for the ballot, and every poll taken shows
it passing. Lesbian and gay activists figure they'll need at least
$10 million to fight the thing.

<P>
   That is a ridiculous waste of resources.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where underfunded public schools are a sad
contradiction to a booming economy, where a nonviolent prison
population is about to burst the seams of a system operating at 192
percent capacity, where hundreds of thousands of residents have no
health care coverage _ that waste is perverse.

   MARTY STUART/``THE PILGRIM'' (MCA)
</P>
<P>
   Stuart's ambitious new concept album proves he's truly the
keeper of country's traditional flame. Built around a timeless tale
of lost love, alcoholism, death and redemption, ``The Pilgrim''
explores country's beloved themes with help from such luminaries as
George Jones, Johnny Cash, Ralph Stanley, Earl Scruggs, Pam Tillis,
Emmylou Harris and Mike Campbell, among others. Stuart tells the
story perfectly, utilizing creaky Appalachian vocal dust, crackling
bluegrass, twangy honky-tonk, plus tasty rock and string
arrangements. This fully-realized effort deserves a place at the
top of the charts. 3 1/2 stars

RON SEXSMITH/``WHEREABOUTS'' (Interscope)
</P>
<P>
   Canadian singer-songwriter Sexsmith returns with another
gorgeous album of smart pop, again assisted by ace producers and
collaborators Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake. ``Whereabouts''
builds on Sexsmith's previous efforts, adding quirky string
arrangements to some songs and unexpected orchestral touches to
others. The constant remains Sexsmith's melancholy voice and
beautiful way with a melody. ``Still Time,'' the album's hopeful
opener, might be the year's most beautiful tune. Like the rest of
this fine album, it only gets better with each spin. 3 1/2 stars

PRETENDERS/``VIVA EL AMOR!'' (Warner Bros.)
</P>
<P>
   The first new album from the Pretenders since 1994 finds
tough-but-tender frontwoman Chrissie Hynde delivering
semiautobiographical lyrics in a smooth, appealing pop-rock
package. Tracks like disc-opener ``Pop Star'' and the hook-filled
``Human'' (theme to TV's recent ``Cupid'' series) find the band as
spirited as ever, bolstered by ringing guitar, soaring vocals and
fresh-but-familiar tunes. Incidentally, Jeff Beck lends fret-shred
to the track ``Legalise Me.'' 3 stars

PAVEMENT/``TERROR TWILIGHT'' (Matador)
</P>
<P>
   Alt-rock heroes and eternal grad students Pavement strike gold
with their largely wonderful fifth album, the band's first to be
recorded in a 24-track studio and their first produced and mixed by
Nigel Godrich (Radiohead's ``OK Computer'' and Beck's
``Mutations''). Influences range from the Beatles and the Velvet
Underground all the way to King Crimson as these perennial cranks
inject subtle wit and rare effort into the nicely blurred
proceedings, enlivened by standouts like the radio-friendly ``Spit
on a Stranger,'' slipshod riff-rocker ``Cream of Gold'' and the
sweet country ballad ``Major Leagues.'' 3 stars

EVGENY KISSIN/``CHOPIN: FOUR BALLADES; BERCEUSE; BACAROLLE; AND
SCHERZO NO. 4'' (BMG Classics)
</P>
<P>
   Technical virtuosity has always been a given with this
27-year-old Russian pianist. But Kissin's dramatic, emotionally
declarative renditions of these dissimilar Chopin pieces _ the
querying Sturm und Drang of the first Ballade, the Slavic
dazzlement of the fourth, the soothing rhythms of the Berceuse
lullaby, and the playful, hallucinatory Scherzo No. 4 _ should
further dissolve any lingering ideas that Kissin's playing is all
head and no heart. Chopin's torrential harmonies, as well as his
gentler cloudbursts of melody, unite here in passionate precision.

CHEMICAL BROTHERS/``SURRENDER'' (Astralwerks)
</P>
<P>
   Since meeting a decade ago, the Chemicals have been on a
mission: to uncover sounds nobody's heard before and to make each
record fresher than the last. They've also created some of the most
influential block rockin' beats of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Surrender,'' the duo's third album and follow-up to the
breakthrough ``Dig Your Own Hole,'' the Chemicals offer a twist on
familiar funk and house rhythms. Again calling on Noel Gallagher
for the Beatles-inspired ``Let Forever Be'' and Mercury Rev's
Jonathan Donahue, who sings and plays guitar on album-closing
lullaby ``Dream On,'' the Chems add additional vocal spice in the
shape of Mazzy Star chanteuse Hope Sandoval on the languorous
``Asleep From Day,'' while New Order's Bernard Sumner works out on
the ferocious ``Out of Control.'' 3 stars

CHICK COREA &AMP; ORIGIN/``CHANGE'' (Stretch/Concord)
</P>
<P>
   Corea's ever-inventive acoustic sextet Origin is making some of
the most plainly enjoyable music of the impressionistic
keyboardist's long and varied career. Supported by the challenging
post-bop outfit's supremely fine rhythm section of bassist Avishai
Cohen and drummer Jeff Ballard, Corea demonstrates harmonic
ingenuity and rhythmic savvy of the sort rarely heard these days.
The best tracks include blues-based opener ``Wigwam,'' in which
Corea switches from marimba to piano in midstream; the playful,
Latin-tinged ``Armando's Tango'' (a sequel to ``Armando's Rhumba''
from Corea's ``My Spanish Heart'' in 1976); and the delicious
laid-back cool of ``Early Afternoon Blues,'' a nod to Miles Davis'
``Kind of Blue'' sparked by searing work from Origin horn men Steve
Wilson, Bob Sheppard and Steve Davis. Marvelous stuff. 4 stars

PHINEAS/``PHINEAS'' (Mannawise)
</P>
<P>
   This Los Angeles trio has turned out a surprisingly mature and
consistently engaging collection of jazzy, often edgy ballads and
occasional rockers. Singer/guitarist/songwriter Simon Pagotto
cranks out tuneful music over Marc Joseph's inventive drumming and
Pat Reynolds' mostly acoustic bass, all leavened with grace notes
of violin, trombone, harmonica, tabla, saxophone and more. The
plentiful highlights are mostly of a thoughtful, Paul
Westerberg-like sort of pop, with a lovely Spanish-language ballad
and a couple of moderate ravers thrown in. To get the album, e-mail
mannawisehotmail.com. The band is excellent live also, recently
adding a viola player to flesh out their more rocking live sound. 3

   For his best album in a decade, the instantly recognizable
Carlos Santana invites cameos from such varied folks as Lauryn
Hill, Everlast, Matchbox 20's Rob Thomas, soul crooner Cee-Lo, Dave
Matthews, Eric Clapton, rock en Espanol stars Mana, Wyclef Jean and
Eagle-Eye Cherry.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other star-studded projects, each contributor
actually adds musical rather than name-drop power to this
unexpectedly stirring project, additionally fueled by some of
Santana's best guitar work in ages. Favorite track: ``The

VARIOUS/``NO BOUNDARIES: A BENEFIT FOR THE KOSOVAR REFUGEES''
(Epic)
</P>
<P>
   Quickly compiled to help the ongoing nightmare in Kosovo, here's
a solidly entertaining collection of mostly rare, live or
unreleased tracks by a wide variety of artists, from Korn to Tori
Amos. Although other good-hearted efforts have fallen short
musically, ``No Boundaries'' is clearly a keeper, thanks to such
winners as Pearl Jam's collectors-only reading of the mid-'60s hit
``Last Kiss,'' Alanis Morissette's charged concert version of
``Baba'' and Rage Against the Machine's blistering remake of Bruce
Springsteen's ``The Ghost of Tom Joad.''

DON'T CONFUSE CIVIC VALUES WITH RELIGIOUS VALUES

 &HT;    
 By JIM CASTELLI  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Whenever a catastrophe like the Littleton massacre occurs, there
is a predictable call for a return to religion as a solution.
 &HT;    Most Americans associate religion with morality. But the two do
not necessarily go together.
 &HT;    American history is full of people who believe in God but
consistently act immorally; the use of the cross as a symbol by the
Ku Klux Klan is the most vivid example.
 &HT;    American history is also full of people like Thomas Paine, who
practiced no religion but acted morally.
 &HT;    Many calls for a ``return to religion'' are actually thinly
disguised efforts to impose a narrow religious view on the rest of
society. As American history has shown from day one, religion often
brings intolerance and conflict, not peace.
 &HT;    In addition, Americans rightly view religion as something which,
though it has public implications, is an intensely private matter.
The idea of forcing religious belief on someone, whether belief in
God or denial of God, is repugnant to Americans, who also
instinctively understand that no imposed belief can be genuine.
 &HT;    Seeing a simplistic return to religion as a solution to social
ills is actually a diversion from efforts to reduce violence and
rebuild community. If you want to get from Point A to Point C, then
Point B should be a step along the way, not a detour. If Point A is
America in 1999 and Point C is an America with less violence, then
making religion Point B is a dangerous detour.
 &HT;    That's because, while there are rational elements to religion,
religion is ultimately irrational -- it depends on faith, a belief
in something that cannot be proven. It's difficult enough to
convince people of anything with logic; it's far more difficult to
get them to make a leap of faith before they change their behavior.
 &HT;    Most people who believe in God admit they cannot prove God's
existence; they say they do not need rational proof. This is fine
for individuals, but a society does not have the luxury of relying
on irrational beliefs to sustain law, order, and justice.
 &HT;    Society does not exempt people from crucial laws because of
their beliefs. America does not let murderers go free because they
don't believe in God. The average criminal probably believes in
God, just not in society's right to tell him or her what to do.
 &HT;    Social peace does require shared values, but they must be civic,
not religious, in nature. Civic values are the beliefs members of a
society share across religious, racial, ethnic, gender, class, and
other divisions. There is some overlap between religious and civic
values, but there is a crucial distinction -- civic values don't
claim that they will get you into heaven, only that they will make
you a good citizen.
 &HT;    It's easy enough to identify basic American values -- freedom,
equality, justice, compassion, fairness, diversity. We find them in
America's core documents -- the Declaration of Independence, the
Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. These values go beyond the
United States. They are also reflected in principles accepted by
virtually every nation on earth.
 &HT;    You don't have to be a historian or political scientist to
understand civic values, you only have to be able to understand
``Everything I Needed to Know I Learned in Kindergarten'' --
``Don't take things that aren't yours. Put things back where you
found them.... Clean up your own mess.... Play fair. Don't hit
people. Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody.''
 &HT;    Virtually every religion and every ethical belief system hold
that it's intrinsically wrong to lie, cheat, steal, and hurt
people. But it's also wrong because, if everyone did it, society
would not be protecting its members and could not survive. It
doesn't matter if you believe that there's nothing wrong with
stealing; society says that it's not legal.
 &HT;    People learn by example; the best way to teach morality is to
act morally. Young people in particular seem to have an innate
ability to know when their elders aren't being honest with them.
 &HT;    So when America claims to be looking for solutions to violence,
but our lawmakers are reluctant to require background checks for
people who buy guns at gun shows, the message is clear: Other
things -- ideology, NRA campaign contributions, the risk of
offending gun-toting voters -- are really more important than
saving lives.
 &HT;    It teaches Americans far more about moral values than a month's
worth of talk-show and editorial calls for a return to religion.
It's not a pretty lesson.

at his home and hopefully a shot of him in WWII uniform. The Army

star. The islands have long been a haven for movie stars and
musicians who covet their privacy. But I've never seen them. (Maybe
it's because I hang out in Haiti). At least, though, I know they're
out there. Mick Jagger, for example, has been hanging out on the
island of Mustique, where he's had a thing with Venezuelan
beauty/brains/money combo Vanessa Neumann. Michael Jackson likes to

food-safety investigation concluded that beverages from the plant

 RAY PARK: YOU'VE GOT MAUL 
</HEADLINE>

 (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., JULY 5, 1999) 
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Ray Park as
Darth Maul in ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Darth Maul idolized Han Solo.
 &HT;    ``Han Solo always got the girl and he was very cool,'' says Ray
Park, the soft-spoken Scottish actor who portrays Darth Maul in
``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.'' ``I wanted to be Han Solo, but
with Jedi powers and a lightsaber.
 &HT;    ``It's a bit ironic that I'm playing Darth Maul,'' he adds. ``I
never, ever thought I'd be in a `Star Wars' movie. I mean, who
would think that?
 &HT;    ``It's hard to take in sometimes. It's unbelievable.''
 &HT;    Believe it, Ray. And believe this, too: Darth Maul _ no, George,
not Jar Jar Binks _ is the film's breakout character, the Sith Lord
audiences love to hate. After all, he sports that sinister
crimson-and-black makeup, wields that nifty double-bladed
lightsaber, grits those grungy teeth and takes obvious pleasure in
skewering Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson).
 &HT;    ``I knew `The Phantom Menace' would be big, but I didn't think
Darth Maul would be so big,'' Park says by transatlantic telephone
from Twentieth Century Fox's offices in London. ``All I knew was
that he was a cool character and I wanted to play him.
 &HT;    ``It was my first role as an actor,'' he says, ``and what better
movie than a `Star Wars' movie to start off with? I was just happy
to get the gig, and I never realized the kind of reaction the
character would get.''
 &HT;    Only 24 years old, Park holds a second-degree black belt and is
a veteran of numerous martial-arts competitions. Hoping to pursue
his lifelong dream of acting, he accepted a job as a stunt
performer in the 1997 fantasy/action film ``Mortal Kombat:
Annihilation,'' which led directly to ``The Phantom Menace.''
 &HT;    It took a lot of people to make Darth Maul a reality, of course.
After George Lucas wrote the script, Nick Gillard choreographed the
lightsaber duels. Makeup wizards Nick Dudman and Paul Engelen gave
Maul his sinister visage, while Peter Serafinowicz provided Maul's
voice.
 &HT;    What did that leave for Park to do?
 &HT;    ``There's a little bit of me in there, too, because of the
martial arts, the look and the attitude,'' he says. ``I'm like
that, very serious and disciplined, when I'm competing, and I could
take that a little farther with Darth Maul.
 &HT;    ``You don't growl in competition,'' Park says, ``but you have to
have piercing eyes and strong body language to show your
confidence. The makeup, the horns and the double-edged sword just
gave me more confidence, and I hope that comes across in the
performance.
 &HT;    ``The character is not about talking and being aggressive. He's
more about presence.''
 &HT;    Actually, at this point he's more about absence. A vengeful
Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) strikes him down in the film's
rousing final faceoff between good and evil. Unless fan rumors
about a clone are borne out, don't expect to see him in the
upcoming second or third episodes.
 &HT;    ``Darth Maul becomes a bit overconfident, in an arrogant way,''
Park says. ``He becomes cocky, and that's what does him in.
 &HT;    ``I'm not bothered that I can't come back, though,'' he adds.
``I knew going into the movie that he was going to die.''
 &HT;    Upon wrapping ``The Phantom Menace,'' Park accepted a job as a
stunt man on Tim Burton's upcoming film, ``Sleepy Hollow,'' which
co-stars Park's ``Phantom Menace'' master, Ian McDiarmid, as well
as Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. He's also hobnobbing with
``Star Wars'' devotees on the convention circuit and supporting the
British release of ``The Phantom Menace'' with a flurry of
interviews and public appearances.
 &HT;    When the stardust settles, Park's acting career awaits. And
he'll pursue it with Sithlike tenacity, he promises.
 &HT;    ``Performing is what I want to do,'' the actor says. ``I'm
making the rounds and trying to get work as me. I think `The
Phantom Menace' is starting to open doors.
 &HT;    ``People are wanting to meet me and talk to me, at least,'' he
concludes. ``So we'll soon find out just how wide the door has
opened.''
 &HT;    And as anyone who's seen ``The Phantom Menace'' can attest,
anyone who opens a door to find Darth Maul on the other side ...
well, they'd better be ready for some action.

KATHERINE BETTS NAMED EDITOR OF HARPER'S BAZAAR MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Katherine (Kate) Betts, 35, former fashion news
director of Vogue magazine, has been appointed editor-in-chief of
Harper's BAZAAR magazine, Cathleen P. Black, president of Hearst
Magazines, announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Betts, who succeeds the late Elizabeth (Liz) Tilberis, will join
the company immediately. Her first full issue will be the December
issue that will appear on newsstands in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kate's reputation in the fashion magazine industry is
extraordinary _ both here in the U.S. and in Europe,'' said Black.
``She has been an innovator in covering fashion beyond the design
world and on the runway. Her view extends into the home, into arts
and entertainment, and every other aspect of our 21st century
lifestyles.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Betts said she wants to make Harper's BAZZAR
``the style source for readers'' by adding to the mix of fashion,
design and photography that characterize the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to offer readers the best service pages in the
business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Betts has worked at Vogue since 1991, most recently as fashion
news director. She was responsible for developing and producing all
fashion features including runway reports, designer profiles, and
popular culture stories. Betts was editor of such sections as
``Vogue's View'' and ``Vogue's Index,'' a special shopping section
which she created in 1995, and the magazine's supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Vogue, Betts was a reporter for, and later the
bureau chief of, the Paris office of Fairchild Publications from
1988 to 1991. While managing the Paris office of the daily trade
newspaper WWD, W and M magazines, she helped launch W Europe. She
also has worked for Metropolitan Home, the International Herald
Tribune and European Travel &AMP; Life.
</P>
<P>
   She is a graduate of Princeton University.

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of those moments of history that will always remain
in the mind.
</P>
<P>
   British armored vehicles pelted with roses and a crowd of Kosovo
Albanians emerging from the darkness of fear and persecution, their
faces convulsed by that dangerous joy that can so soon turn to
fury.
</P>
<P>
   They cried ``NATO'' and they wrote ``Tony Bler'' on the main
road running through the Pristina suburb of Vranjevac where they
had lain in hiding for two months.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Serb army drove up the street on its way out of
Kosovo _ and when the terrified Serb civilians, foot on the
accelerator, their cars crammed with wives and children and bedding
and kettles and toys, swept through between the Yugoslav army
trucks, the Albanians cursed them and threw stones at them.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when I heard the shots. It was mid-morning on Sunday
June 13; several bursts of automatic fire from up the road where
the Irish Guards should already have been deployed with their
Warrior armored vehicles _ but which they hadn't yet reached amid
the adulation of the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   A French reporter drove down the highway and shouted at me:
``There's a lot of shooting up there _ someone's killed a
soldier.'' Two soldiers, to be exact, and a Serb policeman.
</P>
<P>
   We saw the terribly mutilated body of one of them on television
that night, a bloody corpse beside a Yugoslav army truck _ shot
while ``looting,'' according to the reports on Sky TV.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, by chance, I was back in Vranjevac, outside an old
high school named after the wartime Albanian partisan, Zenel
Hadjini. There was a pathway lined with piles of red roses and
bleak young men in black T-shirts, and inside I found the local
Pristina commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, newly arisen from
the hidden, brutal world of all guerrilla leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commandant'' Sali Mustafa was prematurely bald with a narrow,
intelligent face and a half-growth of beard, his eyes obscured by
tinted glasses, his blue and red track suit and running shoes
ordinary enough to give him an oddly sinister appearance.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him, by chance, if he knew anything about the killing of
the three Serbs the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were looting in the area and started shooting,''
``Commandant'' Mustafa replied. ``So we intervened. Their bodies
were taken away by NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like that. A law and order man, the ``Commandant.'' And a
student at the history faculty at Pristina University, imprisoned
for four years by the Serbs for ``terrorism'' while advocating an
independent Albanian Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But quite by chance _ and coincidence plays an extraordinary
role in this story _ as I was leaving ``Commandant'' Mustafa, I
found outside the school a British army jeep and standing beside it
a young officer in the Irish Guards.
</P>
<P>
   It was he who had been sent to retrieve the bodies of the Serb
policeman and the two soldiers. ``There were some household goods
in their vehicles but we were very suspicious and we thought it
looked as if they had been planted there,'' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the Serbs had been shot and the back of his head had
been blown off, and the second had been shot in the chest. We
couldn't find out how the third one was shot because he had so much
blood over him.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from looting, the Serbs had been coldly murdered. And, of
course, the world didn't care. But I wrote the British soldier's
words in my notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a week later, hundreds of miles away in the city of Novi
Sad, far north of Belgrade, one of those moments of fate occurred
which turn incident into tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   I had gone there to discover how Serbs were reacting to the end
of NATO's war against Yugoslavia. And in a local newspaper, the
following notice caught my eye: ``Ilija Jelicic (Boban), 21...
Funeral today at 1 p.m. in Futok cemetery. Sad-hearted, our beloved
son and brother, the soldier Ilija Jelicic Boban, born 1978,
tragically lost his life defending his homeland... The place of
mourning is in Nikola Tessla Street at No. 17. Mother Boja, father
Nikola and brother Zoren.''
</P>
<P>
   I was too late for the funeral. But dare I show up at the home
of a newly dead Serb soldier, I from a NATO country, he a victim of
NATO, perhaps of a British aircraft?
</P>
<P>
   I drove to Nikola Tessla Street. No. 17 was a modest two-story
home and in the garden beside the house, friends and relatives of
the dead soldier were sitting on wooden benches at trestle tables,
eating soup and pork and drinking brandy to his memory. A cousin
spoke to me outside.
</P>
<P>
   I asked if I could meet Boban's family, and held my breath until
he returned very solemnly and told me I could join the funeral
party.
</P>
<P>
   I was given a glass of brandy and invited to drink it ``for the
soul of Boban'' and I sat at the table, watched with deep suspicion
by the other guests.
</P>
<P>
   One was a soldier who sat down opposite me and asked the name of
my newspaper. ``In-De-Pen-Dent!'' he muttered angrily, using the
plosives as a sort of condemnation. I concentrated on the dish of
pork.
</P>
<P>
   Then the cousin returned. ``You may speak to Zoren,'' he said.
And so I was taken into the kitchen of No. 17 Nikola Tessla Street
to meet a tall, well-built, thoughtful young man with stubble on
his chin, dressed in a black T-shirt and black trousers,
chain-smoking a pack of Marlboros.
</P>
<P>
   I told him I wanted to hear about Boban's life because I thought
that the dead should never be statistics but should be made to live
again in words. For this reason alone, he told me quietly, he would
speak of his brother. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 450 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family originally came from Bosnia-Herzegovina after the
Second World War,'' he said. ``I am seven years older than my
brother. Boban was born on Nov. 11, 1978 in Novi Sad. He spent all
his life here in Futok before he went to serve in the army on June
23.
</P>
<P>
   ``He graduated at the high agricultural school in Futok. He came
from a family of workers. My mother used to work in a shoe factory
until it went bankrupt three years ago, and now she is unemployed.
My father is a plumber. I help to manage the vegetable market in
Novi Sad.''
</P>
<P>
   I noted how Zoren still spoke of his dead brother in the present
tense, how Boban was born on the day the world commemorates the end
of the war that began in his family's land of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Boban had been born while his parents were building their home
with their own hands, a house without electricity. Boja had to
leave at four o'clock every morning to take Boban to school before
starting her shift at the shoe factory.
</P>
<P>
   The family had been given a chance to leave for Australia. ``The
papers were ready at the embassy but at the last moment my parents
just gave up and didn't go,'' Zoren said. ``I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been a hard life. The upper floor of the house had been
built for the families of the sons when they married. ``Boban was a
social type, he started going to discos when he was 15. He liked
girls very much and they loved him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a bit shorter than me but very solid with dark hair, cut
very short and colored blond. He is very interested in electronics,
he adores computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was smaller, we used to joke that he would take
everything to pieces to learn how it worked. He was always coming
home from parties when I got up in the morning. He likes techno
music. I used to say to him, `Boban, you are going to break my head
with this music.'''
</P>
<P>
   His words were still in the present tense. Nikola Jelicic walked
into the kitchen, a beard of white stubble beneath tearful eyes.
The father listened to Zoren for a while then almost staggered out
of the door in grief, holding the door frame for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boban's girlfriend Diana loved him very much and she spoke at
the funeral today,'' Zoren continued. ``She gave the eulogy and
said, `My beloved Boban, you'll stay with me forever.''' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And slowly, the last days of Boban unfolded. The army had
transferred him to Prizren in Kosovo on Sept. 15. On his last leave
home, he had broken a front tooth while eating lunch.
</P>
<P>
   He liked cars and Zoren had been ready to repair an old Yugo for
him to go to parties in when he came home on June 8. But his return
was delayed _ Boban was a driver so the Yugoslav army needed him to
transport its troops in the withdrawal from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He had called all his friends on the phone the week before he
was killed. Zoren had said to him: ``You just take care of yourself
_ God will take care of you and after you come back, everything is
going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, on June 15, the Jelicic family received a call from
Boban's best friend in the army. ``He said his truck had been hit,
that he was wounded but that Boban's condition was not serious,
that he was in hospital in Pristina and going to be transferred to
Belgrade,'' Zoren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then our suffering started. My mother and father went to
search for Boban and then the day before yesterday, they were asked
to go to the Military Academy hospital in Belgrade and given
tranquillizer injections before identifying him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were told he was dead but that it would be better for Mum
and Dad not to see him, to identify him from his possessions. But
my Dad said he didn't want to ask himself all his life whom he had
buried, so he went to see Boban. And he could only identify him
from the front tooth he broke at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful to God that I didn't see his body and that I can
remember him as he was. But our parents, what they saw will remain
in their minds all their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikola had returned to the kitchen, tears running down his
cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   And by now I realized the truth. NATO had not killed Boban _ not
directly, anyway. He had died on June 13 in Pristina _ yes, in
Vranjevac, Zoren said to me when I looked searchingly at him _ at
the hands of ``terrorists,'' beside the truck he was driving.
</P>
<P>
   I had heard the shots that killed Boban Jelicic. Then I had met
the man who ordered the murder of Boban Jelicic, then the young
Briton who had dragged away the corpse of Boban Jelicic _ covered
in blood _ and now I was in Boban Jelicic's home, next to the
father who had identified his broken body. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   I told Zoren all this but left out the bit about ``Commandant''
Mustafa. ``What can I say about this war?'' Zoren asked me. ``As a
Serb, it was important that Kosovo remain a part of Serbia and
Yugoslavia because you can't give up something that belongs to you.
But is there any war that brings nice things?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that maybe this time, it would have been possible to
solve everything without a war, without bombing, without
destruction. And the most tragic thing for us is that Boban was
killed after the peace settlement.'' &QL;

<P>
   It was one of those moments of history that will always remain
in the mind.
</P>
<P>
   British armored vehicles pelted with roses and a crowd of Kosovo
Albanians emerging from the darkness of fear and persecution, their
faces convulsed by that dangerous joy that can so soon turn to
fury.
</P>
<P>
   They cried ``NATO'' and they wrote ``Tony Bler'' on the main
road running through the Pristina suburb of Vranjevac where they
had lain in hiding for two months.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Serb army drove up the street on its way out of
Kosovo _ and when the terrified Serb civilians, foot on the
accelerator, their cars crammed with wives and children and bedding
and kettles and toys, swept through between the Yugoslav army
trucks, the Albanians cursed them and threw stones at them.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when I heard the shots. It was mid-morning on Sunday
June 13; several bursts of automatic fire from up the road where
the Irish Guards should already have been deployed with their
Warrior armored vehicles _ but which they hadn't yet reached amid
the adulation of the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   A French reporter drove down the highway and shouted at me:
``There's a lot of shooting up there _ someone's killed a
soldier.'' Two soldiers, to be exact, and a Serb policeman.
</P>
<P>
   We saw the terribly mutilated body of one of them on television
that night, a bloody corpse beside a Yugoslav army truck _ shot
while ``looting,'' according to the reports on Sky TV.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, by chance, I was back in Vranjevac, outside an old
high school named after the wartime Albanian partisan, Zenel
Hadjini. There was a pathway lined with piles of red roses and
bleak young men in black T-shirts, and inside I found the local
Pristina commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, newly arisen from
the hidden, brutal world of all guerrilla leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commandant'' Sali Mustafa was prematurely bald with a narrow,
intelligent face and a half-growth of beard, his eyes obscured by
tinted glasses, his blue and red track suit and running shoes
ordinary enough to give him an oddly sinister appearance.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him, by chance, if he knew anything about the killing of
the three Serbs the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were looting in the area and started shooting,''
``Commandant'' Mustafa replied. ``So we intervened. Their bodies
were taken away by NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like that. A law and order man, the ``Commandant.'' And a
student at the history faculty at Pristina University, imprisoned
for four years by the Serbs for ``terrorism'' while advocating an
independent Albanian Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But quite by chance _ and coincidence plays an extraordinary
role in this story _ as I was leaving ``Commandant'' Mustafa, I
found outside the school a British army jeep and standing beside it
a young officer in the Irish Guards.
</P>
<P>
   It was he who had been sent to retrieve the bodies of the Serb
policeman and the two soldiers. ``There were some household goods
in their vehicles but we were very suspicious and we thought it
looked as if they had been planted there,'' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the Serbs had been shot and the back of his head had
been blown off, and the second had been shot in the chest. We
couldn't find out how the third one was shot because he had so much
blood over him.''

JOHNSON, GREENE ADD SEX APPEAL TO TRACK AND FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Although the USA Track &AMP; Field Championships
involve 39 men's and women's events contested over four days, the
meet can be condensed to a single 20-second flash of pure sex
appeal: Michael Johnson vs. Maurice Greene in the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to give people here a great show,'' Greene said.
``It's going to be a lot of fun. I'm just here to run a phenomenal
200. It's going to be an exciting race.''
</P>
<P>
   The 200 is the penultimate race on Sunday at Hayward Field and
wraps up a whole hour of live programming by CBS. After that, the
concluding women's 5,000, featuring Regina Jacobs of Oakland,
Calif., will be a tree falling in the proverbial forest: no one
watching or listening.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson vs. Greene is the kind of head-to-head match-up track
and field desperately needs to promote itself in a non-Olympic
year. It came about because each man already has a free pass in
other events to this August's World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   The International Amateur Athletics Federation, governing body
for the sport, decreed that defending champions can compete in the
following World Championships without having to qualify in their
country's trials. Thus, Johnson, the 1997 World Champion at 400
meters, and Greene, the '97 champion at 100, will not run those
events in the USATF meet, which began Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones will not run the 100 here, either, based on her
world championship at the distance in '97. Instead, she will
concentrate on the 200 and long jump Friday through Sunday. Her 200
final directly precedes the Johnson- Greene furlong fandango.
</P>
<P>
   The men's 200 is compelling stuff because Johnson, at 31, is
trying to hold onto his domain as the world's greatest long
sprinter while Greene, 25 next month, is stepping up in distance.
</P>
<P>
   Each man is a world record-holder. Johnson ran his astonishing
19.32 seconds at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Greene a week ago
claimed the 100 record with an overpowering time of 9.79 in Athens,
site of the 2004 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael gets a lot of respect from us,'' said John Smith,
Greene's coach. ``For Maurice it's stepping into a new area where
he's challenged. Michael's a challenge. Ato's (Boldon, of Trinidad)
a challenge. He loves a challenge; loves to compete. Michael didn't
come here to run second, and we appreciate that, but neither do
we.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene's best in the 200 is 19.86, more than half a second
slower than Johnson's world record. However, Greene scored a win
over Johnson in 1998 in the Prefontaine Classic on this same fast
track.
</P>
<P>
   Greene loves running in Eugene and said he's had second thoughts
about not entering the 100 in these national championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a special place for me,'' Greene said. ``You have to have
a game plan and my plan is to come here and run a fast 200.
Michael's the world record-holder in the 200. He's one of the
biggest names in track and field. I just broke the 100 world
record. That should draw some people.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ For nearly three years I've bopped around the Caribbean
as a foreign correspondent. I've chased decent stories, but one
goal has always eluded me -- rubbing elbows with a star.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Aspen. Forget St. Tropez. It's the islands that have long
been the real havens for actors, musicians, and other celebrities
who covet the discreet retreat. But I've never seen any. And this
matters to someone -- yes, I admit it -- who gravitates towards
Parade magazine's column on personalities before reading any other
part of the Sunday paper.
</P>
<P>
   But at least I know the stars are out there -- somewhere --
enjoying all the trappings of wealth on my turf.
</P>
<P>
   Those like actor Tim Robbins and actress wife Susan Sarandon --
who vacation in a secluded bungalow in the Bahamas -- seek to avoid
attention, while those like supermodel Elle Macpherson(CQ) -- who
reportedly sunbathes topless on beaches in St. Bart's within plain
view of tourists -- actually seem to seek it out.
</P>
<P>
   A nomadic breed, stars migrate to certain parts of the world for
one main reason: to get away from the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Like herds of cattle, they've been flocking to the Caribbean
since before the 1940s, when Errol Flynn used to hold torchlit
rafting parties down the Rio Grande in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Today, supermodel Naomi Campbell fancies New Providence Island,
a green splash in the midst of the Bahamas archipelago, while
talk-show maven Oprah Winfrey so likes Jumby Bay, a 300-acre isle
off Antigua, she once rented the whole island for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Eddie Murphy stays at the Half Moon Golf, Tennis and Beach
Club in Jamaica, where Georgian-style villas come complete with a
live-in chambermaid and rent for $10,500 a week in high season.
</P>
<P>
   I think I'll save that one for when I win the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, magician David Copperfield rented Little St. James
Island so that he and supermodel girlfriend Claudia Schiffer could
be alone when he proposed. But despite a $5 million ring, their
engagement appears to be as endless as the Caribbean's translucent
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Bill Clinton and the first lady enjoy these
parts, having been photographed frolicking and slow-dancing (or was
it mock-slow-dancing?) on a beach in St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin
Islands during a brief respite there in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Besides luxuriating with their own kind, stars also go to the
Caribbean to get married, to conduct business, and to be, well,
unabashedly wicked.
</P>
<P>
   Ageless rocker Mick Jagger, 55, recently had a thing on the
secluded island of Mustique with a voluptuous 27-year-old
Venezuelan heiress even as the musician's marriage to leggy Texas
beauty Jerry Hall was on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Crawford honeymooned on Paradise Island in the Bahamas
last year after wedding nightclub entrepreneur Rande Gerber in a
tranquil, barefoot wedding ceremony on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Also last year, singer Michael Jackson persuaded St. Croix
during a three-day visit to let him build a multimillion-dollar
casino and theme park there after the weirdest nose in pop was
supposedly spurned by Brazil and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, St. Croix hasn't heard from him since.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, Eric Clapton turned over dozens of his guitars
to a charity auction to benefit his Crossroads Center in Antigua,
the residential treatment center Clapton, a one-time drug abuser,
opened in 1998 on the West Indies island to help combat alcohol and
drug dependency.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trims.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no where else in the world are celebrities more of a
fixture than they are on Mustique, an emerald speck in the
Grenadines due south of St. Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   This one-time patch of scrubland has been an outpost of wealth
ever since a shrewd developer named Colin Tennant gave England's
Princess Margaret a parcel of land there in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustique Co., controlled by private investors, eventually
bought the island and now owns or oversees almost everything,
including a security force whose job it is to keep the paparazzi --
as well as tourists -- at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-by-1.5-mile island has become so synonymous with privilege
that the company's public relations firm readily provides a long
list of more than 75 famous visitors to Mustique -- everyone from
Brad Pitt to Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbernecking is about all there is to do here, but you can rent
one of 50 or so scrumptious-sounding villas for $4,000 to $17,000 a
week which, leasing agents assure me, includes the use of a car.
(Gee, that makes me feel better about the price).
</P>
<P>
   Jagger owns one, a Japanese-style abode that sleeps 10, and he
rents it out for about $9,000 a week, depending on the month.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion mogul Tommy Hilfiger owns one too, but he doesn't rent
his out. (I wonder if it's decorated in red, white and blue).
</P>
<P>
   He's having to tear down his spacious villa anyway (he
apparently considers it too small) to make room for a palace-like
dwelling with nine bedrooms more to his liking. Poor baby.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Another tiny, lah-di-dah island is St. Bart's in the French West
Indies.
</P>
<P>
   This is the place where Arista Records chief Clive Davis parties
with rapper Sean ``Puff Daddy'' Combs. (Clive has a yacht, Puffy
has a yacht).
</P>
<P>
   This past New Year's, those said to be attending various
shindigs there included rocker Jon Bon Jovi, director Penny
Marshall and home-making maven Martha Stewart. Tommy Mottola,
ex-Mr. Mariah Carey, also visited. Good thing he didn't show up in
April, when Carey was there with Luis Miguel. Unfortunately, Carey
and Miguel did bump into Miguel's ex-flame, Daisy Fuentes.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of action for an island of nine square miles.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for those of you who'd like your own shot at a star
encounter, here are a few spots to check out after you've robbed
that bank.
</P>
<P>
   Harbour Island in the Bahamas is a mixture of pastel-colored
cottages and white picket fences where all sorts of celebs,
including Jimmy Buffett, Sydney Poitier, Keith Richards, and Robert
De Niro, either have homes or are frequent visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to stay there is the Pink Sands, a resort that
offers ``cottages'' bigger than most people's homes sprawling
across 18 acres of lush foliage.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Bart's, the Isle de France hotel is a favorite with the
jet-set, with its marble-floored guest rooms furnished with
mahogany antiques.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms at the Isle de France cost up to $880 a night in peak
winter months. Some rooms at the Pink Sands go for a cool $1,750 a
night.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of money for the chance at a little bit of
hobnobbing. But, hey, breakfast is included.

   MICROSOFT-TRIAL (Washington) _ The final day of testimony. By
Joel Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-REFLECT (Undated) _ To the government, it is a clear
case of unfair competition. As for Microsoft, it asks: Show us how
consumers were harmed. A look back at the trial and the issues. By
Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   INTEREST-RATES (Washington) _ Is it 1994 all over again, the
beginning of a prolonged series of interest rate increases intended
to wring inflationary pressures out of an economy that is
threatening to overheat? Or is it 1997, when the Federal Reserve
bumped interest rates up once just to let everyone know it was on
the case, and then let the economy go on its rip-roaring way? By
Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   COCA-COLA-EUROPE (Bornem, Belgium) _ ``I'll never drink Coke
again,'' one Belgian youth said Thursday after getting sick from
drinking a Coca-Cola 10 days ago. That is exactly the sentiment
that the Coca Cola Company fears most in Belgium and many other
parts of Europe after the biggest recall in its 113-year history.
By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   GANNETT (Undated) _ The Gannett Co., the publisher of USA Today
and dozens of other newspapers, offers $1.5 billion for the British
regional newspaper chain Newsquest, which describes the offer as
``serious and fair,'' but stops short of urging shareholders to
accept it. By Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   MORGAN-EARNINGS (Undated) _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.
becomes the latest Wall Street firm to report
stronger-than-expected earnings thanks to a surge in trading. By

   Also last year, singer Michael Jackson persuaded St. Croix
during a three-day visit to let him build a multimillion-dollar
casino and theme park there after the weirdest nose in pop was
supposedly spurned by Brazil and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, St. Croix hasn't heard from him since.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, Eric Clapton turned over dozens of his guitars
to a charity auction to benefit his Crossroads Center in Antigua,
the residential treatment center Clapton, a one-time drug abuser,
opened in 1998 on the West Indies island to help combat alcohol and
drug dependency.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no where else in the world are celebrities more of a
fixture than they are on Mustique, an emerald speck in the
Grenadines due south of St. Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   This one-time patch of scrubland has been an outpost of wealth
ever since a shrewd developer named Colin Tennant gave England's
Princess Margaret a parcel of land there in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustique Co., controlled by private investors, eventually
bought the island and now owns or oversees almost everything,
including a security force whose job it is to keep the paparazzi --
as well as tourists -- at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-by-1.5-mile island has become so synonymous with privilege
that the company's public relations firm readily provides a long
list of more than 75 famous visitors to Mustique -- everyone from
Brad Pitt to Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbernecking is about all there is to do here, but you can rent
one of 50 or so scrumptious-sounding villas for $4,000 to $17,000 a
week which, leasing agents assure me, includes the use of a car.
(Gee, that makes me feel better about the price).
</P>
<P>
   Jagger owns one, a Japanese-style abode that sleeps 10, and he
rents it out for about $9,000 a week, depending on the month.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion mogul Tommy Hilfiger owns one too, but he doesn't rent
his out. (I wonder if it's decorated in red, white and blue).
</P>
<P>
   He's having to tear down his spacious villa anyway (he
apparently considers it too small) to make room for a palace-like
dwelling with nine bedrooms more to his liking. Poor baby.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Another tiny, lah-di-dah island is St. Bart's in the French West
Indies.
</P>
<P>
   This is the place where Arista Records chief Clive Davis parties
with rapper Sean ``Puff Daddy'' Combs. (Clive has a yacht, Puffy
has a yacht).
</P>
<P>
   This past New Year's, those said to be attending various
shindigs there included rocker Jon Bon Jovi, director Penny
Marshall and home-making maven Martha Stewart. Tommy Mottola,
ex-Mr. Mariah Carey, also visited. Good thing he didn't show up in
April, when Carey was there with Luis Miguel. Unfortunately, Carey
and Miguel did bump into Miguel's ex-flame, Daisy Fuentes.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of action for an island of nine square miles.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for those of you who'd like your own shot at a star
encounter, here are a few spots to check out after you've robbed
that bank.
</P>
<P>
   Harbour Island in the Bahamas is a mixture of pastel-colored
cottages and white picket fences where all sorts of celebs,
including Jimmy Buffett, Sydney Poitier, Keith Richards, and Robert
De Niro, either have homes or are frequent visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to stay there is the Pink Sands, a resort that
offers ``cottages'' bigger than most people's homes sprawling
across 18 acres of lush foliage.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Bart's, the Isle de France hotel is a favorite with the
jet-set, with its marble-floored guest rooms furnished with
mahogany antiques.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms at the Isle de France cost up to $880 a night in peak
winter months. Some rooms at the Pink Sands go for a cool $1,750 a
night.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of money for the chance at a little bit of
hobnobbing. But, hey, breakfast is included.

 &HT;    Monumental healing power of mullein
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE, Ga, _ Mullein has never been shy. Or choosy. It
takes up just about anyplace, growing all along roadsides, in
fields _ and gardens, especially new ones up here in the mountains.
A lover of sun and sand, mullein grows well on the coast, I'm told,
though I've seen no mullein by the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced to the herb as a child when I drank tea made from its
leaves to fight coughs and colds, I remain a mullein man. I
actually planted it here, though it clearly needed no help finding
my space and getting a roothold.
</P>
<P>
   And did it ever.
</P>
<P>
   I know mullein. But the mullein I'm seeing out the cabin door is
like no mullein I've seen. One flower stalk at last measurement had
reached 7 feet, several feet taller than any I'd grown before. I'm
sure mullein grows flower stalks this high elsewhere. But along the
road or in a huge open space, a 7-foot stalk with little yellow
blooms at the top doesn't seem nearly as imposing as it does in a
new garden filled with mostly tiny plants made even tinier by
grazing deer. Talk about vertical accents.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising, all who see this monster mullein can't resist
comparisons to Jack's fabled beanstalk, alien plants from sci-fi
flicks and assorted sordid creations of astonished minds.
</P>
<P>
   It all started innocently enough. In a spring like any spring.
Here and there, a few fuzzy little gray-green leaves pushed through
the rocky earth, cutely. With time and a little moisture, the
leaves grew larger. And larger, eventually becoming longer than a
foot. This stage made me pay attention but mostly to note the fine
ornamental value of leaves such as this. Lambs' ear never was so
impressive; wouldn't children love this? Rubbing the leaves feels
sensational. And that incredible stalk _ whoa!
</P>
<P>
   Those leaves historically have had purpose far beyond the
ornamental. I knew about the tea, but Thomas Broken Bear Squier of
Aberdeen, N.C., who learned plant medicine from his Cherokee
ancestors, calls mullein ``a unique medicinal plant in that the
dried leaves used to treat asthma and bronchitis are smoked either
in a pipe or in cigarette form.''
</P>
<P>
   I could make cigarettes for the state, I said to myself as I
watched countless big leaves flop around the ground, appearing
overnight in places I hadn't dreamed of planting them. Including
over at the Japanesque garden, where two mulleins stand just
outside a foot-high bamboo fence, staring menacingly at the
Japanese maples.
</P>
<P>
   By May, I had pulled mullein plants up by the dozens, realizing
again the fine line between an ornamental and a weed. The few I
left let their leaves lie around for a few weeks. Then, the stalks
began. First, a little nub popped up from the center of the leaf
clump. It sat there for a few days, then took off in a race for the
sky. Each time I walked by during a day, I swear it had inched up.
</P>
<P>
   Mullein at this stage may not equal the growing pace of bamboo
or kudzu, but it's a very speedy creature.
</P>
<P>
   As daughter Leslie put it when she walked warily past the two
tallest: ``I can hear them growing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Leslie, who just tops 5 feet, two giant mullein plants take
on monumental proportions _ and provide opportunity for big fun.
One friend visiting the cabin the other day looked at the mullein
stalks and asked, curling her lips, ``What do you do with that top
part?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You run like hell and hope it doesn't chase you,'' answered
Leslie. Everybody laughed. With only slight nervousness.

 &HT;    Book fresh off the press, athens couple continues mission to
ensure wildflowers grow on
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ On a shelf of biology and gardening texts, the
periwinkle cover of their new wildflower guidebook stands out
against the dull green background like a pink lady-slipper among
rocks _ just the way botanists Wilbur and Marion Duncan planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inviting to have color, isn't it?'' says Wilbur, rising
from his chair. He returns a few seconds later holding two books.
``Which of these are you going to be drawn to? Why, the one with
color on the spine, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duncans hope that plant lovers, hikers and gardeners across
the country will reach for ``Wildflowers of the Eastern United
States,'' an identification book published this month by the
University of Georgia Press. Its 380 pages contain a glossary,
plant descriptions and 1,100 wildflower pictures, almost all of
them taken by Wilbur. Printed overseas and not available until
July, the book also includes information about vegetative, floral
and fruiting structures, blooming season, where flowers are found
and their habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purpose in creating this wildflower book was to get more
people interested in plants,'' says Marion, who collaborates with
Wilbur on the research and writing. During World War II, the couple
lived briefly in Charleston, where Wilbur was eradicating
mosquitoes near military operations for the U.S. Public Health
Service. When they visited the South Carolina coast more than 20
years later, they were stunned at the number of plant species that
had been wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked ourselves, `how can we stop it?''' she says. ``With
more interest in plants of a particular area comes more
conservation. If people are aware of what's there, they are more
likely to value and protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, with their youngest child in college, the Duncans
undertook a book project on seaside plants, a particular interest
of Wilbur's. They obtained maps of coastal counties, aerial
photographs and Intracoastal Waterway maps.
</P>
<P>
   They studied, planned and then hit the road, armed with
notebooks and cameras. When the book was finished, they continued
to find, document and photograph plants. Over the past 24 years,
they've driven 80,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   For their wildflower book, the Duncans began traversing the
interior of the country, following the same procedure used for the
seaside book. They took pictures and notes on everything they
found, and they took a specimen of every species, which they
brought back to the UGA Herbarium for identification. Those they
couldn't identify were sent to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some idea of where plants should be, but sometimes we
had to rely on local people to direct us,'' says Wilbur. ``Once in
Nova Scotia, someone told us to open a gate, drive through a
pasture, through another gate, and then get out and walk down to
the bay. We did, and it was so lovely that whenever we were near
there, we always visited that site.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding something new
</P>
<P>
   The couple's living room _ in the house they've lived in for
more than 40 years _ is a simple, elegant room with a few pieces of
furniture. The walls are paneled in walnut cut from trees on the
Indiana farm where Wilbur grew up. Marion has made a coffee table
from some of the same walnut.
</P>
<P>
   On the end tables are plants, live and dried _ pipsissewa,
foxtail, a leek and garlic bulbs. Two watercolors, of Hairy
Rattlebox and an Oglethorpe oak, both of which Wilbur found and
named, hang on the walls. The artwork is a reminder of some of
Wilbur's accomplishments _ finding new plants isn't an everyday
occurrence for botanists.
</P>
<P>
   His 1939 discovery of an oak tree species in Oglethorpe County
was the first new oak found east of the Mississippi in 90 years, an
event so newsworthy that Time magazine did a feature article about
it. With typical modesty, Wilbur deflects attention from himself
and onto the tree, which others had identified as a shingle oak,
saying ``there was a kind of quiet pleasure in finding a new
species.''
</P>
<P>
   He found the Hairy Rattlebox in Brantley County, south of Jesup,
where he and Marion were visiting her family in 1942. As usual,
Wilbur was driving in the country and stopping periodically to
search for plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see swamps, ravines, bluffs or other habitat, I want to
know what's growing there, so I drive along and stop,'' Wilbur
said. ``When I saw this plant, I knew immediately it was different,
because I'd been working with Baptisia and was armed with
information. It was very hairy _ really hairy. I had to check out
the literature to be sure I was right, and I was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My father got so where he wouldn't ride with Wilbur,'' says
Marion with a laugh. ``He said that Wilbur would drive three miles
and back up two.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, Wilbur was instrumental in having Hairy
Rattlebox placed on the Federal Endangered Species list. The plant
was adapted to open pine lands. A paper company had bought the
Brantley County land and planted pines, changing the habitat and
threatening the plant. Letters to federal officials in Washington
helped assure the plant's protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we were crusaders,'' Marion says. ``It seems
like we were always poking our noses into something.''
</P>
<P>
   Always something to see
</P>
<P>
   The living room window offers the best views of the hilly land.
Almost every morning, Wilbur gazes at the trees and flowers as he
dozes off for a brief nap, but there's plenty to look at inside as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``See these flowers?'' Wilbur points to the foxtail. ``Not a day
goes by that Marion doesn't find something blooming for us to look
at.'' He smiles at her. ``This foxtail, when the light hits it,
it's something. Every time I look at it, I get a funny feeling,
it's so beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur, 88, hasn't lost his passion for plants or for sharing
his knowledge with others. With the completion of the wildflower
book, the Duncans are already working on a book about shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discovery is an exciting thing and preparation of books for
others to use and learn about plants is very satisfying,'' he says.
``It's basic to all science _ to gather knowledge and to try and
understand the relationships of plants to each other and to the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But plants weren't Wilbur's first love, birds were _ until he
was an undergraduate at Indiana University and found that his best
teacher was a botanist.
</P>
<P>
   After earning a Ph.D. at Duke in 1938 with forest ecologist C.F.
Korstian, former director of Yale's prestigious School of Forestry,
Wilbur took the advice of colleagues and headed to Athens,
convinced it was an ideal setting for his taxonomic research. He
joined the biology department and focused on the proper
classification of specimens and the naming of plants.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few years away during World War II, Wilbur spent
his career doing research, running the UGA Herbarium and teaching.
When he retired in 1978, the Herbarium had grown from 16,000 to
135,000 specimens.
</P>
<P>
   The biology department is also where he met Marion, who is eight
years younger. She had come to UGA after completing a premed
program at Georgia State College for Women at Milledgeville,
reasoning that graduate school was more affordable than medical
school. She earned a master's degree in botany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilbur had to break a date to get married,'' Marion says with
a laugh. ``He was dating Miss Pandora, a campus beauty queen. He
asked me to marry him and we got married two weeks later. Neither
of us feels that once you make up your mind, you should put things
off.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiles at her husband and then looks out the living room
window. In view are mountain laurel, Carolina rhododendrons and
stewartia, as well as the rocky banks of one of three creeks on
their property.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 33 acres of woods and water bear witness to the
Duncans' crusade to save plants from destruction. They have
transplanted more than 150 species of wildflowers to their property
and have planted thousands of pines as well, primarily to stop
erosion on the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the plants have come from land later submerged by
reservoirs, including lakes Allatoona, Russell, Sinclair and
Hartwell. Wilbur brought 300 pale yellow trillium from the Savannah
River drainage system before Lake Russell was created. Another,
dwarf sumac, came from land near a Covington water tower.
</P>
<P>
   They can measure their lives by the size of the trees, shrubs
and flowers on their property, remembering how large the Georgia
Oak was when their three children were growing up. They can point
out places where their children and their children's friends, and
now their grandchildren, had picnics, built forts and held
sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we bought this land, we hoped to live here forever,''
says Wilbur. Adds Marion, ``Our daughter Lucia wants to strew our
ashes on the property after we die. I think we'd like to be on the
hill, overlooking the creek.''

<P>
   YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK _ More than a valley, it is a crucible of
natural majesty. Granite, some of it in curious shapes, forms the
towering walls. Water pours in over the edges in spectacular falls,
leveling off to shimmering smoothness only moments later. The floor
is richly carpeted with meadow and forest. The serenity can be so
profound, you're likely to be rocked to sleep by the sounds of
tumbling water, gently awakened by calling birds.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Yosemite Valley, the jewel of a vast national park in the
western Sierra Nevada, is truly an enchanting place. You yearn for
it to be immune from the harshness of reality, to be exempted from
natural and unnatural havoc.
</P>
<P>
   But idylls are hard to come by. Even here. And lately, Yosemite
has been subjected to a withering onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   One week ago, a slide killed one person and injured three others
when rocks broke loose from the west shoulder of the Glacier Point
apron and sent boulders down the hillside near Curry Village, where
300 cabins house about 1,300 guests and employees. In 1996, a slab
of rock broke off Glacier Point and killed one person in the Happy
Valley area of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, three women visitors to the park, soon after
leaving its western border, disappeared. Their murdered bodies were
discovered weeks later. Although the crime _ believed to be a
kidnapping or carjacking _ did not occur in the park, it shattered
its innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, freak winter weather conditions resulted in
devastating flooding of the valley floor, and numerous cabins and
campsites were washed away.
</P>
<P>
   The valley has been under assault by tourists for some time _
every year, upward of 4 million visitors converge on a region that
is only seven miles long, one mile wide.
</P>
<P>
   And Yosemite is currently in the throes of a vigorous tug-of-war
of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service wants to reroute roads and relocate
the lost lodging sites away from flood plains, but environmental
and rock-climbing groups have objected to the chosen sites _ with
lawsuits. Visitors express annoyance that there are fewer places to
stay, with no immediate prospects of improving the condition. Also,
the mediation of Yosemite's traffic snarl _ particularly acute in
the summer months _ remains mired in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   All of this presents Yosemite an extreme challenge in this, its
109th year as a national park.
</P>
<P>
   It is still a beguiling place to visit. Late last month, the
spring runoff was particularly robust, such that the valley's
signature waterfalls _ Bridalveil and Yosemite _ were thundering
wonders. The Merced River exhibited several scars from the '97
floods, including deeply scoured banks that exposed boulders, dirt
and entire root balls of trees, but it was still a thing of beauty
as it glided through meadows or cascaded over rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Also, nature had begun to reclaim some of its own. Lower River
Campground, which had been abandoned after the flood because of its
perilous, lowland location, had nearly returned to its original
state. Its forest floor was covered with a thick blanket of pine
needles and pine cones, with grasses and wildflowers poking through
in places where Bob, Marilyn and the kids used to unfurl their
AstroTurf next to the motor home.
</P>
<P>
   Lodging space and campsites remained at a premium, but
visitation didn't seem to be the least bit discouraged. Even before
Memorial Day weekend, fleets of tour buses prowled the property.
And, as usual, a cacophony of foreign tongues _ German, Japanese,
Spanish, French _ could be heard wherever tourists gathered.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the park might be remarkable in light of the
horror of this past winter.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting Yosemite in February, Carole Sund of Eureka, her
daughter Juliana, 15, and a family friend from Argentina, Silvina
Pelosso, 16, vanished after exiting the park to the west and eating
dinner in the gateway community of El Portal on Highway 140.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of all three later were found in remote locations in
the Sierra Nevada foothills, well to the west and northwest of the
park boundary. No arrests have been made in the case, but an inmate
currently incarcerated for a parole violation has admitted he was
involved in the slayings. Investigators have refused to reveal any
of their findings about the killings.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident dealt a devastating blow to those who regarded
a Yosemite visit as the epitome of a tranquil, safe getaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has broken everybody's heart here,'' said Susan Arthur of
Yosemite Concession Services, which oversees lodging in the park.
``And it's scared people, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear has manifested itself in many ways. Park rangers say
they have received numerous calls and letters from parents and
youth-group leaders, asking if there are certain areas of the park
that should be avoided. (Although the crimes are thought to have
occurred far from the park, the incident has been commonly referred
to as ``the Yosemite killings'' on some TV talk shows and news
programs.)
</P>
<P>
   There also have been requests for more guided hikes,
particularly in the cases of women traveling alone, Arthur said.
Yosemite Concessions' interpretive program is scrambling to meet
the requests.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the crimes on visitation to the park? Practically
nil, officials say. Although park attendance was down slightly in
April, according to the park service, it was 10 percent above
normal for the month of March.
</P>
<P>
   Park ranger Scott Gediman said Yosemite has not increased its
force of rangers in the wake of the incident, although he said they
``remain alert for the unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Gediman added: ``I think our advice (for visitors) is to use as
much common sense as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come to a national park, they may not be as much
on guard as they are in a city. As horrible as it sounds, the same
thing that could happen to you in a city could happen in the
park.''
</P>
<P>
   Or even on its pastoral outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   As Yosemite's busy summer season shifts into first gear, it
appears that most tourists are undeterred by the terrible events of
this past winter. Demand for lodging or camping space is as high as
ever, officials say. Some of that is attributable to the decreased
supply in the wake of the '97 floods.
</P>
<P>
   The snowpack had been no greater than normal that year, but a
freak weather pattern still created havoc. A warm January storm
settled over the high country right around New Year's Day,
producing furious rains rather than snow. The rains, and some
unexpected snow melt, began to pour into Yosemite Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Merced River quickly overran its banks, and as it raged to
the west, it wiped out 200 rooms at the Yosemite Lodge (right at
the base of Yosemite Falls) and 375 campsites.
</P>
<P>
   As heartbreaking as the losses were for visitors who had
returned year after year to a favorite cabin or campsite, rangers
saw the flood in some respects as a godsend. For several years,
they had been compiling a management plan for the valley floor, and
the flood spared them the public-relations fallout of ticketing
cabins and campgrounds for removal. The river left no doubt as to
the dimensions of the flood plain.
</P>
<P>
   But the details of the plan, said to be in the final stages of
revision, are proving to be devilish.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Move Northside Drive closer to the river so as to construct
housing on higher ground? The Sierra Club howled in protest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Build employee housing just east of Sunnyside Walk-In
Campground? The campground's nearly permanent community of
rock-climbers rose in revolt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Construct a 1,800-space parking lot on 50 acres at Taft Toe
on the valley's west end, and operate a bus shuttle system from
there, thus eradicating car traffic in the valley? Good luck
getting the OK to pave paradise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Require tour companies to operate electric buses so as to
remove Yosemite's eau de summer: diesel exhaust? A fine idea,
except electric transport technology has not advanced to the point
where an electric bus can handle the steep mountain climbs from
Mariposa.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Permit visitors to the valley on a reservations-only basis
during the summer peak? So much for the spontaneity of a trip to
the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Rebuild something, anything, so that travelers will regain
the lodging that was reduced by 20 percent during the flood? Sure,
but whose ox do you wish to gore in the process?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the balance that needs to be struck,'' said Gediman,
whose love affair with Yosemite reaches back to his family
vacations to the park when he was growing up in North Hollywood.
``Yosemite is one of the oldest national parks. We're within a
day's drive of 30 million to 40 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's finite. It's only so big. And there is an infinite amount
of people coming. It puts a strain on the resource. The balance we
need to achieve is to protect the resource and provide for visitor
enjoyment. That is our challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the challenge has involved finding housing for park
employees whose dwellings were wiped out by the flood and haven't
been replaced. Given the virtual freeze on new construction, the
only option has been to throw up temporary housing or put them in
the tent city at Curry Village, which was evacuated last Sunday for
a short time after the rock slide.
</P>
<P>
   Near Yosemite Lodge, some house trailers have been brought in
for this purpose. They are jammed together end to end, creating an
eyesore that employees refer to as ``the train wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   But the park was visited by 7.6 million people in the first two
years since the lodging was reduced by one-fifth. There is still an
extreme need for people to serve food in restaurants, wash sheets,
empty trash cans, protect natural resources ... and keep an eye out
for suspicious behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned after the flood, this is a small city here,'' said
Gediman.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts have been made to transfer as much support service as
possible (maintenance garages, some employee housing, etc.) outside
the park, to El Portal, but Yosemite Valley still has a district
court, a jail, a high-voltage facility.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it also has El Capitan and Half Dome and the Mist
Trail to Vernal Fall and the trail to Mirror Lake. It has
breathtaking natural beauty that is largely unspoiled.
</P>
<P>
   It engenders make-believe _ prompting visitors to fantasize that
it might be a place of serenity, safely removed from petty
disputes, modern intrusions and human evil. &QL;

<P>
   YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK _ Women who vacation alone or in groups
of two or so are confronted with a choice: Acknowledge
vulnerability or stay home.
</P>
<P>
   The latter isn't a particularly attractive option, so the best
way to try to prevent a time of fun from suddenly becoming one of
terror is to maintain caution in the midst of enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinct and awareness always play the biggest role, and
paranoia almost none,'' writes Sheila Swan, author of ``Safety and
Security for Women Who Travel'' (Travelers' Tales Guides; $12.95).
``To be careful and open is a delicate balance. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Risks can be reduced with attention, preparation and
awareness. Knowing dangers and devices for protecting yourself
enables you to screen risks when you can, and reduce or survive
them when you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is particularly germane in the wake of the murders of
three women who had visited Yosemite National Park in February.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund, 42, her teen-age daughter and a teen-age female
friend of the family disappeared shortly after exiting the park to
the west on Highway 140. All three bodies were found later in
remote foothill locations, Sund and the family friend in the trunk
of their burned-out rental car, the daughter near a reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Although the crimes are presumed to have occurred outside the
park's borders, they nonetheless shattered Yosemite's longstanding
sense of tranquillity _ and exemption from urban horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face it, they were traveling in (a group of) three _ exactly
what you're supposed to do,'' said Susan Arthur, a spokeswoman for
one of the park's administrative operations.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of women travelers headed to Yosemite this summer,
park ranger Scott Gediman said, ``I think our advice is to use as
much common sense as possible and not change the way we behave.
When we come to a national park, we may not be as much on guard as
we are in a city. ... It's important to be aware of our
surroundings.''
</P>
<P>
   To maximize safety, it might be wise to consider the following
tips:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Try to head off a vulnerable situation. If you intend to
drive your own car on a trip, have it checked out thoroughly before
you depart, averting, if possible, a breakdown in a remote area.
And don't wait for the needle to be in the red to fill up on gas.
You have half a tank, and you're in a brightly lit, busy community
as night begins to fall? Stop and fill up; there's no telling when
the next opportunity will come.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Invest in a cell phone. If you do experience car trouble, or
even if you sense a driver is stalking you, you don't want to have
to search for a pay phone or call box for help. This can also serve
as a safety device on a hike or in remote lodgings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; As sad as it is to admit, maintain a healthy suspicion of
someone in distress _ a motorist broken down by the side of the
road, for example. It might be best to keep your doors locked and
your windows cracked, and offer to make a phone call _ on your
newly acquired cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Swan, in her book, suggests carrying pepper spray and/or a
whistle around your neck. Some foreign countries prohibit
possession of pepper spray, however; if that is a factor in your
thinking, it's best to check in advance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Swan further advises that the proper attitude is important.
``Walk and act with a sense of confidence and purpose,'' she
writes, adding that few things attract undesirables faster than
``an obvious tourist standing around looking at a loss for what to
do next.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Gediman urges women to stay in groups and, if walking at
night, to carry a flashlight. &QL;

   &LR; IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: &UR;  &LR;  From the Los Angeles area, Yosemite National
Park is best reached by following I-5 and I-99 north to Fresno,
then proceeding north on state route 41 to the park. The Automobile
Club of Southern California lists the drive from L.A. to Yosemite
Village (heart of the valley) at 314 miles and advises allowing
more than six hours to complete it (traffic on route 41 can be
numbingly slow, particularly in summer). Another option is to fly
to Fresno. This still leaves you a three-hour drive to Yosemite
Valley in a rental car, however.
</P>
<P>
   COSTS: &UR;  &LR;  Yosemite National Park is open 24 hours a day,
year-round. The entrance fee, good for seven days, is $20 per
vehicle, $10 for visitors who arrive by bus, on foot, by bicycle,
by motorcycle or on horseback. The Yosemite Pass costs $40 per
person and is valid for one year. The Golden Eagle Pass costs $50
and is valid for all national parks for one year.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: &UR;  &LR;  Yosemite Concession Services handles reservations for
all lodging in Yosemite Valley, including the Ahwahnee and Yosemite
Lodge. Reservations phone number: (559) 252-4848. Web:
 &UR;  &LR; www.yosemitepark.com &UR;  &LR; . Reservations cannot be made any further
in advance than one year and one day from first date of stay. Early
this month, there was availability at the Ahwahnee and the Yosemite
Lodge no earlier than November, but there is a three-day
cancellation policy, so if you're flexible in your plans, sometimes
a room can pop free on short notice. The Ahwahnee ($292) is upscale
and worthy of its sterling reputation. Lodging units at Yosemite
Lodge ($101-$126) are nicely appointed, but the walls are thin _
hair dryers and conversations in the adjacent rooms are often
audible. Cabins with bath at Curry Village run $83; tent cabins
$44. Outside the valley, a room with bath at the Wawona is $132.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPING: &UR;  &LR;  Three campgrounds in Yosemite Valley (Upper Pines,
Lower Pines, North Pines) are available on a reservations basis but
currently are booked solid well into September. Cancellations
sometimes result in last-minute availability. Reservations may be
made up to five months in advance, on the 15th of the month, by
calling (800) 436-7275, or online at  &UR;  &LR; reservations.nps.gov &UR;  &LR; .
Sites at most campgrounds cost $15 a night. There are nine National
Park campgrounds outside Yosemite Valley.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: &UR;  &LR;  Dinner beneath the towering ceilings of the Ahwahnee's
dining room is a memorable experience. Also elegant _ men are urged
to wear coat and tie. Dinner will push $40 per person excluding
wine and dessert. At Yosemite Lodge, tasty main courses are served
up for under $20 at the Mountain View Restaurant, and some tables
offer views of Yosemite Falls. Hikers and picnickers can find
excellent, made-fresh deli sandwiches at Degnan's in Yosemite
Village. For breakfast, skip the Yosemite Lodge cafeteria (it's
college-dorm quality) and spring for the $20 or so it will cost you
at the Ahwahnee; you won't be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: &UR;  &LR;  Recorded park information and road conditions are
available at (209) 372-0200. For a live operator, call (900)
454-9673, but be advised it is a toll call. Web:
 &UR;  &LR; www.nps.gov/yose &UR;  &LR; . Publications about the park may be ordered by

CHEN EVOKES   THEME OF ALIENATION IN FINE DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Our rating: 3 stars  
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ ``Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl'' has been trading
heavily on the fact that its director, Joan Chen, has been barred
indefinitely from working in China. Print advertisements for the
film bear the brand: BANNED in China for sexual and political
content. Apparently, in a crowded summer marketplace, you have to
make your movie stand out in whatever way you can.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion is a bit misleading, however, since the
subversiveness at the heart of ``Xiu Xiu'' is quiet and much more
poetic than provocative. That doesn't make the film any less
withering as an indictment of the social engineering conducted in
China from 1966 to 1976. During this time, nearly 8 million young
Chinese were ``sent down'' from cities to the country's remote
regions like Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this had more to do with indoctrination than
genuine education. China's Communist leaders wanted to eliminate
class distinctions and ``re-educate'' its young people in the ways
of manual labor and the lifestyles of its rural villagers. The
movement was not only anti-intellectual at its core, it was also
emotionally devastating for the millions of families it tore apart.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age Xiu Xiu (pronounced ``show show''), the film's
title character, comes from one such family. We meet her through
the recollections of a young male admirer, whom Xiu Xiu leaves
behind in her home city of Chengdu. From there, Xiu Xiu is assigned
to an isolated grassland in Tibet to learn horse ranching. Her
teacher, Lao Jin (Tibetan actor Lopsang), is a former cavalry man
who was castrated and now seems more comfortable with horses than
he does with people.
</P>
<P>
   Xiu Xiu (played with impressive confidence by 17-year-old Lu Lu)
is told her stay will last six months, after which she'll return to
lead an all-girls cavalry unit. Six months pass, then a year, and
there's no sign of the Chinese authorities. In fact, there's no
sign of anyone in this lonely wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a handsome peddler comes upon Lao Jin's
weather-beaten tent and tells Xiu Xiu that the girl's cavalry unit
has been disbanded and that if she wants to return home, she had
best be prepared to trade on her physical beauty. Soon, a host of
soldiers and local bureaucrats are taking advantage of Xiu Xiu's
plight as the film fatefully builds toward its tragic conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Shanghai-born Chen, who also co-adapted the screenplay with
author Yan Geling, filmed ``Xiu Xiu'' on the fly along the
China-Tibet border, bypassing the Chinese film board along the way.
Smart move. The subsequent uproar with the final product has
everything to do with the way the movie shows the pervasiveness of
corruption and favoritism in China's cultural experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Chen displays a nice eye for composition and pacing, although
she relies a bit much on visual symbolism at the expense of
emotional impact. Still, it's an assured filmmaking debut from a
woman who came of age in China during those years of cultural
upheaval and clearly learned a thing or two in the process. &UR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Dstributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   An unpleasant truth often overlooked is that although war is a
great evil, it does have a great virtue: It can resolve political
conflicts and lead to peace.
</P>
<P>
   This can happen when all belligerents become exhausted or when
one wins decisively. Either way the key is that the fighting must
continue until a resolution is reached.
</P>
<P>
   War brings peace only after passing a culminating phase of
violence. Hopes of military success must fade for accommodation to
become more attractive than further combat.
</P>
<P>
   But since the establishment of the United Nations and the
enshrinement of great-power politics in its Security Council, wars
among lesser powers have rarely been allowed to run their natural
course. Instead, they have typically been interrupted early on,
before they could burn themselves out and establish the
preconditions for a lasting settlement.
</P>
<P>
   If the United Nations helped the strong defeat the weak faster
and more decisively, it would actually enhance the peacemaking
potential of war. But the first priority of U.N. peacekeeping
contingents is to avoid casualties among their own personnel. Unit
commanders therefore habitually appease the locally stronger force,
accepting its dictates and tolerating its abuses.
</P>
<P>
   This appeasement is not strategically purposeful, as siding with
the stronger power overall would be; rather, it merely reflects the
determination of each U.N. unit to avoid confrontation. The final
result is to prevent the emergence of a coherent outcome, which
requires an imbalance of strength sufficient to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers chary of violence are also unable to effectively
protect civilians who are caught up in the fighting or deliberately
attacked. At best, U.N. peacekeeping forces have been passive
spectators to outrages and massacres, as in Bosnia and Rwanda. At
worst, they collaborate with it, as Dutch U.N. troops did in the
fall of Srebenica by helping the Bosnian Serbs separate the men of
military age from the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The very presence of U.N. forces, meanwhile, inhibits the normal
remedy of endangered civilians, which is to escape from the combat
zone. Deluded into thinking that they will be protected, civilians
in danger remain in place until it is too late to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions such as the European Union, the Western European
Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
lack even the U.N.'s rudimentary command structure and personnel,
yet they too now seek to intervene in warlike situations, with
predictable consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Bereft of forces even theoretically capable of combat, they
satisfy the interventionist urges of member states (or their own
institutional ambitions) by sending unarmed or lightly armed
``observer'' missions, which have the same problems as U.N.
peacekeeping missions, only more so.
</P>
<P>
   Military organizations such as NATO or the West African
Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG, recently at work in Sierra Leone) at
least are capable of stopping warfare. Their interventions have the
destructive consequence of prolonging the state of war, but they
can at least protect civilians from its consequences. Yet even that
often fails to happen because multinational military commands
engaged in disinterested interventions tend to avoid any risk of
combat, thereby limiting their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Multinational commands find it difficult to control the quality
and conduct of member states' troops, which can reduce the
performance of all forces involved to the lowest common
denominator.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of troop degradation can rarely be detected by
external observers, although its consequences are abundantly
visible in the litter of dead, mutilated, raped and tortured
victims that attends such interventions. The true state of affairs
is illuminated by the rare exception, such as the vigorous Danish
tank battalion in Bosnia that replied to any attack on it by firing
back in full force, quickly stopping the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   What of NATO's intervention against Serbia for the sake of
Kosovo? The alliance relied on airpower alone to minimize the risk
of NATO casualties, bombing targets in Serbia, Montenegro and
Kosovo for weeks without losing a single pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the ground far beneath the high-flying planes,
small groups of Serb soldiers and police in armored vehicles were
terrorizing hundreds of thousands of Albanian Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has a panoply of aircraft designed for finding and
destroying such vehicles. All its major powers have anti-tank
helicopters, some equipped to operate without base support. But no
country offered to send them into Kosovo when the ethnic cleansing
began _ after all, they might have been shot down.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Apache helicopters based in Germany were finally
ordered to Albania, in spite of the vast expenditure devoted to
their instantaneous ``readiness'' over the years, they required
more than three weeks of ``predeployment preparations'' to make the
journey.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks into the war, the Apaches had yet to fly their first
mission, although two had already crashed during training. More
than mere bureaucratic foot-dragging was responsible for this
inordinate delay. The U.S. Army insisted that the Apaches could not
operate on their own, but would need the support of heavy rocket
barrages to suppress Serb anti-aircraft weapons. This created a
much larger logistical load than the Apaches alone, and an
additional, evidently welcome delay.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, NATO had aircraft deployed on Italian bases already
which could have done the job just as well: U.S. A-10 ``Warthogs''
built around their powerful 30mm antitank guns and British Royal
Air Force Harriers ideal for low-altitude bombing at close range.
Neither was employed, again because it could not be done in perfect
safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the calculus of the NATO democracies, the immediate
possibility of saving thousands of Albanians from massacre and
hundreds of thousands from deportation was obviously not worth the
lives of a few pilots. That may reflect unavoidable political
reality, but it demonstrates how even a large-scale disinterested
intervention can fail to achieve its ostensibly humanitarian aim.
</P>
<P>
   The most disinterested of all interventions in war _ and the
most destructive _ are humanitarian relief activities. The largest
and most protracted is the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). It
was built on the model of its predecessor, the U.N. Relief and
Rehabilitation Agency (UNRRA), which operated displaced-persons'
camps in Europe immediately after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Relief and Works Agency was established right after the
1948-49 Arab-Israeli war to feed, shelter, educate and provide
health services for Arab refugees who had fled Israeli zones in the
former territory of Palestine. Its camps in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan,
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip provided, on the whole, a higher
standard of living than most Arab villagers had previously enjoyed,
with a more varied diet, organized schooling, superior medical care
and no backbreaking labor in stony fields.
</P>
<P>
   They had, therefore, the effect of becoming desirable homes
rather than eagerly abandoned transit camps. With the encouragement
of several Arab countries, the agency turned escaping civilians
into lifelong refugees who gave birth to refugee children, who have
in turn had refugee children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   During its half-century of operation, this U.N. agency has thus
perpetuated a Palestinian refugee nation, preserving its
resentments in as fresh a condition as they were in 1948. By its
very existence, the UNRWA dissuades integration into local society
and inhibits emigration.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration of Palestinians in the camps, moreover, has
facilitated the voluntary or forced enlistment of refugee youths by
armed organizations that fight both Israel and each other. The
agency has contributed to a half-century of Arab-Israeli violence
and still retards the advent of peace.
</P>
<P>
   If each European war had been attended by its own postwar UNRWA,
today's Europe would have remained a mosaic of warring tribes,
undigested and unreconciled in their separate feeding camps. It
might have assuaged consciences to help each one at each remove,
but it would have led to permanent instability and violence.
</P>
<P>
   The UNRWA has counterparts elsewhere, such as the Cambodian
camps along the Thai border, which incidentally provided safe
havens for the mass-murdering Khmer Rouge. But because the United
Nations is limited by stingy national contributions, these camps'
sabotage of peace is at least localized.
</P>
<P>
   That is not true of the proliferating, feverishly competitive
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that now aid war refugees.
Like any other institution, these NGOs are interested in
perpetuating themselves, which means that their first priority is
to attract charitable contributions by being seen to be active in
high-visibility situations.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most dramatic natural disasters attract any significant
mass-media attention, and then only briefly; soon after an
earthquake or flood, the cameras depart. War refugees, by contrast,
can win sustained press coverage if kept concentrated in reasonably
accessible camps.
</P>
<P>
   Regular warfare among well-developed countries is rare and
offers few opportunities for such NGOs, so they focus their efforts
on aiding refugees in the poorest parts of the world. This ensures
that the food, shelter and health care offered _ although abysmal
by Western standards _ exceeds what is locally available to
non-refugees. The consequences are entirely predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Among many examples, the huge refugee camps along the Democratic
Republic of Congo's border with Rwanda stand out. They sustain a
Hutu nation that would otherwise have been dispersed, making the
consolidation of Rwanda impossible and providing a base for
radicals to launch more Tutsi-killing raids across the border.
Humanitarian intervention has worsened the chances of a stable,
long-term resolution of the tensions in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   To keep refugee nations intact and preserve their resentments
forever is bad enough, but inserting material aid into ongoing
conflicts is even worse. Many NGOs that operate in an odor of
sanctity routinely supply active combatants. Defenseless, they
cannot exclude armed warriors from their feeding stations, clinics
and shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Since refugees are presumptively on the losing side, the
warriors among them are usually in retreat. By intervening to help,
NGOs systematically impede the progress of their enemies toward a
decisive victory that could end the war. Sometimes NGOs, impartial
to a fault, even help both sides, thus preventing mutual exhaustion
and a resulting settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And in some extreme cases, such as Somalia, NGOs even pay
protection money to local war bands, which use those funds to buy
arms. Those NGOs are therefore helping prolong the warfare whose
consequences they ostensibly seek to mitigate.

<P>
   An unpleasant truth often overlooked is that although war is a
great evil, it does have a great virtue: It can resolve political
conflicts and lead to peace.
</P>
<P>
   This can happen when all belligerents become exhausted or when
one wins decisively. Either way the key is that the fighting must
continue until a resolution is reached.
</P>
<P>
   War brings peace only after passing a culminating phase of
violence. Hopes of military success must fade for accommodation to
become more attractive than further combat.
</P>
<P>
   But since the establishment of the United Nations and the
enshrinement of great-power politics in its Security Council, wars
among lesser powers have rarely been allowed to run their natural
course. Instead, they have typically been interrupted early on,
before they could burn themselves out and establish the
preconditions for a lasting settlement.
</P>
<P>
   If the United Nations helped the strong defeat the weak faster
and more decisively, it would actually enhance the peacemaking
potential of war. But the first priority of U.N. peacekeeping
contingents is to avoid casualties among their own personnel. Unit
commanders therefore habitually appease the locally stronger force,
accepting its dictates and tolerating its abuses.
</P>
<P>
   This appeasement is not strategically purposeful, as siding with
the stronger power overall would be; rather, it merely reflects the
determination of each U.N. unit to avoid confrontation. The final
result is to prevent the emergence of a coherent outcome, which
requires an imbalance of strength sufficient to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers chary of violence are also unable to effectively
protect civilians who are caught up in the fighting or deliberately
attacked. At best, U.N. peacekeeping forces have been passive
spectators to outrages and massacres, as in Bosnia and Rwanda. At
worst, they collaborate with it, as Dutch U.N. troops did in the
fall of Srebenica by helping the Bosnian Serbs separate the men of
military age from the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The very presence of U.N. forces, meanwhile, inhibits the normal
remedy of endangered civilians, which is to escape from the combat
zone. Deluded into thinking that they will be protected, civilians
in danger remain in place until it is too late to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions such as the European Union, the Western European
Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
lack even the U.N.'s rudimentary command structure and personnel,
yet they too now seek to intervene in warlike situations, with
predictable consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Bereft of forces even theoretically capable of combat, they
satisfy the interventionist urges of member states (or their own
institutional ambitions) by sending unarmed or lightly armed
``observer'' missions, which have the same problems as U.N.
peacekeeping missions, only more so.
</P>
<P>
   Military organizations such as NATO or the West African
Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG, recently at work in Sierra Leone) at
least are capable of stopping warfare. Their interventions have the
destructive consequence of prolonging the state of war, but they
can at least protect civilians from its consequences. Yet even that
often fails to happen because multinational military commands
engaged in disinterested interventions tend to avoid any risk of
combat, thereby limiting their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Multinational commands find it difficult to control the quality
and conduct of member states' troops, which can reduce the
performance of all forces involved to the lowest common
denominator.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of troop degradation can rarely be detected by
external observers, although its consequences are abundantly
visible in the litter of dead, mutilated, raped and tortured
victims that attends such interventions. The true state of affairs

tank battalion in Bosnia that replied to any attack on it by firing

`BIG DADDY': WHAT HAPPENS WHAN A LITTLE BOY MEETS A VERY BIG BABY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's awfully early in the career of Adam Sandler to find him
sharing the screen with a heart-tugging, scene-stealing 6-year-old.
Besides, the cute kid in Sandler's movies is usually the star
himself.
</P>
<P>
   But as the film world's latest $20 million, 800-pound gorilla,
he can do whatever he likes, even if it's a flimsy sentimental
comedy with more product plugs and fewer laughs than might have
been hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Dennis Dugan, who also directed the much funnier
``Happy Gilmore,'' has said, ``I'd work with Sandler if he called
up and said, `I've got an idea to dramatize the phone book.''' On
the evidence of ``Big Daddy,'' that's not such a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Having greatly expanded his following with the romantic comedy
and 80s kitsch of ``The Wedding Singer,'' not to mention the
inspired rustic lunacy of ``The Waterboy,'' Sandler falls back on
much less inventive material this time.
</P>
<P>
   He plays a case of arrested development (funny so far) who hopes
to impress his girlfriend with his maturity by adopting a little
boy (getting colder) whom he eventually learns to care for in
earnest (brrrr!).
</P>
<P>
   The film even contains a counter-comical courtroom scene in
which the star declares about parenting: ``I won't fail at that! I
can't! I love this kid too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandler has progressed to the point where he can deliver those
lines with convincing sincerity. He may also be ready to play
Shakespeare, but that doesn't mean he ought to be doing it. This
actor's temperamental, infantile side happens to be his most
appealing, and his taste for anarchic outbursts is his best secret
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' doesn't ignore these gifts entirely, but it
doesn't give them the prominence they deserve. An overabundance of
nice-guy moments, including a love scene verging on baby talk,
gives the film tepid predictability instead of a cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, 32, a law school graduate whose
friends wear suits and act like lawyers. Sonny himself spends time
in a tollbooth, and that's as close to work as he's willing to
come.
</P>
<P>
   This causes his girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) to be
unhappy with him, which she expresses while flouncing around in a
red bra. To impress Vanessa and make audiences marvel at the film's
shameless contrivances, Sonny decides to adopt a boy named Julian
(played by Cole and Dylan Sprouse), who is almost literally dropped
on his doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, this Yoo-Hoo is good,'' Sonny says to Julian. ``Know
what's even better? Smokin' dope.'' And that's pretty much the
film's approach to fatherhood during its first hour. Unfortunately,
it's not often more original than that, and even its high-profile
gag about Julian's urinating outdoors is given four or five weary
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   An even more popular running motif has Sonny making fun of
Corinne (Leslie Mann), a friend's girlfriend, because she was once
a waitress at Hooters and still has the anatomy for that job. The
Hooters restaurant chain is mentioned relentlessly throughout the
film. There's a scene set at an actual Hooters, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even viewers well acclimated to prominent product plugs, like
those all over the new Austin Powers film, may be taken aback by
the flagrant, tireless promotion of junk food here. The barrage of
brand-name chips and soda and spaghetti is enough to make skin
break out in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   And the pluggable brands even make their way into the screenplay
by Sandler, Tim Herlihy and Steve Franks, one that includes a
longish sequence about buying a meal at McDonald's for a homeless
man. As played by Steve Buscemi, he is one of the colorful minor
characters on hand to distract attention from the ostensible plot.
</P>
<P>
   Also here are Rob Schneider as an especially funny Russian
delivery man, Jon Stewart as Sandy's law school friend, Ms. Mann,
nicely acerbic in her comic scenes with Sandler, and the Sprouse
twins (who once shared a role on the television series ``Grace
Under Fire'') showing off doleful eyes and a lisp.
</P>
<P>
   Romance arrives in the form of a wholesome lawyer played by Joey
Lauren Adams, though the sappiness of her role here is made all the
more startling by memories of her sharp talk in ``Chasing Amy.''
Her character and Sandler's share a pre-emptive brief exchange,
actually one of the film's funnier moments, about the awfulness of
critics. Obviously, they can read minds. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

X GAMES STAR DEFIES STEREOTYPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK FAINARU-WADA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The face of the X Games is not some
prepubescent, trash-mouthed hellion with a pierced tongue, hair
down to his waist, shorts down to his shins and a Black Sabbath
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only face of the X Games _ the only truly
recognizable athlete _ is the guy in the Lexus bombing down
Interstate 5, somewhere between San Diego and Los Angeles, chatting
on his cell phone on the way to an audition for a television show.
</P>
<P>
   He's the 30-year-old man (not dude) who employs the William
Morris Agency and a New York publicist, who has done commercials
for milk, Campbell's Soup and Levi's, who would fit right into the
pages of GQ and who is married with two children.
</P>
<P>
   While the tone and image of ESPN's made-for-TV event, which
begins Friday in San Francisco, are all about extremes, Tony Hawk
is most notable for being extremely un-extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous skateboarder in the world _ the guy whom
publicists and journalists love to refer to as ``The Michael Jordan
of skateboarding'' _ hauls in a six-figure annual income and has
fans all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as close to transcending the X world as we have,'' said
an ESPN spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Jordan, Hawk's fame and notoriety have left him hated
by some of the more stereotypical bad boys within the skateboarding
community.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just as it has become popular to loathe NASCAR's Jeff
Gordon because of his California roots and his corporate presence,
it's now ``in'' to hate Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely sort of the surging opinion in the hardcore
skate world, where I'm the guy people love to hate,'' Hawk said as
he cruised down I-5 on his way to an audition for the HBO show
``Arli$$.'' ``Maybe they don't even know why, it's just the cool
thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not me, it'll be someone else that they're gonna
decide embodies what they don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like? Hawk's resume includes: ad work for the GAP
clothing company, Gatorade, AT&AMP;T and Coca-Cola; a thriving business
called Birdhouse Projects Inc., which manufactures and distributes
skateboards, shirts and stickers; on-air host appearances for MTV;
production of a skateboard video; a Web site (http://tonyhawk.com)
that includes, among other things, a link to Disney's promotion for
its latest animated epic, ``Tarzan''; and, coming soon, a video
game called, ``Tony Hawk's Pro Skate.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hawk admitted in a recent issue of ESPN The Magazine, ``Oh
yeah, I'm Mr. Commercial now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years ago, Hawk was the son of the Little League
president in the San Diego area. That, though, was not enough to
keep him from dumping baseball and turning his entire focus to
skateboarding. By 1983, at the age of 14, Hawk had become the
youngest-ever professional skateboarder.
</P>
<P>
   And he was dominant from the start. In fact, from 1981-93, he
finished first in the National Skateboarding Association series, a
run that earned him the title ``Skater of the Decade'' by Thrasher
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Within his sport, Hawk is most beloved for creating the 720 _ a
midair, 360-degree somersault done twice _ as well as for such
tricks as the Stale Fish, the Madonna and the Varial 540. His cache
of moves and his icon status will be on display beginning Saturday
with the start of the skateboarding competition, which will take
place at Piers 30 and 32 and will run through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the faction of children who are hawkish about Hawk, he
surely will have a huge following at these X Games. His recognition
factor isn't to the point where he is accosted merely by walking
the streets, but, within the world of skateboarding, his can be a
hectic like.
</P>
<P>
   During the last two X Games, which were held practically in his
back yard in San Diego, just moving Hawk from place to place was a
chore for event organizers. Last week, as he and Andy MacDonald
went to a skatepark to practice for the doubles competition, local
kids skidded to a halt and started shouting out trick requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always really friendly and not so intrusive that
you can't relax,'' said Hawk, who said that once he told the kids
that he and Andy MacDonald were there to practice, they returned to
their own skateboarding.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Hawk has become the poster boy for his sport,
which has meant speaking out not only in his own defense but making
the effort to distance skateboarding from the very stereotype some
of its hard-core followers most embrace.
</P>
<P>
   He's not defensive about his popularity and exposure, but rather
logical in making the case that those critical of the corporate
nature of both him and the X Games are missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   Where skateboarding clearly was a fad as it drifted through the
1970s and '80s, it seems to have taken a firmer hold in the '90s _
if for no other reason than the legitimacy afforded it by
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize that in all of this promotion that
skateboarding is involved in,'' Hawk said, ``it's really bringing
the popularity to a level that it never reached and providing more
opportunities than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who love to bash don't realize that (the exposure) is
why they have a new skatepark in their hometown.''

`TIMBUKTU': MY LIFE AS A DOG: A DOG FEELS LIFE'S VAGARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In book after book, from his acclaimed ``New York Trilogy''
through ``Moon Palace,'' ``The Music of Chance'' and ``Leviathan,''
Paul Auster has examined the same themes: the role that randomness
and coincidence play in determining people's lives, the elusiveness
of truth and identity and the limits of language and free will.
</P>
<P>
   In his charming if slight new novel, ``Timbuktu,'' he has found
the perfect subject and narrative strategy for re-examining these
issues: he has told the story of a dog and his master from the
dog's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   It is a perspective that by its very nature suggests a world
processed with partial understanding, a seemingly arbitrary world
in which one's fate, and even identity, is determined by large,
mysterious and controlling creatures known as human beings.
</P>
<P>
   The dog in this case is a mongrel named Bones, a pooch adopted
from the North Shore Animal Shelter by a would-be poet and
full-time lush named Willy Gurevitch. Bones will play Sancho Panza
to Willy's Don Quixote, Jim to Willy's Huck.
</P>
<P>
   He will accompany Willy on his shuffling peregrinations around
America, and he will be there, too, for Willy's last journey _ to
Baltimore to search for his high school English teacher, Bea
Swanson, who inspired him to become a writer so many decades ago.
Though Willy hasn't spoken to Bea in years, she remains his last,
best hope: now that he is dying (worn down by age and illness and
life on the streets), he hopes to give her his poems and persuade
her to find a new home for Bones.
</P>
<P>
   Willy, who grew up in Brooklyn, the son of Holocaust survivors,
was a malcontent in college, a rebel with ``a noisy, fractious
disdain for Everything-That-Was.'' He was ``a loudmouthed crank, a
nihilist, a besotted clown'' who believed ``the more wretched your
life was'' the closer you were ``to the gritty nub of existence.''
</P>
<P>
   That all began to change, however, after Willy had a breakdown
and reinvented himself as Willy G. Christmas, a disciple of Santa
Claus devoted to making the world a better place. Willy gives away
his meager inheritance to the needy and importunate. He fantasizes
about building a transparent toaster that would ``be a thing of
beauty.'' And he pens dozens of poems with titles like
``Thirty-Three Rules to Live By.''
</P>
<P>
   This much about his master Bones has pieced together by
listening to Willy's tireless soliloquies and by listening to
Willy's mother and friends. The do's ``grasp of Ingloosh was as
good as any other immigrant who had spent seven years on American
soil,'' and while he wonders sometimes about the truth of some of
his fanciful master's stories, he has ``a sense of the drift'' of
Willy's world, ``a feeling for what its shape both was and
wasn't,'' which is more than can be said for many of Auster's
earlier characters, who tended to ricochet from one episode in
their life to the next without ever piecing together a coherent
picture of the whole.
</P>
<P>
   Bones has been with Willy since his earliest days as a puppy,
and it is hard for him ``to imagine a world that did not have his
master in it''; for him, ``every thought, every memory, every
particle of the earth and air was saturated with Willy's
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Willy is dying, Bones experiences what can only be
called ``pure ontological terror'': ``subtract Willy from the
world,'' he thinks, ``and the odds were that the world itself would
cease to exist.'' He not only feels grief and terror at the
prospect of his master's death, but he also fears for his own
future.
</P>
<P>
   As a dog on his own, he knows, he will be subject to dogcatchers
and police officers; he will have to forage for food and depend on
the kindness of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   He dreams of joining his master in Timbuktu, that great
hereafter in the sky, where ``you were at one with the universe, a
speck of antimatter lodged in the brain of God.'' Bones just hopes
it's not one of those places with fancy carpets and expensive
antiques, one of those places where pets are banned.
</P>
<P>
   In limning the story of Bones, his life both with Willy and
after Willy, Auster does a nimble job of showing what the world
might feel like from a dog's perspective: a world in which devotion
to one's master is paramount, smells matter more than sights and
the perplexities of human life are a constant source of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   When Willy stops to rest in front of a house where Edgar Allan
Poe once lived, Bones confuses ``Poe-land'' with Poland, the home
of Willy's ancestors. He cannot understand why two types of birds,
the Orioles and the Blue Jays, play a game called baseball, and
he's amazed that humans spend their vacations traveling hundreds of
miles to visit a mouse named Mickey.
</P>
<P>
   Auster, unfortunately, does not make as much of these sorts of
misunderstandings and incongruities as he might. Too often, he has
Bones thinking more like a vaguely dimwitted human being than a
bright, curious dog, and too often he settles for tired jokes about
the difficulty of teaching old dogs new tricks and the problem of
dogs' not being able to read signs that say ``No Dogs Allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if ``Timbuktu'' does not entirely deliver its promising
premise, it nonetheless emerges as Auster's most touching, most
emotionally accessible book. In writing this slender fairy tale,
Auster seems to have realized that putting his philosophical theses
across does not require deliberately elliptical narratives or
fancy, post-modern pyrotechnics, that he can tell an old-fashioned
story, replete with sentiment and even flourishes of
sentimentality, without losing his voice.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, it seems, he needed to turn from the highfalutin
world of human affairs to the earthier realm of doggy travails. &QL;

<P>
   The war in Kosovo has reinforced the Balkans' image as a
cauldron of ethnic hatred. And yet we still need help understanding
the extent of the violence and cruelty involved in ethnic
cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Although journalists such as Robert D. Kaplan, who wrote
``Balkan Ghosts,'' tend to regard Balkan violence as inherent in
Balkan cultures, it is postmodern orthodoxy in the academy to
insist that it is ``socially constructed.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither perspective is very enlightening. State-imposed violence
is quite different from the violent actions of individuals, whether
acting on state orders or on their own initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Ottoman Empire, kinship-based blood feuds of the type
common to medieval western Europe survived well into the 20th
century. They did so because the Turks did not efficiently provide
security and justice to their subjects after the 16th-century
Ottoman golden age, while the authorities they sanctioned among the
non-Muslims usually lacked the means to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Largely though not entirely suppressed after 1918, the ethic of
blood revenge, binding individual members of extended families,
sprang back to life when states disintegrated and civil wars
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, this ethic has been successfully grafted onto
ethnic nationalism. The individual murders customary to blood feuds
are committed against the anonymous national enemy. This helps us
understand how such people as Slobodan Milosevic's security police
in Kosovo can murder and deport civilians of all ages. It also
helps explain violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   In the postcommunist Yugoslavian civil wars, rape's age-old
dishonoring effects have been heightened by perpetrators bent on
implanting their own ethnic offspring in the wombs of the national
enemy's women _ an ``essentialization'' of national identity if
there ever was one.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances of civil war and ethnic cleansing, the
most ruthless rise to the fore. Some of the less ruthless manage to
escape the situation by, for example, emigrating to the U.S.
eastern seaboard, where hundreds of thousands of Serb and other
Balkan refugees unwilling to participate in the slaughter have
congregated. Those who cannot escape are forced to toe the line.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar occurs in U.S. prisons, organized as they
usually are along ethnic lines that pit gangs of black, Latino, and
white racists against one another, leaving little or no room for
dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   At the level of state-imposed violence, attacks upon the enemy's
human numbers _ such as the expulsion of the Kosovo Albanians and
the murder of many Kosovar Albanian men capable of bearing arms _
have a long history in the Balkans, stretching all the way back to
Thucydides' Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Evident here is the military and technological weakness of the
Balkan state, which, in Machiavellian manner, counsels destroying
the enemy's manpower in lieu of his industries or arms as the best
way of crippling his capacity to fight back. This can be grimly
effective. At the same time, ethnic cleansing may succeed, as
Milosevic seemed to hope, in establishing an irreversible fait
accompli in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the violence in both the 1992-95 wars in Croatia and
Bosnia and the 1999 war in Kosovo expresses not unmediated ancient
hatreds, but the insecurities accompanying the breakup of the
multinational communist confederation of Yugoslavia and the
unresolved conflicts over the establishment of new political
boundaries. In short, civil war sparked by conflicts over the
frontiers of the successor states has triggered the violence and
inhumanity.
</P>
<P>
   Had those wars been fought more impersonally, in the high-tech
American way, the U.S. reaction to all the carnage would perhaps be
less horrified. The United States' fearsome bombing of German and
Japanese cities in World War II was far more destructive of
civilian life than anything that has occurred in postcommunist
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Analogies are frequently drawn between Serbian ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo and the Nazi genocide against the Jews. In some
particulars _ such as the victims' brutal uprooting from their
homes at gunpoint and their inhuman transportation by railroad _
the analogy, though inexact, is enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   But fundamentally, it is misleading. The Holocaust was a program
of biological extermination based on racist eugenic theories.
Balkan ethnic cleansing does not require mass extermination but
rather mass removal, which can be hastened along by displays of
murderous violence drawn from the repertory of revenge killings and
blood feuds.
</P>
<P>
   This has, unfortunately, frequently occurred in the last century
_ for example, the destruction and expulsion of the Greeks by the
Turks in Asia Minor following the ill-fated Greek invasion of
Turkey in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Even the lamentable Armenian genocide of 1915 was an extreme
form of ethnic cleansing, not an attempt to rid the earth of every
last Armenian. In 1914-15 czarist Russia forced the mass exodus of
its German-speaking subjects who lived along its borders with
Austria-Hungary. The largest such expulsion was that of the Germans
from eastern and Balkan Europe following the Nazi defeat of May
1945. Here some 12 million to 15 million people were uprooted and
driven from their homes amid rape and murder.
</P>
<P>
   These points suggest that Milosevic falls short of Hitler.
Although his and his allies' complicity in war crimes justifies
their moral and legal condemnation, demonizing them serves no good
strategic purpose. The West is dealing with ruthless nationalists
who seek secure and (to them) honorable borders _ a goal understood
and shared by all Balkan peoples.
</P>
<P>
   A defeated Serbia seething with nationalist extremism would cast
shadows on neighboring states struggling toward democracy. The only
way to remove Milosevic from power is to achieve a peace within
which liberal, democratic civil-society movements can sink deeper
roots than they now have.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a long time for such an opposition to become a
majority in Serbia, as it will in Croatia and other postcommunist
Balkan regimes. But it is vital to the region that they do.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washington should take every care neither to impose
the peace of the graveyard on Serbia nor to turn its back on a
million or two Albanian Kosovar deportees. NATO _ which does not
mean the United States alone _ has now intervened deeply enough to
commit itself for the long term to peace in the Balkans. Anything
less fails to justify the West's resort to arms.

<P>
   The war in Kosovo has reinforced the Balkans' image as a
cauldron of ethnic hatred. And yet we still need help understanding
the extent of the violence and cruelty involved in ethnic
cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Although journalists such as Robert D. Kaplan, who wrote
``Balkan Ghosts,'' tend to regard Balkan violence as inherent in
Balkan cultures, it is postmodern orthodoxy in the academy to
insist that it is ``socially constructed.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither perspective is very enlightening. State-imposed violence
is quite different from the violent actions of individuals, whether
acting on state orders or on their own initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Ottoman Empire, kinship-based blood feuds of the type
common to medieval western Europe survived well into the 20th
century. They did so because the Turks did not efficiently provide
security and justice to their subjects after the 16th-century
Ottoman golden age, while the authorities they sanctioned among the
non-Muslims usually lacked the means to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Largely though not entirely suppressed after 1918, the ethic of
blood revenge, binding individual members of extended families,
sprang back to life when states disintegrated and civil wars
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, this ethic has been successfully grafted onto
ethnic nationalism. The individual murders customary to blood feuds
are committed against the anonymous national enemy. This helps us
understand how such people as Slobodan Milosevic's security police
in Kosovo can murder and deport civilians of all ages. It also
helps explain violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   In the postcommunist Yugoslavian civil wars, rape's age-old
dishonoring effects have been heightened by perpetrators bent on
implanting their own ethnic offspring in the wombs of the national
enemy's women _ an ``essentialization'' of national identity if
there ever was one.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances of civil war and ethnic cleansing, the
most ruthless rise to the fore. Some of the less ruthless manage to
escape the situation by, for example, emigrating to the U.S.
eastern seaboard, where hundreds of thousands of Serb and other
Balkan refugees unwilling to participate in the slaughter have
congregated. Those who cannot escape are forced to toe the line.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar occurs in U.S. prisons, organized as they
usually are along ethnic lines that pit gangs of black, Latino, and
white racists against one another, leaving little or no room for
dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   At the level of state-imposed violence, attacks upon the enemy's
human numbers _ such as the expulsion of the Kosovo Albanians and
the murder of many Kosovar Albanian men capable of bearing arms _
have a long history in the Balkans, stretching all the way back to
Thucydides' Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Evident here is the military and technological weakness of the
Balkan state, which, in Machiavellian manner, counsels destroying
the enemy's manpower in lieu of his industries or arms as the best
way of crippling his capacity to fight back. This can be grimly
effective. At the same time, ethnic cleansing may succeed, as
Milosevic seemed to hope, in establishing an irreversible fait
accompli in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the violence in both the 1992-95 wars in Croatia and
Bosnia and the 1999 war in Kosovo expresses not unmediated ancient
hatreds, but the insecurities accompanying the breakup of the
multinational communist confederation of Yugoslavia and the
unresolved conflicts over the establishment of new political
boundaries. In short, civil war sparked by conflicts over the
frontiers of the successor states has triggered the violence and
inhumanity.
</P>
<P>
   Had those wars been fought more impersonally, in the high-tech
American way, the U.S. reaction to all the carnage would perhaps be
less horrified. The United States' fearsome bombing of German and
Japanese cities in World War II was far more destructive of
civilian life than anything that has occurred in postcommunist
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Analogies are frequently drawn between Serbian ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo and the Nazi genocide against the Jews. In some
particulars _ such as the victims' brutal uprooting from their
homes at gunpoint and their inhuman transportation by railroad _
the analogy, though inexact, is enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   But fundamentally, it is misleading. The Holocaust was a program
of biological extermination based on racist eugenic theories.
Balkan ethnic cleansing does not require mass extermination but
rather mass removal, which can be hastened along by displays of
murderous violence drawn from the repertory of revenge killings and
blood feuds.
</P>
<P>
   This has, unfortunately, frequently occurred in the last century
_ for example, the destruction and expulsion of the Greeks by the
Turks in Asia Minor following the ill-fated Greek invasion of
Turkey in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Even the lamentable Armenian genocide of 1915 was an extreme
form of ethnic cleansing, not an attempt to rid the earth of every
last Armenian. In 1914-15 czarist Russia forced the mass exodus of
its German-speaking subjects who lived along its borders with
Austria-Hungary. The largest such expulsion was that of the Germans
from eastern and Balkan Europe following the Nazi defeat of May
1945. Here some 12 million to 15 million people were uprooted and
driven from their homes amid rape and murder.
</P>
<P>
   These points suggest that Milosevic falls short of Hitler.
Although his and his allies' complicity in war crimes justifies
their moral and legal condemnation, demonizing them serves no good
strategic purpose. The West is dealing with ruthless nationalists
who seek secure and (to them) honorable borders _ a goal understood
and shared by all Balkan peoples.
</P>
<P>
   A defeated Serbia seething with nationalist extremism would cast
shadows on neighboring states struggling toward democracy. The only
way to remove Milosevic from power is to achieve a peace within
which liberal, democratic civil-society movements can sink deeper
roots than they now have.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a long time for such an opposition to become a
majority in Serbia, as it will in Croatia and other postcommunist
Balkan regimes. But it is vital to the region that they do.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washington should take every care neither to impose
the peace of the graveyard on Serbia nor to turn its back on a
million or two Albanian Kosovar deportees. NATO _ which does not
mean the United States alone _ has now intervened deeply enough to
commit itself for the long term to peace in the Balkans. Anything
less fails to justify the West's resort to arms.

`WHEN LOVE COMES': CHURNING IN A SELF-PITY BATH SURE CAN WHIP UP
THE SUDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With her sullen, downturned mouth, hollow, haunted eyes and air
of tattered glamour, the New Zealand actress Rena Owen suggests a
Down Under descendant of the '40s Bette Davis via the late-'60s
Jeanne Moreau.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Owen's majestic, wrecked beauty lent an extra poignancy to
her portrayal of a battered wife in Lee Tamahori's harsh domestic
drama ``Once Were Warriors.'' And it adds a tinge of divalike
grandeur to her portrayal of Katie Keen, a fading international pop
star, in Garth Maxwell's ramshackle sudsfest ``When Love Comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in this emotionally overwrought film Ms. Owen delivers a
distraught monologue while standing on the beach, silhouetted by a
raging bonfire, in which she tearfully explains why she returned to
New Zealand after many years in the United States. Hint: It wasn't
just because her career was on the skids. Katie, unfortunately,
isn't the film's only character who likes to wallow in strident
self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   Easily the worst offender in that department is Mark (Dean
O'Gorman), an angry young songwriter prone to getting drunk and
stoned and throwing tantrums in the presence of his older lover
Stephen (Simon Prast), who happens to be Katie's best friend from
way, way back. &UR;  &LR;  Mark's lyrics exalt things like kissing the boot
that kicks you and other masochistic delights. His songs are
performed with snarling abandon in a local rock club by a frisky
lesbian duo, Fig (Nancy Brunning) and Sally (Sophia Hawthorne).
These two young women, who are wildly in love with each other,
serve as the movie's cheeky Greek chorus, introducing the story and
commenting on the action.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the film, who should arrive in New Zealand but Katie's
American manager and married ex-lover, Eddie (Simon Westaway). It
turns out that Eddie still cares about Katie and ... But it would
be unfair to give away the gist of Eddie's preposterous confession,
which sets up the movie's icky, lovey-dovey ending.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, not even Ms. Owen's screen presense and the actors'
intensely earnest performances can pull together the strands of
this meandering, indulgent film. The title, ``When Love Comes''
says it all. Thud.

 &HT;    FEDERAL POLICIES HARM BEACHES, ENVIRONMENTALISTS CLAIM
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's seashores are in trouble as oceans
rise and beaches erode, a trio of environmentalists warned
Thursday. Development is accelerating the damage, they said, and
federal policies are making the situation worse, not better.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the dire messages delivered by Cornelia Dean, author
of the recently released book, ``Against the Tide: The Battle for
America's Beaches''; Jackie Savitz, executive director of the Coast
Alliance, and Donald Boesch, president of the University of
Maryland Center for Environmental Science.
</P>
<P>
   Boesch even suggested that vacationers should regard ``Against
the Tide'' (Columbia University Press, $26.95) as this summer's
version of ``Jaws'' _ a fascinating, scary book to read at the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   Dean, science editor of The New York Times, said beaches are
almost like living creatures in their ability to move and replenish
themselves to ensure their survival.
</P>
<P>
   When politicians talk about preserving beaches, they are really
talking about preserving buildings along the shoreline, she said.
``Left alone, a natural beach will preserve itself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the barrier islands along the nation's coastline, beaches
have existed for centuries by continually shifting sands between
dunes and beach and offshore sand bars and back around again. But
the natural replenishment is disrupted when homes are built on the
dunes and sandbars are dredged to deepen channels. Building
seawalls eventually causes eroding beaches to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beaches are dynamic landscapes,'' said Dean. ``But development
pins them down, freezing them in place. They can't protect
themselves when storms or erosion strike.''
</P>
<P>
   With oceans rising around the world, there is no way to stop
some beach erosion, Boesch said. And it is unlikely that existing
homes and hotels and other buildings with an ocean view will be
razed to save nearby beaches.
</P>
<P>
   But it is reasonable to consider a ban on development along the
beaches, said Savitz. ``Why are we talking about where we can still
build?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists said beaches have been endangered more by
the National Flood Insurance Program than by hurricanes.
Established in 1968, the program enables owners of oceanfront
property to buy federally subsidized insurance at bargain rates,
explained Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Before the system was created by Congress, it was practically
impossible to buy flood insurance for buildings located on the
shore. Consequently, most beach houses were modest structures.
</P>
<P>
   With the federally backed insurance, however, bankers were
willing to give bigger mortgages to property owners along the beach
and development exploded. Now taxpayers subsidize the insurance for
some of the most expensive property on the planet, Dean pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
   Abolishing the program, or scaling it back, would discourage
development and protect the beaches, Savitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean was skeptical of projects to renourish beaches by bringing
in new sand. A recent proposal is to import sand from the Bahamas
to build up Florida beaches, she said. But the replenished sand
eventually is lost because the basic problem of over-development
has not been solved, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, taxpayers are footing the bill, the
environmentalists said. A current project to replenish 33 miles of
New Jersey beaches will cost nearly $3 billion, with 65 percent of
the funding coming from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists spoke a press conference sponsored by the
Environmental Media Services, a non-partisan group devoted to
increasing news coverage of ecological and medical issues.

`ROGUE TRADER': FOR THE LOVE OF MONEY AND THE RISKS OF MAKING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor was sexy as an unusually cheerful Scottish heroin
addict in ``Trainspotting.'' Ewan McGregor was sexy as a Jane
Austen country gentleman singing duets at the pianoforte with
Gwyneth Paltrow in ``Emma.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor is even a little sexy as the young Obi Wan Kenobi,
grossly overshadowed by Liam Neeson's character, in ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.'' But Ewan McGregor is not even
remotely sexy as a panicked futures trader in ``Rogue Trader,'' a
new Cinemax movie about a very young man who singlehandedly,
accidentally brings down the oldest merchant bank in the world.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just the dreadful black-and-yellow-striped jackets
that McGregor's character and his financial team wear to work.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, international futures trading isn't a naturally sexy
subject, except for viewers who spend their days with margin
payments and straddles and derivatives, whatever they are.
</P>
<P>
   James Dearden, the writer and director (who is best known for
having written ``Fatal Attraction''), has taken a straightforward
approach to the story and the results are inoffensive and mildly
interesting, but there's no life to this, even though the story is
based on remarkable, recent real-life events.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor plays Nicholas Leeson, a British plasterer's son who
goes to work for Barings, the esteemed British bank, and makes
good. Still in his 20s and a newlywed, he is put in charge of
trading in Singapore, where things quickly go bad. One of his
young, inexperienced trading-team members makes a mistake and loses
$20,000; rather than dismissing her, he takes some chances and
tries to make it good.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he keeps losing more and more. Things get dicey.
``There's not enough in the client account to cover margin
payments,'' an employee tells him at one point. But his luck
changes, the Nikkei hits 19,000, and he makes back all his losses,
which had added up to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad, because it just encourages him to take chances
again, and this time he gets in even deeper. Meanwhile he is
getting six-figure annual bonuses, being hailed by the London
office as ``a turbo arbitrager.''
</P>
<P>
   He is asked to give speeches to share his secrets of success (if
only they knew) but is in such turmoil over a situation he knows is
out of control that he throws up backstage. When an audit finds a
discrepancy of 7.78 billion yen (about $64 million), he begins
forging memos and other paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he's caught and Barings goes under. In fact, Britain
very nearly goes under. Leeson is arrested at the Frankfurt airport
and extradited.
</P>
<P>
   The real Leeson is expected to be released from prison in
Singapore next weekend and to return to England after having served
roughly three years of a six-and-a-half-year sentence. He is now
32, divorced and suffering from colon cancer. &QL;

UNGODLY GOINGS-ON IN A FORSAKEN TOWN'S CHURCH
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
(nk) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its rapid pretitle images of a young couple in bed in the
morning light, of soberly dressed men and women filing into a
church, of a woman fleeing from a house into woods, of a young man
donning the garb of a clergyman and delivering a sermon from the
Book of Job before bluntly dismissing his disgruntled congregation,
``The Broken Giant'' cloaks itself in an immediate air of
theological profundity and secular mystery.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time this film, written and directed by Estep Nagy,
has run its attenuated course, it proves to be a monotonous drama
that generates tensions and avoids resolution by withholding
essential information about its pivotal characters for as long as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Broken Giant,'' opening Friday at Anthology Film
Archives, moody visual talent outbalances literary skill; character
is not so much revealed as arbitrarily obscured.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a little town that seems depopulated rather than
underpopulated, this low-budget film tells the story of a troubled
young minister, Ezra Caton (Will Arnett). He is descended from a
line of preachers, including his namesake grandfather who perished
in a way known to all the townspeople but withheld from the
audience until late in the film.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, Ezra types notes to his grandfather and sets
them afire. Ezra is having an affair with Rosemary (Brooke Smith),
the daughter of the town's mayor, Thomas Smith (George Dickerson).
Rosemary, who tends the counter at the local coffee shop, worries
that the distant Ezra might be moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Life grows more complicated when Clio Hale (Missy Yager), the
runaway seen in the film's opening moments, arrives at Ezra's Free
Will Church seeking sanctuary from her father, the sinister Bennett
Hale (John Glover).
</P>
<P>
   Although details of the relationship between Bennett and Clio
are never specified, it has clearly been unhealthy. But with an
assist from Tom Smith, who is not happy for various reasons about
the young woman sharing the church premises with his daughter's
beau and the town's not-so-popular minister, Bennett tracks down
Clio and appeals for her return.
</P>
<P>
   So, with Bennett threatened by the intervention of Ezra, with
Rosemary threatened by the appearance of the attractive Clio, with
Ezra and Clio threatened by the devious Bennett, the disapproving
Tom and their individual psychological demons, ``The Broken Giant''
at last provides the victimized Clio and the passive Ezra with an
opportunity to share confidences and take action.

MIKE NESS HANGS TOUGH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mike Ness has tattoos covering much of his body. Two
of the least ornate, yet most provocative, are on his hands. Across
the knuckles of his left hand you'll find the letters ``L-O-V-E.''
On the other hand you'll find ``P-A-I-N.''
</P>
<P>
   Ness has known his share of both emotions in a music career that
began 20 years ago, when the 17-year-old high school dropout formed
a punk-rock band called Social Distortion in Orange County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   While all but a few bands from punk's formative years have long
since gone the way of all flesh, Social D has hung tough. The
band's masterpiece, ``Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell,'' was
released in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But following the release of a live album in 1998, Ness found
himself feeling restless. He wanted to write and sing some songs
that just didn't fit in Social D's louder, faster punk aesthetic.
Like, say, a love song.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Cheating at Solitaire,'' Ness' first solo album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved American roots music _ folk music, blues,
country, rockabilly,'' Ness said. ``With Social Distortion, I tried
to bring American roots to punk. With the solo thing, I'm trying to
bring punk to roots, to put back some of that darkness and angst
that's been lost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheating at Solitaire'' admirably fulfills this ambition, as
Ness combines covers of Bob Dylan's ``Don't Think Twice,'' Hank
Williams' ``You Win Again,'' Lefty Frizzell's ``Long Black Veil''
and Al Ferrier's ``Send Her Back'' with his own gritty originals.
He's joined on the album by a few high-profile friends, including
Bruce Springsteen, Brian Setzer and Billy Zoom.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen, whom Ness approached after he read in Rolling Stone
magazine that Bruce was a Social Distortion fan, plays a mean
guitar and shares the snarling lead vocals on ``Misery Loves
Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Setzer adds his distinctive lead guitar to the bluesy ``Crime
Don't Pay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes a Gretsch guitar squeal like a pig,'' Ness said with
admiration. ``We have the same tattoo artist, so I guess it was
inevitable that we would share the same dark, sleazy, rockabilly
vibe.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoom, an original member of the seminal Los Angeles punk band X,
plays guitar on ``Dope Fiend Blues,'' which recalls Ness' lost
years as a heroin addict in the mid-'80s. He's been clean for more
than a decade, but he still feels drawn to the darkness on the edge
of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that ever really leaves you,'' Ness said. ``I've
also come to realize that I'm chronically irritable and discontent.
I have to be. That helps me write.''
</P>
<P>
   Ness, 37, grew up in Fullerton, Calif. As a kid, he was consumed
by a rage and frustration that found an outlet in the hard-core
punk-rock that was spreading to the Southern California suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Social Distortion's first album, ``Mommy's Little Monster,'' was
released in 1983, shortly before Ness began his descent into
junkiedom. One story from those days has him pawning the band's
equipment shortly before a gig to buy drugs, then borrowing another
band's equipment and pawning that gear, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ness announced his return to the living with Social Distortion's
1988 album ``Prison Bound.'' ``Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell''
included a flat-out rock cover of the Louvin Brothers country
classic ``Making Believe.'' The band's last studio album was called
``White Light, White Heat, White Trash.''
</P>
<P>
   Ness figures he'll eventually get back together with Social
Distortion. He plans to maintain separate band and solo careers,
like Neil Young with Crazy Horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I've learned about punk/alternative shows in the
last 15 years. A lot of people come who really have no idea why
they are there, or they're there for the wrong reasons. They come
to get drunk, and to fight, or to get in the front and crowd-surf.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff gets old after 20 years. I'm not sure how long I
can keep doing it. But I am sure I can keep doing this (his solo
career) from here on in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The older he gets, Ness said, the more he realizes that the
battle between the love and the pain is really taking place inside
him. He has a 7-year-old son, Julian, whom he describes as ``the
light of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am constantly having to rebond with him, because I'm gone
all the time,'' Ness said.
</P>
<P>
   But lest anyone accuse him of going wimpy or soft, Ness says
fans can expect a high-energy rock band.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still the same Mike Ness you know from Social Distortion.
It's a more intimate setting, but it's definitely not a quiet
show.''

CHRIS ROCK: TOO BIG AND TOO FUNNY TO IGNORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ His raw, relevant and Emmy-winning HBO stand-up show,
``Bring the Pain,'' established Chris Rock as a talent bigger and
better than any of his peers, a voice too strong, too funny for his
fame to be limited to his race, his generation.
</P>
<P>
   Now here comes ``Chris Rock: Bigger &AMP; Blacker,'' a new stand-up
show that will play on HBO next month. Rock says he selected the
title as ``a knockoff on LL Cool J's second album, ``Bigger &AMP;
Deffer.'' It's a title that puts pressure on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   As if he needed an excuse. Just 33, he's been crowned ``the
funniest man in America'' by Vanity Fair and ``probably the
funniest and smartest comedian working today'' by The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   That billing comes hard-earned _ smart, hilarious performances
on TV, in movies, on CD, in commercials, in print. The trick is
holding on to it: staying visible without overexposing himself;
maintaining his Everyman appeal while producing extraordinary work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The maintenance is the hard thing,'' Rock says. ``You know,
people win the lottery, they're doing fine. It's just the
maintenance. They buy the big house, but it's keeping it up (that's
difficult).''
</P>
<P>
   He feels that pressure to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I like where I'm at, and I'd like to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   And maintaining does not mean standing still.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm the same guy (I always was),'' Rock says. ``I live
at the same place I lived before the HBO special (a three-story
carriage house in Brooklyn that he shares with his wife, Malaak
Compton-Rock). I don't know _ I may be a little more demanding, a
little more confident. That's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits his work habits have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work harder,'' he says. ``I've got more to lose. A lot more
to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why he's playing Sunday in Houston and 27 other cities
in anticipation of his first stand-up appearance on TV since 1996's
``Bring the Pain.'' The majority of what audiences see will show up
on the special, which Rock taped in mid-June at the Apollo Theater
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   What can we expect?
</P>
<P>
   ``You start with the Columbine thing, get into a little gun
control, the media, Clinton. You get into a lot of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   How does television come out in this?
</P>
<P>
   ``TV's fine,'' says the TV star, who also is an executive
producer of the ABC-TV sitcom ``The Hughleys.'' ``You can't blame
the media for this ... .No one takes into account, if you went to
medical school right now, what do you listen to? Marilyn Manson,
Snoop Doggy Dogg. What do lawyers listen to? What do engineers
listen to? They're listening to that same (stuff).
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't think a 35-year-old physician saw `Scarface'? So
does he not count? Is his degree not good? (It's said that) no one
listens to gangsta rap and actually does something with his life.
`Au contraire.'''
</P>
<P>
   There's your evidence that Rock approaches issues from a
different place than most. Combine that with impeccable delivery in
a modulating, often high-pitched voice that can only be described
as ``funny,'' and you have what The Washington Post calls ``a
brilliant comic, a charming presence.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that praise comes a bigger, brighter spotlight.
Appearance, scrutinized. Every word, scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   His few detractors point to his penchant for obscenities and his
use of the ``n'' word. His monologues have been scribbled down and
reprinted, cussed and discussed with the frequency and attention
afforded a network anchor, a politician or the president.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, amid all that noise, he maintains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, until I do something that (reeks),'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So he kept a low profile for most of the year _ ``since
November, the only time people have seen me on TV is at a Knicks
game'' _ and now is touring furiously. The ``Bigger &AMP; Blacker''
stand-up tour ends July 8. The TV special, July 10 on HBO, will
beget a CD, July 13 from DreamWorks Records. Then he'll turn around
and begin a new season of ``The Chris Rock Show.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is the secret to his success:
</P>
<P>
   ``The act always needs to be better,'' he says. ``Everything
needs to be better. Until I wake up and I'm Richard Pryor, I'm
always going to have to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means the funniest man in America believes someone else is
the funniest man in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a tenth as funny as Richard Pryor. I'm not (one of the
giants). I can barely ...''
</P>
<P>
   His voice trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they'll let me sit at a little table next to the big
table.''
</P>

MANY YOUTHS' ATTITUDES ABOUT VIOLENCE SHOCK SOME EXPERTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, June 27) 
 
By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Houston last year, juveniles committed 6.7 percent of all
reported homicides.
</P>
<P>
   And while that number is small _ 17 were recorded _ it doesn't
reflect the number of more common crimes in which potentially
deadly force was used. Statewide in January, 126 juveniles were
held in Texas Youth Commission facilities for killings. The figure
did not include those minors certified to stand trial as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Godwin, a 25-year prosecutor who now heads the Harris
County District Attorney's juvenile division, is among those
flabbergasted by the pervasiveness of youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1974, we almost never saw a case involving a gun,'' she
said. ``Now it's completely off the map. ... Often kids don't have
a real idea of morally what's right or wrong, but they are
streetwise about what's legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, authorities noted, homicide is the second leading
cause of death for minors. That many of those crimes were committed
by the victims' age peers is a given.
</P>
<P>
   Violence, said Texas Youth Commission official Linda Reyes,
often begets violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that most (violent youths) have been in seriously
abusive families,'' said Reyes, who is the agency's assistant
deputy executive director for rehabilitative services. ``They
witness violence between parents, violence between siblings,
violence on the street. By the time they're 4, 5 or 6 years old,
they've actually witnessed several killings on the streets of their
own neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Those messages are reinforced by the media, ever eager to find
more novel, violent ways to entertain. While video games and rap
lyrics might not, in themselves, lead teens to kill, Reyes said,
they help desensitize youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time they're 14 or 15, they've been immersed in a
violent socialization and the idea of killing someone _ or seeing
that as an option _ comes easily to them. ... They see that power
is in the hands of the victimizer and say, `I'm not going to be the
victim anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   Family abuse doesn't even have to be violent to wreak
devastation on young psyches, added Peter Sheras, University of
Virginia professor and associate director of the Virginia Youth
Violence Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it doesn't even have to be abuse,'' he said.
``Sometimes it's neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask the parents, `Where's little Joey?''' said veteran
Houston homicide Sgt. Waymon Allen, ``and they'll tell you he's
visiting Pete. But if you ask them who Pete's parents are, or what
his phone number and address are, they can't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Too often, gangs provide the missing family support.
</P>
<P>
   Sheras noted that youth gangs bind their members with ``fierce
loyalty, a strong emotional connection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They see other people as the enemy,'' he said. ``Or as an
annoyance.''
</P>
<P>
   And often a reckless fatalism is encouraged. ``They don't
imagine living long and fruitful lives,'' Sheras said. ``What they
see is the short term. They'd rather die in a blaze of glory rather
than struggle to make a life for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said children from the most violent backgrounds
sometimes exhibit symptoms of the ``post-traumatic stress
syndrome'' found among battlefield veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They develop an armor against feelings,'' said Sheras.
</P>
<P>
   Such antisocial teens _ a group that includes 60 percent of
violent youth _ seem to have no feelings of guilt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They act in manipulative ways to gain money, position or
dominance,'' he said. ``They act in ways that seem cold-blooded.''

MIKE NESS HANGS TOUGH 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mike Ness has tattoos covering much of his body. Two
of the least ornate, yet most provocative, are on his hands. Across
the knuckles of his left hand you'll find the letters ``L-O-V-E.''
On the other hand you'll find ``P-A-I-N.''
</P>
<P>
   Ness has known his share of both emotions in a music career that
began 20 years ago, when the 17-year-old high school dropout formed
a punk-rock band called Social Distortion in Orange County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   While all but a few bands from punk's formative years have long
since gone the way of all flesh, Social D has hung tough. The
band's masterpiece, ``Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell,'' was
released in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But following the release of a live album in 1998, Ness found
himself feeling restless. He wanted to write and sing some songs
that just didn't fit in Social D's louder, faster punk aesthetic.
Like, say, a love song.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Cheating at Solitaire,'' Ness' first solo album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved American roots music _ folk music, blues,
country, rockabilly,'' Ness said. ``With Social Distortion, I tried
to bring American roots to punk. With the solo thing, I'm trying to
bring punk to roots, to put back some of that darkness and angst
that's been lost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheating at Solitaire'' admirably fulfills this ambition, as
Ness combines covers of Bob Dylan's ``Don't Think Twice,'' Hank
Williams' ``You Win Again,'' Lefty Frizzell's ``Long Black Veil''
and Al Ferrier's ``Send Her Back'' with his own gritty originals.
He's joined on the album by a few high-profile friends, including
Bruce Springsteen, Brian Setzer and Billy Zoom.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen, whom Ness approached after he read in Rolling Stone
magazine that Bruce was a Social Distortion fan, plays a mean
guitar and shares the snarling lead vocals on ``Misery Loves
Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Setzer adds his distinctive lead guitar to the bluesy ``Crime
Don't Pay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes a Gretsch guitar squeal like a pig,'' Ness said with
admiration. ``We have the same tattoo artist, so I guess it was
inevitable that we would share the same dark, sleazy, rockabilly
vibe.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoom, an original member of the seminal Los Angeles punk band X,
plays guitar on ``Dope Fiend Blues,'' which recalls Ness' lost
years as a heroin addict in the mid-'80s. He's been clean for more
than a decade, but he still feels drawn to the darkness on the edge
of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that ever really leaves you,'' Ness said. ``I've
also come to realize that I'm chronically irritable and discontent.
I have to be. That helps me write.''
</P>
<P>
   Ness, 37, grew up in Fullerton, Calif. As a kid, he was consumed
by a rage and frustration that found an outlet in the hard-core
punk-rock that was spreading to the Southern California suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Social Distortion's first album, ``Mommy's Little Monster,'' was
released in 1983, shortly before Ness began his descent into
junkiedom. One story from those days has him pawning the band's
equipment shortly before a gig to buy drugs, then borrowing another
band's equipment and pawning that gear, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ness announced his return to the living with Social Distortion's
1988 album ``Prison Bound.'' ``Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell''
included a flat-out rock cover of the Louvin Brothers country
classic ``Making Believe.'' The band's last studio album was called
``White Light, White Heat, White Trash.''
</P>
<P>
   Ness figures he'll eventually get back together with Social
Distortion. He plans to maintain separate band and solo careers,
like Neil Young with Crazy Horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I've learned about punk/alternative shows in the
last 15 years. A lot of people come who really have no idea why
they are there, or they're there for the wrong reasons. They come
to get drunk, and to fight, or to get in the front and crowd-surf.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff gets old after 20 years. I'm not sure how long I
can keep doing it. But I am sure I can keep doing this (his solo
career) from here on in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The older he gets, Ness said, the more he realizes that the
battle between the love and the pain is really taking place inside
him. He has a 7-year-old son, Julian, whom he describes as ``the
light of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am constantly having to rebond with him, because I'm gone
all the time,'' Ness said.
</P>
<P>
   But lest anyone accuse him of going wimpy or soft, Ness says
fans can expect a high-energy rock band.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still the same Mike Ness you know from Social Distortion.
It's a more intimate setting, but it's definitely not a quiet
show.''
</P>

HOUSTON :come to the games. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some aspects, the Littleton killings paralleled his own case,
Carson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kids,'' he said, ``were so neglected.''
</P>
<P>
   By his early teens, Carson was in free-fall.
</P>
<P>
   Urged on by bad companions, unsavory neighborhood youths Carson
described as ``knuckleheads,'' he drank two to three quarts of beer
each day, acquired guns and assumed the role of neighborhood tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started drinking at family barbecues,'' Carson said.
``Parents just assume that if they let you drink in the home under
their supervision, you're not going to do it in the streets.
They're wrong. My mother, a cook at the hospital, would be at work
when I'd come home at night. In the morning, there would be the old
remedy _ I'd start drinking again. When I'd get home from school,
she wouldn't know. She'd be there asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   On the chance occasion Carson's mother found her son
intoxicated, she simply admonished him ``to never put a syringe in
my arm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to have guns for self protection,'' he added. ``You'd
go to parties and there would be fights. On several occasions, I'd
step in to help a friend who was being beaten up and end up having
a pistol shoved to my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Such episodes of near violence might have served as an impetus
for Carson to find new friends. But, Carson added, ``In a situation
like that, you just don't want to get out. ... I wish to God I
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson's downward course accelerated on the evening of May 8,
1981, when the 16-year-old youth and four friends ran out of
gasoline while cruising a Houston neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   As Carson recalled the incident, he and his friends were walking
home when they were accosted by a group of men who shouted racial
slurs and began chasing them. Authorities suggested the men
surprised Carson's group as they burglarized an auto.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Carson fired two shots at the men, killing one and
injuring a second. ``We turned and ran,'' Carson recalled. Within
days, he and one of his friends, Toren Michael Milburn, 18, were
arrested and charged with murder. In October, weeks before the pair
were to be tried, Carson heard that Milburn wanted to talk with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Carson said said he found Milburn in a rage. ``He said his
lawyers told him I was going to testify against him,'' Carson said.
``He pulled out a knife. He started a fight and ended up
deceased.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Carson killed Milburn to keep him from turning
state's witness, then hastily buried him in a shallow grave.
</P>
<P>
   So hardened was Carson that even veteran prosecutors found him
unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   During his trial he threatened a prosecutor, then sat glowering
at witnesses from the defense table. ``He was scary,'' allowed
Assistant District Attorney Kris Moore, who worked to have him
certified to stand trial as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Carson was sentenced to two concurrent 40-year terms for the
murders.
</P>
<P>
   His grandmother, Ardilia Washington, was a frequent visitor to
the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had heard a lot of stories about what I had done,'' he
said, ``And the first time she came, she just said, `Chris, did you
kill those men?' I told her that I had. She was quiet for a minute,
and then said, `OK, now I'm at peace.' She just had to know for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   During his 14 years in prison, Carson said he matured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does someone have to get hurt for people to find
themselves?'' Carson said. ``Why did people die for me to get my
head right?''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Carson has been free on parole. He lives in a small
East Texas community, where he has married. He and his wife have an
infant daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Still his crimes haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry for killing these people,'' he said. ``I think about
them and their families. I'd like to write to tell them I'm sorry.
But how do I do that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see their anger. Their frustration. They may view me as
a little old (expletive). How do I know how they'll react? Maybe
they'll let the Lord handle it. Or maybe they'll say the law made
me pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or maybe they'll say, `You haven't paid enough. You're going
to pay for it our way.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`I TOOK LIFE, AND LIFE IS SO PRECIOUS' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a gangster, that was my goal in life,'' said Robert,
whose real name is being withheld at his request. ``That was my
life. It was real painful. If I gave out pain, I didn't feel
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 19, Robert doesn't know how many people he's killed.
Although he told Houston police and state psychologists that he
believed he had killed at least two people, he did not mention
those cases when interviewed recently at an Austin halfway house,
where he is enrolled in a capital offender program.
</P>
<P>
   What's clear is that he meant to kill. On the night that he
participated in the murder of a rival gang chief at a Houston
multigang peace conference _ the crime for which he was sentenced _
he also twice tried to shoot an enemy in the head with a shotgun.
On both occasions, the weapon failed to fire.
</P>
<P>
   Robert's early life with an abusive father, passive mother and
wayward siblings was a harbinger of worse things to come during his
adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   The youth's father, who ran an auto body shop, beat his children
three or four times a week, he said. On one occasion, Robert was
battered black and blue. That episode resulted in a phone call to
authorities. But when investigators arrived, Robert claimed the
bruises had resulted from a fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved my father,'' said Robert. ``... I came to see that
being a man was to be powerful, violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert first smoked marijuana at age 8.
</P>
<P>
   At 10, he joined one of the city's burgeoning Hispanic gangs as
a ``pee-wee member,'' serving an apprenticeship in stealing guns
and committing robberies.
</P>
<P>
   At 11, he joined in stealing cars, and at 12 he was a practiced
robber, ready to do anything it took to get the goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about their families,'' he said. ``If they had
something, I'd take it. If I had to shoot them, I'd do it. If I had
to hit them in the mouth, I'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the victims were gay residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd get $300 or $500 in each case,'' he said. ``We'd get
leather jackets and jewels. They'd come out of the beer joints
drunk. Once, my friend hit him and he fell and we stomped on him.
We got $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of them tried to fight, but what can you do when
you've got five people on you? I didn't give a damn. I always felt
justified. It was pretty much a thrill. I was young, and youth has
to show strength. There was this power thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Robert proved himself to his gang _ he ultimately pulled as
many as 100 robberies _ he was entrusted with greater
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owned crack houses,'' he said. ``I sold drugs. I had sex
with prostitutes. I figured only those who were unlucky got AIDS
and I was lucky. ... I smoked, drank beer, got into fights and got
involved with drive-bys.''
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, Robert's heavily armed gang went in search of
the rival who had stabbed a member. They found a house they thought
_ but weren't certain _ was the offender's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fired a warning shot,'' Robert recalled. ``A lady, a
mother, came out. One of my gang had a 12-gauge. He shot at her and
she fell down. I had a .410. We shot up the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert didn't bother to find out if they had targeted the right
house or if their victim survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never watched the TV news,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Robert lived literally and figuratively on the edge of
a larger world _ sometimes he'd sit on his rooftop at night and
stare at the glimmering lights of downtown Houston _ he was so
involved in his gang that he saw few alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to school,'' he said. ``But to go to college, to be a
doctor, that wasn't in my future. The image taught to me was to be
bad, violent. That was my `doctor' _ to be bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no self-esteem. I didn't know who I was. I recognize now
how many people I've hurt, the pain I've caused. I took life, and
life is so precious.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a participant in the Texas Youth Commission's intensive
capital offender program, Robert has completed his high school
education and works part time as an auto mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Within six months, he will be released to a closely monitored
independent living program in Houston or Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think working was stupid,'' he said. ``We had all
the money we needed. But now I work hard for a living _ I'm a
mechanic. I work hard and it feels good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go to Dallas. It's a new place. I want to make
something good out of it. After all, everyone in the world is
looking for happiness.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AFTER LIFE,' starring Arata, Taketoshi Naito and Erika Oda.
Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda (not rated, 118 minutes). Much of
this transcendently compassionate, gently humorous Japanese film is
set in a drab office building where courteous caseworkers welcome
the week's new clients. The place turns out not to be a social
service agency but a metaphysical way station where the newcomers
are people of all ages and types who have just died and have three
days to select one memory to take with them into eternity. Before
they depart, those memories will be filmed. As they tell their
stories and make their choices (those who can't choose remain at
the processing center as caseworkers), the movie becomes a profound
meditation on life's meaning and value and the relationship of
movies, memories and dreams (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME,' starring Mike Myers,
Heather Graham and Elizabeth Hurley. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13,
95 minutes). There may come a time when even Austin Powers tires of
the words ``Oh, behave!,'' but it isn't here yet. Although the
sequel with the fab title is several love beads short of its
predecessor and more than a few scenes play like outtakes, this is
still a crafty, intermittently hilarious comedy. Myers' neo-Sellers
multiple-personality act is fine even when the material is less so,
and this sequel makes the most of Dr. Evil, his most inspired
creation. A scatological Scotsman, the film's walking id and
bathroom joke, is more of an acquired taste. Costumes and pop
references are still a hoot, as is the adorably benighted Austin.
Ms. Graham makes terrific eye candy, but doesn't share Ms. Hurley's
quick-witted air of being in on the joke (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ELECTION,' starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon.
Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the acerbically
funny director of ``Citizen Ruth'' comes this caustic satire of the
American electoral process in a high school setting. Its leading
candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms. Witherspoon, has a
mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from Connie Chung and
Elizabeth Dole. Broderick plays the hapless good-guy teacher who
thinks this wicked little front-runner needs to be stopped. And the
hunky newcomer Chris Klein plays Tracy's reluctant opponent in a
style best described as early Keanu. With a lovely ear for
hypocritical conversation, the screenplay specializes in keeping
all the characters a few beats off what they actually mean
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ENTRAPMENT,' starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
Directed by Jon Amiel (PG-13, 105 minutes). This glossy caper
summons the days when being a thief was the profession of choice
among debonair movie heroes. And heroines: As the great-looking
insurance investigator who is supposedly investigating Connery's
glamorous super-burglar, Ms. Zeta-Jones makes a smashing gymnast
and heist expert in her own right. No need to believe the
outlandish details of the story; there's enough verve and charisma
to the stars to make the escapade easy on the eyes. The action
sequence, in which the stars hang off the side of the world's
largest skyscraper, is a vertiginous show stopper. And here's a
nice bonus: nobody gets killed (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER,' starring John Travolta, Madeleine
Stowe and James Woods. Directed by Simon West (R, 118 minutes).
Murder on a military base was once enough of a pretext for a
detective thriller, but nowadays it takes more. The prevailing
sleaze quotient calls for kinks, and this galling adaptation of a
Nelson DeMille best seller is happy to oblige. So the title
character, a pretty young officer whom the film thinks has no place
in the military, is the victim of a lurid crime. Travolta and Ms.
Stowe affably investigate whodunit, though the unraveling of the
crime is laughably arbitrary. The real point of their ponderous
investigation is that the victim asked for what she got (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AN IDEAL HUSBAND,' starring Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver,
Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore and Jeremy Northam. Written and
directed by Oliver Parker (PG-13, 97 minutes). The best thing about
Parker's likable but diluted screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde's
1895 comedy of politics and Victorian morality is Everett's
portrayal of Wilde's elegantly epigrammatic alter ego Lord Arthur
Goring. In underplaying this seemingly incorrigible (but actually
wise, witty and caring) rake, Everett makes him all the more
charming. Northam and Ms. Blanchett are well cast as a politician
and his priggish wife, but Ms. Moore and Ms. Driver miss hitting
the right notes in a screenplay that streamlines Wilde into a
quasi-contemporary style, keeping some but not all of the
playwright's scintillating bons mots. The settings are so lavish
they're almost edible (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `LIMBO,' starring Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and David
Strathairn. Directed by John Sayles (R, 126 minutes). Part
survivalist drama, part satirical portrait of contemporary Alaska,
Sayles' powerful new film is almost as vast as the great outdoors
it contemplates. Ms. Mastrantonio, as a well-traveled folk-rock
singer working Alaskan lounges, and Strathairn, as the brooding
local fisherman with whom she becomes involved, make one of the
most compelling adult couples to be seen in an American film in
quite some time. When they find themselves castaways along with her
teen-age daughter on a remote Alaskan island, the movie becomes
both a suspense thriller and a sorrowful meditation on survivalism,
civilization and the ties that bind. Though marred by an abrupt
ending and glaring literary devices, ``Limbo'' is eminently
worthwhile (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MATRIX,' starring Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne.
Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120 minutes). The
time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will be all but
incomprehensible to anyone but techno freaks. And the film borrows
unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a big debt
to ``The X-Files.'' But the storytelling is intricately bizarre and
the special effects are indeed special, notably when it comes to
midair martial arts with a gravity-defying gusto. And Reeves shows
that you can look like a Prada model while behaving like an action
hero. One of the main stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive
cinematographer. He and the Wachowskis provide a couch-potato
epiphany; while the characters seem to be performing marvelous
feats, they're often lying stock-still in the grip of virtual
reality (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MUMMY,' starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold
Vosloo and John Hannah. Directed by Stephen Sommers (PG-13, 134
minutes). More like a video game than a movie, this incoherent
spoof (very loosely based on the 1932 Boris Karloff horror
classic), overloaded with cheesy special effects, suggests an
unwieldy hybrid of ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ``Abbott and
Costello Meet the Mummy'' via ``Night of the Living Dead.'' The
intrepid adventurers who disturb an ancient Egyptian crypt that
carries a fearful curse are Fraser (playing a swashbuckling
American in the Foreign Legion), Ms. Weisz (as a plucky, wide-eyed
English librarian) and Hannah (as her twitty older brother). It's
all played for laughs. The only scary moments involve swarming
scarabs that burrow under the skin and do awful ``Alien''-like
things (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `NOTTING HILL,' starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Directed
by Roger Michell (PG-13, 105 minutes). The most romantic notion
here may be that a Hollywood star as famous as Ms. Roberts might be
out, unassisted, browsing for a book. But it's enough to bring her
together with Grant's bashful bookseller and let two
extraordinarily charming actors play out an intelligent flirtation.
As written by Richard Curtis with frequent wit and welcome echoes
of his ``Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' this is a bright, winsome
romantic comedy that's as teasing as the characters themselves,
inviting the audience to ponder the movie star's burdens of being
world famous and desperately attractive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE RED VIOLIN,' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Flemying,
Greta Scacchi and Don McKellar. Directed by Francois Girard (not
rated, 130 minutes). ``The Red Violin'' follows the colorful
300-plus-year journey of a priceless violin from its construction
in an Italian workshop in 1681 to a contemporary auction in
Montreal. As it makes its way from Vienna to England to Communist
China, the instrument becomes the inspiration for some richly
photographed historical tableaux. If the movie's narrative energy
is undermined by a plodding screenplay and wooden acting, the
music, composed by John Corigliano and played by Joshua Bell and
the London Philharmonia Orchestra, is sublime (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,' starring Liam
Neeson. Directed by George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of
hype and breathless expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a
happy surprise: It's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit
of the series and offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway,
creating illusions that are even more plausible than the
kitchen-raiding raptors of ``Jurassic Park.'' While the human stars
here are indeed reduced to playing action figures, they are
upstaged by amazing backdrops and hordes of crazily lifelike space
beings as the Lewis Carroll in Lucas is given free rein. The ``Star
Wars'' franchise was funnier and scrappier when it was new. But it
simply wasn't capable of this (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TARZAN,' with the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver and
Nigel Hawthorne. Directed by Kevin Lima and Chris Buck (G, 88
minutes). No need to wonder how this animated Tarzan movie could
improve on the 47 others that preceded it. Disney animation turns
the hero into a supple, long-haired hunk, lets the apes talk to
him, and whooshes through lush jungle settings with exultant
agility. This ``Tarzan'' is sprightly and likable in ways that are
hard to resist, with lively vocal performances, excitingly kinetic
animation and Phil Collins singing tunefully in the background.
Parents will stay awake, and children will be charmed (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TEA WITH MUSSOLINI,' starring Cher, Dame Judi Dench, Joan
Plowright, Dame Maggie Smith and Lily Tomlin. Directed by Franco
Zeffirelli (PG, 117 minutes). The screen divas (especially Dame
Maggie) who give ``Tea With Mussolini'' a patina of class obviously
relish chewing the scenery in this sudsy historical drama (adapted
from a chapter of Zeffirelli's autobiography) about a circle of
English expatriate women living in Florence on the eve of World War
II. Dame Maggie, a quintessential British snob, is the leader of
the pack, nicknamed the Scorpioni, whose comfortable lives are
shattered when the Fascists rise to power and they find themselves
carted off to a Tuscan hill town, where they are held under house

   `THE WINSLOW BOY,' starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon and
Jeremy Northam. Directed by David Mamet (G, 110 minutes). Terence
Rattigan's play about the 1910 schoolboy's trial that created a
furor in England has been artfully pared down to its essentials in
this adaptation. Played with unusually effective restraint by a
fine cast, it works as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in
which the family of a cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered
by the consequences of that accusation. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly
arch acting style sets the film's tone and gives her suffragist
character a sharp edge (Maslin).

WRONG CHOICES: TV? THE STREETS? UPBRINGING? WHAT CAUSES KIDS TO
KILL

By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Robert didn't care whom he killed. He was a robber,
drive-by shooter, Houston bad man extraordinaire, and all life,
except his own, was cheap. That's the way he felt when he took a
hard, 35-year fall for murder five years ago. He was only 14.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Carson always looked out for number one. First he
killed a man; then he killed an accomplice who planned to testify
against him. He was 16 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Beaver loved his mom. No one was more surprised than he
when he beat her to death with a baseball bat at their Fort Bend
County home near Houston. He was 15.
</P>
<P>
   These are the stories of kids who kill.
</P>
<P>
   Such crimes invariably galvanize politicians to word-whip the
entertainment industry for glamorizing violence, to demand an end
of easy juvenile access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   They perpetually startle complacent Americans whose attention
turns to youth violence only after headline-grabbing tragedies like
this year's Littleton, Colo., school shootings in which 15 people
died.
</P>
<P>
   What causes kids to kill? The answers are myriad _ and
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts hypothesize that violence spreads like an insidious
virus from generation to generation. A preponderance of violent
teens, they note, have felt the lash of parental abuse or, more
subtle but no less destructive, the hush of parental indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in the home, violence in the streets, violence on the
movie or television screen _ it's easy to see, they say, why some
kids come to believe murder is an acceptable solution to some of
life's problems.
</P>
<P>
   But while prosecutors, police and psychologists can offer
valuable insights, no one understands the nuances of pain _ for the
victim and the victimizer _ better than the teen-agers who have
grown to maturity behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I hope,'' said one interviewed for this article, ``is that
someone, maybe a high school counselor, can take my story and use
it. To tell some kid, `Here's someone who made the wrong choices.
Don't be like him.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THESE KIDS?' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The inmates at Texas' grimy red-brick Walls Unit in downtown
Huntsville have seen it all. But when word of the April 20
slaughter of students at Columbine High School in the Denver suburb
of Littleton filtered through the cell blocks, even the most
hardened prisoners shook their heads in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such an extreme,'' said Walls inmate Beaver. ``People
in here generally were shocked. They were saying, `Man, what's
going on with these kids?'''
</P>
<P>
   Similar sentiments were voiced in suburban Fort Bend County in
the late summer of 1988 when Beaver, then 15 and a member of a
loose-knit adolescent gang called the Wolverines, was arrested for
bashing his mother's head with a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Macha, 39, was beaten at least a dozen times with the
bat, a portion of which lodged in her skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a little baseball with my mother,'' Beaver told other
youths after his arrest. ``I made a boo-boo.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believed members of the group, about 10 suburban
high school kids, some of whom were suspected Satan worshippers,
planned to kill their parents, then flee to Mexico. Two other
parents of gang members suffered nonlethal attacks on the same day.
Beaver, however, who now is serving a 15-year sentence for his
crime, insisted that his mother's death simply grew out of a
daylong quarrel about his previous day's attempt to run away from
home.
</P>
<P>
   Beaver said he was driven to the Wolverines _ ``a bunch of kids
trying to appear tough'' _ by violent disagreements with his
stepfather, a heavy equipment operator who occasionally beat his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a distant type of person,'' Beaver said. ``He was
emotional, and his main emotion was anger. He disapproved of me and
my two sisters. He didn't want us to talk at the dinner table. He
wanted to discipline me; he'd talk about how I needed to be
disciplined. I'd be standing there, and he'd talk as if I was
furniture. He just made me feel worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, Beaver said, his stepfather grabbed his shirt in an
apparent effort to assault him. ``I didn't wait,'' Beaver said. ``I
came out swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of a `floater,''' he said. ``I had friends in
different groups, but I didn't belong to any of them. I liked
athletics _ soccer, basketball, football _ but I wasn't a jock. I
liked heavy metal, but I wasn't a metalhead. I had a lot of
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   It was through a friend that Beaver was introduced to the gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't walk around with gang signs. There weren't certain
clothes we'd wear. You were just a Wolverine. There was no
organization, just a bunch of kids. If you'd see a girl and she was
involved, that was one way to get the girl. You'd join up to beat
your chest for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his arrest, one of Beaver's classmates said that
Beaver often fantasized about becoming a ``vampire.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the gang, Beaver said, often got drunk and used
drugs. Never an outstanding student, Beaver began to fail his
classes. ``Me and a couple of guys broke into a store,'' he said.
``One said he knew where the money was, but we just got a bunch of
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   As his school performance deteriorated, Beaver came to the
attention of school counselors. But their efforts made matters
worse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a problem with my mother,'' he said. ``She stood
between the kids and our stepfather. ... She liked to have a good
time, go out drinking with her friends. She wanted to help her kids
do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to leave,'' he said. ``I had tried to run away but
they arrested me. The day before I had been drunk and high. We got
into an argument. I was thinking with the mindset of a Wolverine. I
was prepared mentally for gang banging. When our fight began, I was
already preset. I grabbed what was nearby _ a bat. I only remember
the beginning and the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, I was numb. I had no feelings. I was walking down the
street, thinking, `What's wrong?' There was no anger, no sadness.
Just completely numb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, I was just tired. Then scared. A few days later, I
started feeling sadness and remorse. At first, I was just charged
with aggravated assault. I thought maybe it wasn't that bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how bad it was. You've got a protecting
mechanism for things you don't want to know. When it was explained
to me that my mother had died, then the realization set in. Grief.
Fear.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Beaver _ certified to stand trial as an adult _ was
convicted of murder and sentenced to the penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   In prison, Beaver said he has repeatedly relived the events
leading to the murder. He's gleaned bits of truth about himself and
teen-agers in general. If he could convey a message to his dead
mother, he said, it simply would be: ``I'm sorry. I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers, Beaver said he now recognizes, live purely in the
present, with little appreciation for the consequences of their
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids don't realize they can be put in jail,'' he said. ``It
really sucks. Day for day, I've lived (nearly) half my life in
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`I'M SORRY FOR KILLING THESE PEOPLE' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gang life held little allure for Carson. He excelled in sports,
did relatively well in school and seemed destined for a future of
some promise.
</P>
<P>
   Though his home life on Houston's north side sometimes was
tumultuous, his visits to his grandparents' East Texas farm were a
touchstone of stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have stayed up on the farm,'' the two-time killer
mused during a recent interview. ``I got into it more. I loved my
grandparents. I worked with the hogs and cows. I loved hauling hay.
I knew right from wrong. All I needed was a little push in the
right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In the city, though, Carson felt anchorless. His parents,
preoccupied with making ends meet, offered little support, he said.
Though Carson played school football, he was perpetually
disappointed when his family failed to come to the games.

`EL NUEVO MUNDO:' THE FACE AND SOUL OF A BARRIO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mich., Chile)   By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than two decades, the photographer Camilo Jose Vergara
has been taking portraits of American cities, or rather of parts of
American cities that almost nobody wants to see. The primary
subjects of his 1995 book, ``The New American Ghetto,'' were poor,
gutted, socially roped-off neighborhoods in Newark, Detroit, the
Bronx and elsewhere. The pictures, accompanied by a diaristic text
that read like a tolling of bells, constituted a bad-dream
architectural saga of things falling down, walls mostly, in slow
motion, brick by brick, or in one big, jolting, bulldozer-induced
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Vergara, who is 54 and trained as a sociologist, caught this
process on film by showing up while it happened. Since the late
1970s, he has made repeated visits to specific places _ a city
block, a housing project, a school _ and photographed what he
found. The pictures that resulted are technically straightforward,
objective rather than expressive. But seen together and in sequence
they add up to fever-chart narratives of disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   Vergara's relationship to loss is a complicated one, at once
hard-headed and romantic. (He traces it to his childhood in Chile
when the family wealth he was born into evaporated before his
eyes.) He took some heat a while back for proposing that a cluster
of empty skyscrapers in downtown Detroit be declared a ruins theme
park, where tourists could witness the grand, cautionary spectacle
of a city moldering away from within.
</P>
<P>
   Urban change can, of course, be viewed from many perspectives,
some positive, even utopian. It is this upbeat spirit that warms
``El Nuevo Mundo: The Landscape of Latino Los Angeles,'' an
exhibition of Vergara's most recent photographs, which opens Friday
at the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum. The bulk of the work
dates from 1994 to 1998, so the time-lapse format, which has always
been Vergara's strong suit, isn't operative here. (Though he
includes one beautiful 20-year sequence of shots of a Harlem
storefront to show how it works.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 100 color pictures have semi-independent lives,
making them feel closer to fine art photography than to field data.
But they also collectively form a single giant snapshot of life in
the present tense in a hardscrabble urban environment where poverty
is a constant but new cultural roots are in photogenic flower.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade or so, Los Angeles has become home to the
largest Hispanic population of any city in the United States; more
than 40 percent of its 9.5 million people are Spanish-speaking.
Many of the hundreds of thousands of new arrivals are Mexicans who
have settled in once predominantly black areas.
</P>
<P>
   In Vergara's view, they are different from earlier immigrants,
who often moved over long distances to a foreign land, leaving old
identities behind. Mexico is only a few hours' drive from Los
Angeles, and Southern California, with its desert climate, was once
Mexican territory, facts that encourage northbound immigrants to
transport and and sustain a familiar way of life.
</P>
<P>
   The shoring up of identity is the focus of Vergara's show, and
he illustrates it in a handful of introductory images. One is a
tableau of waving palm trees lining a boulevard, a classic
Hollywood logo. Beside it, however, are shots of a mariachi band
playing in a Los Angeles street, and of an elegant carved stone
doorway plastered with advertisements, mostly in Spanish, including
one for New Life Immigration Services.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, this show is divided into a few thematic sections
centering on home and work. Most of the buildings in the Mexican
neighborhoods are one-story bungalows built in the 1920s and 30s.
House pride is the rule. One man has framed his front door with
decorative Mexican tiles. Another, who makes cast-cement
architectural ornaments for a living, has fitted his tiny hacienda
with baronial balustrades.
</P>
<P>
   But space is scarce, and houses are often packed to overflowing.
(One street address is divided into fractions: 823, 823 1/5, 823
2/5 and so on.) New shelters spring up in driveways and empty lots.
Old cars are preserved far beyond their active lives, and in
Vergara's pictures they assume an animated presence, as if they had
thoughts and memories of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Home and work place merge: a front yard in south-central Los
Angeles serves as a showroom for mattress sales. Certain businesses
keep on the move (a barber makes house calls, grooming an entire
family in a visit). Others appear to be traveling even when they
are not, as in the case of a shoe repair shop that operates out of
a long-immobilized truck painted fire-engine red.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial architecture (which is what this ex-truck, by
default, is) reflects its surroundings in all kinds of ways. A
jewelry factory, for example, is given the blank, no-window look of
a bank vault in response to local crime. But in terms of design,
what clearly fascinates and delights Vergara most is the
proliferation of a vivid public art.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the work is please-pay-attention promotional. This is
true of Maritza's Fashions shop, all scrumptious yellow and pink,
with skirts and socks painted on the facade. Of the magnetic Ultra
Tire Service, with its snazzy ribbons of tread patterns painted as
trim on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the Mexican community's ties to back-home rural
roots is evident in paintings of farm animals, country churches and
mountain vistas. Multicultural heroes have their day in the sun.
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is often depicted, in part
perhaps as a diplomatic gesture in an area where population shifts
have produced racial tensions. In some portraits he is given Latino
features, and in one he is paired with Pancho Villa.
</P>
<P>
   But no figure carries more emotional weight than the Virgin of
Guadalupe, spiritual protector of Mexico and a potent nationalist
symbol. She shows up everywhere in Mexican Los Angeles, in her blue
veil and aureole of pointy flames, including on the wall of a
muffler repair shop where she floats imperturbably between vintage
cars.
</P>
<P>
   She also rises over the skyline of the city itself in a gallery
mural executed at the Cooper-Hewitt by the young Manhattan artist
James De La Vega and his assistant Nelson Caban. De La Vega lives
and works a few blocks north of the museum in Spanish Harlem, where
he has enlivened neighborhood walls with a wealth of similar
paintings. His work was spotted by Vergara and Jen Roos, the
exhibition designer, and they invited him to take part in the show.
</P>
<P>
   The geographic distance between Manhattan's Upper East Side and
the barrio is just a few blocks, but the social divide can be as
insurmountable as the towering steel barriers that seal the
U.S.-Mexico border. Photographs of those barriers are the final
pictures in the show, and they end things where they should end,
after celebration, on a note of doubt.

</P>
<P>
   How welcoming is the New World, after all, to its new settlers?
What are the future implications of the insularity of the Mexican
community in Los Angeles? What does it mean that murals in
Vergara's pictures project virtually none of the activist political
fire of paintings done in the same city by members of the Chicano
Art Movement starting in the 1960s? Does the Virgin of Guadalupe
represent accommodation to realities _ scant housing, poor working
conditions _ that should inspire vigilant resistance?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the answers, the photographs with their brief,
personalized captions, are persuasive and moving, particularly when
considered as part of the larger visual and textual project that
Vergara describes as an ``uninterrupted dialogue with poor
communities.'' (He has conducted hundreds of on-site interviews
over the years; they are a crucial part of his work. Longer
excerpts from some of them here would have been a good idea.)
</P>
<P>
   His images take on an extra measure of resonance at the
Cooper-Hewitt. The museum's palatial Fifth Avenue building was
erected at the turn of the century by Andrew Carnegie as his New
York home. The show is installed in what were once family quarters.
Vergara's loving portraits of immigrant houses hang in former
Gilded Age bedrooms, dressing rooms and nurseries. His shots of the
forbidding border walls appear in Carnegie's billiard room. The
result is yet another architectural image of adaptation and change.
El Nuevo Mundo, indeed.

at the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, Smithsonian
Institution in Manhattan through Sept. 5.

 &HT;    Bush bids on large ranch near Waco
 &HT;    By Brad Reagan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Is McGregor the next Kennebunkport? And is Gov.
George W. Bush taking steps toward creating the next Texas White
House?
</P>
<P>
   That's the talk in Central Texas as sources confirm that Bush is
looking to buy a ranch west of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he has a bid in on it,'' said state Sen. David Sibley
of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman in Bush's office confirmed recently that Bush was
looking at land in the area, but said a deal had not been
completed. At a campaign stop in South Carolina, Bush declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley said the ranch is ``several hundred acres'' in western
McLennan County near the town of McGregor, about 20 miles from
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner in Austin last week, Sibley said, Bush extolled the
beauty of the land, which includes a creek running through the
property and several canyons. Bush's wife, Laura, then asked for
recommendations of home builders in the area, Sibley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes have reportedly been looking at land in the area for
several months.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Citrano, owner of the Coffee Shop in Gatesville, said the
couple stopped in the restaurant last month and told him they were
looking to buy a ranch nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Before closing the deal, Bush is waiting on an engineer's report
regarding whether the land will hold water, Sibley said. The report
would indicate whether Bush, an avid fisherman, would be able to
build a stock tank on the property.
</P>
<P>
   As for the possibility that Bush could make McLennan County the
millennium's equivalent of LBJ's Texas White House in Blanco County
near Johnson City, Sibley said, ``It's an exciting prospect.''

 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chamber music, as its name implies, is music meant to
be performed in chamber-size rooms. Historically, such performances
were informal. When Mozart and some friends got together to play
string quartets, they were taking part essentially in sight-reading
sessions for the musicians involved, with sometimes an extra
listener or two. And they were usually playing in someone's living
room. Even when the idea of chamber music concerts took hold, these
still tended to be private affairs in smaller spaces, at most a
wealthy musical amateur's elegant salon with chandeliers, satin
sofas and floor space for additional chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The concert halls where chamber music is typically performed
today are too large. Alice Tully Hall, which was built for chamber
music, is much too large at 1,096 seats. Merkin Concert Hall, which
seats about 450, is better. The rotunda at the Frick Collection,
which can accommodate about 175, is better still, though the sound
of the room is rather bright.
</P>
<P>
   But is there any place where music lovers can experience the
intimacy of chamber music as it was in the days of Mozart and
Mendelssohn and as it should still be today?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. On a 102-foot solid steel barge docked on the East River in
Fulton Ferry Landing in Brooklyn, just south of the Brooklyn
Bridge, practically underneath it.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, this has been the home of Bargemusic, which may be
the most prolific chamber music series in the world, since it
offers at least two concerts a week _ on Thursday evenings and
Sunday afternoons, and during certain periods one more on Friday
nights _ all year round.
</P>
<P>
   The founder and director of Bargemusic is the 80-year-old Olga
Bloom, a wizened, soft-spoken yet indomitable amateur violinist who
is also something of a local character among her maritime
neighbors. She owns the barge, which she bought in the 1970s for
$10,000, and until about 15 years ago she lived on it as well. ``I
was a peculiar apparition around here,'' she said on Sunday after
an all-Schubert concert on the barge. ``I was happy living here.
But the city was getting so many inquiries from other harbor people
who wanted to live on the river that they kicked me off.'' She
bought a Civil War-era home in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn for
$6,000 and lives there still.
</P>
<P>
   She might as well be living on the barge for all the time she
spends there. It's nothing fancy, just your basic barge, with a
10-foot high ceiling and a narrow metal gangplank. But inside, the
walls are paneled with lovely cherry wood, which Ms. Bloom carted
over in her car from Staten Island and installed herself with help
from family and friends. There are the requisite amenities (a
restroom and such), and a pantry to prepare snacks and drinks for
sale. Using folding chairs, the space can accommodate about 130
comfortably, though the Fire Department has given clearance for
179.
</P>
<P>
   The barge may be spare, but the view it affords of lower
Manhattan across the river is spectacular, and it can be enjoyed
not just from the rooftop deck, where the audience wanders during
intermission, but from inside during the concerts: The musicians
play on a slightly raised platform against a rear wall of windows
that overlooks the river.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the room's acoustical properties that make it so ideal
for chamber music. Actually, the space has some acoustical quirks.
The piano, a lovely Steinway, sounds imposing up close, yet
somewhat under-powered on the far side of the room. But it doesn't
matter. The intimate space draws you into the midst of a
performance. On Sunday, when a group of fine musicians played
Schubert's ``Trout'' Quintet, the resonance of the bass seemed to
travel right through the floorboards, and the brilliant piano
writing in the high register of the keyboard jangled in the ears.
It was positively symphonic. And that's the point. Heard up close,
chamber works become enormous musical statements.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of chamber music on a barge may seem peculiar, but Ms.
Bloom points to a precedent. When King George I of England asked
Handel to write music for a royal water party, legend has it that
the musicians played for the revelers on a barge floating up the
Thames. ``If it was good enough for a king, it is good enough for
us,'' Ms. Bloom says.
</P>
<P>
   But her inspiration was as much spiritual as musical. ``We are
strangling in plastic,'' she says. ``It has been my sad fate to
watch electronic developments increase the profitability of music
in certain areas and diminish the sensitivity of human response in
general.'' She wanted to create at least one small place where
people can come together, audiences and musicians, and realize that
they have shared values.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, for gala events, Ms. Bloom will participate in a
performance. Mostly she plays chamber music in the traditional way:
with friends at home in the darkness of the night, she says.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bloom was born in Boston to immigrant parents. Her Russian
father, an ardent communist, ``played the violin atrociously,'' she
says. Her mother, of Slavic descent, sang beautifully. Their
relationship survived the turbulent 1920s by their shared love of
nature and music. Ms. Bloom's violin teacher, Jacques Hoffmann, was
the associate concert master of the Boston Symphony Orchestra at
the time. When the Depression came, he kept teaching her free of
charge. When Ms. Bloom realized that a professional career as a
violinist was not in her future, she still felt a need to give
something back to music.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Bargemusic going was a formidable undertaking. She owned
two barges before settling on the current one. The first was a
``glorious thing,'' Ms. Bloom says, with massive beams. But the
4-inch-thick flooring just soaked up the sound. Moreover, a wooden
barge was uninsurable, she learned. So public concerts would have
been prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   The second barge was solid steel, but the particular type of
steel was spongy and brittle. ``If you poked your finger in the
hull, it started to give way,'' she explains. Over the years Ms.
Bloom has put some $100,000 into renovating the current barge,
which has proved reliable and inviting.
</P>
<P>
   A large circle of excellent and loyal musicians have been
involved with Bargemusic. The remarkable cellist Ronald Thomas, who
is based in New York but is also the artistic director of the
Boston Chamber Music Society, participated in Sunday's program and
serves on the seven-member Resident Artists Committee, which picks
the programs. ``So many of us have played with each other over the
years, not just here but in other places, that it feels like we are
regular partners,'' he said after the concert. ``Yet there is a
comradeship, a spirit of informality that allows us to take musical
risks that we might not in some Manhattan hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the musicians must deal with the shifting of the
barge, which rocks gently up and down every time a ferry, tugboat
or cargo ship passes by. ``You can count on having a slip, or two
or three, in every piece,'' Thomas said. ``But it doesn't matter.''
Ms. Bloom thinks that a little sense of danger makes the atmosphere
more romantic and helps the audience pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians take risks not just in interpretations but in
programming, which is adventurous. A concert Friday night, part of
a special Friday series sponsored by the Nakamichi Foundation,
offers a piano trio composed in 1984-85 by the Argentine-born
composer Maurizio Kagel and the Brahms Piano Quartet in G minor. A
program on Sunday afternoon at 4 will present the fine Hungarian
pianist Peter Nagy in a recital of works by Messiaen, Bartok and
Schubert.
</P>
<P>
   Programs frequently mix the old and the new in enticing ways.
But even standard repertory programs, like Sunday's all-Schubert
concert, are freshly thought out. The ``Trout'' Quintet was
preceded by an Adagio and Rondo for the same group of unusual
instruments (violin, viola, cello, bass, piano), a little-known
work that sounds like a sketch for a mini piano concerto. Nagy also
gave an eloquent account of one of Schubert's least-heard piano
works, the five-movement Sonata, D. 459.
</P>
<P>
   New musicians keep getting drawn into the Bargemusic circle. In
February the pianist Peter Serkin played there for the first time
with a group of exemplary performers including two members of the
Artists Committee: the violist Paul Neubauer and the cellist Fred
Sherry. The program offered recent works by Oliver Knussen and Toru
Takemitsu and a pair of Haydn piano trios in big-gestured
performances that, heard up close, seemed a rebuke to the notion
that Classical-era chamber music should be refined.
</P>
<P>
   Change is coming to the Bargemusic schedule in January. Ms.
Bloom's board has just given her the go-ahead to offer regular
concerts on Saturday evenings. The idea would be to have one
program played on Thursday nights and Sunday afternoons, and
another on Friday and Saturday nights. This means that the rental
of the barge for catered events on Saturdays, which in the past has
provided one-third of the organization's income, will cease. ``The
hell with it,'' Ms. Bloom says. ``Everything in life is a risk.
Let's go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bloom must be the only presenter of chamber music around who
has to worry about the dredging of New York Harbor. Plans for this
environmentally essential work are under heated discussion between
the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Port Authority of
New York and the Department of Economic Development, she explained.
It will be a huge project, and no agreement has yet been reached
about how to proceed. Silt and sediment have accumulated in the
riverbed to the point that during low tides the barge sometimes
rests on rock, which is terrible for its hull.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Bloom remains irrepressible and committed to her barge
as a site for chamber music. She is even feeling more hopeful about
the economic future of struggling musicians, something that pained
her for decades. ``Finally, there seems to be a growing awareness
that we in this society are being blunted spiritually and
personally beyond redemption,'' she says. ``The arts can heal us,
and I think there is a new awareness of this. I think there is a
change in the tide.''
</P>
<P>
   She may be right. Ms. Bloom is an authority on the tide.

 &HT;    Catching up with Headley: Concert, album, rehearsals for
retooled `Aida' among performer's projects
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's Atlanta's favorite diva up to these days?
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Heather Headley, the once and future star of
Disney's ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida,'' is languishing in
her Manhattan apartment, sifting through sheets of music, trying to
decide what to sing when she returns to the city this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After stealing the hearts of Atlanta theatergoers last fall, the
24-year-old Broadway performer _ known for her gazelle-like grace,
dramatically swooping eyebrows and, most importantly, that
murderously gorgeous voice _ is back for a solo, one-night-only
show Saturday at the 14th Street Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed up until 3 or 4 last night. I've got all my music
laid out on the bed,'' Headley (which is pronounced ``HAD-lee'')
says in a telephone interview, in an accent that has traces of
everything from Brooklyn to her native Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   For the concert she promises a bit of Broadway (including
numbers from her ``Ragtime'' and ``Lion King'' repertories), some
jazz (``Lush Life'') and plenty of gospel (her father was a
minister, so she grew up singing in the church). And, of course,
her signature song, ``Elaborate Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, these people will be able to leave the theater by
11 o'clock,'' she jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Headley's own clock is ticking. She's counting the
minutes until Aug. 1, when she wraps up her engagement as Nala in
Broadway's ``The Lion King,'' and Sept. 20, when she begins
rehearsals for a new version of ``Elaborate Lives,'' retitled
simply as ``Aida.'' The heavily overhauled production of the
musical begins Nov. 5 at Chicago's Palace Theatre; the show is
expected to open on Broadway in March.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, she'll be cutting her first album, which will
feature original music written by herself and others. But Headley
says she's taking her time on the project, which some believe could
be a major breakthrough. ``It's Whitney Houston meets Lauryn Hill,
who has lunch with Celine Dion while talking to Regina Belle,'' she
says, teasing about her big-throated style.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Headley talks nothing like a diva, sprinkling an
hourlong conversation with infectious laughter and self-deprecating
humor. Here's what she had to say about:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Her dream date: ``I'm so easy to please. `Pick up Kentucky
Fried Chicken, and we'll go to the beach.' I'm not a big restaurant
person. I don't like going to places where you feel you must
behave, where you have to sit and use the right fork and the right
knife. That's not me. If it's a dream date, it's that sense of
completeness and just being accepted (that I'm looking for). I
would be so comfortable with this person that I would eat chicken
wings in front of them.'' She says there's no significant other in
her life at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Her voice: ``I think I have the gift of air. I think God gives
you gifts, and he says, `Your gift of air is going to last for 80
years.' I feel that if I don't make the payments, it will be taken
from me. I have to make sure I give back in some way. I think
everybody has a loan (from God). All you have to do is figure it
out. Some people have a talent for listening, or being a friend.
Some people cannot be a good friend. Your talent does not mean you
have to be in front of people.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Her early career: ``Mummy says I started singing at 2, that I
was on a radio program at 2. I remember coming home from school,
dropping my books and charging into the church and singing. It
would be a daily ritual, and I would sing until I was sweaty. I
would imagine that there were people in the pews. I would have a
little concert every day. I was just praying nobody would see me!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Her first record: ``I want to do timeless music, music that
you can go back and listen to years later _ like the Supremes and
Ella Fitzgerald. It sounds like it was just done yesterday. That's
why we are still talking Shakespeare and singing Verdi.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have the gift of air. I think God gives you gifts,
and he says, `Your gift of air is going to last for 80 years.' I
feel that if I don't make the payments, it will be taken from me. I
have to make sure I give back in some way.''

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this IMAX film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy
</P>
<P>
   Who Shagged Me'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mike Myers
</P>
<P>
   and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's fave dentally impaired British superspy, Mike
Myers goes back to the '60s to save his mojo from Dr. Evil and a
giant slob in a kilt (Myers and Myers, respectively). Shaggy but
still shagadelic, this worthy sequel also stars Heather Graham as a
curvy CIA operative, Seth Green as Dr. Evil's brooding son Scott
and Jerry Springer (don't ask). (SM)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler
</P>
<P>
   and Joey Lauren Adams.
</P>
<P>
   It's Adam Sandler's latest money-maker. ``Big Daddy'' ties
together elements from his successful date movie ``The Wedding
Singer'' (boyish innocence and charm to woo the women in the
audience) and his even more successful yukfest ``The Waterboy''
(scatological scatting just for the boys). Throw in an itty-bitty
kid for Sandler to pal around with and you've got the makings of a
mack-daddy movie. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' R (profanity, sexuality and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   In this cruelly funny satire, high school teacher Matthew
Broderick schemes to thwart perky student Reese Witherspoon in her
bid for the student government presidency. The second feature from
``Citizen Ruth'' director Alexander Payne may sound like a bouncy
comedy. But it's really a
</P>
<P>
   bittersweet ode to the everyday lies people tell themselves to
justify their actions. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrapment'' PG-13 (violence and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Connery
</P>
<P>
   and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   A thriller with no thrills. A he/she sexual pas de deux with
little
</P>
<P>
   chemistry. Sean Connery plays Max, a dapper thief swiping
priceless works of art and computer chips. A shapely insurance
agent (Catherine Zeta-Jones) slinks into the picture and
``Entrapment'' becomes a cat-and-mouse game with lots of twists and
turns. Sadly, it's almost always a bore. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 50
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The General's Daughter'' R (profanity, violence, rape,
</P>
<P>
   sadomasochism)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta,
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Stowe and James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   As a warrant officer investigating the mysterious slaying of a
female captain, John Travolta bolts on screen, barking his lines
and spitting his machismo all over the place. He's got to.
Somebody's got to turn this mess into a movie. Shot in Savannah and
disguised as an A-grade film, ``General's Daughter'' is a slick,
over-directed, over-written and ultimately underwhelming whodunit
B-grade thriller. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 55 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' R (profanity, adult sexual issues)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Silverstone
</P>
<P>
   and Brad Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   Needs to get over itself. This gay-themed film about two British
male teens and their coming-out conflicts might have been of some
interest 15 years ago. Now, it's so obvious that the only ones
who'll be interested are gay 15-year-olds. As is, ``Get Real''
bravely goes where too many films have gone before. (ERG) 1 hour,
48 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' PG-13 (brief nudity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rupert Everett,
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett,
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Northam and Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   A less-than-ideal adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play. In 1895
London, a respected politician's public and private lives are
threatened by a blackmailer who knows a secret from his past. The
fine cast is stymied by director Oliver Parker's literal-minded
approach. What remains is a well-acted, very well-appointed period
piece that becomes more stifling and less engaging as it goes
along. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinct'' R (intense violent behavior)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anthony Hopkins
</P>
<P>
   and Cuba Gooding Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Resist your instinct to see it. Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins
plays an anthropologist locked up in a psychiatric prison
surrounded by ``colorful'' inmates. It seems that, after living for
months with gorillas in the African wilds, he went berserk and
killed two natives. Why? It's up to a psychiatry student (Oscar
winner Cuba Gooding Jr.) to pick his mind. It's twaddle. (SM) 2
hours, 4 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Life'' R (language, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy
</P>
<P>
   and Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence bicker for more than 60 years
in this sometimes hilarious and racially poignant prison comedy.
How they landed in a Mississippi correctional facility with life
sentences isn't nearly as important as the knack these talented
performers have for taking turns at
</P>
<P>
   generating laughs out of a throwaway script. (Bob Longino). 1
hour, 49 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbo'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Strathairn
</P>
<P>
   and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.
</P>
<P>
   Independent filmmaker John Sayles is at his most
independent-minded in this intriguing and inherently honorable
movie whose parts don't add up to a satisfying whole. It's as if he
set out to make one film _ a tender, middle-aged romance told
against the backdrop of encroaching tourism in Alaska _ and then
got interested in something totally different: an unsettling
metaphysical survival tale. (ERG) 2 hours, 6 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Loss
</P>
<P>
   of Sexual Innocence'' R (violence, profanity, sex and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julian Sands.
</P>
<P>
   Loses its way all too often, but never loses its audience.
Disconnected and dreamlike, Mike Figgis' film is as self-indulgent
as it is disturbingly primal. A British filmmaker (Julian Sands) in
Tunisia reflects on various former selves _ a little boy in Kenya;
a fat boy in gym class; a lust-filled teen. Meanwhile, a very black
Adam and a very white Eve act out their Garden of Eden tragedy on a
decaying estate. (ERG) 1 hour, 41 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love Letter'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kate Capshaw,
</P>
<P>
   Tom Everett Scott
</P>
<P>
   and Tom Selleck.
</P>
<P>
   Not lovable, but generally likable. An anonymous love letter
circulates among the residents of a small New England town setting
off rendezvous, revelations and romantic misunderstandings. The
film has two problems: It flirts with a serious case of the cutes
and Kate Capshaw, sexually appealing and adorably flustered, never
quite takes over her own star vehicle. Still, it has enough charm
to keep you interested. (ERG) 1 hour, 29 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' R (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves,
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Fishburne
</P>
<P>
   and Carrie-Anne Moss.
</P>
<P>
   A knockout sci-fi flick. Writer-directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski bring their sharp storytelling and visual showmanship to
an adventure
</P>
<P>
   starring Keanu Reeves that should please comic book fanatics and
mainstream moviegoers. Balancing intelligence with stunning special
effects and action, it's a movie that earns its explosions, high
kicks and cascades of spent
</P>
<P>
   bullets. (SM) 2 hours, 15 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' PG-13 (pervasive adventure violence
</P>
<P>
   and partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser
</P>
<P>
   and Rachel Weisz.
</P>
<P>
   Mummy, make it stop! Please! Just because a movie has desert
scenery, a hunky action hero (Brendan Fraser), hissable bad guys
and supernatural hoodoo doesn't make it an Indiana Jones flick.
You'll miss Steven Spielberg's masterful touch watching ``The
Mummy,'' a petrified mixture of retro adventure, clumsy slapstick
and minimal chills. (SM) 2 hours, 4 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Never Been Kissed'' PG-13 (profanity, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   sexual references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore
</P>
<P>
   and David Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore is Josie Geller, a newspaper copy editor in her
mid-20s and former high school dweeb (``Josie Grossie,'' they
called her), who goes back to teenville as an undercover reporter,
promptly relives high school hell and pretty much bumbles her way
to popularity. Everything about her career is implausible. The
movie's jokes are lame, its situations loopy. But Barrymore does
make a go of it. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 47 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant
</P>
<P>
   and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Boy gets movie star, boy loses movie star, etc. Hugh Grant plays
a decent London bookseller and Julia Roberts a version of herself
(worldwide movie star) in this romantic comedy. The latest from the
writer of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' is old-fashioned hokum,
short on surprise but very long on charm. (SM) 2 hours, 4 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' PG (profanity, sensuality, alcohol use,
</P>
<P>
   some thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jake Gyllenhaal,
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cooper and Laura Dern.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teenager Homer (Jake
Gyllenhaal) and three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and
shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of
their small town. Based on Homer Hickam's autobiography ``Rocket
Boys,'' it makes the process of learning seem as exciting as a
special FX-driven action flick. (SM) 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Out-of-Towners'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn
</P>
<P>
   and John Cleese.
</P>
<P>
   A mess from the start. Based on the Neil Simon 1970 film, it
feels staler the second it starts to unreel. Henry (Steve Martin)
and Nancy Clark (Goldie Hawn) are a long-married couple from Ohio
trying to redefine their lives now that the children are grown.
They land in New York and hijinks ensue. (Drew Jubera) At area
discount theaters. 1 hour and 31 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin'' Not rated, but contains
</P>
<P>
   nudity and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Girard's centuries-spanning saga follows the fortunes
and misfortunes of those who come in contact with the so-called Red
Violin, carved in 1681 by an Italian master. Holding the different
stories together is a present-day auction during which violin
expert Samuel L. Jackson struggles to unravel the instrument's
tragic secret. (ERG) 2 hours, 10 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I
</P>
<P>
   _ The Phantom Menace'' PG (sci-fi action/violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   Is George Lucas' new movie visually amazing? Yes. Exciting?
Sometimes. Emotionally involving? Almost never. As a technological
Mount Everest (and the Mount McKinley of marketing), ``Menace'' is
a
</P>
<P>
   remarkable achievement. Too bad writer-director Lucas left out
the gee-whiz enthusiasm of the original movies. He also left out
memorable characters. He left out the fun. (SM) 2 hours, 11
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated film with voices
</P>
<P>
   by Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver,
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Close and Nigel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's animated ``Tarzan'' really swings. This long-haired
dude confidently surfs through Africa's immense rain forest. He
glides barefoot on never-ending, moss-covered tree limbs like the
coolest Rollerblader you've ever seen. His feet never fail him. His
movie doesn't either. Both a little scary and a lot funny, kids
will no doubt lap up this movie. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 28 minutes.
B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joan Plowright,
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Smith and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Known in 1930s Florence as ``the scorpioni,'' thanks to their
collective sting, a band of British and American expatriate women
become surrogate mothers of a young boy named Luca. Based on his
autobiography, director Franco Zeffirelli's film is an uneven but
enjoyable tale of a boy growing up in Black Shirt Italy, entrusted
to a handful of Auntie Mames. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thirteenth Floor'' R (profanity, sex and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Craig Bierko,
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Mol
</P>
<P>
   and Armin Mueller-Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   A ``what is reality?'' sci-fi thriller that doesn't measure up
to earlier and better films such as ``The Matrix'' and ``Dark
City.'' It's about a modern-day computer whiz team that creates,
then walks around in, a digitized version of 1937 Los Angeles.
Murder, intrigue and too much flat acting follow. Your ultimate
warning: The movie's from some of the creative team that earlier
flubbed ``Godzilla.'' (Bob Longino) 2 hours. C
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)
40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Trippin' '' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Deon Richmond
</P>
<P>
   and Donald Adeosun Faison.
</P>
<P>
   It keeps trippin' up on its own mixed message. Deon Richmond
plays Greg, a high school senior whose plans for college keep
getting waylaid by his fantasies of living the phat life,
surrounded by gorgeous women whose sole goal in life is to show him
their breasts. The movie has flashes of charm and heart, but
they're undermined by the filmmakers' pandering to the basic
instincts of its target teen audience. (SM) 1 hour, 32 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``William Shakespeare's PG-13 (sensuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   A Midsummer
</P>
<P>
   Night's Dream''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, magic doesn't happen. A sexy cast, a classic play,
the
</P>
<P>
   sensuous Tuscany countryside. How could ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' misfire? Blame it on director Michael Hoffman, whose
</P>
<P>
   picturesque but pedestrian approach dims the sparkle of William
Shakespeare's script. (SM) At metro theaters. 1 hour, 55 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Winslow Boy'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nigel Hawthorne
</P>
<P>
   and Jeremy Northam.
</P>
<P>
   David Mamet proves an unexpectedly good match for Terence
Rattigan's 1946 play loosely based on a true story of an Edwardian
patriarch's risky and costly fight to clear his 13-year-old son's
name when the boy is expelled from a prestigious school for
stealing pocket change. Mamet brings care, thoughtfulness and even
a theatrical spark to the material. Nigel Hawthorne and Jeremy
Northam lead an excellent cast. (ERG) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Jill Vejnoska) 41 minutes. B-

 &HT;    Comedian Adam Sandler pitches yet another winning goofball
character
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two ways to look at Adam Sandler. He's either the poor
man's Cary Grant or the white-collar crowd's long-lost fourth
Stooge.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of stokes his box office potency, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Here you have ``Big Daddy,'' Sandler's latest sure-fire
money-maker. It nimbly ties together elements from his successful
date movie ``The Wedding Singer'' (boyish innocence and charm to
woo the women in the audience) and his even more successful yukfest
``The Waterboy'' (scatological scatting just for the boys). Throw
in an itty-bitty kid for Sandler to pal around with and you have
the makings of a mack-daddy movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' does work much of the time. It's light on its feet
and full of jokes that often hit their marks (especially if you
don't set the bar too high). Best of all is Sandler himself. He's
one smooth talker, whether he's connecting with his pint-size
co-star (played by 6-year-old identical twins) or cozying up to his
latest love interest (``Chasing Amy's'' Joey Lauren Adams).
</P>
<P>
   Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a law school grad who's chosen to
spend his life watching cartoons and drooling milk while snarfing
down cereal. Oh, and he works part time at a New York toll booth.
</P>
<P>
   It's all the sweet sloth of life until his girlfriend bolts and
little Julian (played by Cole and Dylan Sprouse) shows up at his
door.
</P>
<P>
   Julian's story is a tremendously sad tale, and one that ``Big
Daddy'' pretty much lets slide right by. Suffice it to say that
Sandler's character ends up as the tyke's caretaker _ and the
comedy kicks into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   When a scared Julian wets the bed, Sonny's answer is to lay a
few newspapers over the sheets. When the kid can't sleep without a
night light, Sonny hooks one up: a neon sign that reads ``Live
Nudes.''
</P>
<P>
   He teaches Julian how to properly fold a pizza slice before
devouring it, how to master wrestling's sleeper hold, how to
urinate in public.
</P>
<P>
   It would be criminal if it wasn't all put together so darned
cutely.
</P>
<P>
   Stoking the shenanigans are numerous gay jokes, too many barbs
about Hooters restaurants, and respectable support from a talented
cast that includes Rob Schneider, Jon Stewart and Steve Buscemi.
Counterbalancing it all is Sandler's artistry in depicting Sonny's
sweet-guy attempts to win Layla (Adams) as his new girlfriend. Face
it, he's a pro.
</P>
<P>
   As Julian says in baby talk, reciting word for word Sonny's
tutelage in attracting women: ``Initiating the conversation is half
the battle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler and Joey Lauren Adams. Directed by Dennis
Dugan. Rated PG-13 for language. At metro theaters.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: He's all fun and
</P>
<P>
   games.

 &HT;    Not at all ideal: Wilde with too little wit
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' is not an ideal introduction to Oscar
Wilde, playwright. Which probably explains why his ``The Importance
of Being Earnest'' or ``Lady Windermere's Fan'' are more frequently
revived. However, it was a long-running and unexpectedly successful
revival of ``Husband'' _ staged by Peter Brook in the mid-1990s _
that reportedly inspired director Oliver Parker to tackle the piece
on film.
</P>
<P>
   Wilde purists will note a few alterations. Everyone else will
probably wonder why Parker bothered.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' is a tale of politics, marriage and
morality in 1895 London. Rising political star Sir Robert Chiltern
(Jeremy Northam) and his high-minded activist wife, Gertrude (Cate
Blanchett), are routinely described by the press as ``what is best
in English public life.'' But a snake has entered their
late-Victorian paradise. She's Mrs. Laura Cheveley (Julianne
Moore), a visitor from Vienna. She wants Sir Robert to do her a
little favor. Namely, support a shady Argentine canal scheme in
which she is heavily invested. Should he refuse, Mrs. Cheveley has
a certain incriminating letter exposing a youthful indiscretion
that helped Sir Robert amass his wealth and reputation.
</P>
<P>
   One incriminating note leads to another. Thus, the complications
and misunderstandings mushroom as we ponder the following:
</P>
<P>
   (A) Will Sir Robert yield to Lady Cheveley's blackmail?
</P>
<P>
   (B) What will Gertrude, his no-less-ideal wife, think of him
should his sullied past be revealed?
</P>
<P>
   (C) Which Wildean witticism will their good friend and
self-appointed social gadfly Arthur Goring (Rupert Everett) drop
next? (Sample: ``To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong
romance.'')
</P>
<P>
   What's onscreen is a well-acted, very well-appointed period
piece that becomes more stifling and less engaging as it goes
along. That's not to say you won't enjoy hearing Arthur tell his
fusty, patrician father (John Wood) that he talks about serious
things only on the first Tuesday of every month. Or that drama
lovers won't appreciate the not-so-subtle theatrical in-jokes (at
one point, everyone attends the London premiere of ``Earnest'' and
hears the playwright's celebrated curtain speech).
</P>
<P>
   But in a world where our own chief executive can carry on with
an intern in the inner sanctums of the White House, ``An Ideal
Husband'' can't help but seem a bit dated. Idealistic, perhaps, and
even admirable in its staunch support of public and private
responsibility. But dated nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even that might be less of a problem if Parker had
employed an aura of arch theatricality. Instead, he opts for a
humanistic realism that stymies even such good actors as Blanchett
(``Elizabeth'') and Northam (``The Winslow Boy''). And poor Minnie
Driver, who plays Sir Robert's younger sister, is a disaster. She's
supposed to be saucy and provocative but comes off as mannered and
unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   Everett is luckier. He has the most screen time (he may, in
fact, be the ideal connubial partner of the title _ a juicy irony
because he poses as a confirmed bachelor) and gets the good lines.
He strikes exactly the sort of playful, raised-eyebrow tone the
rest of the production lacks. And Moore is simply wonderful.
Punctuating her every dastardly deed with a friendly twinkle, she's
the most Machiavellian screen female this side of Bette Davis in
``The Little Foxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rupert Everett, Cate Blanchett, Jeremy Northam and
Julianne Moore. Rated PG-13 for brief nudity and sexuality. At
Garden Hills and Mansell Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Less than ideal.

 &HT;    `Red Violin' the sound behind artistic impulse
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francois Girard's best-known movie, 1993's ``Thirty-Two Short
Films About Glenn Gould,'' was as playful, spare and sophisticated
as his most recent one, ``The Red Violin,'' is florid, expansive
and emotional.
</P>
<P>
   A centuries-spanning saga, it follows the fortunes _ and, more
often, misfortunes _ of those who come into contact with a violin
carved in 1681 by an Italian master named Bussotti (Carlo Cecchi).
</P>
<P>
   First, Girard establishes an intriguing framing device. We begin
in the present, where, at a chichi Montreal auction house, a
Stradivarius knocked down for $1.9 million is merely the second
most important piece being offered. The ``star of the evening,'' as
the auctioneer says, is the so-called Red Violin, an instrument so
perfectly conceived that an expert (Samuel L. Jackson) called in to
authenticate the items has become obsessed with it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the auction isn't the only framing device. Skip back
three centuries to Italy, where an ancient servant is reading the
tarot cards for her mistress, Anna (Irene Grazioli), Bussotti's
very lovely and very pregnant wife. But is it the woman's future
being read _ or that of the violin her husband is so feverishly
trying to finish before the birth of their child?
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Red Violin wends its way from hand to hand, from
country to country. It finds a home at a 17th-century Austrian
monastery, where it's picked up by an orphaned prodigy. It also
ends up with Gypsies, thieves and between the naked legs of
Frederick Pope (Jason Flemyng), a 19th-century British virtuoso
whose tempestuous affair with a Victorian author (Greta Scacchi) is
one of the sillier segments. Pope's Chinese manservant (Stuart Ong)
returns to his homeland with the instrument, where, several decades
later, the Red Violin collides with Mao's Cultural Revolution
before landing in Montreal, where Jackson finally unravels its
tragic secret.
</P>
<P>
   The different stories vary in quality, from the near-sublime
(the Italian section) to the ridiculous (the aforementioned Pope
pulp). But the one thing that remains constant is the inherent
intrigue of Girard's central conceit. The Red Violin is as much
seeker as sought. There are those through whose hands it passes
without leaving a mark. But there are also those for whom the
violin is a destiny in waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Using an inanimate object to tie together a series of short
stories was once a hugely popular construct. In the 1940s, ``Tales
of Manhattan'' followed a tailcoat. In the '60s, it was ``The
Yellow Rolls Royce.'' But underneath this familiar structure,
there's a surprising ferocity. The violin's secret creates, not a
curse necessarily, but a fate. It's a bit like Michael Powell's
1948 ballet wonder ``The Red Shoes,'' a reminder of the
unquenchable chaos that flirts with all true artists. To forestall
the outraged e-mail, no, ``The Red Violin'' is not a masterpiece
like ``The Red Shoes,'' but its power comes from a similar impulse:
an attempt to understand the creative/destructive fulcrum in which
artistic genius resides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin'' will be too melodramatic for some tastes, too
schematic for others. But anyone who's ever felt a chill at the
revelations of an overturned tarot card will hear this film's inner
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by Francois Girard. Not
rated, but contains nudity and sexuality. At metro theaters. 2
hours, 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A sweeping symphony, with some parts better than
others.

FTC WARNS CONSUMERS ABOUT MISLEADING INTERNET HEALTH PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission unveiled a consumer
education campaign Thursday designed to warn the public about
misleading health information and unproven cures touted on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also cited four companies for deceptively marketing
products like magnets and shark cartilage capsules over the
Internet as effective treatments for cancer and other serious
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet offers a powerful tool for finding health
information,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau
of Consumer Protection. ``Our survey of web sites found that too
many make deceptive, unproven and fraudulent claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year more than 22 million Americans sought health and
medical information on the Internet, making health and medical
information one of the most popular targets of online searchers.
</P>
<P>
   While the FTC continually monitors the Internet for bogus health
claims, Bernstein said the agency cannot keep up with the hundreds
of web sites that promote fraudulent products.
</P>
<P>
   One such site touted shark cartilage capsules as a ``tumor
inhibitor'' and offered the product for $14.50. The company
marketing the product, Body Systems Technology, Inc., said that
studies proved ``that shark cartilage is an effective cancer
treatment.'' The firm cited a 1992 study by a Texas doctor claiming
that tumors in eight breast cancer patients significantly shrank in
size because the patients consumed shark cartilage. The FTC later
found that claim and other studies cited by Body Systems as lacking
``credible scientific evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein recommended that people use government Internet web
sites that provide a so-called gateway with links to reputable
health and medical web sites operated by universities, medical
clinics and organizations like the American Heart Association.
Operators of gateway web sites, such as the FTC, decide which links
to allow on their web site and thus can control the type of
information people can access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Separating what's good on the Internet from the bad or the
ugly isn't easy,'' said Mary Jo Deering, director of health
communication at the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   The Health and Human Services Department operates a gateway web
site with links to more than 5,000 reliable sites containing health
and medical information, according to Deering.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet address of the HHS site is www.healthfinder.gov.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC says consumers can also access reliable health
information through the FTC's Internet web site (www.ftc.gov). That
address will link consumers to such web sites as those operated by
the American Cancer Society, the Mayo Clinic and the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the FTC surveyed 800 Internet web sites that contained
questionable promotions for products or services purporting to help
cure, treat or prevent cancer, heart disease, AIDS, diabetes,
arthritis and multiple sclerosis. The agency then e-mailed each web
site operator warning them that their claims must be backed up by
scientific information and that disseminating false or
unsubstantiated claims would violate federal law.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the web sites have either been taken down or
the site operators have removed the unproven claims.
</P>
<P>
   The four companies charged by the FTC are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Arthritis Pain Care Center of Arlington, Texas, for claiming
that a product called CMO, which contains a fatty acid, was
effective in treating arthritis. CMO was also advertised as a
treatment for cancer, multiple sclerosis and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   _ Body Systems Technology, Inc. of Casselberry, Fla., for
promoting shark cartilage capsules and other products as effective
treatments for cancer, HIV, AIDS and arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Magnetic Therapeutic Technologies, Inc. of Irving, Texas, for
marketing magnetic devices as an effective treatment for a variety
of medical problems and diseases including cancer and high blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pain Stops Here! of Baiting Hallow, N.Y., for also marketing
magnetic devices as an effective treatment for various medical
conditions including liver disease and arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   In all four cases the companies agreed to stop promoting
products using the unproven health claims. Body Systems Technology
was required to make refunds to customers who previously purchased
the shark cartilage capsules.

 &HT;    BILL WOULD LET SOME VETERANS GET MEDICARE TREATMENT AT VA
CENTERS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Senate panel agreed Thursday to allow veterans to
receive Medicare coverage at eight Department of Veterans Affairs
facilities beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, which passed the Senate Finance Committee with
one dissenting vote, about 4 million veterans nationwide would be
eligible for Medicare coverage in VA facilities in selected
demonstration areas. They are those who are eligible for Medicare,
but who don't receive VA care now because they do not have a
service-connected disability or have incomes above certain limits.
</P>
<P>
   The secretaries of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and
Health and Human Services would select the demonstration sites.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining access to quality health care for our veterans is of
tremendous importance,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the
committee chairman. ``This (bill) substantially improves veterans'
access to the VA health system.''
</P>
<P>
   The only dissent came from Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who said he
agreed with the intent of the bill, but opposed the mechanism for
paying for the services.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would reduce Medicare's coverage of hospitals' bad
debts for care of Medicare patients from 55 percent to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt by Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., to alter the financing
mechanism was defeated on a 9-11 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said he hoped to vote for the bill on final Senate passage
if a different way could be found to pay for the $50 million-a-year
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also contained a provision to extend for one year,
until 2001, the law that allows military retirees _ those who did
not serve in combat but retired from the armed services _ to obtain
Medicare coverage in VA facilities.

RENAISSANCE FOR A QUIRKY DESIGNER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jean Royere has never been a household name, until
now. This French decorator, furniture and lighting designer, who
lived from 1902 to 1981, was a great success in his day. But he was
nearly forgotten after death.
</P>
<P>
   A profoundly modest man, he never sought fame, and he never
thought his designs were immortal. ``Why would you want to
resuscitate works that belong to the past?'' he once asked an
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   But that is exactly what is happening. His whimsical furniture
and lighting designs from the 1940s and 50s _ roly-poly Polar Bear
sofa, goat-fur-covered chairs and coffee tables with spider legs _
are suddenly in great demand.
</P>
<P>
   Royere is back. On May 11 at Christie's in London, a pair of
upholstered arm chairs that he designed in the early 50s went for
$137,000.
</P>
<P>
   Through July 30 Galerie de Beyrie in SoHo, is presenting a show
of several works from an apartment interior Royere designed in 1950
on the French Riviera. ``To find a whole apartment is a dream,''
said Stephane de Beyrie. The furniture includes beds with
wave-shaped, white-lacquered headboards; a tufted pink couch
nicknamed the Bordello sofa, and a nine-foot-long mahogany
sideboard with white brass birdlike decorations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A piece like this sideboard is really serious, but the brasses
aren't,'' said his wife, Catherine de Beyrie. ``They make you
laugh.'`
</P>
<P>
   A strikingly modern metal sofa commissioned for the apartment's
veranda predates by years a similar-looking chair by Eero Saarinen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of fashion, Royere came after Jean Prouve and
Charlotte Perriand,'' Mrs. de Beyrie said. ``Now he is just as
popular, and not just in New York, also in Beverly Hills and Palm
Beach. The movie industry loves Royere.''
</P>
<P>
   Joann DeLorenzo of the DeLorenzo gallery concurred. ``Our
clients are Royere crazy,'' she said. ``Royere is becoming the new
Prouve. But he was much more sophisticated than Prouve.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris the Galerie Jacques Lacoste recently sold two-thirds of
its current Royere show the day it opened (it is on view through
July 2), even though prices ranged from a $15,000 Egg armchair of
1951 to a $100,000 Polar Bear couch and chair set in bright purple
from 1946. Lacoste said most of his buyers at the show have been
French.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French were late, but they are finally getting it,'' he
said. ``What makes Royere different is that he never applied
decoration. The materials are the decoration.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 7 the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris is mounting a
Royere exhibition. ``There is so much interest in French 1940s
design now,'' said Bruce Newman of Newel Art Galleries in
Manhattan. ``I've been buying Royere for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Royere came from a distinguished French family and became a
banker after studying the classics at Cambridge. In 1931, at age
29, he quit banking to become an interior designer. ``I always had
a flair for decorating,'' he recalled in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   He apprenticed with Pierre Gouffe, a furniture maker in Paris,
and soon became the artistic designer for Gouffe's contemporary
line. In 1934 Royere won a contest to design a brasserie for the
Hotel Carlton on the Champs-Elysees, and in 1939 he showed his work
at the prestigious Salon de la Societe des Artistes-Decorateurs in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was greatly influenced by Le Corbusier and Charlotte
Perriand,'' Lacoste said. ``But he always chose his own personal
path, somewhere between modernism and traditionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also brave. During World War II he was able to use his
metier to hide some Jews and a few English aviators who had been
shot down in France.
</P>
<P>
   He opened his own company in 1944. After the war, he moved to a
large space on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore. ``In this period it's
totally couture furniture,'' said Alan Moss, who has a gallery just
east of SoHo. It is difficult to mix Royere with other furniture
designs, Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   But Christine Grajales of Gallery 1950 in Manhattan disagrees:
``I think it's easy to mix Royere with contemporary art as well as
18th-century furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Royere loved to travel. He set up an office in Cairo in 1947,
and one of his first commissions was a private apartment for King
Farouk. He opened bureaus in Beirut, Tehran, and Sao Paulo. ( Moss
is selling for $65,000 a red brocade sofa that Royere designed in
Beruit. He also has a pair of Royere chairs covered in fake fur.)
</P>
<P>
   He worked for King Hussein of Jordan, the shah of Iran and the
shah's family. He designed the Senate building in Tehran, the Hotel
Semiramis in Cairo, the Bristol in Beirut, and the Philadelphia
Club in Amman. In 1953 he redesigned the Paris restaurant Fouquet's
on the Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   At the very end of his life he moved to the United States, where
he died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Royere was full of opinions that did not endear him to his
competitors. In 1963, for example, he wrote: ``I'm against
furniture. I think we should eliminate it as much as possible.''
The man who set up design companies all over the world declared,
``I am against decoration because everything that is strictly
decorative goes out of fashion too quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was he the member of any camp. ``I'll never be attached to
one school or one theory,'' he said. ``The words `functional,'
`style,' `contemporary,' have no meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-taught, Royere said all he was trying to do was create a
``harmonious spectacle to enchant the eye, rejoice the heart and
elevate the spirit.''

<P>
   IZBICA, Yugoslavia _ Churned earth has replaced the neat rows of
mounds that told the world a mass grave was here.
</P>
<P>
   A few detached body parts may remain in the clods of dirt, along
with the errant shoe or muddy blanket once used to wrap a body. But
gone are the corpses, the most compelling evidence of a heinous
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were removed to destroy the evidence, to destroy the
facts,'' said Sadik Gjemajli (pronounced, ``Jie-MY-lee), the local
commander of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Izbica (pronounced, Is-BEE-tsa) massacre, in
which more than 140 people are said to have been executed, is one
of seven in the four-count indictment against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and four cohorts for war crimes in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Gjemajli and other eyewitnesses said Serb soldiers returned here
three days before the Yugoslav army agreed on June 10 to withdraw
troops and spent two days digging up the graves, removing the
corpses, and then setting afire a wagon load of grave markers and
blankets that had wrapped the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The grave robbers were trying to rob the world of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, that justice will be
terribly difficult to attain even where there has not been
intentional evidence tampering. There is ample opportunity for
evidence to be ruined simply by the passage of time and intrusion
of innocent people to crime scenes that have no guard, no fences or
even any markings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, confusing conditions of continued danger, bad
communications and hard travel contribute to delays in
investigations by The Hague tribunal on war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia, the body that indicted Milosevic and four of his
leading cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic teams began probing through alleged sites in Kosovo
last week, including from Britain's Scotland Yard, America's FBI
and Canada's Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   But they are the second stage of the investigative process,
according to Paul Risley, spokesman for The Hague tribunal, while
thus far the crucial first stage hasn't even been carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each of these cases, we have soldiers secure the sites,''
Risley said, speaking of NATO troops in the KFOR, or Kosovo Force,
taking over the seven sites of alleged atrocities listed in the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a limited window of opportunity for (collecting) the
surface evidence -- tire marks, footprints, bloodstains,'' he said,
emphasizing the need for quick forensic assessments at protected
sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern Kosovo town of Djakovica, the crumbling house
where an estimated 20 women, children and elderly people were
burned alive still sat open last week to the elements and to
intruders. The attack on this modest home on the night of April 1
also is listed in the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor poked through the charred remains of the house,
picking up pieces of human bone with a pair of pliers, just out of
curiosity. One piece was potentially important as evidence that
might help identify a victim -- a piece of jawbone with a tooth
still attached. Other visitors urged him not to disturb the site,
and certainly not to take away any of the gruesome mementos he
inexplicably was hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Less grisly artifacts are popular souvenirs, such as spent
bullet casings that also could be useful to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Nor at mid-week was there any sign of KFOR protecting anything
within miles of Izbica, a village in the central Kosovo region that
was a KLA stronghold and was thoroughly routed by Serb troops. It
is a place reached after winding down rocky dirt roads, where cows
may as easily wander through the remnants of mass graves as through
adjacent grasslands.
</P>
<P>
   With the bodies of dead villagers missing, any evidence left
gains in importance.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the victims clearly have been moving through the
site, if only to replace grave markers bowled over by Serb backhoes
-- despite the fact that the bodies are gone. Tire marks by now
have been largely mixed with the treads of tractors and mushed
under heavy pelts of rain.
</P>
<P>
   The corpses would be the best evidence, holding bullets that
might be identified as Yugoslav military issue and other signs
indicating the manner of death. And of course, the identification
-- and even the numbers -- of the victims now is a matter of
hearsay, based on lists the KLA and villagers compiled before they
buried their friends and loved ones. There also is a video-tape of
some stages of the burials.
</P>
<P>
   The graves first appeared in NATO spy satellite photographs in
early April, and were publicized as evidence of Serb atrocities.
That alone might have been sufficient to provoke efforts to erase
proof of the crime, but then additional publicity drew more
attention to it.

   In mid-April Cox Newspapers interviewed villagers who said they
buried the bodies after a Serb massacre, and the video-tape
surfaced later and was shown on CNN news broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Izbica is not the only place Serb forces are reported to have
dug up and removed corpses. Risley said the tribunal has received a
number of such reports, about Yugoslav authorities saying their
forces discovered the mass graves and identified the corpses as
``victims of terrorist attacks'' which the Serb troops then removed
and humanely gave a decent burial in individual, marked graves.

   ``You can see this as a kind of very sophisticated effort to
hide the evidence,'' he said. ``That in itself would be a specific
kind of war crime committed by the military units.''

   Additional indictments against other aggressors and possibly
more charges against Milosevic are expected, he said.

SPOTLIGHT ON A NEW ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSY MISDEMEANOR ELLIOTT: ``Da Real World'' (Gold
Mind/EastWest), and THE CHEMICAL BROTHERS: ``Surrender''
(Astralwerks). Two of the finest party albums of 1997 were Ms.
Elliott's future-minded rap and rhythm-and-blues debut, ``Supa Dupa
Fly,'' and the Chemical Brothers' big-beat electronic rump-shaker,
``Dig Your Own Hole.''
</P>
<P>
   But the party has ended for both of these acts: in the
intervening years, their style has been widely imitated and, partly
in response, both have forced themselves forward, darkening and
mellowing their sound, indulging in many (perhaps too many)
collaborations and, in the case of the Chemical Brothers, sampling
Ms. Elliott's music.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elliott, one of the most successful black female producers
and songwriters, focuses on reclamation here: not just in trying
(half-successfully) to put a positive spin on disrespectful female
slurs but also in being an aggressor, with males as victim.
</P>
<P>
   Produced with Timbaland, the songs are full of minor-key string
samples, ominous rapping and staggered, stuttering beats. But the
rapping, the collaborations (particularly with Eminem) and the
arrangements are uneven, resulting in a pretty good album that one
often wants to be better than pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   The third Chemical Brothers album comes on strong with the
robotic bleep-and-grind of ``Music: Response,'' which samples an
Elliott-Timbaland production, before detouring into new wave (with
Bernard Sumner of New Order), Beatles psychedelia (featuring,
predictably, Noel Gallagher of Oasis) and ambient drone (with Mazzy
Star).
</P>
<P>
   Though fans expecting this pair of English DJs to kickstart a
party with ``Surrender'' may be disappointed, those expecting a
varied mix tape won't be. -

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dame Judi Dench, who won a Tony for her leading performance in
``Amy's View,'' returned to England Thursday to tend to the health
of her husband, who was ill.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Boneau, a spokesman for the play, said that Dame Judi
would miss performances at least through the weekend and that the
date of her return was uncertain. Her understudy, Jennifer Harmon,
will perform in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Dame Judi said: ``I am devastated to disappoint
anyone who came to see me in the play, but I must be with my family
at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Boneau said that Dame Judi was told late Wednesday afternoon
that the medical condition of her husband, Michael Williams, had
worsened. Williams, an actor, has been hospitalized with pleurisy,
an inflammation of the lining of the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Judi missed Wednesday evening's performance to board a
flight for London.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 250 of nearly 1,100 ticketholders remained to see the
play on Wednesday night after they were told that Dame Judi would
not appear. One ticketholder said the scene in the lobby of the
Barrymore Theater was chaotic after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Boneau said ticketholders for future performances who want
refunds should either return the tickets to the Barrymore box
office or send them to P.O. Box 998, Times Square Station, New
York, N.Y. 10108.
</P>
<P>
   Making the Shoe Fit
</P>
<P>
   Think you've seen ``Closer''? Think again.
</P>
<P>
   The play, at the Music Box Theater, has had some tweaking in
recent weeks with the departure of the English actress Natasha
Richardson and the arrival of the American actress Polly Draper.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Ms. Draper took over the role of Anna, a beautiful
photographer caught in a savage sexual food chain in modern-day
London. But now Anna is no longer a Brit with a troubled past but
an expatriate American. (The troubled past remains.)
</P>
<P>
   The playwright and director, Patrick Marber, said the identity
shift was made in part to help American audiences identify with the
play, which was one of a flood of British imports in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the play to be accessible to an American audience, as
much about their society as about our society,'' Marber said from
London. The changes, he said, may make the play ``feel a little
less foreign perhaps.''
</P>
<P>
   The nationality switch was made with the addition of a handful
of lines in the play's second scene and the deletion of several
British colloquialisms later in the script. For example, where the
old Anna had said ``Romantic tosh,'' to dismiss a lover's
statement, the new Anna says, ``You're just romanticizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Also altered is the play's ending, which has reverted to the one
seen in an earlier production in London's West End. Previously in
New York, the play ended with Anna alone onstage. Now another
character is left, providing what Marber called a ``more
bittersweet'' ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's correct for the tone of the play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It may also answer some critics who have said the West End
version was more impressive than its New York incarnation.
``Closer'' received mixed reviews, but has returned about 80
percent of its original investment, its producers say. Sales have
slowed since the summer doldrums took hold.
</P>
<P>
   While rewrites are de rigueur in rehearsals and previews,
opening night usually marks the end of substantial work on a play's
text. But Marber said the changes were one of the benefits of being
both playwright and director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I perceive the play as a living text,'' he said. ``And if I'm
the director, I'm at liberty to do whatever I want with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Type-Casting
</P>
<P>
   Forget the fact that Linda Hart has black hair and Bunny
Weinberger is, in the words of her creator, Albert Innaurato, a
``hepatitis blonde.'' Ignore, too, that while Ms. Hart is a petite
120 pounds, Bunny is a good 160.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference between Ms. Hart (the actress) and Ms.
Weinberger (her character) is that while Bunny has a mouth like a
sailor, Ms. Hart says she hasn't said a dirty word in as long as
she can remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my entire life, I have not cursed as much as I do in one
night at Second Stage,'' Ms. Hart said with a laugh. ``My friends
are amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   They aren't the only ones. For the last month, Ms. Hart has been
donning a fat suit and astounding audiences with her portrayal of
the coarsely hysterical Bunny in Second Stage's revival of
Innaurato's ``Gemini.'' The play's producers, who have posted an
official closing for this Sunday, are mulling an extension.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas native, Ms. Hart is the daughter of two evangelical
ministers and has nine other relatives who are preachers. Her first
seven years were spent on the road in a tent revival, and her
family's firm no drink, no smoke, no curse ethos remains part of
her life.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had to think twice before taking on Bunny's bad
self, but that it was a lesson from the pulpit that keyed her into
the character. ``You don't go up there without knowing you're going
to go for it,'' she said. ``It's a real leap of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ Fiona Shaw, Tony Randall and Isabella Rosellini are confirmed
as readers in the world premiere of ``The Days Before'' by Robert
Wilson, playing July 7-10 at Lincoln Center Festival '99. The piece
is based on an Umberto Eco novel about a sailor, a shipwreck and
some subsequent surrealism.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marian Seldes, a recent Tony nominee, will appear in the Irish
Repertory's production of ``Dear Liar,'' a comedy based on the love
letters of George Bernard Shaw. It opens July 22.
</P>
<P>
   _ Betty Buckley is heading the cast of a September production of
``Camino Real'' at Hartford Stage. Michael Wilson directs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Valarie Pettiford, nominated for a Tony for her performance in
``Fosse,'' will leave that show in mid-July to play opposite Chita
Rivera in the London production of ``Chicago.''

SHORT NEWS ITEMS ON THE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Compliments Of a Friend &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At his death on Feb. 1 at 91, the philanthropist Paul Mellon
left the National Gallery of Art in Washington the largest gift in
its history: $75 million in cash plus more than 100 pictures, many
of them masterpieces by artists like van Gogh, Manet, Cezanne,
Monet and Renoir.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not all Mellon intended to leave the museum. This
week it announced that it was receiving 73 additional works from
Mellon, which were not listed in his will because they were not
part of his estate. These were left to the gallery through a trust.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the latest gift is Degas' ``Scene From Steeplechase:
The Fallen Jockey'' (1866), which was shown at the National Gallery
in 1998 as part of its exhibition ``Degas at the Races.'' It joins
18 others by Degas in the gallery's collection, of which 5 were
given by Mellon. The gift also includes 37 Degas sculptures: 29 in
wax, 4 in plaster or mixed materials and 4 bronzes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Degas holdings are now extraordinary,'' said Earl A.
Powell III, director of the gallery. ``With this latest gift we
have 49 Degas waxes.'' The gallery plans to exhibit them together
in a Degas room in the West Building, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other works in this latest bequest is a Stubbs
painting, ``White Poodle in a Punt,'' (circa 1780), which had been
promised to the gallery at the time of its 50th anniversary in
1991. There are also five oils on board or panel by John Frederick
Peto, the late-19th-century American artist.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mellon was a longtime trustee of the gallery; his father,
the financier Andrew W. Mellon, helped found the institution. Paul
Mellon had previously left the gallery more than 900 works,
including many Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings.
</P>
<P>
   His father paid for the Gallery's West Building; Paul Mellon and
his sister, Ailsa Mellon Bruce, gave nearly two-thirds of the funds
to build the museum's East Building, which was designed by I.M. Pei
and completed in 1978 for about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mellon had told the gallery about most of the works he
planned to donate, but the final transfer of property occurred only
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no real surprises,'' Powell said. ``But this is
confirmation of a remarkable gift by a remarkable collector and
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The gallery is planning a Mellon memorial exhibition in the
fall. ``It will include a selection of things, highlights,'' Powell
said. ``We can't show everything. If we did, we'd strip the
gallery.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Rush for Rauschenberg &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The competition is getting stiffer among leading museums in the
United States for great works by the country's leading artists _
names like Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns _
as both the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan and the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art make serious efforts to strengthen their
permanent collections.
</P>
<P>
   Take the work of Rauschenberg. This week the Modern in New York
announced that it had acquired four important works by him, three
from the 1950s and one from 1998. A year ago the San Francisco
museum bought a group of 14 works from his own collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``While these acquisitions may crisscross, they are not
related,'' said Glenn D. Lowry, director of the New York museum.
``I'm one who believes competition is healthy. It's good for the
artists, the public and for museums.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowry said this recent acquisition represented ``the pendulum
swinging from the early art of the century to the late part.'' He
added, ``We want to concentrate on post-1950, giving the collection
the same depth coming out of this century as going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now Rauschenberg's work was not so well represented in the
Modern's collections. But the addition of ``Factum II'' (1957) is
considered a coup for the museum. Although not as sculptural as
many of his combine series, the work is composed of found images,
scraps of writing and other paper or cloth elements, all on a
canvas that he has also painted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Factum II'' belonged to Hubert Neumann, an investor whose
20th-century art collection was begun by his father, Morton G.
Neumann, who made his fortune in the mail-order business.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Neumann has been selling portions of his collection
recently; in November Sotheby's sold a group of works that included
a 1909 Picasso. For years auction houses, collectors and museums
have been trying to buy ``Factum II,'' considered one of the stars
of the Neumann collection. While the Modern declined to discuss the
price it paid, experts estimated it in the region of $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Factum II'' was conceived as a direct companion to ``Factum
I,'' which belongs to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles
but is being lent to the Modern from Thursday through Oct. 5. The
two will be displayed together for the first time in decades, when
the Modern hangs its new '50s Rauschenbergs in its third-floor
painting and sculpture galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The other two '50s Rauschenbergs acquired by the Modern are
``Untitled (Asheville Citizen)'' from 1952, a two-panel painting
bought directly from the artist, and ``Untitled'' (1953), a
sculpture sold to the museum by Pace Wildenstein. ``Asheville
Citizen'' is one of the most austere Rauschenberg works, dominated
by a black matte surface.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture, one of a series, is a cubic box, seven and
one-eighth inches on each side, fashioned from thick used boards,
which contains a slightly smaller cube of transparent silk,
stretched on a frame.
</P>
<P>
   The more recent Rauschenberg is ``Bookworms Harvest'' (1998), a
promised gift from Jerry I. Speyer, a trustee of the Modern. It
incorporates computer-manipulated photographs on paper. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fragment of the Renaissance &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There has been a very last-minute addition to ``The Treasury of
St. Francis of Assisi,'' an exhibition of Italian Renaissance art
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that opened on March 16 and runs
through Sunday: the fragment of a small angel's head by Giotto.
</P>
<P>
   The fragment was one of the largest of the 50,000 recovered
after the 1997 earthquake collapsed two sections of vaulting in the
upper church of the Basilica of San Francesco in Assisi. It was
also one of the few to show a recognizable figure.
</P>
<P>
   But it took months of negotiating to get it to New York,
officials at the Met said, because the Italian cultural ministry
was reluctant to send a fragment so frail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smallness of the fragment highlights the complexity of the
restoration, given that it is one of the largest pieces,'' said Pia
Palladino, a research associate in the Met's Robert Lehman
Collection. ``The colors are remarkably fresh and brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   The fragment will be displayed next to the Franciscan tree, the
tapestry commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV. It will travel to the
Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco for the show's
opening there on July 15.  &QL;

A DIRECTOR WHO LEFT HIS HEART IS ON MADISON AVENUE 
MAKING A CRITIC PAY 
WITH OFFENSE FOR ALL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Vt. )   (nk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's Hollywood's version of a man-bites-dog story: Kinka
Usher, a highly successful television commercial director, has just
finished his first feature film, ``Mystery Men,'' which Universal
will release on July 30, but he doesn't really want to direct
movies.
</P>
<P>
   How's that?
</P>
<P>
   The world of commercials and music videos is Hollywood's farm
system for movie directors. People ranging from Ridley Scott
(``Blade Runner'' and ``Thelma and Louise'') to Michael Bay
(``Armageddon'') earned their spurs making commercials, and the
studios regularly comb the ranks of commercial directors looking
for the next Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   For the studios it is a source of relatively cheap talent with a
presumably fresh perspective, while some critics have complained
that it has filled theaters with movies that are fast-paced,
visually arresting and hollow. But for the aspiring directors, the
offers are like professional catnip. Everyone, it seems, wants to
be in motion pictures, and the directors are generally happy to
dump their running-shoe and soft-drink sponsors for a shot at
Hollywood glamour.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone except Usher, who is, by his own admission, a devotee
of the television commercial process. ``I'm an adman,'' he said.
``I like the freedom and the autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   His clients have included Pepsi, Nike and Miller Lite, and last
year he won the Directors Guild's commercial director of the year
award. He said he believes that many ad people who have succumbed
to the lure of films are ruining Hollywood with movies that are
often soulless amusements.
</P>
<P>
   Given his visibility in the industry, he said, he has been
approached several times over the years about directing movies but
always said no. And he was unenthusiastic when he was first sent
the script for ``Mystery Men,'' a superhero sendup, roughly in the
same genre as ``Men in Black,'' based on a comic book series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was boring,'' Usher said. ``However, the premise
was great. It was about a bunch of lousy superheroes who believe
they are just a break away from being real superheroes.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked out a deal with Universal and assembled a striking
ensemble cast, including Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, William H.
Macy, Geoffrey Rush, Greg Kinnear, Paul Reubens (a k a Pee-wee
Herman) and Hank Azaria. The well-meaning but daffy heroes, who
strive to save Champion City, use weapons like a bowling ball,
forks and a shovel. One of the heroes can make himself invisible,
but only when no one is looking.
</P>
<P>
   Usher said he played it straight, emphasizing the sincere desire
of these misfits to do good, to give them some depth. ``Most of the
movies made by commercial directors are heavy on visuals and thin
on content,'' Usher said. ``I don't want to be part of that. I was
very cognizant of showing that I know how to work with character.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience, Usher said, was a delight, and he is finishing
the sound dubbing on the movie. And yet, he said, it has only made
him eager to return to his core business. He added that he was not
looking for another film, but conceded that he might be tempted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Usher said, ``the more you say no in this town,
the more people want to work with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Making a Critic Pay
</P>
<P>
   Call it an actor's ultimate revenge: William H. Macy, the actor
and sometime writer, has helped write a script about a movie critic
who turns out to be a philandering, larcenous murderer and, best of
all, gets caught and suffers for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, revenge was not my aim,'' Macy, vacationing in Vermont,
said of the film, ``A Travesty.'' He wrote the script with Steven
Schachter for the TNT cable network. But he was quick to add,
``It's a morality tale about paying up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Travesty,'' whose title may be changed later, is based on a
Donald Westlake novel, and it is scheduled to be shown in
September. The movie is sort of a post-modern thriller with a wry,
ironic movie critic, Terry Thorpe, played by Macy, sinking ever
deeper into a chain of crimes from which he cannot extricate
himself. For the character, it is all just an interplay of scenes
from movies. He sees life through the lens of scripts and considers
his actions in terms of famous films. The whole idea of reality
gets fuzzy in this nervous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let him Hitchcock me and I'll Spielberg him one right back,''
Macy said, quoting one of Thorpe's lines as he is being pursued by
the police.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is dark, filled with black humor and violence. But,
Macy insisted, it is not the sort of violence, often seen in
movies, in which characters get hit on the back of the head with a
shovel and then go about their lives as if nothing had happened.
Macy said he was a critic of gratuitous violence in film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The violence we show has consequences,'' Macy said. ``I
believe you tell the story you want, and it can have violence in
it. But tell the truth about violence, let there be a day of
reckoning.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie also stars Adam Arkin, James Cromwell and Felicity
Huffman (Macy's real-life wife).
</P>
<P>
   The film is indirectly about the way art has insinuated itself
into reality, about how people model their behavior on what they
have seen in movies. Thorpe, in addition to referring constantly to
movie action, also turns to the camera from time to time and speaks
right to the audience as he explains how he sees his increasingly
hopeless situation.
</P>
<P>
   That technique, Macy added, helps make Thorpe a likable rogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bad and he's gotta pay, but he's a classic antihero,''
Macy said. ``I just think the hero of the '90s will be the
antihero, despicable people but we kind of dig them. There's
something in the Zeitgeist that makes that kind of character our
hero.''
</P>

<P>
   With Offense for All
</P>
<P>
   Lona Williams has given everyone something to hate in her movie
``Drop Dead Gorgeous,'' which, she said, makes her happy.
</P>
<P>
   In this black sendup, she ruthlessly skewers, not necessarily in
this order, small towns, beauty pageants, anorexia, shopping malls,
trailer parks, Lutherans, Asian-Americans, gun clubs. Well, you get
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   While humor in movies is in general getting blacker, ``Drop Dead
Gorgeous,'' which New Line Cinema will release on July 23, may be
among the darkest comedies of the season. The movie, on which Ms.
Williams was the writer as well as the executive producer, is in
the form of a fake documentary, a so-called mockumentary, about a
beauty pageant in a small Minnesota town in which everything gets
out of hand. It is about murder, mayhem and taut, insincere smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Told that it offers a bleak vision, Ms. Williams responded with
a hearty ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that it makes people uncomfortable,'' said Ms.
Williams, a former writer on ``The Drew Carey Show,'' making her
first feature film. ``I use humor to deal with these subjects. I
didn't set out to do something black. I just thought it was
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Williams, the movie was a matter of writing what she
knows. The movie takes place in the fictitious town of Mount Rose,
a none too subtle reference to her hometown, Rosemount, in rural
Minnesota. And she was a contestant in the Miss Teen Princess
America Pageant, the contest that is the source of the bedlam
depicted in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won in the town, which was odd, and I competed in the state
pageant, which was even more odd,'' Ms. Williams said. ``I went to
the nationals in Mobile, Ala., and it was one of the freakiest
experiences of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Kirstie Ally and Ellen Barkin play mirror opposites
caught up in an unusual interaction. Both have daughters competing
for the beauty title, a major event in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ally, a former pageant winner herself, is wealthy and
domineering and will not even entertain the idea that her daughter,
played by Denise Richards, might not win. Ms. Barkin styles hair
from her mobile home in a trailer park and pushes her daughter,
played by Kirsten Dunst, to compete. She hopes a victory will help
her daughter escape the town where she does the makeup on corpses
in a funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ally plots to blow up Ms. Barkin in her trailer but succeeds
only in giving her serious burns and fusing her ever-present beer
can to her hand. Another character meets an untimely end atop a
papier-mache swan in the local parade.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a note of grace, it is the relationship Ms. Dunst
has with her screen mother, which is open and supportive. ``After
all, what would a black pit be without a bottom,'' Ms. Williams
said.  &QL;

MAN BEHIND SPONSORSHIP HAS OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LOWELL COHN   
 Santa Rosa, Calif., Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ This is the story of NASCAR'S phenomenal
success, and the potential losses that are a byproduct of that
success.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Sunday's Save Mart/Kragen 350. The owner of
Save Mart Supermarkets is Bob Piccinini. He's the guy from Modesto
who's heading up an investment group that hopes to buy the Oakland
A's.
</P>
<P>
   Piccinini is devoted to the annual race at Sears Point Raceway
and this is the eighth year the race bears his company's name. But
Piccinini also wonders how long he can go on sponsoring it. He's
currently in the second year of a three-year contract with Sears
Point and is debating with himself whether to continue his
association with the event.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, if you can call it a problem, is the immense
popularity of the race, which has become the most-attended
single-day event in California. When Save Mart first sponsored the
event in 1992, it cost Piccinini $200,000. Sure, 200 grand may seem
like a chunk of change, but it was well within the supermarket's
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. Total sponsorship this year is more than $1.2
million. (It's $1.5 million at the Daytona 500.) A grocery man,
even a smart one like Piccinini, would have to sell a lot of
broccoli, toilet paper and Hostess Cupcakes to make up the
difference. To help him out, Sears Point brought in Kragen last
year to split the bill. Even with Kragen sharing the burden, Save
Mart's cost on Sunday will be $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Piccinini is not in the business of losing money or squandering
money or throwing away money. It occurs to him that Winston Cup
gives Save Mart an incredible amount of publicity, of marquee
value, all over the country. He likes that. He notices that the
employees at his stores, most of them situated in California's
Central Valley, are excited about the association with NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks before the event, he promotes the race at Save
Marts. He understands that a grocery clerk in, say, Coalinga, not
always the most high-profile job, could get turned on by the
connection with something big and nationwide and glamorous, could
go weak in the knees when a Winston Cup driver shows up at the
store, which happens from time to time. In Piccinini's words,
``This is good for esprits de corps.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also studied the demographics, and understands that every
year the percentage of fans from the Central Valley who attend the
race has grown. This is good for business, and Piccinini is a good
businessman. But he understands something else. Someone watching
Sunday's race on ESPN in a bar in Utica, N.Y., might get excited by
the idea of Save Mart. This theoretical race lover might run out of
the bar with the firm desire to purchase nonfat yogurt at the
nearest Save Mart.
</P>
<P>
   But this theoretical Utica race lover couldn't get his yogurt at
a Save Mart because Save Mart is strictly a Northern California
business. Piccinini wonders about the effectiveness of paying
constantly rising sponsorship fees to reach folks who can't buy his
hot peppers, onions and barbecue sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Kragen, by the way, is in a similar pickle, to use a
grocery-store term. Kragen markets its oil filters, coolant,
batteries, etc. to the western United States, and currently enjoys
no benefit with our theoretical race-car lover in Utica. The
Winston Cup circuit, including the Save Mart/Kragen 350, used to be
a local phenomenon. But now it's national, and local sponsors like
Save Mart are caught in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Piccinini has not locked himself in his room and turned off the
lights, wallowing in grief because of the changes in NASCAR. He
hasn't become the Hamlet of Winston Cup. He's a happy guy who loves
the event, and a lot of that has to do with his pedigree in racing.
</P>
<P>
   His dad used to own a Ford dealership. In the 1957 model year,
the Piccininis ran a stock car in NASCAR and U.S. Auto Club events,
about 20 in all on the West Coast. Piccinini, who was a teen-ager,
was seduced by the excitement of seeing the family car out there.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to 1989. Winston Cup was coming to Sears Point, and Banquet
Frozen Foods was the sponsor. The race was the Banquet 300 in those
days. It so happened that Piccinini sold Banquet foods in his
stores. And one of his perks as a Banquet vendor was a free seat at
the race and, one presumes, all the Banquet foods he could eat.
Piccinini liked the whole package, especially the race which
brought him back to his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   He would go to Sears Point every year and party at the Banquet
hospitality tent. Banquet once let him be the official race
starter. Another time he was the grand marshal.
</P>
<P>
   And then it was the winter of 1991, and Steve Page, current
president of Sears Point, had just signed on. The morning after he
took the job, Banquet dropped out. Page immediately got on the horn
to Piccinini, and he also called Lucky Stores. He talked and he
negotiated, and he made a deal with Save Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Lucky phoned. They wanted to be the sponsor.
Sorry. Too late.
</P>
<P>
   You get the point, right? The race was two days away from being
called The Lucky 350. Are we talking supermarket wars here, or
what?
</P>
<P>
   Save Mart sponsored the race for one year. Piccinini liked it,
so much that he picked up an option for an additional two years.
After that, he negotiated a series of three-year contracts and the
current deal expires after the race in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys hosting his own hospitality tent at Turn 11. And he
enjoys zooming around the grounds on his golf cart greeting people
and feeling like the host of the event. And, let's face it, he
enjoys meeting the drivers. But he doesn't push that part of it.
``If I walk through the pits? I have my own pass and I see a driver
and he's just standing there, and if I catch his eye, I might go
over and talk. I try not to be intrusive. It's their work time.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Piccinini. He's still a working man, and he understands
other working men, and he's reluctant to bother them. He also
understands business. He and Sears Point are currently in
negotiations for another three-year deal, to begin 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Will he continue sponsoring the race?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's yet to be determined,'' Piccinini says.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Sluggish winds from the northwest at 20,000 feet will direct a
soggy disturbance from Kentucky toward the Carolinas. The envelope
of clouds associated with low pressure on the west slopes of the
central Appalachians will extend from central New York to the
Carolina coast and westward along the Ohio River.
</P>
<P>
   Potent thunderstorms will erupt on the southern flank of the low
along a warm front in the central Carolinas. A few sections may
receive over 2 inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   A few thunderstorms will form ahead of a weakening cold front in
the St. Lawrence Valley. Very warm and humid conditions over New
England will lead to several potent storms in the higher
elevations. The Northeast Coast will notice hazy sunshine and sea
breezes, most sections will stay dry.
</P>
<P>
   The merging of a couple of clusters of thunderstorms over
eastern Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas will lead to a dull, damp day
in the western Gulf region. The most potent storms should occur
Friday morning near the eastern part of the Red River Valley. The
western and central Plains will turn hotter.
</P>
<P>
   A push of sultry air into the Dakotas and Minnesota ahead of a
jet stream disturbance will trigger several large thunderstorms.
The storms will weaken as they move toward the Middle West.
</P>
<P>
   Cool, moist onshore winds will promote showers west of the
Cascades. The interior Northwest will be bright, but not as warm.
Except for a few thunderstorms in New Mexico, the Southwest will be
sunny and hotter. The California coast will notice some fog. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Maine Storms
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of strong thunderstorms descended on Aroostook County,
Maine, late Wednesday. Oddly, the storms were moving from north to
south. Potent thunderstorms are associated with very warm and humid
air, which can reach Maine in the early summer.
</P>
<P>
   The sultry weather is usually transported into New England on
balmy breezes from the south. Indeed, surface winds were light
southerly, but thunderstorms are tall clouds that are directed by
winds above 10,000 feet. The clockwise flow around a stationary
high at 20,000 feet over Quebec sent the Maine storms southward. &QL;

   IZBICA, Yugoslavia _ The story of the Izbica massacre, in which
more than 130 people are said to have been executed, is one of
seven in the four-count indictment against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and four cohorts -- Milan Milutinovic, Nikola
Sainovic, Dragoljub Ojdanic, and Vlajko Stojiljkovic -- for war
crimes in Kosovo. Following is a list of the counts and alleged
atrocities in the indictment:
</P>
<P>
   COUNTS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1 _ Deportation, a CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY, punishable under
Article 5(d) of the Statute of the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  2 _ Murder, a CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY, punishable under Article
5 (a) of the Statute of the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3 _ Murder, a VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OR CUSTOMS OF WAR,
punishable under Article 3 of the Statute of the Tribunal and
recognized by Article 3(1)(a) (murder) of the Geneva Conventions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  4 _ Persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds, a
CRIME AGAINST
</P>
<P>
   HUMANITY, punishable under Article 5(h) of the Statute of the
Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ATROCITIES
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that beginning on or about Jan. 1, 1999
up until the date of the indictment in late May, Yugoslav and Serb
forces, under the direction of Milosevic and his cohorts, murdered
hundreds of Kosovar Albanian civilians ``in a widespread or
systematic manner,'' including:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On or about Jan. 15, 1999, in the early morning hours, the
village of Racak (Stimlje/Shtime municipality) was attacked by
Yugoslav and Serb forces. After shelling by Yugoslav troops, the
Serb police entered the village later in the morning and began
conducting house-to-house searches. Villagers, who attempted to
flee from the Serb police, were shot throughout the village. A
group of about 25 men attempted to hide in a building, but were
discovered by the Serb police. They were beaten and then were
removed to a nearby hill, where the policemen shot and killed them.
Altogether, the Yugoslav and Serb forces killed about 45 Kosovar
Albanians in and around Racak.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On or about March 25, Yugoslav and Serb forces attacked the
village of Bela Crkva (Orahovac/Rahovec municipality). Many of the
residents of Bela Crkva fled into a streambed outside the village
and sought shelter under a railroad bridge. As additional villagers
approached the bridge, a Serb police patrol opened fire on them
killing 12 persons, including 10 women and children. The police
then ordered the remaining villagers out of the
</P>
<P>
   streambed, at which time the men were separated from the women
and small children. The police ordered the men to strip and then
systematically robbed them of all valuables. The women and children
were then ordered to leave. The village doctor attempted to speak
with the police commander, but he was shot and killed, as was his
nephew. The other men were then ordered back into the streambed.
After they complied, the police opened fire on the men,
</P>
<P>
   killing about 65 Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On or about March 25, the villages of Velika Krusa and Mali
Krusa/Krushe e Mahde and Krushe e Vogel (Orahovac/Rahovec
municipality) were attacked by Yugoslav and Serb forces. Village
residents took refuge in a forested area outside Velika
Krusa/Krushe e Mahde, where they were able to observe the police
systematically looting and then burning the villagers' houses. On
or about the morning of March 26, Serb police located the villagers
in the forest. The police ordered the women and small children to
leave the area and to go to Albania. The police then searched the
men and boys and took their identity documents, after which they
were made to walk to an uninhabited house between the forest and
Mali Krusa/Krushe e Vogel. Once the men and boys were assembled
inside the house, the Serb police opened fire on the group. After
several minutes of gunfire, the police piled hay on the men and
boys and set fire to it in order to burn the bodies. As a result of
the shootings and the fire, about 105 Kosovar Albanian men and boys
were killed by the Serb police.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On or about the evening of March 26, in the town of
Dakovica/Gjakove, Serb gunmen came to a house on Ymer Grezda
Street. The women and children inside the house were separated from
the men, and were ordered to go upstairs. The Serb gunmen then shot
and killed the six Kosovar Albanian men who were in the house.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On or about March 27, in the morning hours, Yugoslav and Serb
forces attacked the village of Crkolez/Padalishte (Istok/Istog
municipality). As the forces entered the village, they fired on
houses and on villagers who attempted to flee. Eight members of the
Beke Imeraj family were forced from their home and were killed in
front of their house. Other residents of Crkolez/Padalishte were
killed at their homes and in a streambed near the village.
Altogether, Serb forces killed about 20 Kosovar Albanians from
Crkolez/Padalishte.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On or about March 27, Yugoslav and Serb forces attacked the
village of Izbica (Srbica/Skenderaj municipality). Several thousand
village residents took refuge in a meadow outside the village. On
or about March 28, Serb forces surrounded the villagers and then
approached them, demanding money. After valuables were stolen by
the soldiers and policemen, the men were separated from the women
and small children. The men were then further divided into two
groups, one of which was sent to a nearby hill, and the other of
which was sent to a nearby streambed. Both groups of men were then
fired upon by Serb troops, and about 130 Kosovo Albanian men were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On or about the early morning hours of April 2, Serb police
launched an operation against the Qerim district of
Dakovica/Gjakove . Over a period of several hours, Serb police
forcibly entered houses of Kosovar Albanians in the Qerim district,
killing the occupants, and then setting fire to the buildings. In
the basement of a house on Millosh Gilic Street, the Serb police
shot the 20 occupants and then set the house on fire. As a result
of the shootings
</P>
<P>
   and the fires set by the Serb police, 20 Kosovar Albanians were
killed, of whom 19 were women and children.

   NEW YORK _ Evil wears an all-American glow in Neil LaBute's
``Bash: Latterday Plays,'' which opened Thursday night at the
Douglas Fairbanks Theater. The characters in this transfixing
evening of monologues have that sheen of idealized, corn-country
wholesomeness that Madison Avenue has always put such a premium on:
clear skin, sparkling eyes and teeth to make an orthodontist cheer.
To look at, they're the human equivalents of a glass of milk.
</P>
<P>
   But if you know anything about LaBute, who has cut a fast and
distinctive swath as a filmmaker in the last several years with
``In the Company of Men'' and ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' you
probably know already that the milk is laced with arsenic.
</P>
<P>
   The stories told in ``Bash,'' even the one that occurs beneath a
police interrogation light, all begin with a comforting air of
familiarity that goes down bland and easy. Then comes a moment when
the taste turns sour, and you feel like gagging. It's as though
characters from ``Ozzie and Harriet'' had suddenly pulled a shiv on
you.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that the first of the three short works in
``Bash,'' which have been directed with confident, elegant
crispness by Joe Mantello, is performed by Calista Flockhart, who
plays American television's reigning sweetheart, Ally McBeal.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute has admitted he was relying on the trust audiences would
reflexively accord Ms. Flockhart, on the good will she
automatically generates.
</P>
<P>
   The two other actors, Ron Eldard (who spent a season on
``E.R.'') and Paul Rudd (of films like ``Clueless'' and ``The
Object of My Affection''), exude a similar if lower-key aura of
affable recognizability.
</P>
<P>
   They all, in that heightened way of performers who regularly
seep into our consciousness via movie and television screens, feel
like people we already know; indeed, to borrow the barbed title of
LaBute's 1998 film, like your friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Having a solid Q rating can only take you so far, however, in
putting over a work as insistently brutal as ``Bash.'' Fortunately
the three actors, who all have worthy track records in the theater,
do exactly what is required not only to hook the audience but also
to keep it on a tight leash as their stories wander into
increasingly unpleasant terrain.
</P>
<P>
   They are all Scheherazades, using darkly flirtatious timing to
keep you thinking, even against your will, ``So what happened
next?''
</P>
<P>
   Seductive story-spinning monologues are well represented in New
York at the moment. Two glorious examples of the genre from the
young Irish dramatist Conor McPherson are running, both on Broadway
(``The Weir'') and off (``This Lime Tree Bower'').
</P>
<P>
   LaBute, it turns out, shares many of McPherson's gifts,
including knacks for conveying information as a game of hide and
seek and for finding hypnotic lyricism in vernacular speech.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute is also as unmistakably American as McPherson is Irish.
For all its ostensible cynicism, ``Bash'' is informed with an
earnest, probing moralism as fierce as that of Nathaniel Hawthorne.
The evening's narrators have the self-enthralled intensity of
guests on shows like ``Jerry Springer'' and ``Leeza,'' on which
confession is a public activity.
</P>
<P>
   Each character is as imprinted with the rhythms and cliches of
pop psychology, televangelism and business pep talk as Emma Bovary
was with the fantasies of cheap romantic novels. Three of the
evening's four characters are also, as it turns out, Mormon (as is
LaBute), and the clean-cut look associated with that religion is
used in gleaming contrast to the darkness within.
</P>
<P>
   Like Alfred Hitchcock in ``Shadow of a Doubt,'' LaBute hunts out
the sinister in sunny American imagery. Unlike the psychopath
played by Joseph Cotten in that film, the murderous characters in
``Bash'' are not charmingly amoral, not Iagos for our time.
</P>
<P>
   There is clear, grounded logic behind the behavior described
here, and it is couched in the sort of everyday, lazy language that
you routinely overhear in train stations or diners. Of course that
language usually isn't attached to things quite as gruesome as
those described here.
</P>
<P>
   (A note to those worried about lurid television and cinema fare
as an incitement to violent behavior: The instructive cultural
references in ``Bash'' are derived from the Bible, Greek mythology
and the movie ``Kramer vs. Kramer.'')
</P>
<P>
   Much of the evening's thorny pleasure comes from the carefully
calibrated reversals of its stories, so you don't want to know too
much about them in advance. If you've seen LaBute's movies, you'll
be aware of his notion of human will as a blunt instrument, capable
of inflicting serious damage.

LEXUS AND OLIVE TREE SYMBOLIC OF TODAY'S STRUGGLE TO LIVE IN TWO
WORLDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember how easy it was for business during the Cold War?
</P>
<P>
   Not that it was pleasant living with a nuclear arsenal pointed
at us all the time, but, back then, the American and the Soviet
governments were more or less in charge of most everything.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was divided, compartmentalized, homogeneous and except
for a handful of creative engineers in a space race, the business
world was relatively static, bureaucratic, heavy, slow.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Berlin wall came down in 1989. And everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to globalization.
</P>
<P>
   A new book, artfully written by New York Times foreign affairs
columnist Thomas Friedman, provides an insightful look at the
chaotic world in which we now live, a world in which global
business is the dominant mover and shaker.
</P>
<P>
   His observations on topics from Japanese factories to the
Wailing Wall in Jerusalem are skillfully chronicled in ``The Lexus
and the Olive Tree,'' (Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 394 pages, $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   ``The slow, stable, chopped-up Cold War system that had
dominated international affairs since 1945 has been firmly replaced
by a new, very greased, interconnected system called
globalization,'' Friedman writes. ``We are all one river.''
</P>
<P>
   And that river was created from cheaper telecommunications
because of microchips, satellites, fiber optics and the Internet,
Friedman asserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what also makes this era of globalization unique is not
just the fact that these technologies are making it possible for
traditional nation-states and corporations to reach farther,
faster, cheaper and deeper around the world than ever before,'' he
writes. ``It is the fact that it is allowing individuals to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman aptly describes this new era of business with words
like integration and speed. Its symbol is the World Wide Web, as
opposed to the Cold War's Wall. Its defining economist is Intel's
Andy Grove. Instead of Einstein's theory of relativity, the new era
is based on Moore's law that the computing power of silicon chips
will double every 18 to 24 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Cold War, the most frequently asked question was: `How
big is your missile?' In globalization, the most frequently asked
question is: `How fast is your modem?'''
</P>
<P>
   Along with this modern world, however, are powerful ties to the
past, hence the title of the book.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman tells us of one trip he made to Japan where he visited
a Lexus car factory at which 310 robots and 66 people were making
cars. The people were there there primarily for quality control.
</P>
<P>
   On his way back, speeding along in Japan's bullet train, he
noticed a newspaper item about further unrest among the
Palestinians in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck me then that the Lexus and the olive tree were
actually pretty good symbols of this post-Cold War era: half the
world seemed to be emerging from the Cold War intent on building a
better Lexus, dedicated to modernizing, streamlining and
privatizing their economies in order to thrive in the system of
globalization,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And half of the world _ sometimes half the same country,
sometimes half the same person _ was still caught up in the fight
over who owns which olive tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Olive trees are symbolic not just of property rights, but of
religion, community, nationalism and home, Friedman writes. The
Lexus, meanwhile, represents the human drive for improvement,
prosperity and modernization.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman sees globalization also as Americanization of the world
and devotes many chapters to the influence of American culture on
the rest of the world. He also has a section on the backlash
developing against this new economic/political system.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the book is full of fascinating pictures of how once
far-reaching parts of the world are being woven together, as well
as insightful commentary on what it all means.

Challenging Times''
</P>
<P>
   By Donald T. Phillips
</P>
<P>
   Warner Books, $22
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being an interesting history of African-Americans
in this country from pre-Revolutionary times on, plus a biography
of Martin Luther King Jr., this book also provides insight into
King's ability to rally much of the country around him. Guiding the
movement, winning over people and ensuring the future are
leadership ideas that emerged in King's speeches and writings from
which any leader could learn.

book, he explores the complex world of corporate human relations,
covering such topics as creating an employee-friendly work
environment, creating benefits packages, measuring employee
performance and setting up wage structures. The book also lists
numerous resources, such as the top 10 Web sites and books with
which human resource personnel should be familiar. A CD-ROM
includes more than 30 documents, such as policies, forms, contracts
and laws, as well as Internet access.

   ``How to be a Star at Work''
</P>
<P>
   By Robert E. Kelley
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $12
</P>
<P>
   Author and Carnegie Mellon University teacher Robert Kelley
estimates that between 10 percent and 15 percent of all workers
outperform their peers by a wide margin. This qualifies them as
``stars.'' Kelley outlines nine strategies on how to become a
member of the star club, with a separate chapter providing
additional hints for women and minorities. Now out in paperback,
this book was originally published in 1998 and became a bestseller.

 NEW YORK: serious damage.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three stories in ``Bash'' are correspondingly all, in
different ways, about the power instinct, about the animalistic
urge for control. In ``Medea Redux,'' Ms. Flockhart plays a young
woman who is speaking into a tape recorder in a police station,
describing her seduction by a schoolteacher when she was 13.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Iphigenia in Orem,'' a traveling businessman (Eldard) in a
hotel room tells the interrelated histories of the casualties of a
corporate downsizing and of the death of his infant daughter. And
in ``A Gaggle of Saints,'' two ebullient Mormon college students
and longtime sweethearts (Rudd and Ms. Flockhart) recount the
events surrounding a memorable party at the Plaza Hotel in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In rendering these narratives, LaBute shows not only a merciless
ear for contemporary speech but also a poet's sense of recurring,
slyly graduated imagery. You might want to pay special attention to
the use of the references to water, by both playwright and actress,
in Ms. Flockhart's opening monologue and the esthetics of red and
white in ``A Gaggle of Saints.''
</P>
<P>
   Such devices aren't always subtle. The Freudian connections made
in Rudd's monologue might as well be drawn in Magic Marker. LaBute
can definitely slide into pretentiousness with the classical
allusions in ``Medea Redux,'' though he gives Ms. Flockhart's
working-class character legitimate reasons for knowing them.
</P>
<P>
   Because much of the language is so finely tuned, when the script
drops a clunker, it makes noise. Ms. Flockhart's speech about ``the
howl of the cosmos'' feels wedged in, and it tears a hole in her
narrative. Similarly, it seems unlikely that Eldard's character
would use a phrase like ``the whimsy of a lingering red light.''
</P>
<P>
   These are minor failings, however, in a production as darkly
engrossing and as impeccably mounted as this one is. Scott Pask's
simple but sharply defined sets and James Vermeulen's lighting
exactly match the tone of the yarns being spun. (It's amazing to
see the effects that can be achieved by Ms. Flockhart's simply
leaning into and out of the funnel of light in the first play.)
</P>
<P>
   The three young actors are superb, never distancing themselves
from either the pedestrian or unsavory elements in their
characters. In ``Medea Redux,'' Ms. Flockhart, looking raw and
childlike with her face stripped of obvious makeup, achieves an
aching eloquence through the simplest gestures, drawing the back of
her wrist over her eyes or tapping her finger on an unlit
cigarette. She is also delicious in the less meaty role of the
conscientiously girlish partygoer in ``Gaggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, in the same segment, radiates a goofy, gangly charm that
turns toxic by stealthy degrees, reminding you of why it's always a
good idea to cross the street when you see a flock of drunken frat
boys coming toward you. And he brings a frighteningly quiet
centeredness to his monologue's climactic moment, in which disgust,
erotic arousal and pure blood lust play equal parts.
</P>
<P>
   It is Eldard, however, who has been given the evening's choicest
monologue, and he certainly doesn't squander it. A seemingly
gentler cousin to the corporate sharks of ``In the Company of
Men,'' Eldard initially appears to be the ultimate boring,
logorrheic businessman whom you try to avoid sitting next to on
airplanes, down to the restless jiggling of his feet and
self-conscious chuckles. This is a fellow who manages to turn even
his apologies for using cliches into something cliched.
</P>
<P>
   Eldard never sheds that persona, which makes the exquisitely
staggered revelations of his story all the more disturbing. The
evening's most chilling moment comes when Eldard delivers a line,
in formulaic business-speak, about a ``calculated risk'' his
character took. In another context that line would invite yawns.
Here it makes your stomach turn. That's what LaBute does best,
finding the corrosive acid in the blandest substances. &QL;

   COXNET NASCAR 0624 _Jimmy Spencer has watched his NASCAR season
literally go up in smoke. A year ago, Spencer, 42, of Berwick, Pa.,
was ninth in the points standings heading into Sears Point Raceway,
the first of two road-course events on the Winston Cup circuit.
When the Winston Cup series makes its annual stop in the San
Francisco area on Sunday, however, Spencer will find himself 29th
in points, trailing leader Dale Jarrett by a whopping 1,056.
Spencer's main problem has been blown engines, and his sponsor,
Winston cigarettes, says it won't be back next season. However,
Jimmy Spencer says last week's top five finish has rejuvenated his
campaign. (Schlabach, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 15-18''

   MINDSPRING _ A look at who Mindspring might be discussing
partnerships with and why. The candidates include
telecommunications companies like BellSouth who would provide the

Internet service provider, said it's in discussions about possible

<P>
   w/COKE-FRANCE _ PARIS _ Now that the French government has
lifted its ban on Coca-Cola products from a plant in Dunkirk,
Coca-Cola Enterprises is making preparations to get that plant,
along with plants in Belgium, up and running again. The decision
comes after a food-safety investigation concluded that beverages
from the plant were safe. Still unanswered is the status of a probe
into the suggestion that rat poison could be the source of
contamination on drink containers produced at the plant. Also
checking to see whether Coca-Cola is planning the same media blitz
as the one in Brussels. Also checking the status of the EU
investigation. (Holmes, Cox News Service). 18.

<P>
   COKE-CCE _ ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. expects to take
a $60 million charge in the second-quarter because of its soft

   CHECKFREE _ CheckFree Thursday withdrew its secondary public

   Demise of Divx clears the field &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However the collapse last week of Divx, the alternative digital
video disk, affects the spread of DVD, it at least relieves
confusion for consumers and perhaps increases the inclination of
studios and other distributors to commit more films to a new medium
that several months ago seemed to be getting tangled in a format
war.
</P>
<P>
   Divx, developed by Circuit City, the consumer-electronics chain,
was predicated on a marketing concept that made it incompatible
with standard DVD and required a different player. (Basically, the
Divx disk was designed to play once, whereupon, among other
options, the user could throw it away rather than return it to the
video store.)
</P>
<P>
   By late winter Divx was accounting for about 10 percent of the
overall DVD market. Nevertheless, Circuit City, citing high costs,
difficulty in getting movies for the format and distribution
problems, announced on June 16 that it was discontinuing the line.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of standard DVD stopped short of performing back flips,
but the Divx withdrawal disarms a situation that in its first
stages had disquieting intimations of video's VHS-Beta conflict of
the early 80s. Now the consumer no longer has to choose one form of
DVD over another, and that pleases the movie makers and
distributors.
</P>

   ``We'll be more aggressive in changing all our VHS titles into
the DVD format,'' said Amir Malin, president of Artisan
Entertainment, an independent film and video company with a library
of 6,600 films, among them titles like ``Dirty Dancing,''
``Reservoir Dogs'' and ``Terminator 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Malin, a strong supporter of the standard disk, said the removal
of Divx positions DVD to replace videotape and the VCR eventually.
That remains to be seen, of course, but with DVD now in more than
two million households, one can at least agree with his observation
that it has overcome another format that had the misfortune of
competing against the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now,'' Malin said, ``there was always the issue of
whether DVD was going to be the technology of the future or another
format like laser disk: high-end use and limited availability.'' &UR;  &QL;

<P>
   Thursday a two-month Francois Truffaut retrospective ended at
Film Forum in Manhattan, but videophiles should be aware that six
of the films are available in restored editions, on both tape and
DVD, from Fox Lorber, the distributor that provided the movies for
the Film Forum series. They are ``The 400 Blows,'' ``Shoot the
Piano Player,'' ``The Last Metro,'' ``Confidentially Yours,''
``Love on the Run'' and ``Two English Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24 seven more Truffauts will appear on tape and disk:
``Jules and Jim,'' ``The Soft Skin,'' ``The Woman Next Door,''
``Bed and Board,'' ``Stolen Kisses'' and two short films on one
cassette, ``Les Mistons'' and ``Antoine and Colette.''

   All the videos have been made from new prints and have newly

 &HT;    LAWMAKERS PROPOSE RENAMING JUSTICE HEADQUARTERS FOR RFK
 &HT;    180&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Legislation to rename the main headquarters of the
Justice Department building for Robert F. Kennedy was proposed
Thursday by Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and other House members.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Kennedy his ``shining inspiration,'' Lewis said he was
delighted to co-sponsor the bill with Reps. Joe Scarborough,
R-Fla., Tim Roemer, D-Ind., and Jack Quinn, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think of no more fitting and appropriate way to honor
this great man's legacy'' than by renaming the building where he
served as attorney general, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bill has a very good chance of passing. My
colleagues have talked with (House Speaker Dennis Hastert) and he
is very supportive,'' Lewis said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he initiated the bill several years ago, but it
failed in committee. He said he thinks it will pass this time
because of its bipartisan sponsorship and because of a different
climate in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have had the opportunity to name several buildings
after Republican leaders,'' he said, pointing to those named after
former presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I had known Robert F. Kennedy for many years'' and worked with
him on his 1968 presidential campaign, Lewis said. ``I was with him
when he informed us of the death of Martin Luther King and had
spoken to him before he was killed in Los Angeles'' the night
Kennedy won California's Democratic primary that year.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said Kennedy epitomized the very best the country had to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a champion of the poor, the voiceless and the
forgotten. He possessed a passion for justice and fought hard for
what is right,'' he said. Lewis, a noted civil rights activist,
said Kennedy was ``at home'' with people of color, helping to give
a ``sense of hope in a time of hopefulness.''

MARIJUANA EASES THEIR PAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, July 1)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, it would have been more efficient to grow his own,
but that didn't work, and so the young man's sister went out on the
street and bought marijuana for him.
</P>
<P>
   His mother said, ``Any one of us would have done it for him,''
but it was his pregnant sister who insisted on helping him out,
``putting herself, her husband and her baby at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man lived with AIDS for four years before he died.
Without question his family believes that marijuana prolonged his
life.
</P>
<P>
   His mother explains, ``They use the term wasting because that's
exactly what happens to a body. The person with AIDS can literally
starve to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana made the life-giving difference. ``If he smoked, he
could eat. If he didn't smoke, he couldn't eat.'' I became a
believer after watching the relief it brought to a friend with
cancer. One moment she was lying in a fetal position, huddled
against the pain and the fear, so weak she asked me to light her
marijuana pipe and hold it her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   She inhaled and lay back against the pillows, whispering ``thank
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later she was sitting up and waiting to tell another
story. She was clearheaded. Her face had relaxed into a smile. She
said the thing she had to fight the most was fear and anxiety and
marijuana put them to rest for a while.
</P>
<P>
   If you're the mother of a child with AIDS or a friend of someone
with terminal cancer there's no question about sick people having
access to something that brings them such relief.
</P>
<P>
   It's so simple. It's relatively cheap. And it works. To withhold
it is inhumane. To make it difficult to get is cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in California two and a half years ago made it legal for
people to grow and use the otherwise illegal drug for medicinal
purposes with a doctor's permission.
</P>
<P>
   The ``growing'' part has been a problem. Not everyone can grow
their own and when others grow it for them, or worse, for several
people, law enforcement steps in. The problem is attaching money to
marijuana. Police rip out plants, arrest growers, arrest users,
close down clubs that provide marijuana for many sick people.
</P>
<P>
   There's a provision in the law that allows a person' caregiver
to grow for a patient but that person is far less protected than
the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes small groups of patients will get together and share
the expense of a garden, growing it together in a cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Last week AIDS patients in Sonona County, Calif., went before
the Board of Supervisors asking them to stop police raids on
medicinal marijuana gardens. A recent raid in Petaluma had dried up
supplies in San Francisco, said one man who begged the board not
only to stop police from raiding marijuana patches but to open up
the county to growing marijuana in a big way for people anywhere
with a medicinal need.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney said he doesn't want to see Sonoma County
become the marijuana garden for San Francisco or anywhere else.
That's understandable. Being known as Wine Country is one thing;
Dope Country is another.
</P>
<P>
   But being known as compassionate and doing whatever it takes to
ease people's pain would seem to be a worthy goal of any entity.
</P>
<P>
   The title of the 1996 law was the Compassionate Use Act but
compassion has had to wait on the details of how medicinal
marijuana is grown and distributed. In the meantime people often go
without. They don't eat; they stay coiled in a ball of pain.
</P>
<P>
   There are stories of people who grow their own, thereby
complying with the current law, but are hassled because their
doctor's note _ required under the law _ is considered too vague.
There are stories of doctors who freak when a police officer calls
to verify if they really recommended marijuana for a person's
condition. There are still people who think that a young man
smoking marijuana so he can keep his dinner down mocks efforts to
dissuade young people from imbibing.
</P>
<P>
   I loved seeing the smile return on my friend's face when the hot
pain subsided, but I don't think that picture would tempt any
teen-ager to get stoned.
</P>
<P>
   Things could be improving. California's attorney general is
expected to soon put his blessing on a task force's recommendations
to involve public health departments instead of police departments
in enforcing who gets medicinal marijuana and how.
</P>
<P>
   The mother took her son on a trip out of the country before he
died as one of her last gifts to him and they took along plenty of
his special medicine. ``You wouldn't believe what was in that
suitcase,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And was she worried the whole time that they'd all be busted?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course. But this was my son. I said I'd worry about that
another day.''

BAYER TO SET UP US BIOINFORMATICS FACILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bayer AG, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies,
confirmed Thursday that it agreed to invest up to $100 million in a
Cambridge, Mass. facility to develop a state-of-the-art technology
known as bioinformatics.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer, based in Leverkusen, Germany, said it would make the
investment over a five-year period through a research collaborative
with a German biotechnology company, Lion Bioscience AG.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Bayer and Lion will set up a facility in
Cambridge, to be called Lion Bioscience Research Inc. About 20
researchers will develop computer hardware and software in an
effort to aid Bayer in its race to identify genes and gene
sequences that can be used to develop targets for new drugs. The
technology known as bioinformatics.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion of the facility would depend on its success, Bayer
said. But Bayer said the agreement gives the company the right to
take over the facility when the agreement ends.
</P>
<P>
   Lion Bioscience Research will be Bayer's second project in
Cambridge involving drug development tied to an ongoing global
effort among scientists to identify the 100,000 or so genes in
human beings. At the center of this effort is the Whitehead-MIT
Center for Genome Research.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Bayer committed $465 million to Cambridge-based
Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. to develop targets for drugs to
treat cancer, liver fibrosis and cardiovascular disease and other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cambridge is the birthplace of genomics and bioinformatics,''
Wolfgang Hartwig, head of international pharmaceutical research,
said Thursday. With Millennium nearby, ``it makes sense'' to locate
Lion Bioscience Research in Cambridge so that researchers can share
information, Hartwig said.
</P>
<P>
   In a newly emrging field of drug development, pharmaceutical
and biotech companies hope to use these newly identified genes as
the basis for identifying genes linked to diseases and deriving
drugs based on those genes. Bioinformatics involves using computers
to sort through mounds and mounds of data to find targets. In
addition to bioinformatics technology, Bayer and Lion agreed to
develop diagnostics for diseases identification through information
about genes.

WANT TO GET OUT OF TOWN TO RING IN THE NEW YEAR? IT'S NOT TOO LATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're like me, you made a New Year's resolution last year
not to put off making plans for New Year's this year. And if you're
like me, you probably still haven't even thought about making those
plans.
</P>
<P>
   But don't panic. You're not alone. A lot of folks have yet to
make plans to party like it's 1999. And despite all the dire
predictions made by compulsive types who booked their tickets to
the Y2K bash two years ago, there are still plenty of options
available for the New Year's procrastinator.
</P>
<P>
   Not that those options are cheap. There's a reason your
more-organized acquaintances plan well in advance _ to save a
little cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're probably going to pay 30 to 40 percent more than normal
for a New Year's package this year,'' said Christie Crawford, a
travel agent with Carlson Wagonlit Travel in Fort Worth. ``There
are no discounts on millennium travel. All the cruise lines are
taking nonrefundable deposits. Even if you're deceased by the time
your vacation comes up, you're not getting your money back.''
</P>
<P>
   The new millennium, of course, begins with the arrival of 2001.
But try telling travel agents, resort managers or big-city
officials around the world planning their megacelebrations for when
the clock strikes midnight on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing, and it should be worth the
extra money,'' said Barbara Ford, president of Country Day Travel.
``If you don't see it that way, you better start planning your
party at home.''
</P>
<P>
   So what should we definitely rule out as a New Year's
destination?
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents agree that Paris, London and New York are going to
be suffering from millennium madness, with rooms almost impossible
to find. Don't plan a Disney vacation, either. It has been reported
that all 25,000 rooms at the 27 Disney hotels are booked. Even if
you find a room on the outskirts, theme parks have a maximum
occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hawaii is going to be astronomical for New Year's, and Vegas
could sell out,'' Crawford added.
</P>
<P>
   But although she agreed that a good portion of the planet is
booked for the holiday, there are still plenty of packages
available to make it a memorable New Year's. Some travelers have
canceled early plans, so spaces are becoming available.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if you go some place really cool and Y2K
strikes, wiping out the world's computer network and causing mass
hysteria? Crawford sounded unperturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows exactly how it will affect things,'' she said.
``But a lot of travelers aren't that concerned. I think the
airlines are taking so many precautions and gearing up, and most
people are booking to Europe well into the new year.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are feeling adventurous, here are some suggestions for
places to celebrate New Year's with a few hundred thousand close
friends.
</P>
<P>
   I WANNA BE A PART OF IT ...: You have never done New Year's in
New York, but you've virtually been there watching ``Dick Clark's
New Year's Rockin' Eve'' TV show for the past 15 years. Well, don't
get your hopes up about actually seeing the former ``American
Bandstand'' host up close if you venture to Times Square this year,
not without the aid of telescope, at least. You'll be lucky to spot
the specially built Waterford crystal ball drop at 11:59 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 500,000 is expected, which is how many people
officials say they believe they can cram into Times Square. People
will begin arriving the morning of Dec. 31, 1999, and party well
past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're willing to camp out for a good space, you would
probably be better off watching it the old-fashioned way ... on TV.
But if your heart's set on the Big Apple, don't miss the
spectacular fireworks display over the Hudson River, with good
viewing spots along the Hudson shoreline or across the river in
Hoboken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said you can still get a good air fare (about $240), if
you book now and are ``very'' flexible with travel times. But
expect to pay no less than $300 a night for a hotel room unless you
can score a good hotel package.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the popular hotels are booked, a few venues
opened their reservation books only this month.
</P>
<P>
   A few semiaffordable options we found: the Broadway Bed &AMP;
Breakfast ( (212) 997-9200) at 264 W. 46th St., a short walk from
Times Square. It has a six-night package, starting on Dec. 26, with
double rooms from $250-$410 a night. The Roger Williams (31st and
Madison ( (212) 448-7000), a boutique-style hotel, is offering
double rooms at $499.95 after Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Among New York-area hotels you wouldn't normally consider, a few
options remain. The Parsippany, N.J., Days Inn (3159 U.S. Route 46
( (800) 329-7466) is less than 45 minutes from the Big Apple by
bus. The train station is a short drive away. A regular room rate
of $135 for Dec. 31., $89 for Jan. 1, gets you a double, including
continental breakfast.

HILLARY CLINTON'S ROLLER COASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is doing just
fine with New York voters at the moment, thank you. It may not mean
the moon in the long run but it's better than her two buddies are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton gets no respect for his role in NATO's
military victory in Kosovo and Vice President Al Gore suffers from
reviews panning the uninspired launch of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Hillary Clinton's pending run for the Senate is
looking good.
</P>
<P>
   Her chief Republican nemesis, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
has been having a bad time lately. He looked petty when he withdrew
permission to let the new magazine Talk use a Brooklyn Navy Yard
site after discovering that the first lady might be on the cover of
its first issue. And he hasn't overcome guilt by association with
scandals about failing public schools and cop brutality.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide New York Daily News poll published Sunday showed
Hillary Clinton would beat Giuliani by 8 points were the Senate
election held now. It isn't being held now, of course, but being
ahead at any time is more promising than being behind.
</P>
<P>
   The new survey also reported that 73 percent of those questioned
did not see any conflict between simultaneously running for the
Senate and carrying out White House duties. In addition, 69 percent
said the fact she does not yet have a home in the state was no big
deal and would not keep them from voting for her.
</P>
<P>
   If those majority views hold, there's no great momentum in the
two main issues Republicans have raised against her thus far.
</P>
<P>
   The real political blockbuster, however, is that only 17 percent
of those surveyed said her legal troubles stemming from Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's manic pursuit make them less likely to vote
for her. A whopping 68 percent said Starr's attacks would have no
effect on their vote.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that if Starr calls her to testify again before a
jury about the stale Whitewater scandal and trashes her in his
final report, his actions may well backfire. They are simply too
blatantly political to be taken at face value.
</P>
<P>
   Starr threw every bit of personal nastiness he could document,
exaggerate or imply at the president but could not bring him down.
To try the same stunt on the president's wife in the middle of her
Senate campaign would make reasonable people puke.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable former prosecutors are convinced that if Starr had
any hope of convicting Hillary Clinton of a single one of the
charges he has investigated, he would indict her. He has not done
so because he does not have sufficient evidence to prove what his
partisan bias drives him to suspect. Another high-profile loss in
court would bury his professional reputation, which is already
lower than an underground parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr is widely believed to be so bitter and frustrated he
will issue a final report that paints the first lady not simply as
evasive but downright evil. He can say anything he wants in that
report, even though he acknowledged in a June 13 Fox television
interview that he had been politically ``unwise'' in the first
place to probe the White House travel office firings, the mystery
of Hillary Clinton's missing legal files or the president's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has a perfect opportunity to leave his post when the
independent counsel law expires June 30, but he insists he will not
give up until his job is done. He is reportedly hanging on in order
to be sure the first lady is called as a witness in the Aug. 9
trial of her former Arkansas law partner, Webster Hubbell, who is
accused of concealing work they both did in a land deal that went
sour.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton has already testified before a grand jury that
she does not recall the key details of their legal work 14 years
ago. She is unlikely to have anything more to say. But the first
lady's foes hope the drama of another court appearance will remind
everyone of the scandals that have trailed the Clintons throughout
their White House years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it may not have the political impact they anticipate. The
New York Daily News poll suggests she could emerge reinforced as a
sympathetic figure, not only the Wronged Wife but the Valiant
Victim standing up to a wicked persecutor. There's certainly a good
chance of that.
</P>
<P>
   It seems most likely, however, that all that ugly legal business
will have very little impact.
</P>
<P>
   All politics is local, even in sophisticated New York state and
even with the first lady as a central figure. As she moves about
the state, she will connect on a personal basis that will
overshadow whatever ancient baggage she carries from Washington or
Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Most voters already know a great deal about Hillary Clinton, her
strengths and weaknesses. They have heard the stories and accepted
or rejected them.
</P>
<P>
   This is a public woman. Not even her inner thoughts are much of
a mystery. And I suspect that more voters have made up their minds
about whether they like her than are currently willing to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   It is her job now to appeal to the mushy middle less likely to
be concerned about her past than her plans for helping New York
state.

 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN FRANCISCO _ More than any other, this is the city that
Americans fantasize about. No one leaves his heart in Salt Lake
City. No one calls Baltimore Baghdad by the Bay, as Herb Caen, the
city's six-day-a-week poet laureate for more than 50 years, called
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   For me San Francisco has always been a paradox: a thoroughly
worldly place, yet remote and somehow detached from world capitals
like New York and London; a little indifferent to the mundane
business of trading shares and casting votes; in other words, a bit
smug. (The good Mr. Caen, who before his death in 1997 did for San
Francisco what Samuel Pepys did for London, once quoted a local
citizen who, upon reaching heaven, reported back to friends here
that ``it's nice, but it isn't San Francisco.'')
</P>
<P>
   Yet San Francisco looms large in the imagination of everyone who
knows it, myself most decidedly included. Like Paris, Venice and
Hong Kong, it is a city without peer, a city of myth and magic.
</P>
<P>
   I can't think of the place without thinking about sourdough
bread and Alice Waters, who revolutionized American cooking; Joe
DiMaggio, the fisherman's son, and A.P. Giannini, another
Italian-American, who built the world's largest bank; Turk Murphy
and San Francisco jazz; Alcatraz and San Quentin; the hairpin bends
on Lombard Street and the sudden watery vistas.
</P>
<P>
   The weather I could do without. Fog veils the city so often that
a local radio station has adopted the call letters KFOG. Fog
bleaches the color from the perky paint jobs on the Victorian frame
houses that march up and down the city's distinctive hills. When
the fog finally lifts, when everything sparkles in the sun, it is
an occasion for celebration. Yes! A five-bridge day, with all the
spans from the Golden Gate almost down to Palo Alto clearly
visible.
</P>
<P>
   But fog has its uses. Several years ago, crossing the Bay Bridge
from Oakland to San Francisco at dawn, my wife, Betsey, and I
watched bug-eyed as the Transamerica pyramid and the city's other
towers rose bronzed and beautiful from their cloudy bed. Nothing,
in truth, not fog or rain or fire or quake, ever quite masks San
Francisco's beauty or quenches its exuberance. Its setting rivals
Rio's. Its charm compares with Boston's. Its joie de vivre nearly
matches that of New Orleans; it lacks only the last Latin measure
of heedlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Characters from Nob Hill and Telegraph Hill, Chinatown and the
Tenderloin have walked straight into the pages of Bret Harte, Jack
London, Frank Norris, Dashiell Hammett, Tom Wolfe (who found the
essential San Francisco experience in ``roaring up hills or down
hills, sliding on and off the cable-car tracks'') and John
Steinbeck, who loved San Francisco, as he wrote, when ``the
afternoon sun painted her white and gold, rising on her hills like
a noble city in a happy dream.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is on something of a cultural tear lately,
cementing its position as the West Coast's cultural capital,
although Los Angeles is by no means the pothole full of philistines
many San Franciscans see when (if) they take the plane south.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Opera is the nation's second largest, after
the Met, and it has the largest budget of any West Coast arts
organization.
</P>
<P>
   An old autocrat named Kurt Herbert Adler built the opera's
reputation, bringing singers of the caliber of Tebaldi, Schwarzkopf
and Fassbaender to the United States for the first time. Lotfi
Mansouri, the current general director, has gradually lengthened
the season, and during the 10 months from next September through
July 2000, 11 different operas will be performed.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the opera is in the midst of four cycles of
Wagner's immense ``Ring of the Nibelung'' at the War Memorial Opera
House (the place where the United Nations Charter was signed on
June 26, 1945, by representatives of 50 nations). The 15-year-old
production was reshaped by Andrei Serban, the Romanian-born stage
director, who had never seen a complete ``Ring'' until his own.
Jane Eaglen, Deborah Voigt and James Morris are among the gods,
demigods and giants onstage. The final cycle ends on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, the city's orchestra is just concluding an
ambitious Stravinsky festival, exploring the master's work in
Russia, Paris and Los Angeles, where its music director, Michael
Tilson Thomas, then in his 20s, knew him at the end of his long,
hugely productive career. Successor to luminaries like Monteux and
Krips, the lithe, lean Maestro Thomas is one of only three
American-born music directors of major American orchestras, along
with Leonard Slatkin in Washington and Andrew Litton in Dallas.
M.T.T., as the local papers call him, is one of San Francisco's
genuine celebrities these days, a Pied Piper leading the young back
into the concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   If the critics grumble once in a while, the public has responded
warmly to his programs in his nearly four years here, and even a
Vienna audience would have been impressed, I think, by his powerful
but never bombastic Bruckner Ninth in Davies Symphony Hall early
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   As ever under Thomas, there will be a lot of American and modern
music next season, plus a tasty rarity, Elgar's ``Dream of
Gerontius.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Ballet is in the hands of an old New York
favorite, Helgi Tomasson, who has transformed a regional troupe
into a fine classical company since taking over as artistic
director in 1985. I won't prattle on here; it's enough to quote
Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times, no easy mark, who proclaimed
the company ``world class'' after watching it last year.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies perform in San Francisco's Civic Center,
whose most prominent building is the newly, grandly restored City
Hall, with an enormous, echoing rotunda. (Don't miss it, even if
this stuff usually leaves you cold as a musher's nose in
midwinter.) Nearby stands the new public library, and by 2002, now
that a knot of litigation has seemingly been untied, the Asian Art
Museum is scheduled to open in the old library building, adapted by
Gae Aulenti, the Italian wizard who turned a Paris train station
into the Musee d'Orsay.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons are odious, if entertaining, but I would argue that
the Asian museum is San Francisco's best. Built around the
collection of Avery Brundage, it contains Japanese, Korean and
Indian works, but the Chinese material is supreme. When the Chinese
leader Jiang Zemin visited the museum, he was dazzled by a gilded
image of the Buddha from A.D. 338. I'll bet you will be, too.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the Asian museum shares a quake-weakened,
obtrusively buttressed building in Golden Gate Park with the M.H.
de Young Museum, which has raised $65 million for a new home, to be
designed by Herzog &AMP; de Meuron, architects of the new Bankside
building for the Tate Gallery in London. The strength of its
collection lies in American painting, from George Caleb Bingham's
``Boatmen on the Missouri'' through Frederic E. Church's ``Rainy
Season in the Tropics'' to Grant Wood's ``Dinner for Threshers,'' a
plain-faced group portrait that outshines the over-familiar
``American Gothic.'' Many of the choicest pictures came in a 1978
gift of 175 items from Mr. and Mrs. John D. Rockefeller III.
</P>
<P>
   The de Young's sister museum, the California Palace of the
Legion of Honor _ together they are known as the Fine Arts Museums
of San Francisco _ was rebuilt and reinvented several years ago,
reopening in November 1995. It occupies a picturesque site in
Lincoln Park, overlooking the great rust-red pylons of the Golden
Gate Bridge, an iconic structure that embodies this city's spirit
the way the Statue of Liberty embodies New York's.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by the flamboyant Alma de Bretteville Spreckels, whose
rich, indulgent husband, Adolph, inherited a sugar fortune, the
museum's collection centers on European art, especially French art.
The ``Old Woman'' by Georges de la Tour, a Monet ``Waterlilies,'' a
powerful off-center portrait by Degas, ``The Impresario,'' and some
70 Rodins are in the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another arts district has sprung into being in recent years
in the redeveloped area south of Market Street, known as SoMa. At
its core is the Yerba Buena Center, designed for the many
small-scale arts organizations in the Bay Area. It includes
galleries by the Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, sheathed in
corrugated aluminum siding but still somehow delicate, and a
theater designed by James Stewart Polshek, dark and angular on the
inside but more like a jaunty piece of de Stijl sculpture outside.
</P>
<P>
   Around the perimeter are a children's entertainment and
education center, complete with carousel; the brand-new $85 million
Metreon, Sony's urban version of a Disney theme park, with an
``environment'' by Maurice Sendak, which is expected to attract
five million visitors a year; the Ansel Adams Center for
Photography, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Still to
come are a new Jewish Museum designed by Daniel Libeskind, who did
a similar project in Berlin, and a new building for the Mexican
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The big cheese, of course, is the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art, which is housed in Mario Botta's four-year-old landmark
building, whose truncated cylindrical tower lets the light flood
in. A bequest from Elise S. Haas, of the Levi Strauss family,
brought it several pictures once owned by Sarah Stein, the
sister-in-law of Gertrude, including a breathtaking Fauve Matisse,
``Femme au Chapeau.'' Phyllis C. Wattis, the San Francisco cultural
world's Brooke Astor, gave $20 million in 1998 to buy 13
Rauschenbergs and other works.
</P>
<P>
   Donald G. Fisher, the founder of the Gap clothing chain, paid
$1.9 million in May for an Alexander Calder wood-and-wire sculpture
called ``Constellation.'' It appears to be headed for the modern
art museum, too. But because of the need to rotate pictures, Bay
Area artists like Richard Diebenkorn and Sam Francis are sometimes
underrepresented on the museum's walls.
</P>
<P>
   The Yerba Buena area is the epicenter of modern architecture in
the city. Elsewhere, the pickings are slimmer, despite Frank Lloyd
Wright's building on Maiden Lane, now the Circle Gallery, which was
a precursor of the Guggenheim in its use of a spiral ramp, and his
Buck Rogers-style civic center in Marin County.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture buffs will want to see something of Bernard
Maybeck, the individualist who foreshadowed the California Arts and
Crafts movement. (The templelike Palace of Fine Arts, left over
from the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition, and the First Church of
Christ, Scientist, in Berkeley are his masterworks.) A
glacier-white Richard Neutra house, cantilevered over a cliff with
a picture-postcard view of the Bay Bridge, is at 56 Calhoun
Terrace. And the excess of San Francisco's Gilded Age is
wonderfully displayed in Alma Spreckels' Beaux-Arts mansion on
Pacific Heights, with 26 bathrooms. It now belongs to Danielle
Steel, the romance novelist.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hemmed in by bay and ocean at the tip of a narrow peninsula, San
Francisco is relatively small. It ranks only 13th on the list of
American cities, with a population estimated at 735,000 in 1996;
Los Angeles, San Diego and San Jose are all bigger. But the
metropolitan area surrounding the bay, with 6.6 million people, is
the nation's fifth largest.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco was built on three stout economic legs: silver
from the Comstock Lode, the transcontinental railroads and the
port, once dominated by Harry Bridges, the militant leader of the
longshoremen.
</P>
<P>
   George Hearst struck it rich in the mines; his son, William
Randolph Hearst, struck it richer in yellow journalism, which he
helped to invent; the younger Hearst's granddaughter Patty was
kidnapped in 1974 by the Symbionese Liberation Army, but survived.
The circulation of Hearst's flagship, The San Francisco Examiner,
whose logo proclaims it ``Monarch of the Dailies,'' has shriveled,
but it may yet swallow its larger rival, The San Francisco
Chronicle, whose owning families could give lessons to the
Hatfields and the McCoys.
</P>
<P>
   W.R. Hearst may have been satirized by Orson Welles in ``Citizen
Kane,'' but the men who built the Central Pacific were reviled in
their own time as profiteers. They were called the Big Four: Leland
Stanford, Collis P. Huntington, Charles Crocker and Mark Hopkins.
According to one contemporary account, they made a $63 million
profit on a $121 million investment.
</P>
<P>
   It once seemed that San Francisco got by on beauty, charm and
the spending of strangers. But that has changed, and radically.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley, just to the south, is the land of memory chips,
software and freshly coined millionaires, which attracts a third of
all the venture capital invested in the country. Five of the best
20 places to earn a living in the United States, a survey by Forbes
magazine recently found, are within an hour and a half's drive of
downtown San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder people want to live here. No wonder the median price
for a single-family house in the Bay Area has risen 14.2 percent in
the last year to $334,590. (In Atherton, a tony suburb, it hit $2.5
million.)
</P>
<P>
   But off in a corner, with no share in this orgasm of prosperity,
are the city's omnipresent homeless, begging for money at freeway
off-ramps by day, rolling out their sleeping bags by night in the
doorways of expensive stores and other buildings, hoping the police
won't notice.
</P>
<P>
   If the police do move in, some of the homeless people whip out
their cellular phones and call television stations to come film the
action.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1883, Robert Louis Stevenson remarked on the city's
cosmopolitan character, detecting ``the airs of Marseilles and
Peking'' in its streets. Writing in the same vein 50 years later,
another traveler, John Gunther, called San Francisco ``brilliant,
polyglot and sophisticated,'' and said it ``will tolerate
everything, including the intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has an established social order and lots of Old
Money, even a mini-Wall Street. It has a fondness for clubs _ the
Olympic; the Bohemian, with its encampments on the Russian River
north of town, and the Pacific Union, whose brown sandstone
clubhouse atop Nob Hill once belonged to the silver millionaire
James Flood. It is bracketed by two universities of world stature _
the University of California at Berkeley, east of the bay, and
Stanford University at Palo Alto, an hour south of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But this has always been a city that embraces rule-breakers.
From its beginnings as an R &AMP; R stop for Gold Rush pioneers through
the wide-open era of Barbary Coast saloons to the heyday of North
Beach topless bars, featuring the silicone-boosted charms of Carol
Doda, San Francisco has been a good-time town, ready to live and
let live.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of its tolerance, the city has always had more than
its share of characters, notably Joshua Norton, who proclaimed
himself Emperor of the United States in 1859 (and advanced the
obviously loony idea of a bridge connecting San Francisco and
Oakland). I saw one of his spiritual descendants this spring, a
portly fellow with full beard and flowing hair, dressed in overalls
and railroad engineer's cap, ambling along, blowing soap bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Countercultures have flourished here since World War II. In the
1950s, Columbus Avenue gave birth to the Beat Generation and its
bards Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. In the 1960s came the
hippies of Haight-Ashbury, preaching Flower Power, dreaming
multicolored dreams and packing Bill Graham's rock concerts, and
the student rebels of Berkeley, led by Mario Savio. In the 1970s,
Huey Newton, from Oakland, made the Black Panthers a militant voice
for the dispossessed of the nation's ghettos.
</P>
<P>
   Gay men and lesbians were given an honored place in San
Francisco when they were still swept under the carpet elsewhere. It
was perhaps inevitable that the American AIDS epidemic hit first
and hardest here, but horrifyingly unexpected when the gay activist
Harvey Milk, whose election as a supervisor in 1977 had thrilled
gay San Franciscans, was assassinated in 1978 along with the city's
mayor, George R. Moscone.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mayor is Willie Brown, a black boulevardier who started
life as a sharecropper's son, a man with the charm of Cary Grant,
the audacity of a high-wire artist and lots of political smarts.
Willie, as they say here, never bothering to specify his last name,
``is a piece of work.'' Some people bridle at his Italian suits,
flashy cars and pretty girlfriends, but few will bet against him
when he stands for re-election this fall. Many nights, he attends a
half-dozen political functions before meeting a friend for a late
dinner, and then at midnight he stands on the street outside the
restaurant, greeting and teasing a few of the tourists who throng
to his city.
</P>
<P>
   His most reliable supporters are San Francisco's Chinese.

   Here is information about visiting San Francisco:
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   CAMPTON PLACE, 340 Stockton Street, (415) 781-5555. A polished
little gem of a hotel, ideally situated just off Union Square,
marred only by a few overly snug bedrooms. The multinational,
multilingual staff will jump through hoops to make you comfortable.
A half-dozen of San Francisco's best chefs have presided in the
dining room over the last quarter-century. Double room: $260 to
$400.
</P>
<P>
   MANDARIN ORIENTAL, 222 Sansome Street, (415) 885-0999. In the
heart of the Financial District yet close enough to Union Square,
Chinatown and SoMa, this is a spectacular sibling of one of Hong
Kong's finest hotels. It occupies floors 38 to 48 of a skyscraper,
guaranteeing great views. Double room: $415 to $570 weekdays; $255
to $550 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   REX, 562 Sutter Street, (415) 433-4434. Like Paris, San
Francisco is blessed with affordable hotels, and the Rex is among
the most charming. A vaguely clubby lobby with a bar and rooms with
luxury-hotel amenities _ voice mail, dataports, movies _ dispel any
hint of slumming. Double room: $165 to $245.
</P>
<P>
   RITZ-CARLTON, 600 Stockton Street, (415) 296-7465. As ritzy as
they come, this is the city's premier hotel, a worthy successor to
the grandes dames of the past like the St. Francis, the Clift and
the Fairmont. Perched on the side of Nob Hill, it is fairly stuffed
with marble, crystal and brocade, and the bedrooms are luxurious in
size as well as decor. We ate an impeccable Thanksgiving dinner one
year in the pretty restaurant. Double room: $309 to $3,500 for a
suite.
</P>
<P>
   W, 181 Third Street, (415) 777-5300, is a sassy new spot in the
Yerba Buena arts district. An octagonal three-story lobby adjoins a
``living room'' with smart modern furniture. Royal blue and
chocolate brown are the colors of choice upstairs and down. The
restaurant is called XYZ, natch. Double room: $239 to $319.
 &UR;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHEZ PANISSE, 1517 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, (510) 548-5525.
What to say? Alice Waters only gets better, buying superlative
ingredients from small farmers and handling them with reverence.
Every night, a six-course set menu, balanced and seasonal, is
served in an old Craftsman house half hidden by trees. In the final
week of May this year, the menus emphasized fava beans, morels,
king salmon and asparagus. The atmosphere is a little worshipful
for me, but who cares when everything looks and tastes so
beautiful?
</P>
<P>
   MASA, 648 Bush Street, (415) 989-7154. For decades now, Masa has
been the town's top French restaurant, a subdued, formal place with
subtle, complex cooking. Julian Serrano, who made it what it is,
has followed the yellow brick road to Las Vegas, but Michael Bauer,
The San Francisco Chronicle's exigent food critic, detects no
decline in standards.

<P>
   OLIVETO, 5655 College Avenue, Oakland, (510) 547-5356. Close
your eyes, and Paul Bertolli will whisk you to the Umbrian
countryside. He marries peasant heartiness with city-slicker
lightness: homemade noodles with delicate sand dabs, gossamer
gnocchi with sage and brown butter, moist roast pork bathed in rich
pan juices, with fleshy white beans on the side. One of our
companions called the dense chocolate tartuffo ``heroin on a
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   POSTRIO, 545 Post Street, (415) 776-7825. This is Wolfgang
Puck's Northern California outpost, a trilevel showplace designed
by the celebrated Pat Kuleto. Puckish pizzas at the bar; more
substantial fare downstairs, notably roasted leg of lamb with
garlic mashed potatoes (aaah) and nicoise olives. Or try the fine
grilled quail. They serve breakfast, too.
</P>
<P>
   RUBICON, 558 Sacramento Street, (415) 434-4100. The room is
airy, the food solidly Californian, the management by Drew
Nieporent watchful. But it is Larry Stone, California's best
sommelier, who pulls in the winos, myself included. Can't find
Grace Family cabernets? He has them (at a price, to be sure), as
well as small-grower Burgundies and many other goodies.
</P>
<P>
   SLANTED DOOR, 584 Valencia Street, (415) 861-8032. You will find
no better Vietnamese food anywhere in the United States (or, I dare
say, in Vietnam). The neighborhood is proletarian (no parking), but
classic dishes like spring rolls and caramelized shrimp are
executed with all the finesse of Alain Ducasse. The spicy squid and
chili green beans aren't bad, either.
</P>
<P>
   TADICH GRILL, 240 California Street, (415) 391-1849. Born with
the Gold Rush, Tadich's turns 150 this year. Fabulously fresh fish,
simply prepared, is the house specialty: sand dabs and petrale
sole, grilled or pan-fried; the tomato-based seafood stew called
cioppino, and peerless Dungeness crab in the shell, in a cocktail
or in a salad. Go for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   TON KIANG, 5821 Geary Boulevard, (415) 387-8273. Think you know
dim sum? Ton Kiang will teach you a thing or two about greaseless
frying, translucent dumpling skins and the use of chives, spring
onions and ginger to point up flavors. This is a favorite of the
chef Barbara Tropp, which speaks volumes, and it earns a tip of my
hat for its smiling, efficient service.
</P>
<P>
   ZUNI CAFE, 1658 Market Street, (415) 552-2522. A friend of mine
calls Judy Rogers' Spartan cafe, with copper bar and roaring
wood-burning oven, ``the soul of San Francisco.'' So it is, in its
delicious simplicity, whether you order a pristine martini and a
plate of oysters at the bar, or a Caesar salad fit for a Caesar or,
if you go late, an unlisted treat: a princely hamburger made from
brined beef ground when you order and served on focaccia.

`RUN LOLA RUN' POWERS ALONG LIKE A TRUCK ON THE AUTOBAHN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When German director Tom Tykwer was picked for an in-person
tribute in the ``Emerging Masters'' series of the recently
concluded 25th Seattle International Film Festival, few local
moviegoers had ever heard of him, much less seen one of his three
obscure previous films.
</P>
<P>
   But the choice seemed prescient indeed when his fourth film,
``Run Lola Run,'' debuted in the festival and took the audience
(and critics) by storm. It won the Golden Space Needle Award for
best picture, and was also voted the ``most favorite'' film in a
poll of full-series pass holders.
</P>
<P>
   It's about Lola (Franka Potente), a punkish young woman with
fluorescent orange hair, who discovers her low-level gangster
boyfriend (Moritz Bleibtreu) has just left a bag containing 100,000
marks of a big-time gangster's money on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   He calls Lola and asks her to somehow try to come up with that
sum before he's scheduled to meet his gangster boss in 20 minutes.
She's his only hope, and if she can't come through, the gangster
will surely rub him out.
</P>
<P>
   So Lola tears out of her apartment, races through the streets of
the city like a marathon runner _ nearly missing a succession of
cars, baby carriages and bicycles _ and goes to her wealthy banker
father, begging for the money and praying she can get it to the
designated meeting spot in time.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't make it and the worst happens, but, by some curious
twist of fate or whim of the gods, Lola finds herself transported
back to her apartment and given the opportunity to try again _ not
once, but twice, with startingly different results in each stage of
the two re-
</P>
<P>
   races.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you've seen something like this before. It's even becoming
a bit of an overdone idea: the movie (``Blind Chance,'' ``Sliding
Doors,'' ``Twice Upon a Yesterday'') that follows the same
character in a succession of alternate plot lines, and demonstrates
how a minor incident
</P>
<P>
   can have a major ripple effect on a
</P>
<P>
   life.
</P>
<P>
   But the formula has rarely been done as well as it is in this
goofy, audacious, visually stylized omnibus of what-ifs that
operates on its own peculiar logic, and powers along with the force
of a truck on the Autobahn. On a purely visceral level, it's a kind
of unbridled celebration of the exhilaration of speed.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, ``Lola'' incorporates animation, a rock-video
editing style (with some scenes apparently even shot on video), and
flashes of various passing characters' pasts, futures and present
interior monologues. It's a jumble of techniques, but somehow it
all comes together to be a unique storytelling style.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, for a film that is almost all action, it also
showcases a highly charismatic, movie-star performance from
newcomer Potente as the indomitable title character. Beneath that
orange fright wig, there's the cool, haughty, distinctly Teutonic
sexuality of a Marlene Dietrich, and it provides this clever little
movie with an irresistible focus.
</P>
<P>
   Run Lola Run. Directed and written by Tom Tykwer. Cast: Franka
Potente, Moritz Bleibtreu, Herbert Knaup, Armin Rohde. Sony
Pictures Classics. 81 minutes. In German with English subtitles.
Rated R for no obvious reason.

U.S. GOVERNMENT HONORS GAY SITE AS A HISTORIC PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: RECASTS lede, adds reaction, edits throughout.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   WASHINGTON _ For the first time, the
federal government has recognized a gay and lesbian site, New York
City's Stonewall Inn, as worthy of inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bar on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village was the scene
of several nights of strident protests and fighting after police
raided it in the early hours of June 28, 1969. After the arrest of
patrons and employees, protesters assembled in the street and, by
throwing pennies, beer cans and other objects, forced police to
retreat temporarily back into the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Widely viewed as the birthplace of the gay civil rights
movement, the Stonewall has become a focal point for homosexual
activists. New York's annual Pride Parade for gays and lesbians
routinely passes in front of the Stonewall.
</P>
<P>
   In March the New York State Board for Historic Places voted
unanimously to recommend the Stonewall's listing in the national
register. The Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation
and the Organization of Lesbian Architects and Designers jointly
nominated the site.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Interior Department Assistant Secretary John Berry
officially announced the designation in a ceremony near the
Stonewall site. He compared the uprising there with other American
historical events such as the Boston Tea Party, the battle of
Gettysburg and the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the heat of a summer's night here at Stonewall that led
to the creation of a new civil rights movement for America,'' Berry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who is openly gay, added, ``Laws that would call our love
perverse, that hold our sacrifice of life in the service of our
country any less dear, and that conclude that by our very existence
we are somehow inferior are not laws founded in truth. They are
repugnant and must be repudiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, President Clinton cited the Stonewall in a
proclamation declaring June to be Gay and Lesbian Pride Month. He
called the original Stonewall protesters ``a courageous group of
citizens (who) resisted harassment and mistreatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations set ``in motion a chain of events'' that led
to ``the birth of the modern gay and lesbian civil rights
movement,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Department spokesman Tim Ahern said that of the 68,000
listings on the national register, no others were for gay and
lesbian sites. ``The Stonewall is the first and most significant,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of gay rights denounced the historic place
designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it has now been listed in the National Register of
Historic Places, there is no way the hearts of Americans will ever
believe homosexuality is normal or viable, or should have a
significant place in American history,'' said the Rev. Lou Sheldon,
chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition, composed of 43,000
mostly conservative evangelical churches nationwide. ``Are we going
to honor prostitution and pedophilia next? Those are `behaviors'
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Chantale Wong, senior adviser to Berry, said that to avoid
protests from anti-gay organizations, there was little effort to
publicize the designation although a press release was issued.
</P>
<P>
   Wong said Interior Department officials are considering the
listing of the Stonewall as a National Historic Landmark, the
A-list of officially designated historic places. Only 2,200 of the
nation's most famous historical sites have been named landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Stonewall protests, police harassment of gay bars was
routine in New York and other cities, according to David Smith,
communications director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's
largest gay and lesbian civil rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Police often raided such establishments on the pretext of
enforcing liquor licensing or morals laws, he said. Putting the
Stonewall on the historic-place register ``is a very important
symbolic gesture for our movement,'' Smith said. ``The Stonewall
has enormous cultural significance for our community.''

<P>
   Near Newark Airport, the Days Inn ( (800) 329-7466) and the
Travelodge ( (800) 578-7878) are quoting a rate of $150-$175 for a
double. At least you won't have to fight traffic leaving town.
</P>
<P>
   2000 BY SEA: There are plenty of cruises with space available on
their New Year's voyages. At the top of the line, Seaborne ( (800)
929-9595) is sailing from New York to Miami, then on to the
Caribbean. Its flagship, the QE2, has midrange rooms starting
around $11,139 per person.
</P>
<P>
   A little pricey, perhaps? Laurie Monroe, an agent with It's Your
World Travel, said there are several more-affordable cruises
available. Commodore offers a seven-day cruise starting in New
Orleans and sailing through Playa Del Carmen, Cozumel, the Caymans
and Ocho Rios for about $1,148.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Cruises offers a 10-day trip along the Mexican Pacific
coast, starting in Los Angeles and traveling to Cabo San Lucas,
Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta, Ixtapa, Acapulco and Puerto Caldera for
only $1,533 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe confirmed that deposits have been as much as $750 and are
nonrefundable, so make sure you're going before you make
reservations. But she also advised contacting a cruise specialist
or travel agent for more options and reservations.
</P>
<P>
   2000 BY SKI: If you've just got your heart set on spending New
Year's in front of a fireplace, drinking a hot toddy, a ski holiday
might be the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford says Carlson Wagonlit hasn't had a demand for ski
bookings yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look for that pretty soon _ people wanting to be in the
mountains and have a snowy Christmas and New Year,'' she said,
adding that many of the end-of-the-year ski packages are just
becoming available.
</P>
<P>
   One option is the Broadmoor Hotel ( (800) 634-7711) in Colorado
Springs. Its three-night, all-inclusive New Year's weekend includes
a room, all meals and a New Year's Eve gala featuring fireworks and
a concert with the Temptations. It's $2,500 per person, with a
mandatory double booking.
</P>
<P>
   What better way to ring in 2000 than blitzed on peppermint
Schnapps, with your leg in a cast, singing along to ``My Girl?''
</P>
<P>
   HAPPY NEWTON YEAR!: Can you believe a city with more hotel rooms
than almost anywhere in the world can be sold out? Well, yes, if
that city is Las Vegas, gaming capital of the world and home of
Wayne Newton. Although Vegas is still organizing 2000 programs,
count on The Strip being wall-to-wall bedlam. There are still lots
of hotels with rooms available, although most are expensive. You
can order a list from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors
Authority ( (800) 524-3152), or check them out online at
www.lasvegas24hours.com.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the cheap rooms are about $200 a night during New
Year's, but this year, the least expensive room we found was $500 a
night for a Fairfield Inn (3850 Paradise Road, (702) 791-0899).
There is also a four-night minimum. Don't bother with the Motel 6s
and Super 8s in town. All of them are sold out.
</P>
<P>
   OVER THERE: Before crossing the Atlantic for your New Year's
celebration, take the advice of travel agent Ford, who said to
choose a less conventional destination.
</P>
<P>
   Paris and London might have a few rooms lurking in the outer
regions, but why bother when you can visit countries such as
Israel, Egypt, Morocco or Turkey? They all offer ``millennial''
celebrations, and like just about every overseas offering, their
availability wavers hourly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constantly shifting thing,'' Ford said. ``The one thing
people need to have for any kind of travel is flexibility of mind
and imagination. If they don't have that, then this should have
been booked and paid in full two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford suggested meeting your travel agent with an open mind. Her
suggestion, especially for the more mature traveler, is
Maupintour's selection of New Year's Eve packages to sites like
India, Nepal, the Galapagos Islands, Egypt and even the Vienna
Imperial Ball (with tickets starting around $4,500, including air
fare from New York).
</P>
<P>
   You can watch the clock that's the official keeper of Greenwich
Mean Time in Greenwich, a suburb outside London. It's said to be
the first clock that will tick midnight in the Western world on
Dec. 31. Rooms are still available, but with London in the grips of
millennium fever, rooms aren't expected to last.
</P>
<P>
   A huge concert and fireworks display are planned with tickets on
sale this month. For details, contact the Greenwich Tourism Office
( (011) (44) (181) 858-6376, www.info.greenwich2000.com) for
details.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand claims it will be one of the first places to be
touched by the new century's first sunrise. Festivities include a
beach party in Gisborne and a concert featuring David Bowie. Say
hello to 2000 with Ziggy Stardust. Contact the New Zealand Tourism
Board at (800) 388-5494.
</P>
<P>
   With options still available, how is an intrepid travel agent
going to celebrate the new century?
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually will be staying at home,'' Crawford said.

MIRAMAX'S `AN IDEAL HUSBAND' COULD BE SUMMER HEIR TO `SHAKESPEARE
IN LOVE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Say what you will about Miramax's alleged underhanded
business practices and big-bucks campaigns to buy itself Academy
Awards, the studio definitely knows how to package a satisfying
movie adaptation of a classic of English Literature.
</P>
<P>
   Its latest foray into the field _ a film version of Oscar
Wilde's 1895 play ``An Imperfect Husband'' _ makes the translation
with all its wit, incisive dialogue and eccentric characters
intact, and then some. It could be the summer heir to the studio's
art-house megahit, ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1890s London, it's the story of Sir Robert Chiltern
(Jeremy Northam), a much-respected politician who seems to have it
all: health, wealth, a wife (Cate Blanchett) who adores him and a
brilliant future that seems aimed straight at 10 Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
   But not very far into the film, the MP's good life is suddenly
threatened by a certain blackmail-minded adventuress named Mrs.
Cheveley (Julianne Moore), who has popped into town from Vienna
with evidence that Chiltern's current prosperity is, in fact, based
on a highly unethical act in his past.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for her destruction of this evidence, Mrs. Cheveley
wants him to vote for a pork-barrel South American canal project.
The rest of the film is about the moral dilemma this situation
creates for him, his wife and his playboy best friend (Rupert
Everett).
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, the plays of Wilde are so stagebound and steeped in
the conventions of the late-Victorian theater that they don't tend
to translate well to film _ problems that certainly plagued
Alexander Korda's 1948 British version of ``An Ideal Husband''
starring Paulette Goddard and Michael Wilding.
</P>
<P>
   But writer-director Oliver Parker (the 1995 ``Othello'') finds
just the right middle ground between movie and play, opening it up
in the first half to present an epic visual slice of Mayfair
society life while, in the second half, maintaining such obvious
stage devices as the shuffling of characters in and out of
adjoining rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The film is genuinely witty, its web of interpersonal
relationships seem more profound and less trivial than they usually
do in Wilde, and the more contemporary aspect of its plot _ a good
politician threatened by destruction because of an indiscretion in
his past _ is slyly beefed up but never exploited to be an obvious
Clinton parallel.
</P>
<P>
   The cast doesn't have a sour note in it.
</P>
<P>
   Northam's Chiltern is believably stalwart but never a
stuffed-shirt hero; Moore's seductive blackmailer is splendidly
venomous and, finally, surprisingly sympathetic; and Blanchett _
who clearly has no limitations as an actress _ is more regal here
than she was in ``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's Rupert Everett _ whose performance as the best friend
won him the best actor honors at the 25th Seattle International
Film Festival, where the film debuted late last month _ who steals
the movie. His dry wit, and his casual-but-perfect delivery of the
Wildean epigrams from the corner of his mouth, make him the movies'
ultimate surrogate Wilde, and put him right on track for an Oscar
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   An Ideal Husband. Directed and written by Oliver Parker, from
the play by Oscar Wilde. Cast: Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver,
Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore, Jeremy Northam, John Wood. Miramax.
98 minutes. Rated PG-13 for no obvious reason.

G.M. DEVELOPS SENSOR TO MAKE TRUNKS SAFER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Wash., Va., N.J., Conn.)   By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After 11 children died last summer in separate
incidents in which they became trapped in car trunks, General
Motors and other companies set out to design a release inside the
trunk. They did, and GM, which developed a big yellow handle that
is illuminated when the trunk is closed, made a $50 kit including
the handle available at its dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   But GM said immediately that the handle was not perfect: In
tests, some children did not figure out that pulling it would let
them escape. So the company developed an infrared sensor that
detects a person or a pet by recognizing motion or body heat. It
automatically pops the trunk, using the existing mechanism that
opens the lid from a switch near the driver or from a key fob.
</P>
<P>
   The company will include the new sensor on all of its family
cars with trunks within two and a half years. William J. Kemp, a
spokesman, said that the device would be standard equipment. These
same family cars will also have the illuminated handles.
</P>
<P>
   The company made its announcement a few days after a government
panel, made up of representatives of medical and consumer groups
and the auto industry, recommended that by 2001, all new cars
should have a release handle in the trunk. The panel said that
since 1970, 1,175 people had been caught in trunks in 992
incidents, and at least 260 of them died. Most of the deaths came
in abductions, the report said.  &QL; 
BUSES GET A BREAK  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many car-bus collisions occur when buses pull away from curbside
stops into the travel lanes in heavy traffic. A British Columbia
law that took effect in May gives buses the right of way when they
are pulling out, and a similar law will take effect this year in
Oregon. Quebec and Washington State already have such laws.
</P>
<P>
   The law in British Columbia covers roads with a speed limit of
60 kilometers an hour (37 mph) or lower. Some transit officials in
the Eastern United States are envious.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a law like this in New Jersey it would definitely
speed up traffic,'' said Steven Coleman, a spokesman for New Jersey
Transit. ``One of the biggest problems our operators face is
getting away from the curb. This would definitely improve safety.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hartford, Michael A. Saunders, the Transit and Ride Sharing
administrator for Connecticut, said the specifications for new
buses usually called for acceleration times of 0 to 40 mph in 20
seconds. A typical new car takes half that long to reach 60 mp.h.
</P>
<P>
   A law giving buses the right of way would be useful, he said,
but is not something that he would expend a lot of political
capital on. Instead, his department recently received a grant from
the Transportation Department in Washington to plan a dedicated
busway. It would consist of two paved lanes on an abandoned
railroad right-of-way, complete with 12 stations, on a nine-mile
route from Hartford to New Britain.
</P>
<P>
   On some of New York City's most congested streets, like Fifth
Avenue in midtown Manhattan, buses run on lanes set aside for their
exclusive use. When they stop to discharge passengers, they do not
pull out of the traffic lanes to do so. Thus, they do not have to
pull back into traffic to start again.
</P>
<P>
   In British Columbia, new signs are being added to the backs of
buses, showing the familiar triangular shape, the pointed end down,
with the word ``yield'' inside and a drawing of a bus with its left
directional signal flashing, as it would if it were pulling away
from the curb into a traffic lane. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TOUGH LOOK, FRAGILE BUMPERS
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility vehicles may look rugged, but many of them have a
glass jaw, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,
which runs them into flat barriers, an angled barrier and a pole at
5 miles an hour to measure the damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitsubishi Montero Sport suffered combined damage that the
institute said would cost more than $6,000 to repair, making it the
worst of the six midsized sport utilities that the institute
tested. Even the sturdiest vehicle tested _ the Mercedes ML320 _
sustained about $3,000 in damage.
</P>
<P>
   An inherent problem for sport utility vehicles is that what
causes damage is not speed but force, which is speed multiplied by
mass _ and, generally, these vehicles are massive.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Lund, senior vice president of the institute, which is
financed by the insurance industry and based in Arlington, Va.,
said the real problem was much simpler. ``It's basically that the
bumpers aren't very good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Montero Sport, for example, the bumper contains no
energy-absorbing material and the bumper `reinforcement bar' that
would have to handle something like a pole hit or a corner hit is
just a thin strip of steel plate. This would provide poor low-speed
crash damage protection even for lighter vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   The bumpers may be weak because there is no Federal crash
requirement for sport-utilities as there is for cars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no requirement for vans, either, but they are built
better, he said, perhaps in response to the safety concerns of
typical minivan buyers. In tests this spring, the Honda Odyssey
showed damage of $1,063, the Nissan Quest, $1,110, and the Ford
Windstar, $1,714, he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SEAT BELT USE IS UP  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is as effective at encouraging adherence to safety laws
as the threat of a ticket, experts say. And they are crowing about
the results of an enforcement blitz over Memorial Day Weekend. The
New York State Police, one of the first agencies to report back
with the results, said 300 police agencies in the state
participated in a May 22-31 crackdown and issued 45,084 tickets for
violations of the state's seat belt laws. Of those, 5,024 were for
violations of child restraint laws, the police superintendent,
James W. McMahon, said.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys conducted after the blitz showed that seat-belt
compliance had risen to 81 percent from 76, The high-visibility
enforcement program, which was operated nationally by thousands of
police agencies, was the fourth; the first was at Thanksgiving
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The state's goal is to have a rate of seat belt usage of more
than 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Hurley, a traffic safety expert at the National Safety
Council, said that if New York followed the national pattern, and
that if the increase in compliance continued, the state would
probably have about 100 fewer highway deaths over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is now a national model for belt use,'' he said.
Unlike most states, it allows the police to stop a car if an adult
is unbuckled. (Most states allow an officer to issue a ticket for
not wearing a belt, but only if the car is pulled over for some
other reason.) New York, Hurley said, has ``a strong law, being
superbly enforced.'' &QL;

CAST OF `BID DADDY' IS TALENTED BUT THE SCRIPT IS A MESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are we ready for a soulful Adam Sandler?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he tried to stay love-struck in ``The Wedding Singer'' and
the film fell flat after the first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same happens in ``Big Daddy,'' an initially silly and
darkly funny movie that follows the usual pattern for all Sandler
ventures: he's a schlub who gets dumped by his girlfriend, has no
ambition, but discovers something about his own character in the
process and finally winds up an unorthodox winner.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Big Daddy,'' Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a goof-off who has
unloaded his promising law career for a one-day-a-week job in a
Manhattan toll booth. His longtime girlfriend, Vanessa (Kristy
Swanson), has just taken off with a guy ``with a five-year plan''
and his roommate, Kevin (Jon Stewart), just announced his
engagement to the sharp-tongued Corinne (Leslie Mann), a doctor who
used to work at the local Hooters.
</P>
<P>
   In short, everyone's life is on the upswing _ save Sonny's. But
things are about to change. Julian, a 5-year-old with a sweet lisp
and a mind that works like a serial killer's, enters his life. It
seems the tyke is the result of one of Kevin's one-night stands in
Toronto and Julian's mother has recently died. Sonny hatches a
plan. He'll tell social services that he's Kevin and, by
shouldering the responsibility of fatherhood, prove to Vanessa that
he's not a loser.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing is as simple as it seems, except the
predictable outcome to this subterfuge.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler employs his usual abrasive charm and Joey Lauren Adams
(``Chasing Amy'') is a good choice as a potential new love interest
(though she has little to do) for Sonny. But the real star of the
show is Julian, played by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse. The
character is one of the most disarming kids to hit the screen since
Jonathan Lipnicki stole hearts as Ray Boyd in ``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   But though the cast is talented, the script is a mess. It's
essentially a collision of missed opportunities and Sandler
introduces one idea, only to drop it and take on another.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, ``Big Daddy'' feels like an afterthought of a
film. It shifts from comedy to pathos and winds up sliding through
whatever point it wants to make. I'd rather watch the grotesquely
fascinating and funny ``The Waterboy'' again any day over this
sentimental mishmash of a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Big Daddy. Directed by Dennis Dugan. Written by Steve Franks,
Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler. Cast: Adam Sandler, Joey Lauren Adams,
Jon Stewart, Leslie Mann. Columbia Pictures. 95 minutes. Rated
PG-13 for language.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C

BECKER HOLDS OFF TIME AND FORMER PROTEGE TO MAKE THIRD ROUND AT
WIMBLEDON 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ If tennis years unfurl like dog years _ and
Boris Becker, Wimbledon's head watchdog, claims that's always been
the case with him _ it means he has been torching the turf of his
favorite lawn for 105 years.
</P>
<P>
   First came Becker's historic championship as an unseeded,
carrot-topped 17 year old in 1985; then came his third and last
Wimbledon triumph 10 years ago, and finally, after a 1997
quarterfinal loss to Pete Sampras, Becker confessed that he would
play here no more.
</P>
<P>
   But retiring at Wimbledon was so nice that Becker decided to do
it twice. And Thursday, after saving three match points in his
shaky Tuesday opener on Court Two, the Graveyard Court, Becker was
restored to glory on Center Court, his preferred backyard.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old German used the sentimental homecoming to
annihilate 15th-seeded Nicolas Kiefer, 21, his German heir
apparent, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4. The faithful in the front rows had their
hero's initials painted on their faces, and the faithful in the
upper rows held banners that advised the world that Boris Is A
Tennis God. With a build-up like that, he almost had to play like
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come back after my first-round thriller to play perfect
grass-court tennis was very pleasing; to be back on Center Court,
it brought out the best in me,'' said Becker, who blasted 17 aces,
charged the net 52 times, saved three break points, and won 85
percent of his first service points. ``I can't say that this is my
place anymore: I used to own it, but Pete Sampras has taken over
the keys, so we obviously have new ownership of that court, but I
still feel obviously very much at home on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Kiefer tuned up for this Grand Slam event by winning the
Halle title and was, as the seeded contestant, the statistical
favorite to prevail, the 77th-ranked Becker believed that he still
belongs in this arena and that he deserved to reprise his 1997 swan
song.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure was pretty much on me more, because he has
another 10 years to go and will eventually do very well in
Wimbledon, but this is my last hurrah,'' Becker promised. ``So
there was an enormous amount of pressure on my shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   But Becker handled the pressure like the warrior he is. In
danger of being broken in the fourth game of the final set, Becker
corrected the break point his double fault had created by firing an
ace, one of four he produced in the game. And after holding for
2-2, he pointedly broke Kiefer for a 3-2 edge.
</P>
<P>
   A second-serve ace delivered Becker his third match point in the
10th game, and he ended things by looming up at the net and forcing
Kiefer to rush a backhand pass into the net, a faux pas that
generated a roar of approval from the partisan audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like I won the tournament, but unfortunately it
was only the second round,'' Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   Becker told Sampras in 1997 that he was glad that his last match
had been played against him. Thursday, the cursory handshake he
exchanged with the loser made it clear that he would not have felt
gratified to have Kiefer go down as the player who ended his
Wimbledon career.
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer's relationship with Becker, his former
mentor-turned-Davis Cup manager, has been frosty of late due to
Becker's displeasure with the acolyte's indifferent performance in
Germany's opening-round Davis Cup loss to Russia. Kiefer complained
that Becker ignored him when they met in the locker room here, but
Thursday Becker said whatever hard feelings there are between them
would soon dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably a couple weeks down the road we are going to drink a
beer together, and I'm retired, and he's top 10 in the world,''
said Becker, ``so what's the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Kiefer, the only seeds to make a second-round exit
Thursday were 16th-seeded Natasha Zvereva, ambushed 6-4, 7-5 by
100th-ranked Tatiana Panova, and seventh-seeded Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario, a two-time Wimbledon finalist.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez-Vicario, the versatile Spaniard, couldn't keep up with
the pace set by 37th-ranked Lisa Raymond of Wayne, Pa. The underdog
entered the match with an 0-4 record against Sanchez-Vicario and
left the court with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 upset. Two Wimbledon ingenues,
129th-ranked Jelena Dokic, the Australian qualifier who trounced
top-seeded Martina Hingis in the first round on Tuesday, and
86th-ranked Alexandra Stevenson of San Diego, who has decided to
spurn a scholarship offer from UCLA and turn professional here,
already feel the same fondness for Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Dokic, the 16-year-old Slovak-born prodigy that Hingis'
mother/coach, Melanie Molitor, wanted to add to her coaching stable
even before she beat her daughter, advanced to the third round by
outlasting Katarina Studenikova, 6-0, 4-6, 8-6. Stevenson,
currently working with Martina Navratilova's former coach, Craig
Kardon, upset 57th-ranked Olga Barabanschikova, 6-2, 6-7 (3-7),
6-3. In the fourth round, Stevenson, 18, plays 11th-seeded Julie
Halard-Decugis..
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking I can win the whole thing,'' said Stevenson, who
said that winning a Wimbledon title by the time she is 19 has been
her raison d'etre since she was 3. ``That would be really cool, to
beat my goal.''  &QL;

MODEL FOR PENN STATION ON VIEW AT THE MODERN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A model of the proposed design for the new
Pennsylvania Station has been placed on view at the Museum of
Modern Art. The display will remain on the fourth-floor landing
outside the museum's architecture and design galleries until Aug.
1.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation revives the Preview series, an exhibition
program initiated in 1993 by Terence Riley, chief curator of the
Modern's department of architecture and design, as a showcase for
individual buildings before construction. Projects previously
featured in the series include the Tokyo International Forum,
designed by Rafael Vinoly; the Austrian Cultural Institute in
Manhattan, by Raimund Abraham, and the Nara Convention Hall, by
Arata Isozaki.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by David Childs of the New York office of Skidmore
Owings &AMP; Merrill, the new Penn Station is to be housed in the James
A. Farley Building, the Beaux-Arts post office on Eighth Avenue
between West 31st and 33rd Streets. The design includes a new
ticketing hall, two blocks long, housed beneath a dramatic, curving
space frame of metal and glass. The framework, 150 feet high, also
contains the main entrances to the train station, which will be on
31st and 33rd Streets between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. Waiting
areas and shops will occupy a series of platforms, or trays, that
step down from street level to the train platforms four stories
below ground.
</P>
<P>
   The $486 million project, the most important public work
undertaken in New York in more than a generation, will include the
Manhattan terminal of a rail link to Kennedy Airport, in addition
to hubs for Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail
Road. A rail link to Newark Airport is also planned.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the U.S. Postal Service will continue to operate in the
1935 annex to the Farley Building, which was designed in 1913 by
McKim, Mead &AMP; White, the architects of the original Penn Station.
The postal service will also maintain its existing retail
operations in the lobby on the Eighth Avenue side of the building.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Riley said, ``The Preview series will resume at
a steady beat, focusing on newsworthy projects as they break.'' He
said he expected New York building projects to be a regular feature
of the museum series. ``For the last three decades, New Yorkers
with an interest in architecture have had to settle for mediocre
developer work as the homegrown product,'' Riley said. ``The
Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill design for the new Penn Station is
mercifully an exception, and hopefully is the beginning of renewed
interest in the city and in architectural excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penn Station project faces economic and political obstacles
before construction can proceed. About $80 million of the projected
cost has yet to be secured. Supporters of the project were dismayed
when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani declined to attend an unveiling
ceremony last month. Though the city has committed only $25 million
_ roughly 5 percent of the total cost _ Giuliani has the power to
veto the spending of funds already obtained from federal and state
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has also expressed reservations about Childs' design.
At a news conference, he likened the new ticketing hall to a side
alley. For the next few weeks, visitors to the Modern will have the
opportunity to see for themselves.

SPURS CHAMPIONSHIP WOULD BE FIRST RATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Consider all the Firsts we will see if, as expected,
the San Antonio Spurs win the 1999 NBA championship:
</P>
<P>
   --First graduate of the Naval Academy to win a title.
</P>
<P>
   --First AIC man to win a third title.
</P>
<P>
   --First Southern University man to win a title.
</P>
<P>
   --First Drexel man to win a title.
</P>
<P>
   --First Longwood College man to win a title.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs a big-school pedigree?
</P>
<P>
   And there's more . . .
</P>
<P>
   --First resident of the Virgin Islands to win a title.
</P>
<P>
   --First Georgetown man to win a title, at least in the John
Thompson era.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, they have Steve Kerr and Sean Elliott, Arizona guys
with a Final Four background. But they are a minority factor on a
team that mainly comprises people who have known rejection and
dismissal, or who have come to the ultimate world basketball
showcase from a very strange starting point.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson is a basketball star of the first magnitude, but
that wasn't his goal when he left home as a 6-foot-7-inch high
school kid from Osbourn Park High School in Manassas, Va. in order
to become a naval officer. He didn't plan on growing an additional
seven inches, without which none of this would be happening.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan was going to be a swimmer. (If you've heard this
1,000 times, this is just going to have to be 1,001.) Then came
Hurricane Hugo, and there went the only decent Olympic-type pool on
St. Croix. When he arrived at Wake Forest as a 6-10 blank canvas of
hoop, no one realized we'd be looking at a player who now is
threatening to own the NBA for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Then we get to our friends from such non-mainstream basketball
outposts as AIC (Mario Elie), Southern (Avery Johnson), Drexel
(Malik Rose) and Longwood (Jerome Kersey). All but the soon-to-be
37-year-old Kersey (it happens Saturday) are rotation players on
the Spurs, and Kersey is still capable of making a contribution, as
a first quarter 3-pointer demonstrated in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Kersey, Johnson, and Elie are all foxy old pros. Rose is a
third-year player. The old guys have already answered all the
questions about their uphill climbs to the NBA penthouse. Kersey
will tell you that this is a long way from the days when the big
rival was Randolph-Macon. The undrafted Johnson can tell you about
being bounced from Seattle to Denver to San Antonio to Houston to
San Antonio to Golden State and then, finally, back to San Antonio
in 1994. Elie, who once thought Springfield was a big game, was a
1985 seventh-round draft pick (Milwaukee), who played in Portugal,
Argentina, and Ireland, as well as the CBA, the USBL, and the WBL.
Not to mention Philadelphia, Golden State, Portland, and Houston,
where he picked up a pair of championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   So if young Mr. Rose, who spent the first two years of his NBA
career in Charlotte, is looking for advice on how to handle any
hard times in either his personal or professional life, he has
certainly come to the right team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we all just believe in ourselves,'' says the
affable young man who recalls regarding Delaware, BU, and Maine as
prime rivals when he was carving out a reputation as the ``Shaq Of
The NAC'' a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in one more vagabond, albeit one with a more upscale
collegiate background. That would be 31-year-old Jaren Jackson,
who, in his ninth NBA season, is playing for his eighth team to go
along with his four stops in the CBA and one stint in the WBL.
Jackson is on the verge of becoming the first John
Thompson-developed Georgetown man to play on an NBA champonship
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought much about all that,'' says Kersey, who made
two previous trips to the Finals (1990, '92) as an 11-year member
of the Portland Trail Blazers. ``We're just a team of basic
fundamentalists. We don't have a lot of high-flyers pulling off
reverse dunks.''
</P>
<P>
   And for more emphasis, Elie even says that coach Gregg Popovich
is ``one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true enough. There is no great NBA pedigree attached to
him, either. He played at the Air Force Academy. During his five
years in the military he played on various service and AAU teams
and was even invited to the 1972 Olympic Trials. He later coached
at Division 3 Pomona-Pitzer. His entree into the NBA was Larry
Brown, who hired him as an assistant in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He likes the idea of having so many guys from the wrong side of
the basketball tracks on his team. These are guys who haven't had
it just given to them,'' he declares. ``They've come up the hard
way. When you show confidence in guys like that you get it back
tenfold. They are happy to be here, and they are willing to accept
roles. This all makes sense, at least in my mind, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Popovich's team of ``basic fundamentalists'' _ and it really is
his team since he is also the general manager _ has been a purist's
delight during their steady march to the title. For this is a team
that has brought back the hook shot (Robinson and little Avery, who
made three first-half Lenny Wilkens-style running hooks in Game 4),
the bank shot (Duncan), and, most amazingly of all, the flat-footed
one-hand set shot (Elie).
</P>
<P>
   That may not be the way they play basketball at UCLA (since Bill
Walton left, anyway), Michigan or UNLV. But that's apparently the
way they learned how to play it at Navy, Southern, St. Croix/Wake
Forest, and AIC. Perhaps players at the glamour schools should be
taking notes.

JARRETT IS A MAN ON A MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is, if he can keep it up, an unbeatable pace. Since the
Daytona 500, when he lost control of his car trying to get back in
line and wrecked, Dale Jarrett has been a man on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   And that mission is to win his first Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Sunday's Save Mart/Kragen 350k at Sonoma, Calif.,
Jarrett boasts an 89-point lead over another rapidly rising
contender, Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   But Labonte and everybody else is going to have a difficult time
dealing with him unless Jarrett and his team start fouling up.
</P>
<P>
   Since that wreck in the season's first event, Jarrett has
finished in the top 10 in 13 of the 14 races run, and the one time
he missed, at Las Vegas, he was 11th.
</P>
<P>
   In 12 of the last 14 races, he has been fifth or better.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, in fact, has run so well that he has overshadowed an
outstanding stretch by defending Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon.
Going into this weekend, Gordon has finished second three straight
times. Despite that, he has lost 10 points to Jarrett in his effort
to catch the leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sat down last year, we talked about the way we were
going to have to perform and what we were going to have to do to
win championships,'' Jarrett said. The answer was consistency that
produces a high finish average throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know somebody will do that, so it might as well be us to
set that standard,'' Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   At 42, Jarrett appears to be peaking as a driver in Robert
Yates' second car prepared by crew chief Todd Parrott.
</P>
<P>
   With their Ford's performance in 1999, it is fair to say that
Jarrett and Parrott have shown, beyond doubt, that they now form
one of NASCAR's elite teams.
</P>
<P>
   Originally signed as a fill-in until injured Ernie Irvan was
able to return, Jarrett and Parrott were teamed in 1996 by Yates
when he decided to add a second car. Since then, Jarrett has won 16
races and finished the last three years third, second and third,
respectively, in the point standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have good equipment everywhere I go now,'' Jarrett said.
``What's benefited us a lot is that when you win, you know the kind
of feel you're looking for in a race car. Until you get to that
point, you're not exactly sure what it takes to win and to make
that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that as I go to these race tracks we've performed well
at, I know a certain feel that I'm looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett said he is making no assumptions about a championship.
While he has established himself as the man to beat, he knows he's
just a couple blown engines or blown tires or wrecks away from
losing the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do everything you can,'' Jarrett said. ``You make your
calls throughout the year and you drive your races and, if they
come out like you want them, that's great. If they don't, you start
to get ready for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we get caught up a little bit too much in what we do
and it's not quite as important as we think when you look around,''
Jarrett said. ``You've always got your family to go home to, no
matter what happens, they're behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he keeps running the way he has, so are a lot of other
people.

SECRETS, REVELATIONS OF `DESERT BLUE' TOWN EASY TO FIGURE OUT EARLY
ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Morgan J. Freeman's second film after his critically acclaimed
``Hurricane Streets'' is a slice of small-town life that mirrors
the deserted desert existence it depicts _ nothing happens.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter Beach boasts a population of 89 and is located in a
wasteland in central California. It's a place that holds one
tourist attraction: the world's largest ice cream cone.
</P>
<P>
   Yet life is about to alter radically for the residents. When
teenage TV star Skye (Kate Hudson) and her scientist dad (John
Heard) are waylaid and quarantined in town by the FBI after a truck
carrying a mysterious substance results in the death of the driver,
everyone's eyes are opened to new, potential worlds beyond Baxter's
claustrophobic borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desert Blue'' visually captures the idle existence. But this
turf has been trod in dozens of other films, and Freeman's movie
resembles virtually every screen depiction of a sleepy, shuffling,
nowhere town. Ultimately, it has to rely upon eccentricity to
separate it from the competition. It winds up paralleling its tired
subject matter with an equally lumbering pace, and the secrets and
revelations are transparently easy to figure out early on.
</P>
<P>
   Though it boasts a cast of up-and-coming Hollywood talent _
Hudson, Christina Ricci, Casey Affleck and Brendan Sexton II _ its
strength lies with its older actors. Lucinda Jenney gives the film
its true emotional range. The relationship that buds between her
character and Heard's has a degree of depth that comes from the
despair of being alone with no hope.
</P>
<P>
   The film strains to find a parallel between its middle-aged and
youthful ennui, broken dreams and the prospect of nowhere to go,
but the idea doesn't gel, especially in the way these kids pin
their notions of leaving on a single incident.
</P>
<P>
   That dramatic impetus _ a celebrity in town _ is contrived, and
the result is a movie that sparks to life about as often as a
breeze blows through this hot, still desert town.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Blue. Directed and written by Morgan J. Freeman. Cast:
Brendan Sexton III, Kate Hudson, Christina Ricci, Casey Affleck,
John Heard. Samuel Goldwyn. 89 minutes. Rated R for language.

NEW MONTE CARLO IS COMING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hendrick Motorsports and RAD, the aerodynamics arm of three
Chevy teams, are going full speed ahead on the new Monte Carlo,
2000 model.
</P>
<P>
   The car, which was expected to debut this year, was put on hold
until 2000 after Chevy and NASCAR got into a prolonged debate over
its characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy wanted a version superior to its present Monte Carlo,
while NASCAR wanted to make sure any new design was not inherently
superior to the competition.
</P>
<P>
   That delayed NASCAR approval of the 2000 model until the end of
May. Now, Hendrick Motorsports, which is building a superspeedway
car for Talladega and Daytona, and RAD, which is building the
so-called downforce car that will run every place else, are working
to get test cars ready for the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the process of taking the NASCAR templates and
building a test car for RAD,'' said Steve Hmiel, technical director
for Dale Earnhardt's team. In Hmiel, formerly Mark Martin's crew
chief, and aero engineer Louis Duncan, who played a major role in
designing the Taurus, RAD has two of stock car racing's top chassis
experts.
</P>
<P>
   RAD was put together by three Chevy owners _ Richard Childress,
Andy Petree and Earnhardt _ with the goal of improving performance.
Duncan was hired to assist the teams in building more aerodynamic
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The templates have now been released and all three RAD
organizations have a complete set, which means we can start
building cars,'' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a race team call, but I think we could have a car on the
track, probably sometime in the next few months, once NASCAR gives
us a test date,'' Duncan said. A car should be ready for wind
tunnel testing within weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the new Monte Carlo evolved, NASCAR ran a series of tests
before giving its approval, trying to be certain Chevy wasn't
trying to build a rocket ship.
</P>
<P>
   But despite wind tunnel tests and design calculations, there is
no way to predict how a new car will perform until it actually gets
out and runs.
</P>
<P>
   And NASCAR still has to be a little nervous about this because
most expect the new Monte Carlo to have more downforce, which means
it should be better than the present model except at Daytona and
Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   And that means Jeff Gordon, who drives for Hendrick, should be
even better.
</P>
<P>
   So this story is just getting started and the ending is not yet
in sight.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The heated accusations of monopoly, the lively
e-mail flavored with capitalist aggression and the spirited
testimony alleging and denying misconduct came to a close Thursday
as the last witness stepped off the stand in the Microsoft
antitrust trial, eight months after proceedings began.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft trial is by no means over, but it sharply shifts
gears as the daily theater in the courtroom gives way to a more
sober weighing of facts and law. ``Now the showmanship ends and the
legal maneuvering really begins,'' observed Andrew Gavil, a
professor at the Howard University law school.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the points in the daily courtroom drama went to the
Justice Department and the 19 states suing Microsoft Corp. Led by
trial lawyer David Boies, the government team caught Microsoft's
witnesses off guard again and again, presenting them with
embarrassing e-mails or previous statements that appeared to
undermine their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Even William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, found it
impressive, if not convincing. Since the start of the trial, Neukom
notes that he has fielded expressions of concern that things are
going badly for the company from many of his colleagues, even his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has put on a great performance,'' he said,
``but it does not add up to a solid antitrust case. It's all fluff
legally.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, counters that the evidence and
testimony presented in court has been occasionally entertaining but
consistently incriminating. It adds up to a detailed and convincing
portrait, Klein said, of ``Microsoft's ability and willingness to
do whatever is necessary in using its market power to protect its
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal reckoning that matters, however, will be made by Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will rule in this trial without a
jury. Both Microsoft and the government will make further written
and oral arguments over the summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson must then comb through the mountains of evidence to try
to answer one essential question: What are the appropriate legal
restraints on the behavior of a powerful company in a dynamic
high-technology industry?
</P>
<P>
   The issue extends well beyond the Microsoft case, and the stakes
are high. The ruling could set ground rules for competition in the
modern economy, affecting companies and consumers alike for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The legal guideposts to help Jackson reach his decision,
antitrust experts say, are not clear-cut. The major antitrust
rulings over the last two decades are few, and they mostly involve
mundane businesses including ski resorts in Colorado, a rural Ohio
newspaper, a bowling alley in New Jersey and an egg processor in
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the plaintiffs brought a very traditional
antitrust suit. The government says Microsoft repeatedly and
illegally used its market power to thwart new competition
represented by the rise of the Internet, especially software for
browsing the World Wide Web. With exclusionary contracts and
threats, Microsoft, according to the government, used its market
power to defend its monopoly product _ the Windows operating
system, the software that serves as the central nervous system of
90 percent of the personal computers sold today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is mainly an old-fashioned contract case,'' said Herbert
Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school and
leading antitrust scholar, who is advising the government. ``There
is nothing novel about the practices. The one thing that is novel
is that the case is in the software industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the industry context is a crucial consideration. The
software business is regarded as the forerunner of what has been
called ``the new economy'' _ a fast-moving, fluid environment in
which market leadership can be fleeting, but technology can also
hasten the concentration of market power and the creation of
monopolies. In short, new-economy theories can cut both ways in
antitrust cases. There has been plenty of talk of ``network
effects'' and ``winner-take-all markets'' from both sides in the
Microsoft trial.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Microsoft case focuses on a fast-moving,
technically complex industry complicates the legal judgment the
court must make. ``It makes the toughest issues that courts have to
deal with in antitrust cases _ determining market power, evaluating
the significance of conduct and designing remedies _ far more
difficult,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George
Washington University law school.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many antitrust experts who have followed the trial expect
that Jackson will side with the government on some of its many
charges against Microsoft. They base that view partly on a reading
of Jackson's behavior _openly questioning the testimony of some
Microsoft witnesses, and showing impatience with Microsoft's
lawyers _ and partly on a reading of the law, that some Microsoft
contracts with online services and personal computer manufacturers
did inhibit competition from software rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is by no means conceding defeat in Jackson's federal
district court. But Neukom suggests that its legal strategy is to
prevail on appeal. ``The thing to remember is that we're engaged in
a legal decathlon, and we're still at an early stage,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the two sides reach a settlement, Jackson's ruling,
expected by the end of the year, will certainly be reviewed by a
federal appeals court and possibly by the Supreme Court as well. If
it goes to the Supreme Court, the Microsoft case may well not be
finally determined until 2002, legal experts say.

 WASHINGTON: experts say. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A crucial decision by Jackson a month before the trial began
last October determined what the courtroom proceedings became: a
sweeping portrayal of Microsoft by the government as a bullying
monopolist, supported by a parade of industry witnesses making a
litany of allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The government's original complaint, filed in May 1998, charged
that Microsoft was ``engaged in a series of anticompetitive
ativities.'' But it focused largely on the company's tactics in
the browser market against Netscape Communications Corp., and
specifically on Microsoft's decision to fold its browser into its
industry-standard Windows operating system. Microsoft, the
government contended, had illegally tied a second product to its
monopoly product in a predatory effort to stifle competition and
reduce consumer choice.
</P>
<P>
   But a month later, the government's tying theory suffered a
severe blow when a federal appeals court ruled in a related case
that Microsoft should be free to blend its browser into Windows as
long as it can make a ``plausible claim'' of business efficiency or
consumer benefit from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, the Justice Department and states continued
investigating Microsoft's dealings with other companies and came up
with new evidence involving Intel, Apple Computer and others _ all
of it, the government said, fit into Microsoft's ``pattern of
behavior'' intended to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   Over Microsoft's objections, Jackson permitted the new evidence.
Suddenly, the focus of the case widened well beyond the ``browser
wars'' to a broad, multifaceted scheme by Microsoft to protect its
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   With the retooling, the government case also acquired a broad
narrative theme that rose above the arcane details that are an
inevitable part of a high-tech antitrust trial. Whatever the legal
merits, the approach made the government's case a much more
compelling story to tell in court. So when an Intel executive
testified to a ``credible and fairly terrifying'' threat from
Microsoft, or when an America Online executive testified that it
had no choice but to adopt Microsoft's browser in return for a
coveted place on the Windows desktop, it all added detail to the
government's picture of Microsoft as an arm-twisting monopolist,
stifling competition and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The government and states believe that they have shown not only
that Microsoft crossed the legal line repeatedly, but also that its
monopoly is fairly durable, a crucial consideration for the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think that Microsoft's operating system monopoly is
going to go away in two or three years, then we shouldn't have
brought this case,'' said Klein of the Justice Department. ``But I
obviously don't believe that. What this case is about is protecting
innovation to make a dynamic industry even more dynamic and
innovative.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft agrees that innovation is the goal, but counters that
heavy-handed antitrust enforcement is the real threat. Microsoft's
legal team insists that the law is on its side in this case,
despite the evidence presented by the government. They point to a
general drift of pro-defendant rulings in antitrust cases over the
last two decades, which speak approvingly of ``fierce,
no-holds-barred competition'' and ``the great race of
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what's in the government's case doesn't sound good,
but it doesn't rise to the level of an antitrust violation,'' said
Steven Holley, a Microsoft lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, Microsoft has leaned on two key themes. The
first, in essence, is: Our actions may have hurt some rival, but
where is the harm to competition in general and to consumers? And
the second theme, linked to the first, is: This is a vibrant
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The harm, the government and states reply, is that Microsoft's
actions would be fine if it were still a scrappy entrepreneurial
upstart rather than an industry-dominating force. ``What Microsoft
did not recognize is that it had crossed the line to become a
monopolist, so its behavior had to change,'' said Thomas Miller,
the Iowa attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft disputes the monopolist label, but argues that the
rules for dominant firms are not much different. ``We should be
competing as hard as we can for the next customer because that
behavior is good for consumers,'' Neukom of Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, clarifying the rules of legal behavior for powerful
companies in the modern economy could well be the lasting legacy of
the Microsoft case. ``This case can really determine the boundaries
on the conduct of dominant firms for decades,'' observed Kovacic of
George Washington University.

BIPARTISAN GROUP REINTRODUCES BILL TO PROTECT HOMOSEXUALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers on Thursday
introduced legislation to ban job discrimination against gays and
lesbians and expressed hope that it would win approval despite the
failure of two similar measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1999 (ENDA) would bar
employers from discriminating against homosexuals in hiring,
firing, promotion or compensation. If it becomes law, ENDA would
extend to gays and lesbians that same federal protections already
guaranteed for race, religion, gender, national origin, age and
disability.
</P>
<P>
   The ENDA bill does not require domestic partnership benefits and
doesn't apply to the armed services. It also contains an exemption
for religious organizations and prohibits employers from giving
special treatment or adopting quotas for gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters insist this version will be more popular than earlier
bills because the new legislation would prohibit affirmative action
or preferential treatment based on sexual orientation. In the past,
opponents have argued that the legislation would lead to special
treatment for homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The bill ``will achieve equal rights _ not `special rights'''
for gays and lesbians, Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., a key sponsor
of the bill, told a Thursday news conference. ``Success at work
should be directly related to one's ability to do the job,
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., another key sponsor, called it
``the next important step for civil rights in America.'' Kennedy
said Congress must take steps to achieve fairness for gay men and
lesbians who ``encounter blatant discrimination in the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., another sponsor, said the
case of James Hormel, a San Francisco businessman whose nomination
to be ambassador to Luxembourg was blocked in the Senate for 18
months because he is gay, ``underscores the vulnerability of the
average worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormel will be sworn in next week as ambassador to Luxembourg
because President Clinton intervened and used his constitutional
authority to make a recess appointment and install him directly
during the Memorial Day congressional recess. But, Lieberman said,
there is a need for the legislation because ``there is not such
thing as a recess appointment in the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., the main sponsor in the House,
said he is optimistic that Congress will approve the measure this
year, especially after the House last August voted overwhelming to
uphold Clinton's executive order banning discrimination based on
sexual orientation for federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   The new ENDA has a record number of 163 co-sponsors in the
House, including 15 Republicans, and 35 co-sponsors in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill came within one vote of passage in the Senate in
1996. The measure was reintroduced again in 1997 but failed to win
passage.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has never come up for a vote in the House.
</P>
<P>
   A leading Christian conservative has vowed to block the new
ENDA.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Lou Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values
Coalition, a conservative group that draws support from evangelical
churches, said homosexuals are not being unfairly discriminated
against in the workplace. He also said gays and lesbians are not a
true minority because they can ``disengage'' from a homosexual
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not in bread lines or unemployment lines or living
under bridges as homeless people,'' Sheldon said. ``Why then are we
elevating a behavior-based lifestyle to minority status?''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven states have passed laws to protect homosexuals from
discrimination in the workplace. They are Nevada, New Hampshire,
California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New
Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin and the District of
Columbia.

EVEN-HANDED TREATMENT CARRIES `GUERRILLA WARS' INSTALLMENT OF
`CENTURY' SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any card-carrying revolutionary will say winning hearts and
minds is the key to winning the bigger prize, be it a new
government, a new way of life or the same old way of life with some
new guy eating bon-bons in the imperial palace. In the next-to-last
airing of PBS's Peabody Award-winning ``People's Century,'' two
different methods of gaining popular support are placed in stark
counterpoint and examined with the cool dispassion that has made
``People's Century'' a history teacher's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guerrilla Wars,'' the first hour of Monday's two-part entry,
covers a lot of familiar ground. But because of its non-American
provenance _ ``People's Century'' is a BBC production in
cooperation with WGBH-Boston _ there's a refreshing balance that we
may not have realized was missing from U.S. reportage when the
events were taking place.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in ``People's Cen tury'' the accounts of
guerrilla-war tactics that stymied the United States in Southeast
Asia are neither
</P>
<P>
   pro-American nor pro-North Vietnamese. The facts are presented
not with an eye toward ideology, but more as a means of
illuminating a chapter of history that will forever be obscured by
philosophical posturing in many U.S. precincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guerrilla Wars'' producer Bill Treharne Jones is careful not
to gloat in the victory of a people's army over a superpower. He is
even more careful in showing the repetitious nature of history:
Though ``Guerrilla Wars'' is ostensibly about the withdrawal of
American troops from Vietnam in 1973, it begins with a brief
summary of the surprisingly swift and effective guerrilla campaign
that brought socialism to Cuba in the 1950s, and it ends with the
Soviet Union repeating the mistake of arrogant conceit in
Afghanistan in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of Monday's program looks at revolutions rooted
in the deployment of religion, not rifles. ``God Fights Back''
centers on the backlash that began in the second half of the
century after ``modern technology and Western thought had swept
religion to the margins of public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the documentary renders no judgment. Producer Ben
Loeterman is scrupulously evenhanded, whether he's dealing with the
rise of Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran or the explosion of
fundamentalist fervor in the United States. The issue isn't the
ayatollah's anti-Americanism or Jimmy Swaggart's personal
peccadilloes; it is the fusing of faith and politics into a
lightning rod that has galvanized millions of disaffected,
disenfranchised people around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Kerley, a follower of Swaggart's brand of televangelism,
succinctly summarizes the rhetoric that keeps a revolution rolling.
``What I liked about Jimmy Swaggart,'' Kerley says, ``was the fact
that when you watched him on TV, he had the ability to keep you on
fire. It was what you wanted to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``People's Century'' has a flaw, it is the dryness of its
delivery. Both John Forsythe and Alfre Woodard, who alternated as
narrators for all 26 PBS installments _ 13 last year, 13 this year
_ don't exactly make the subject matter come alive. Instead, they
give it the measured, understated approach that lets the topics
speak for themselves, underscoring the promise of executive
producer Zvi Dor-Ner, who allowed ``no pundits, no academics'' to
appear on camera.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the people who lived the history, such as Fidel
Castro in a rare glimpse of him speaking English, are what will
keep ``People's Century'' alive for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   People's Century. The 11th and 12th installments in the second
season of PBS's retrospective on the 20th century look at different
yet oddly similar ways of fomenting revolution. Monday at 9 p.m.

POLICE INFORMANT CHARGED IN BELFAST LAWYER'S KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ A former British soldier who worked as an undercover
agent for the police in Northern Ireland was charged Thursday with
killing a Belfast lawyer who represented IRA suspects in one of the
most contentious murders here in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   William Stobie, 48, stunned a courtroom here when he declared
his innocence, saying he had worked from 1987 to 1990 as an
informant for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, during which the
lawyer, Patrick Finucane, was shot dead in his West Belfast home as
he ate dinner with his wife and children in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   A group of English police detectives called in this year to
investigate Finucane's murder and this year's killing of another
lawyer who represented IRA suspects say Stobie supplied the gun
that was used in Finucane's murder and say he knows more than he is
telling about who did it. They say Stobie was in charge of
supplying weapons to the assassins of the Ulster Freedom Fighters,
a loyalist paramilitary group of Protestant extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Stobie is arrested at a sensitive time in Northern Ireland, when
the peace process is stalled over the fate of IRA weaponry. The
Ulster Unionists, who represent middle-class Protestants, refuse to
form a local government with Sinn Fein, whose voters support the
IRA, unless the IRA begins to disarm. Sinn Fein says there is
nothing in the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 that links IRA
disarming to their participation.
</P>
<P>
   A British government commission headed by Chris Patten, the last
British governor of Hong Kong, is about to recommend how to reform
the Royal Ulster Constabulary, or RUC. The allegations will aid the
argument by Irish Catholic nationalists that the police force,
which is 93 percent Protestant, must be fundamentally reformed.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mageean, a legal officer for the Committee for the
Administration of Justice, Northern Ireland's leading civil
liberties group, said Thursday's revelations were the most damning
in years of claims that the RUC colluded with loyalist paramilitary
groups in targeting suspected IRA members and sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   Mageean said the arrest of Stobie called into question the RUC's
earlier contention that it had nothing to do with Finucane's murder
after the Ulster Freedom Fighters chief intelligence officer, Brian
Nelson, admitted that he had set Finucane up to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   The RUC had claimed that Nelson was working as an informant for
the British Army, and that it had not been aware of a plan to kill
Finucane.
</P>
<P>
   But Stobie's claims contradict the RUC, suggesting that the
police were complicit in the plan to murder Finucane, a claim the
Finucane family has made for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Mageean said it was now a matter of public record that the
British government had on its payroll Nelson, the Ulster Freedom
Fighters chief intelligence officer, who targeted Catholic
nationalists for murder, and Stobie, the man who supplied hitmen
with weapons to carry out all such assassinations in the part of
Belfast where Finucance was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state controlled the man who targeted people for
assassination in the whole of Northern Ireland, and the man who
supplied guns in West Belfast, how was the (Ulster Freedom
Fighters) allowed to kill anyone during that period?'' Mageean
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Stobie's attorney, Joe Rice, told Judge John Cleary that Stobie
had been charged with firearms offenses in 1991, but that the
police had provided no evidence and he was found not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Mageean said those circumstances were highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a public explanation of what happened in
this case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stobie said he wanted ``to tell the truth'' about what happened
during his employment as an agent of the British government. He was
taken into custody without bail after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest raises new questions about the murder this year of
Rosemary Nelson, who like Finucane was a lawyer who represented IRA
suspects and who was killed by loyalist assassins in similar
circumstances. The RUC's chief constable, Ronnie Flanagan, allowed
the investigation into Nelson's murder to be transferred from his
detectives to a team headed by London's Metropolitan Police deputy
chief John Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who took Finucane's murder as well as Nelson's into his
responsibility, has made progress quickly where the RUC had not.
Within two months of his appointment, Stevens found evidence that
the RUC was not able or willing to bring forth, showing a RUC
informant had been involved in Finucane's murder.

CLASSES PUT OLDER WORKERS IN TOUCH WITH COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LATHAM, N.Y. _ Jane Willey tried to negotiate 54-year-old
fingers around an ovoid plastic lump and to learn the function of
the mouse and other foreign-sounding items on the first day of
computer training class.
</P>
<P>
   During Introduction to Windows '98 at IKON Office Solutions, the
trainer, Mary Carrier, 33, helped guide Willey's right hand to
double-click on an icon to change the computer's screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   Before the midmorning coffee break, Carrier tried to break the
ice with tentative, fearful older students by teaching them how to
play solitaire on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Willey, of Schenectady, who was laid off in April after 14 years
as an administrative assistant at an insurance company, never
expected to have to learn new technology in middle age. Or to be a
student taking instructions from a teacher two decades her junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm old enough to be her mother,'' Willey said of Carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Around New York's Capital Region, in antiseptic, air-conditioned
computer training classrooms, humming with the white noise of
pentium processors, a quiet revolution is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The generational tables have been turned across this retraining
landscape. People in their 40s and 50s have become the students
(``career changers'') and technological whiz kids in their 20s and
30s are their teachers (``trainers'').
</P>
<P>
   The trend has been fueled by the fallout of downsizing and plant
closings as well as a workplace increasingly reliant on workers
with computer expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients talk about the age factor all the time,'' said
Marilyn Itovitch, executive director of The Northeast New York
Alliance for Business, a nonprofit organization in Albany that
coordinates computer training and other services for people over 50
who have been laid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of fear, apprehension and self-esteem issues
hooked into this,'' Itovitch said. ``We try to address the age
factor right away and to reassure them that they're taking classes
because they need a new skill. Being older shouldn't be an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Itovitch's clients have quadrupled in the past five years and
now number more than 100. Although precise statistics are not
available for the trend, anecdotal evidence from companies that
provide computer retraining for career changers suggest that the
numbers are surging.
</P>
<P>
   The generational shift has been accompanied by a struggle on
both sides of the teacher's desk to examine and adapt attitudes
surrounding age, knowledge and authority.
</P>
<P>
   Carrier, a trainer at IKON for the past three years, said she
draws upon her master's degree in adult education as much as her
computer knowledge in working with older students who are out of
work and realize they need to upgrade their technology skills to be
competitive in today's job market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a unique learning style no matter what their age
is,'' Carrier said. ``The older students often feel intimidated,
and I try to recognize their fears and make sure I go slowly and
explain everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge is finding a common language,'' said
another IKON trainer, Eric Halse, 27.
</P>
<P>
   Halse said his students invariably stumble over what he at first
thought were simple instructions. When he says, ``Press any key,''
Halse often gets blank looks as his middle-aged career changers
search in vain for an ``NE'' key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer technology is full of lingo and it's a young
terminology, so I try to find analogies and examples that my older
students can relate to,'' Halse said. ``If you can get an older
student over their fear, they'll do fine.''
</P>
<P>
   At Computer Visions, a Colonie computer training firm, general
manager Pamela Smith searches for trainers in their 30s and 40s
with empathy to go with the technical side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older students respond better to mature trainers with more
life experience,'' Smith said. ``Trainers need to realize that
these older students are going through a very difficult life
transition and they're not thrilled to have to retrain to begin
with.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of clients at such training centers is surging. At
IKON, 15 classrooms are filled weekdays, nights and Saturdays with
more than 700 students. In 1992, IKON had just two classrooms and
20 students. It's already outgrown a new 25,000-square-foot
building near Albany International Airport, with an addition built
last fall and another anticipated, Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology training isn't cheap. Cynthia Gilchrist,
director of employment training with the Albany-Colonie Regional
Chamber of Commerce, estimated it typically costs between $5,000
and $12,000 for six months to one year of training, followed by a
certification test. Dislocated workers or those unemployed for more
than 15 weeks qualify for federal retraining funds, Gilchrist said.

<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ His debut CD has sold more than 3 million
copies, and when he takes the stage here, supported by a four-piece
electric band and two backup singers, thousands of his admirers
greet him with roars and applause. But Marcelo Rossi is not a pop
music idol: He is a Roman Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   At 32, Padre Marcelo, as the faithful here call him, has emerged
as the driving force and main symbol of the Charismatic Renovation
movement that is transforming the face of Catholicism in the
world's most populous Roman Catholic nation.
</P>
<P>
   Barely five years removed from the seminary, he has gone from
simple parish priest to Brazil's king of all media by ``adapting
the eternal message of the church to new methods of
communication,'' as he put it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the five Masses he celebrates each week here at the
Sanctuary of the Byzantine Rosary, a warehouse rented from a glass
factory, Rossi has a daily hourlong radio program that is broadcast
by 95 stations to every corner of this nation of 165 million
people. He also has his own daily TV program and is one of the most
sought-after guests on Sunday television variety programs because
his appearance automatically drives ratings up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel such an inner peace whenever I listen to him talk, so I
never miss a chance to see him or hear him,'' said Sebastiana
Pereira de Souza, 46, a fruit vendor, who says she has also bought
several copies of Rossi's record to give to friends. ``He transmits
the word of God with such tenderness, like an angel who has
descended among us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more than other Latin American countries, Brazil
has a long tradition of popular religiosity focused on charismatic
figures. The novelist Mario Vargas Llosa wrote about one such
leader, the 19th-century prophet Antonio Conselheiro, in ``The War
of the End of the World,'' and folk cults have grown up more
recently around Padre Cicero Romao and Frei Damiao, priests who
served in the same arid and impoverished northeastern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi may be another expression of that tendency, but he
``speaks to a very different audience in a very different way,''
said Ralph della Cava, an expert on religion in Brazil who teaches
at Queens College in New York. ``He addresses a largely urban
audience of young people in a world permeated by secular values,
proposing a set of alternative values through the medium that has
always been the most important in Brazil, the popular music of the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   His emergence is also notable because of where it occurs. Under
Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns in the 1970s and '80s, the Catholic
Church here in Brazil's largest city was a stronghold of liberation
theology, a blend of Catholic and Marxist doctrine that Pope John
Paul II has sought to discourage.
</P>
<P>
   During those stormy times, Rossi was ``a typical teen-ager, who
dated, played guitar and was not all that interested in church,''
his mother, Vilma, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   After serving a year in the Brazilian army, he became an
instructor at an exercise academy here, spending much of his
income, he said, on body-building supplements and equipment
intended to bulk up his 6-foot-4 athlete's frame.
</P>
<P>
   But after a favorite cousin died in a car accident and an aunt
was told she had cancer, both on the same day, he was plunged into
a spiritual crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that pain that led me back to the church,'' he said,
``and once I came back I fell in love with Catholicism and my faith
grew and grew,'' fed by his admiration for Pope John Paul II, ``who
had been an actor and athlete as a young man, full of strength and
vigor.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, traces of Rossi's days in the gym can be detected in
the way he celebrates Mass. As he sings rock-flavored tunes like
``Angels of God'' and ``I Breathe,'' he waves his arms and and
kneels and jumps about with an energy and fervor that recall James
Brown in his prime, inviting the faithful to do the same, and
afterward, he often leads the congregation in a session of what he
calls ``the Lord's aerobics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, the music you heard in church was enough to put you to
sleep,'' said Antonio Carlos de Oliveira, 57, an automobile worker
who attends three of Rossi's services each week. ``But not now. The
prayers are songs, so you feel better and you are also
participating. It's good for your health and good for your soul.''
</P>
<P>
   As his popularity and influence have grown, though, Rossi has
also drawn detractors. Fundamentalist Protestant ministers, who
have made significant inroads in Brazil in recent years, complain
vociferously that he has copied their preaching style and even
their musical repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Liberation theology advocates within the Roman Catholic Church
here have criticized him, too, though mostly indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eucharist is not a show,'' Monsignor Pedro Casaldaliga,
the combatively progressive bishop of Sao Felix do Araguaia in the
Amazon, said when asked about Rossi's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``What frightens me is to see a pop star priest,'' Frei Betto,
one of the leading theoreticians of liberation theology, wrote in a
recent essay addressed to Rossi. He added that, rather than
appearing on television, ``I prefer to appear among the excluded,
on the periphery, among the landless and homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossi said that though ``I had an initial prejudice against
liberation theology that was very strong,'' that is no longer the
case. ``Now I understand how important a role Dom Paulo played in
resisting censorship and how many people's lives he saved'' with
his human rights work during the military dictatorship that ruled
Brazil from 1964 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rossi maintained, over the years liberation theology has
led to ``a certain exaggeration of the social pastoral at the
expense of the Mass.'' And while ``the church has to give
preference to the poor, that must be done without excluding
others,'' he added. ``We need to seek an equilibrium.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a more traditionalist faction within the church
that, as Della Cava put it, sees Rossi's approach as ``not
intellectual enough, as fun-and-games, short-cut Christianity that
panders to popular opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   When a ``surfing priest,'' clearly emulating Rossi, started to
become popular in Rio de Janeiro and also recorded a CD, the
conservative hierarchy there quickly squelched his activities.
</P>
<P>
   To those conservative critics, Rossi replies that what he is
doing is merely using music to glorify the word of God, just as his
predecessors did centuries ago with Gregorian chants. And with a
grin, he buttresses his position with a citation from St.
Augustine: ``He who sings prays twice.''

A TOAST TO BUD COLLINS AT AWARD TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Today we pause to toast one of our own. The great Bud
Collins Thursday was presented the Red Smith Award at the annual
Associated Press Sports Editors convention and yours truly has the
delightful task of writing about Bud.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us who get into this business do it because it's fun and
nobody has more fun on the job than Bud Collins. I only wish all of
you could spend just one evening in his joyous presence.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great things about the Globe sports department is its
roster of writers who've become synonymous with the sport they
cover. Peter Gammons reinvented the way baseball was covered over
the last three decades, Fran Rosa wrote his way into the Hockey
Hall of Fame, Will McDonough is the top football expert in the
country, and Bob Ryan is rightfully known as ``Commissioner'' in
basketball circles.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there's Bud Collins _ the last word on
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Bud wrote the tennis encyclopdedia. Literally. He knows all the
players and they know him. I shall never forget the sight of Chris
Evert, walking off center court after losing a Wimbledon final to
Martina Navratilova, and greeting a microphone-wielding Collins, on
live television, with, ``Nice pants, Bud.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning moment. Here was one of the game's greatest
players, moments after an extremely difficult and celebrated
defeat, and the first thing out of her mouth is . . . ``Nice pants,
Bud.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud always had a way with the players. Only Bud could salute
each player in his or her native tongue, and finish the interview
with ``well done,'' in English, Spanish, Czech, or Romanian.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Globe sports editors Jerry Nason, Ernie Roberts,
Dave Smith, Vince Doria, and Don Skwar have sent Bud around the
world to cover the racquet circuit. Many a Globe rookie assigned to
Longwood has leaned on Bud to meet the people and learn the game.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Globe newcomer, Shira Springer, wrote of Bud's
``colorful prose and pants to match.'' Nice line. Shira can only
hope someday Bud shows her around Wimbledon or the US Open. Going
to a tennis event with Bud Collins is like going to the Academy
Awards with Jack Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud knows everybody,'' says television sportscaster Lesley
Visser, who covered a dozen Wimbledons with Bud. ``When I started
covering tennis, I'd just tell players, `I work for the Globe. I
know Bud Collins.' That was my credential. And then the player
would always say, `What do you need?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to make tennis fun for the masses with crisp and
inventive writing. He is so much more than a sportswriter. He's a
historian, an ambassador, the book of knowledge for the game. I
remember so many times on deadline, there would be a line of
reporters from different countries and everyone had a question for
Bud _ `Who's the first Romanian woman to get to the semifinals?' _
and he would know.''
</P>
<P>
   Even non-tennis people know and love his work. Speaking
informally at his Florida kitchen last summer, Ted Williams
launched into a passionate pledge of allegiance to Bud:
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, that Bud Collins knows tennis. He used to write some
(expletive) about me when I played and I wasn't so sure about him,
but now I like watching the tennis on television and I've learned
so much from listening to him. You tell him, he's the best!''
</P>
<P>
   Bud wasn't always strictly a tennis guy. He covered the Red Sox
during the Impossible Dream season of 1967 and hung out with
Muhammad Ali when the champ was still Cassius Clay. He covered the
Olympics, the British Open, and went on a patrol with the US
Marines as part of an assignment during the Vietnam War. He's even
well versed in Groton-St. Mark's. And who else can say they coached
Abbie Hoffman in tennis at Brandeis? (Bud liked to say that Hoffman
played a conservative game, never rushing the net.)
</P>
<P>
   Bud wrote for the Boston Herald before joining the Globe in
1963. He became a Globe part-timer when he went to work for TV for
keeps in 1974. He gave us colorful nicknames like the Belleville
Basher (Jimmy Connors), the Bucharest Buffoon (Ilie Nastase), The
Great Whomping Crane (Pam Shriver), and most recently, Sisters
Sledgemhammer (Venus and Serena Williams). I can't wait to see what
he does with Belarus's Anna Smashnova.
</P>
<P>
   He's already in the tennis Hall of Fame. Now he joins a lofty
circle of past Smith Award winners including Jim Murray, Shirley
Povich, Edwin Pope, Dave Kindred, Dave Anderson, Jerome Holtzman,
and Red Smith himself.
</P>
<P>
   What I remember most is his willingness to help young people and
his generosity. Never a media ``star'' Bud's always happy to answer
random office phone calls with his favorite salutation, ``Globe
sporting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud accepted his award via satellite from Wimbledon Thursday. He
said, ``I've always felt I was a newspaper guy,'' then added,
``Let's have fun. Let's make the deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   He always has fun. He always makes the deadline. And as always,
I can't wait to read his column from Wimbledon.
</P>

 &HT;    Kubrick still an enigma
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Stanley Kubrick died March 7, cinephiles
moaned, Hollywood shuddered and Harry Knowles' Web site, perhaps
the best grief index of all, turned into an impromptu counseling
center, a congested Wailing Wall of shock and disbelief expressed
in ALL CAPS and thickets of exclamation points. Knowles told
readers he felt physically sick.
</P>
<P>
   The world, meanwhile, kept spinning.
</P>
<P>
   What was there to say? By all accounts, the hermitic Kubrick was
finished with his last film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' about which little
is known. The sexually frank drama, starring Tom Cruise and Nicole
Kidman, will be released July 16. The rest is innuendo and wishful
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is the great director's first film in 12
years. He made five films in the past three decades, and they,
along with four of his earlier works, will enjoy a special,
``Kubrick-approved'' release Tuesday on video and DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Bronx in 1928, Kubrick moved to the English
countryside in 1961, where he led an impressively reclusive
existence away from Hollywood, the press and the public. As with
Austinite Terrence Malick, to find a recent photograph of the
director is an otherworldly feat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we mourn the passing of the nonpareil creator of ``Dr.
Strangelove,'' ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' ``A Clockwork Orange''
and ``The Shining.'' And now, nearly four months since his
un-Kubrickian death (quietly in his rural England home; nothing
less than a mushroom cloud of fiery egress would've been proper),
he haunts us with the video package and the wildly anticipated
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' and this gives us pause.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick will be missed in death.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but ... he was missed in life.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick, like Malick, Salinger and Bigfoot, was a confounding
celebrity, an enigma wrapped in a pain in the behind. He was
obstinate in his obstinacy, secretive in his secrecy,
uncompromising in his uncompromising-ness. It was like he was
already dead.
</P>
<P>
   He was, they said, brilliant and cerebral, which isn't always an
asset for an artist, who's supposed to run on impulse and emotional
surprise. His films frequently feel mechanical and overcalculated.
Cold technique reins; emotion is muzzled. He was a perfectionist
toiling in an imperfect field.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, his films could be brittle things that didn't
always fare so well outside of the Kubrick hot house. Hitchcock's
work springs to mind, but rarely did Hitch sacrifice narrative flow
for his pretty pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Around the time of 1962's ``Lolita,'' Kubrick lost interest in
the simple story and, some argue, people. It was as if he found a
higher calling and shifted from moviemaker to Artist. He lavished
energy on making every frame a masterwork, with fanatical attention
to costume, art direction and lighting, and little to actors. Each
image served a purpose, and nothing was arbitrary. His epic
shooting schedules are legendary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very tenacious, independent filmmaker who followed
his own muse; there's no question about it,'' director Robert
Altman, another Hollywood outsider, recently told me. (Like most
people, Altman ``never saw him face to face. I knew him on the
telephone.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``We approached film in quite a different manner,'' Altman said.
``He was very, very precise and control-oriented, and I don't do
films that way. I can't do that kind of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Few filmmakers can.
</P>
<P>
   Even fewer can boast an oeuvre as ranging and extraordinary as
Kubrick's. He made three war movies, two noirs, two grand-scale
historical epics, two biting social-political satires, a horror
film and two kinky ones. In them, he explored themes of violence,
anomie, obsession, the macabre, hypocrisy and the tragic limits of
human intelligence. There's not a routine movie in the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   When he died, at age 70, he was hailed as a genius, a giant and,
inevitably, a god. Kubrick would savor the paradox: It took death
to make him mortal.

 &HT;    Finding theatre in Philadelphia, P(erforming) A(rts)
 &HT;    By Michael Barnes
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It's no joke. The next American theatrical hub _
outside New York City _ may not be Chicago, Seattle, Washington,
D.C., San Francisco or another artistic center. Instead, new plays,
new acting careers and new energy are emanating from a city that
might surprise you _ Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   A recent gathering of the American Theatre Critics Association
in the City of Brotherly Love proved that it is no longer a
theatrical stepchild of Manhattan. For more than a century, it
hosted Broadway try-outs without creating its own distinct theater
culture. Now, seething with activity, the nation's fifth-largest
entertainment market is home to more than 50 substantial theater
companies, several of them quite innovative.
</P>
<P>
   The largest group occupies one of the nation's oldest theater
buildings. Built in 1809, the Walnut Street Theatre was rescued
from destruction in the 1960s. It underwent some disastrous
renovations this century, ruining some of its former intimacy, but
the Walnut Street remains drenched in history. Now its nonprofit
company presents popular seasons of mainstream plays and musicals,
attracting tens of thousands of subscribers a year. The critics saw
a finely crafted, though less than scintillating version of the
musical ``Grand Hotel,'' directed by former Houstonian Bruce
Lumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   Far more noteworthy was ``Violet,'' a new musical by Jeanine
Tesori and Brian Crawley, produced by Arden Theatre Company. With
two new stages located in the touristy Old City neighborhood, this
group offers heartier material than the Walnut's. ``Violet''
certainly qualifies in this category. The story of a severely
scarred young woman crossing America on a bus, it previously
received a short off-Broadway run, but Arden reanimated it with a
mobile set and a winning cast who liberated its tuneful score.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia is committed to the musical format, as home to the
American Music Theater Festival, which has created some 70 new
musicals since 1984. Its latest, presented at the handsome Prince
Music Theater, is ``Somewhere Over the Rainbow, Yip Harburg's
America.'' This revue, construed from Tin Pan Alley lyricist
Harburg's 550 songs, including standards from ``The Wizard of Oz,''
was still previewing when critics saw it. It needs some work. (It
was startling to see Marsh Hanson as one of the show's five
singers. Hanson played Tony in Austin Musical Theatre's ``West Side
Story'' last season.)
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think Philadelphia is only about musicals _ it also
anchors two musical touring houses, the fabulous Academy of Music
opera house and another, under-construction regional performing
arts center _ there are substantial companies that excel at dramas
and comedies. The Philadelphia Theatre Company has been winning
laurels for its contemporary plays, many of them premieres, for
years. Performing in the dusty, but delightful old Plays and
Players Theatre, the company produced a well-synchronized version
of the Martin McDonaugh hit ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' An
unforgiving comedy/drama about an Irish mother and daughter waging
domestic war, it fell just short of being quite nasty enough, but
nonetheless swept us into its psychological vortex.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilma Theater performs in a new, no-nonsense space on Broad
Street, downtown's central axis that has been dubbed Avenue of the
Arts by the current municipal administration. ($450 million is
pouring into new arts spaces under way, on or near this spruced-up
avenue.) Its version of Tennessee Williams' ``Orpheus Descending''
vaguely recalled the Peter Hall production seen on Broadway almost
a decade ago, but it was still impressive in its acting firepower.
I'm confident we'll hear more from this company, which finds
inspiration in cross-cultural dramatic literature.
</P>
<P>
   Located in suburban Malvern, the People's Light &AMP; Theatre
Company splits its season between two stages, both enclosed in a
gorgeous garden setting. While some critics saw a revival of a
Feydeau farce, I was more interested in Russell Davis' strange
drama, ``Sally's Gone, She Left Her Name.'' A muffled,
psychological journey into a middle-class family's breakdown, it
turned into several hours of quiet tedium. Nonetheless, it was
gratifying to see such artistic ambition far from the city's core.
</P>
<P>
   The play most favored by critics was Israel Horovitz's
``Lebensraum,'' a fantasy about the return of Jews to a future
Germany. Superbly acted by a three-actor cast playing dozens of
characters, this comedy is a bold act of imagination, staged by the
small but well-regarded InterAct Theatre Company. Part of the
National New Play Network, it is clearly in the league with
parallel Austin groups, such as Frontera (at) Hyde Park Theatre,
Salvage Vanguard Theater and Rude Mechanicals.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's critics, who have visited some theatrically vibrant
cities over the past few years, could not stop commenting on the
quality and quantity of theater available in Philadelphia. Clearly,
the city's conscious effort to push the arts in order to reactivate
a dreary downtown has also pushed its artists into new territory.
In the back of my mind, I kept thinking, ``If it could happen in
Philadelphia, it could happen anywhere.

TRADE A SURPRISE, GORI SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUPEN FOFARIA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It's not that he's unhappy with the deal. Mario Gori
just doesn't understand it.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Argentine defender who was traded to the Miami
Fusion six months ago after three years with D.C. United was traded
again. This time, Gori was dealt to the Revolution for midfielder
Edwin Gorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' said Gori, who learned about the deal
from Miami coach Ivo Wortmann. ``I said to him, `You're kidding,
right?' I mean, I was starting there and everything was great. I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Gori has nothing in particular against coming to New England, he
just isn't thrilled about moving again. He had no clue how he would
explain it to his family, which includes his wife, 1-year-old son,
and his parents (who flew to Miami nine days ago from Argentina to
visit for a month).
</P>
<P>
   When he played in Argentina's First Division, he didn't have to
deal with trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``(D.C. United) told me a month before,'' Gori said. ``They said
this is a good move for you _ new experience with a new team, a
young team. So I said, `OK, no problem.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was starting in Miami, and now this happened. So now I
will play 100 percent for New England. Against D.C., against Miami,
against everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The best gift Gori ever received was his first pair of soccer
cleats, which his parents gave him when he was growing up in
Rosario, Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   He used to play soccer all day on any open field he could find.
And it was on those fields that Gori learned to kick the ball, get
past a defender and score a goal, check an opponent and clear the
ball. It was on those fields that he learned to play _ and love _
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he didn't learn about on those fields was trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MLS is different than other leagues (because they) trade
in the middle of the season,'' said Gori. ``I think it's bad for
the player. But we work for the MLS.''
</P>
<P>
   Gori said he won't let the fact that he has been traded twice
this year get to him. He doesn't play so any one team will like
him. He plays because he loves to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play hard,'' said Gori, who is known for his aggressive
style. ``I don't like to play dirty, I like to play hard. I play a
very intense 90 minutes, and I love to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we can play great, sometimes we can play a bad game.
But the more important thing is play with the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Swapping the 36-year-old Gorter for 26-year-old Gori adds youth
to the Revolution, and it also adds some championship experience.
Gori was a starter on the 1996 United team that won the inaugural
MLS title. He was hampered by injuries the last two seasons _ a
torn ACL in his right knee in 1997 and knee and shoulder troubles
in '98.

HOUSE PASSES BILL TO CURB GOVERNMENT SEIZURES OF PRIVATE PROPERTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an unusual show of bipartisan cooperation, the
House voted 375-48 Thursday to make it harder for the federal
government to seize private property from people without filing
criminal charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the
legislation is needed to remedy what he saw as an ``oppressive
instrument'' used to abuse the rights of innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill puts civil liberties and due process back into our
judicial system,'' Hyde said during a floor debate on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   It would dramatically overhaul the nation's civil forfeiture
laws, which allow federal agents to seize the assets of suspects
without a hearing, a trial or even an arrest _ and often allow the
government to keep the assets after suspects are acquitted or their
cases are dropped without an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, civil forfeiture laws require defendants to prove
at their own expense that their property was never linked to any
criminal activity if they want to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of seized properties are associated
with drug cases.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the laws contend that hundreds of innocent people
have been victimized by overzealous federal and state law
enforcers, who view seizing money and property as a way to stop
drug dealers _ and to fortify their budgets. Hyde pointed out that
in most cases, the assets seized go directly to the state or local
agency that made the bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be like traffic cops got half of every ticket they wrote
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Justice Department officials, in the past
decade the federal government has averaged $500 million a year in
seizures, mostly in cash, but also in property such as cars, boats
and planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can take your home, your farm, your car, most anything
you own without even proving that you have broken the law,'' said
Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who said 80 percent of those whose
property is seized are never charged.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's fate in the Senate remained unclear. No similar
measure has been offered there, but a spokeswoman for Judiciary
Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he is looking at introducing a
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Among the incidents cited as reasons to change the law were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Richard Apfelbaum, a salesman from Sunshine, Fla., flying to
Las Vegas in 1992 with $9,640 in cash to use for gambling, was
stopped during a layover at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport by Drug
Enforcement Agency officials who were suspicious of his one-way
ticket. They asked to search his bag, and he agreed. They seized
his money, concluding that such a large sum of cash must be related
to illegal drug activity. But Apfelbaum was not detained or charged
with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   For several months, he tried to retrieve his money, posting the
required 10 percent bond and spending $2,000 in attorney's fees. In
the end, Apfelbaum gave up, saying, ``I'm not in a position to
spend $10,000 in legal fees trying to get $9,000 back.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A Los Angeles man, Hosep Bajakajian, traveling to Syria in
1994 had to go to the Supreme Court to get back $357,144 seized by
customs officials. The cash was not tied to any crime and it would
have been legal to take it out of the country if Bajakajian had
alerted authorities that he was carrying more than $10,000. Noting
the maximum criminal penalty for the offense was $5,000, the high
court overturned the seizure in 1998 for being ``grossly
disproportionate'' to Bajakajian's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's bill has drawn support from unusual array of ideological
opposites. In the House Judiciary Committee, it was sponsored by
many of the main combatants in the impeachment fight including the
ranking Democrat, John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, staunch
conservative Bob Barr Jr., R-Ga., and outspoken liberal Barney
Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bill has been backed by such disparate
organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union and the
National Rifle Association, as well as groups of bankers, lawyers,
realtors, developers, boat owners and anti-tax activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you only see this kind of coalition about every 10
years,'' Conyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's bill would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Require the government to prove that the property seized was
part of a criminal act. Under the existing procedure, the property
owners must prove that it was not used in a crime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raise the standard of proof to one of ``clear and convincing
evidence'' that the property was linked to a crime. Now the
government needs to show only ``probable cause'' to seize suspect
property.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow federal judges to order disputed property released to
the owner pending final disposition of the case in instances where
the owner can show that loss of the property would create a
``substantial hardship.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Remove a current requirement that an owner post a bond equal
to 10 percent of the property's value in order to get a hearing to
challenge the government's claim.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enable judges to appoint an attorney for property owners who
cannot afford the cost of pressing claims for return of their
belongings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow a property owner to sue the government for any damage or
destruction of the seized property while in its possession.
</P>
<P>
   _ Award interest to a property owner who succeeds in getting any
seized money back.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and many national law enforcement groups
have fought hard to kill or weaken the Hyde bill.
</P>
<P>
   Department spokesman Myron Marlin said Thursday that civil
forfeiture laws are an ``incredibly effective tool'' for
authorities to deprive criminals of the assets they need. But he
added that the department is open to working with Congress on a
bill.

SPORTS COLUMN: `NO WONDER HE'S NO. 1' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harrison, N.Y. _ On the 565-yard par-5 fifth hole at the
Westchester Country Club, David Duval's drive seemed to be soaring
toward a landing strip somewhere in New Rochelle before it hopped
to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you look where Duval is!'' a voice in the gallery sighed.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval's little white ball, about a clublength short of the
tangled rough that crosses the fairway, was 325 downhill yards from
the tee and 240 downhill yards to the green. He took a 3-iron, then
switched to a 2-iron that he drilled into the middle of the green,
about 20 feet from the cup. Two-putt birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder he's No. 1,'' another voice said.
</P>
<P>
   Through eight holes in Thursday's opening round of the Buick
Classic, Duval had not played like the No. 1 golfer in the world
rankings. After starting on the 10th hole, wandering drives had
cost him a double-bogey at the 15th and a bogey at the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied the long 18th and the third, then flubbed a chip shot
from behind the fourth green the way a duffer would, but holed a
12-foot putt from the fringe to save par. With another birdie at
the uphill 505-yard ninth, he finished at one-under-par 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not where you wanted to be?'' somebody suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I am,'' Duval, his wraparound sunglasses now atop
his blue cap, was saying outside the scorer's trailer. ``I can't be
concerned with where I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And as much as anything else, maybe that's why he's No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval is concerned with reality, not with the translucent
title of being No. 1 in the world ranking. He doesn't wave his
right index finger. No golfer ever has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being No. 1 is not the biggest deal,'' he said. ``Winning golf
tournaments is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially major golf tournaments, none of which Duval has yet
won. His next opportunity will be the British Open, starting July
15 at Carnoustie where he played in the 1995 Scottish Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to remember it was pretty tranquil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnoustie might not be tranquil this time. With wind and rain,
it could be more difficult than Pinehurst No. 2 was at last week's
U.S. Open when Duval, only a shot off Payne Stewart's lead after
the third hole in Sunday's final round, finished with a 5-over-par
75 and 287, tied for seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Pinehurst,'' he said, ``the difference between playing
really good and good was eight shots.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the exact difference between his 3-under-par 67 that
shared the first round lead and his last two rounds of 75-75 on
Pinehurst No. 2's turtleback greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I told the Mets,'' he said, ``it was like trying to
hit a 6-iron onto the pitcher's mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval threw out the first ball at Shea Stadium on Tuesday night
after taking batting practice with three other touring pros _ Bob
Tway, Mike Hulbert and Doug Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``No homers,'' he said, ``but I one-hopped one into the Bud Lite
sign in left field.''
</P>
<P>
   He batted righthanded, the way he plays golf, but sometimes he's
lefthanded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amphibious,'' he said, smiling. ``I shoot a rifle
lefthanded. I shoot pool lefthanded. I play ping-pong with either
hand. If I played hockey, I'd probably shoot righthanded. Sometimes
I fool around hitting golf balls lefthanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for next week's Canadian Skins Game, the Buick Classic
will be Duval's last tournament until the British Open. In other
years here he tied for eighth in 1995, missed the cut in 1996, and
tied for 27th in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful up here,'' the 27-year-old Floridian said.
``When you think of New York, you don't think of it being this
beautiful this close to the city. I just love it here and I love
the fans here.''
</P>
<P>
   And they love him. Standing on the edge of the practice putting
green after his round, he signed hats, golf balls and pairing
sheets for at least 10 minutes until more than 40 of those fans had
the autograph of the world's No. 1 golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider that part of our responsibility on the tour,'' he
said. ``We get paid well, and I represent Titleist and Tommy
Hilfiger. And there weren't that many people. If there's a big
crowd, you can't always sign for everybody, but today I could.''
</P>
<P>
   After he shot a record-tying 59 in winning the Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic earlier this year, David Duval joked that ``I have some
things to work on'' at the practice range, but after Thursday's 70
he smiled and said, ``I'm just going to work on some lunch.''

 THE NEXT EDITOR OF HARPER'S BAZAAR COMES FROM RIVAL VOGUE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After months of white hot speculation in the
notoriously gossipy magazine world, Cathleen P. Black, the
president of Hearst Magazines, has plucked the next editor in chief
of Harper's Bazaar from the ranks of an archrival.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Betts, the fashion news director at Conde Nast's Vogue
and considered the heir apparent to Anna Wintour, resigned her post
Friday and will take over as editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar on
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Betts, who is nine months pregnant _ she was due to deliver
her baby Friday _ will take a two-month leave before officially
assuming her new responsibilities as the replacement for the late
Elizabath Tilberis, who remade the magazine into a sleek, modern
magazine with an emphasis on dramatic design and fashion
photography. Ms. Betts' first full issue will be the December
issue, and will appear on newsstands in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Betts, who has worked with Ms. Wintour for the last eight
years, was previously an editor for the Fairchild Publications unit
of the Walt Disney Co., writing about fashion from Paris for W and
Women's Wear Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Betts, who is 35, takes over as Harper's Bazaar has
struggled a bit in the face of flat fashion advertising and the
rise of lifestyle magazines that focus less on fashion. While Ms.
Betts has directed most of her energies toward covering the fashion
industry, her vision for the magazine, she said, includes a set of
plans to focus on features and life-style articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal will be to extend the focus of the magazine by
establishing it as the style source for readers,'' she said,
``adding fashionable people and writers with engaging voices to the
very modern mix of fashion, design and photography that Bazaar has
come to represent in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``American women are definitely interested in fashion. But
fashion is happening in places not necessarily on the runway. I
hope to bring that mix of fashion and features to Bazaar, exploring
the lifestyle connection to fashion, and the Hollywood connection,
which is where a lot of exciting thigns are happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Black said that the selection of Ms. Betts was ``not just
about clothes. Kate is a very contemporary woman, and can relate to
women between the ages of 30 to 45 and how they are thinking about
their lives.'' She said: ``Her view extends into the home, into
arts and entertainment, and every other aspect of our 21st century
life styles.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogue leads the four major fashion magazines, with an average
circulation of 1.2 million and in 1998, a total of 2,681 ad pages.
according to the Publishers Information Bureau. Harper's Bazaar's
circulation is 732,572 _ third behind Elle, which is published by
Hachette-Filipacchi Magazines, a unit of Lagardere Group _ and the
fourth, behind W, in advertising. Last year it carried a total of
1,542 ad pages.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Hearst has raided the Conde Nast
cabinet _ or tapped a protegee of Ms. Wintour's _ for the position
of Harper's Bazaar editor. Ms. Tilberis was editor in chief of the
British edition of Vogue when she took over Harper's Bazaar, and
had previously worked for Ms. Wintour at British Vogue as fashion
director. Ms. Black at Hearst said she did not choose Ms. Betts to
weaken Conde Nast.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our industry, we go for talent,'' Ms. Black said. ``It
didn't matter if Kate had worked at Women's Wear Daily. This was
about finding an incredibly talented and creative editor to take
Harper's Bazaar to new heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Betts has long been considered a rising editor at Conde
Nast, a unit of Advance Publications. A graduate of Princeton, she
has written extensively for Vogue, often about popular culture, and
directed much of the magazine's fashion coverage.
</P>
<P>
   About losing her second in command to the competition, Ms.
Wintour said: ``Kate is a good friend of mine. She's a terrific
girl and I could not be more pleased for her. Competition is a good
thing. It's a healthy thing. It's good for the magazine. It keeps
you on your toes. So I look at that as a very positive thing.''
</P>
<P>
   One concern of advertisers had been that Ms. Betts would not be
able to take the reins early enough to woo advertisers for the
September issue. Ms. Black said that Ms. Tilberis, the magazine's
editor in chief who died of ovarian cancer in April, had planned
issues far in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liz had really done a lot of work on the early fall issues,''
she said. ``September is basically done. We will involve Kate in
top editorial decisions, but she obviously can't be involved in
every page that goes into the October issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Betts is married to Chip Brown, a magazine writer and author
who has written for many magazines, including Vanity Fair, Conde
Nast Traveler, the New Yorker, Esquire and Harper's Bazaar.

COMPAQ, CMGI SAY THEY'RE TALKING ALTAVISTA DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. and Internet firm CMGI Inc. made it
official Thursday, saying they are discussing a deal that would
give CMGI partial or total control of Compaq's AltaVista Internet
search engine.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement confirmed rumors that have circulated in
financial markets throughout the week. Both companies refused to
provide details of the negotiations and stressed that a deal may
not be consummated.
</P>
<P>
   An acquisition of AltaVista would make CMGI a major investor in
two top Internet search sites. The Andover, Mass. company also owns
about 20 percent of Lycos Inc. and is rumored to be interested in
acquiring a controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI may have a rival bidder in Atlanta-based Mindspring
Enterprises Inc. Mindspring, a major Internet service provider,
announced Thursday it is actively seeking to combine with other
Internet businesses to strengthen its competitive position.
Mindspring founder Charles Brewer has said Lycos is one of several
firms that might make a good partner.
</P>
<P>
   But if CMGI takes control of both Lycos and AltaVista, it's not
clear how well these assets would fit together. Both Lycos and
AltaVista are well-established brand names on the Internet,
attracting millions of visitors every month. And each uses its own
sophisticated technology for performing Internet searches. Lycos is
based on research done at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University,
while AltaVista was created by engineers at Digital Equipment
Corp., which Compaq purchased last year.

   Melissa Bane, an Internet analyst for the Yankee Group in
Boston, thinks CMGI may be interested in buying AltaVista mainly to
get at its valuable brand name, as well as its recently acquired
on-line shopping service, Shopping.com. ``AltaVista could easily be
broken up for its better parts,'' Bane said.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI and Compaq say their proposed deal would include some kind
of ``strategic partnership.'' This makes sense to analyst Ullas
Naik of First Albany Corp. in Boston. ``I think it would be
essential for Compaq,'' said Naik, noting that other major computer
makers such as Dell Computer Corp. and Gateway 2000 Inc. are
setting up their own Internet services as a way to build long-term
relationships with their customers. Naik thinks any deal to spin
off AltaVista will include an arrangement to make the site the
primary Internet destination for purchasers of Compaq computers.

   Meanwhile, engineers and marketers at Lycos revealed their
roadmap for offering Internet services especially tailored to home
users with high-speed Internet connections. An initiative called
Lycos Lightning will result in the gradual rollout of new features
that take advantage of the ability to download Internet data at
millions of bits per second.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos chief content officer Mark Simmer says that for years to
come, most Internet users will rely on slow telephone modems,
rather than high-speed cable modems and the new DSL telephone
services. Therefore, Lycos won't launch a unified suite of
high-speed services. Instead, said Simmer, ``we're identifying
things that people will do today that we think will be compelling
high-speed applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Lycos has already begun to offer some of these services, such as
a special search engine designed to seek out music files recorded
in the popular MP3 format. MP3 files reproduce music with very high
fidelity, but the files are millions of bytes long and are best
downloaded over a high-speed Internet connection. Still, even
people with slow modems can use the Lycos service to locate and
download music.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Is it 1994 all over again, the beginning of a
prolonged series of interest rate increases intended to wring
inflationary pressures out of an economy that is threatening to
overheat?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it 1997, when the Federal Reserve bumped interest rates up
once just to let everyone know it was on the case, and then let the
economy go on its rip-roaring way?
</P>
<P>
   Economists and investors are all but certain that the Fed will
push its benchmark lending rate up by a modest quarter of a
percentage point next week in a pre-emptive strike against the
possibility of resurgent inflation. And while neither 1994 nor 1997
provides a precise analogy for the current situation, what everyone
wants to know is whether the central bank will be content with a
tap or two on the monetary brakes to reassert its
inflation-fighting credibility, or whether the Fed will embark on a
more vigorous series of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, hinted in congressional
testimony last week that the central bank itself did not know yet
how far it would have to go to deny inflation a foothold, and would
decide based on how the economy performed in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do is make the best judgments we can at the
particular time that we meet, or if it is relevant, between
meetings,'' Greenspan told the Joint Economic Committee. ``I don't
recall ever having a sense that we are going to do a series of
increases or decreases.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, assuming no significant acceleration or slowdown in
economic activity over the next few months, the odds now seem to
favor an in-between scenario in which the Fed tightens its
benchmark federal funds target rate by a quarter point next week,
to 5 percent, and then perhaps once more by another quarter point
later in the summer, before shifting back into neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Although the economy has repeatedly proved to be far stronger
than analysts predicted the last several years, many economists
think the combination of two modest rate increases by the Fed,
combined with the rise the last few months in long-term rates set
by the bond market, should be enough to slow the economy to a point
where inflation recedes as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The view the market has now, and we agree with it, is that
another rate hike is coming, but that this round of tightening will
not have to be aggressive,'' said James Glassman, an economist at
Chase Securities in New York. ``The market now seems priced for
another quarter-point move in August, and that's it for a while
until we see how things work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The judgments made by Greenspan and his colleagues in coming
months will be among the trickiest they have faced in several
years. While they now appear comfortable shifting their attention
from financial conditions around the world back to the situation in
the United States, Greenspan in particular will have to balance his
oft-expressed belief in the inflation-dampening power of increased
productivity against his fear of endangering the domestic price
stability of the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   For all the obvious comparisons, policy-makers may draw little
guidance from their experiences raising rates in 1994 and 1997.
While the Fed, for example, also acted in 1994 to head off
inflation before it took root, it started at a time when monetary
policy was far looser than it is today. The Fed funds rate stood at
just 3 percent when, in February 1994, the central bank made the
first of seven increases that over the course of a year doubled the
rate to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's immediate goal this time around is not so much to
squelch inflation _ there is almost no inflation _ as it is to head
off the forces that can create inflation. Although a rebound in oil
prices has helped push the Consumer Price Index up somewhat this
year, the one-month spike in April of seven-tenths of a percent is
now widely viewed as an aberration, and by most measures prices
remained stable last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the time being, inflation remains exceptionally quiescent,
with the year-over-year increase in consumer prices, excluding food
and energy, falling to 2.1 percent, the lowest rate in more than 30
years,'' economists at Goldman, Sachs told clients in a report this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's somewhat more nebulous target is demand for goods and
services, which has been running at consistently robust levels. In
the view of most Fed officials, the combination of strong demand
growth and extremely low unemployment is potentially volatile. Left
unchecked, they say, strong demand will ultimately force companies
to bid up wages to find the employees they need in a dwindling pool
of available workers _ and rising wages could ultimately lead
companies to raise prices, setting off an inflationary spiral.
</P>
<P>
   But the trick for the Fed will be to temper demand without
setting off a destabilizing rout on Wall Street, where ever-higher
stock prices have left many consumers feeling flush and willing to
spend. And the Fed will have to act in the face of opposition from
some members of both parties who say the central bank is
sacrificing jobs and wage increases in pursuit of a problem that
does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make policy on the basis of the fear of inflation, we
will inevitably forgo the very benefits that have been so crucially
important to working families these last three years,'' John
Sweeney, the president of the AFL-CIO, told a news conference on
Capitol Hill Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One way that Fed officials and economists generally are framing
the debate is to compare the economy and monetary policy last
summer to conditions today.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, before the global financial crisis became acute and
began threatening markets in the United States, the Fed's benchmark
federal funds target rate stood at 5.5 percent _ three-quarters of
a percentage point higher than today's _ and the central bank was
leaning toward pushing rates higher. Only the need to stabilize
markets at home and around the world led the Fed to reverse policy
and cut rates three times in the fall in quarter-point increments.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the global crisis apparently past and demand from both
Europe and Japan likely to pick up, one camp of economists makes
the case that if a Fed funds rate of 5.5 percent or higher was
appropriate last summer, it is appropriate now.
</P>
<P>
   After all, unemployment, which was 4.5 percent last August, has
declined to 4.2 percent. Growth in gross domestic product, which
was 3.7 percent in the summer quarter last year, jumped to 6
percent later in the year and remained a torrid 4.1 percent in this
year's first quarter. And the Dow Jones industrial average, which
stood at around 8,500 just before the financial crisis flared last
August, closed Thursday at 10,534.83, a jump of nearly 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute,
said a series of rate increases now could be seen as a continuation
of a tightening policy that began not last summer but as far back
as March 1997, when the Fed pushed rates up by a quarter point, to
5.5 percent. Only the initial outbreak of the Asian crisis in the
summer of 1997 and the steady spread of financial problems around
the world the next year, he said, kept the Fed from tightening
further in that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``This string of unprecedented financial shocks can be viewed as
an interruption in a Fed process of tightening in response to
strong U.S. demand growth initiated over two years ago,'' Makin
said in a recent report. ``Given that it was on track to tighten in
spring 1997, the Fed would be reasonable to contemplate taking back
the 75 basis points of easing last fall in response to systemic
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But another group of economists, influenced in part by
Greenspan, points out that the economy today is not the same as
last summer's _ that the most significant changes since then are an
increase in the growth of productivity, or output for each hour
worked, and a deceleration in the pace of wage increases despite
the declining unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   Both factors suggest that the economy is less inflation prone
than it was last summer. The rise in productivity means companies
can offset cost increases with improved efficiency rather than
price increases. And the drop-off in wage growth suggests that
workers are not using the leverage of a tight labor market to win
big raises, possibly because of a deeply ingrained fear that they
could lose their jobs to global competition and possibly because
employers are compensating workers with performance-based bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's less skepticism now than last summer about the
favorable inflation outlook,'' Glassman said. ``The more we see
what's happening around the globe, and the more we see what's
happening with productivity, the more open-minded people are about
the economy's ability to sustain low inflation. That argues that
the Fed does not have to push rates back up to where they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan made clear in his congressional testimony last week
that his primary concern is not the heady level of the stock
market, as worrisome as that is to him, but the possible effect of
continued strong domestic demand on wages.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to make an ironclad case these days that
rising wages will lead to a general increase in prices. So far,
productivity gains have more than offset rising wages and other
costs. The problem, as Greenspan has noted repeatedly, is that
policy-makers cannot count on productivity growth to continue to
improve forever. At some point, the productivity growth rate could
level off, or wage growth could accelerate, and the seeds of
inflation would then take root in the form of rising cost
structures within companies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if that happens, it is by no means certain that
companies will be able to pass on their higher costs to consumers
because competition is so intense that producers have proved to be
willing to give up profits to maintain or gain market share.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is little evidence of any acceleration in wage
increases in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure on labor costs is milder than we thought it would
be, despite the fact that the economy is stronger,'' said Richard
Rippe, an economist at Prudential Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rippe said there were other reasons why the Fed was unlikely to
raise rates aggressively the rest of the year. The domestic economy
is already showing some tentative signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   While the global crisis appears past, the recoveries in many
countries are fragile and could be hurt by higher rates in the
United States. And Rippe said the Fed would like to avoid driving
the value of the dollar higher, which would be likely if interest
rates in the United States rose substantially. While a stronger
dollar would help contain inflation by holding down import prices,
it could also lead to a further expansion of the trade deficit,
which is not yet a major problem but could ultimately become one.

U.S. MOVE HAS HONG KONGWORRIED IT WILL LOSE TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mo.)  (rk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Fears about Hong Kong's future as an Asian trading
post have grown here in recent days after the U.S. Senate moved to
tighten export controls to this former British colony in response
to a congressional report on military espionage and China.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved legislation that would impose
more-stringent controls on the export of equipment and technology
with military uses to Hong Kong and Macao _ a Portuguese colony
that will be returned to China in December _ unless both
territories allow the United States to verify that sensitive
shipments end up in the right hands.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., grows out of
accusations in the recent congressional committee report that Hong
Kong is a staging ground for the acquisition of military technology
by China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prudence demands that if China diverts sensitive U.S.
technology, we impose on Hong Kong and Macao the same export
controls that govern sales to China itself,'' Ashcroft said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   It may be prudent for Washington. But for Hong Kong, which has
$56 billion a year in trade with the United States, it could mean
deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely serious issue,'' said Victor Fung,
chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. ``It would
affect a major area of development for us, which is moving up the
food chain into high technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many people here, Fung disputes the accusations in the
congressional report from a committee led by Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif. And he is angry that some in Congress want to strip Hong
Kong of its status as an autonomous trading entity within China.
Though it reverted to Chinese sovereignty nearly two years ago,
Hong Kong polices its own borders and is a member of the World
Trade Organization. ``It is manifestly unjust not to honor Hong
Kong's status,'' Fung said. ``You don't do that to a member of the
WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong plays only a minor role in the Cox report, which
asserts sweeping theft of American military technology by China.
But it does come in for criticism as a teeming bazaar in which
sensitive technology imports can be diverted to the mainland. The
report asserts that a ``sizable number of Hong Kong enterprises''
are fronts for the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The army maintains a garrison here and regularly moves equipment
to and from mainland China. The report says Hong Kong is not
allowed to inspect army vehicles crossing the border _ making them
a perfect way to smuggle goods.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Hong Kong said they had the right to inspect
Chinese army vehicles. But the procedure is cumbersome: Customs
authorities must call the garrison if they suspect an illegal
shipment. The garrison then sends soldiers to conduct the
inspection under the scrutiny of customs officers. Hong Kong
concedes it has not inspected a single army vehicle since the
handover.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we've had no grounds to suspect a breach of Hong Kong
laws,'' said Yvonne Choi, Hong Kong's acting secretary for Trade
and Industry. ``But that doesn't mean it won't happen in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Security Bureau is investigating a report published
in a Chinese-language newspaper here that an army truck recently
entered the enclave without making a full declaration of its cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Choi declined to comment on the incident. But she said Hong
Kong had an exemplary record of policing exports and imports. She
argued that the examples cited in the Cox report _ including one in
which parts for an air-to-air missile were found on a commercial
flight arriving in Hong Kong _ illustrated the vigilance, not the
laxity, of local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider it unfair to treat our successful enforcement
actions as a cause for concern,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's government plans a lobbying campaign to try to
persuade lawmakers in the United States that its customs standards
are adequate, and that Congress should not change Hong Kong's
trading status. Officials recently invited Cox to visit Hong Kong
to judge its controls for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill must go before the House of Representatives
before it becomes law. But with feelings against China running high
on Capitol Hill, officials here said they were taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong may find an ally in the Clinton administration.
Richard A. Boucher, the U.S. consul general, praised the
territory's security in a speech here on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Start spreading the news _ you can travel to New
York City and not break the bank.
</P>
<P>
   How can that be, in a city in which $300-a-night room rates,
$50-per-person dinners and $65 theater tickets aren't uncommon?
Easy. Hunt for bargains and get to know Manhattan before you go,
and your trip will be a lot of fun without sending you deep in
debt.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to go and have been scared off by price, here
are a few tips.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lodging: A hotel doesn't have to cost several hundred dollars
a night. If you don't have to stay in Midtown, check out some of
the hotels just over the river in New Jersey. Secaucus, for
example, has several hotels and motels that range from $89 and up
per night (plus a 6 percent room tax). Some even offer free
continental breakfasts. Secaucus is just a few miles from midtown
Manhattan, and you can catch a bus to Midtown for $2.35 per person
each way (it's the No. 320). From there you catch the subway to any
destination in the city.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to stay in Midtown, get a hotel through
www.priceline.com on the Internet. On Priceline, you tell the
service how much you want to spend per night and the service
selects a hotel for you. Some warning: You have to give a credit
card number (although you can do that over the phone); the service
picks the hotel for you and you don't have a say in the matter;
once Priceline picks the hotel your credit card is automatically
charged and you can't get a refund _ so if the trip gets canceled,
you're stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the service, for some users, is terrific. I'll be in New
York this fall, and by using Priceline I'm staying at a first-class
hotel on 51st Street and Seventh Avenue for $113 a night _ tax
included. In all, that's just $15 more than the Secaucus option
(when including bus fare, train fare), and well worth the
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use Priceline to set your own airfare, but that's
even more of a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   You have to consent to making at least one stop along the way,
and that could be anywhere. So be careful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Meals: You shouldn't spend a lot of money on food in New York.
First, avoid the hotel restaurants. You'll spend $20 on two eggs
and some toast. Instead, go to one of the many delis or grab a bite
from a street vendor. You'll get a real bagel with butter and
coffee for as little as $1. If you want something larger, eggs, a
bagel and coffee can be had for less than $3 at most delis.
</P>
<P>
   For lunch, get New York hot dogs _ again from street vendors _
for $1.50 each, loaded up with onions, relish, sauerkraut and more.
</P>
<P>
   For dinner, get a large New York pizza. There is nothing like a
fresh-made New York slice, and you can get a whole pie _ enough to
feed three easily _ for less than $12. If you want something
fancier, find a midtown deli or dinner that serves all kinds of
food for less than $10 per person. Get incredible hero sandwiches
with roast or corned beef, pastrami or other staples that are meals
in themselves, and are far superior to any chain sandwich stuff.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a sweet tooth, you're in a lot of trouble. Get a
black and white cookie _ very large, half with chocolate, half with
vanilla frosting _ for $1 to $1.25. How about an Italian ice
(cherry, lemon, other flavors) scraped out of the case for about
$1? Then there are the incredible array of danishes and pastries as
well as East Coast staples found in any deli _ Devil Dogs and Ring
Dings. At these prices, you won't have to watch your expenses, but
you will have to watch your waistline.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting around: Seeing the sights won't cost an arm and a leg,
either. You can simply walk through any of Manhattan's incredible
areas _ Central Park, Midtown, Greenwich Village, Soho _ and admire
the shops, landmark stores and incredible architecture. For
example: You can start at 96th Street and Broadway, walk a few
blocks over to Central Park, then walk all the way down Central
Park West to 59th Street and Columbus Circle. From there, head down
Broadway to Times Square. If you're not used to walking you'll be
exhausted; if you can't make it all the way, hop on a bus for
$1.50. If walking doesn't bother you, you'll see several terrific
sights.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy a pass to see six great New York attractions,
including the Empire State Building, for $28 _ about half of what
it would normally cost. Those passes are available in Madison
Square Garden and other tourist spots.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clubbing: Entertainment can be free or nearly so, especially
during the week. Pick up a copy of The Village Voice _ it's free _
and look for clubs that charge no cover or admission. There are
several in the Village that are within walking distance of each
other. You'll have to buy drinks, so expect to pay $5 to $6 for a
beer and $6 and up for a mixed drink. But if a couple has two
drinks each, you can still have a night out for about $20, with
music, and that's not bad anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   _ Souvenirs: When on your New York walking tour you'll find
shops that have New York T-shirts, three for $10; I even found a
few that had four for $10. You can get all kinds of hats _ New York
Yankees, New York emblems, anything you'd like, two for $10.

HEAD OF NEW UTILITY COMPANY CASTS EYE ON BOSTON GAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The future president of the holding company that is
taking over Boston Edison and Commonwealth Electric said Thursday
his company likes the idea of adding Boston Gas to its corporate
stable, a consolidation that could create an eastern Massachusetts
utility giant serving 2 million gas and electric customers.
</P>
<P>
   Russell D. Wright, who will be president of the new entity
NStar, approved by both utilities' owners Thursday, said of Boston
Gas parent company Eastern Enterprises: ``The Eastern system is a
very good physical fit with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the right terms and conditions, sure, we'd be
interested'' in acquiring or merging with Eastern, Wright said in
an interview, adding that ``we'd like to grow the gas business to
be equal to the electric side.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Wright, president of Commonwealth Energy System, nor
officials with Edison or Eastern would say whether any talks were
under way.
</P>
<P>
   At separate meetings Thursday, shareholders of Boston Edison
parent BEC Energy and those of Commonwealth Energy System each
voted overwhelmingly in favor of the merger to create NStar, which
would have just over 1 million electric customers and 240,000 gas
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both companies said the only possible hangup they
see for the receiving the necessary regulatory approvals is if they
have trouble meeting a July 13 deadline to sell Edison's Pilgrim
nuclear plant to a Louisiana firm, which could delay Nuclear
Regulatory Commission approval. They hope to complete the NStar
merger by mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, they face strong opposition from business and
consumer groups to a rate plan being reviewed by state regulators
that would freeze Edison and ComEnergy bills for four years and
allow the companies to recoup more than $600 million in
merger-related costs.
</P>
<P>
   NStar officials say that amount will be far exceeded by savings
on customers' bills. But critics want firmer guarantees those
savings will be passed on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Edison chairman and chief executive Thomas J.
May, who will hold the same positions at NStar, said he wanted
Edison to grow to 2 million customers by the end of 2000. That goal
has been complicated, as possible New England merger partners have
been snapped up by out-of-region utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being an obvious geographical fit with NStar, Eastern
Enterprises would be mathematically perfect. Its 750,000 gas
customers in 115 eastern Massachusetts communities _ once its
takeover of Colonial Gas is approved next month _ would bring NStar
to just over May's 2 million goal in one fell swoop. It would also
create a company, as Wright described, evenly balanced between gas
and electric.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the BEC vote, May would not comment on
whether he would like to combine with Boston Gas. ``I'm comfortable
that we have enough size and scale to achieve our customer service
goals over the next two years,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we're in a panic and looking over our shoulder
and saying, `If we don't execute that (goal of reaching 2 million
customers), we have to sell the business.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing growing speculation that NStar may be an attractive
takeover candidate, May said, ``I think probably everyone would
prefer to be independent, but you also realize you work for the
shareholders,'' whose best interest may lie in selling the company
or merging for a premium. ``We're attractive to 10 utilities,'' May
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright told ComEnergy shareholders: ``This is not the last deal.
There is likely to be further consolidation in the business,'' a
comment he later said applied to NStar as well as other New England
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, BEC closed at 42
7/8, down 1/16. ComEnergy was up 1/4 at 43, and Eastern Enterprises
was down 1/2 at 38 3/16.

FBI BEGINS SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE TO BE USED AGAINST MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ FBI forensic teams began sifting through
evidence Thursday morning at two houses that are believed to be
massacre sites in hopes of helping the prosecution of Slobodan
Milosevic and other Serbian leaders charged with war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Laying out piles of shiny new equipment _ shovels, big screens
for sifting dirt and ashes and two huge electric generators _ the
FBI team went to scenes cited in the indictment brought in May by
the International Tribunal for War Crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   One was the house where a survivor, Hani Hoxha, has told of the
mass killing of about 20 people, including his wife, three
daughters and grandchildren. The dead belonged to three related
families who had tried to hide in the house of one family, the
Vesas.
</P>
<P>
   The second site was a nearby house on Ymer Grezda Street, where
the indictment says six men were executed.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow police tape reading, ``Crime scene _ Do not enter,'' was
stretched on both sides of the street in front of the Vesa house.
Italian soldiers and tanks of the NATO security force kept away
journalists, who had been summoned for a news conference by the FBI
and David J. Scheffer, the State Department's ambassador at large
for war crimes issues.
</P>
<P>
   The crime scene was hardly pristine. Journalists have been going
through it for almost two weeks, and the site had been unattended
for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the yellow tape, the FBI agents, most in standard
American camouflage uniforms with American flags on the left
sleeves, wore a variety of hats _ baseball or floppy wide-brims _
and moved in and out of the house with their gear. Most were also
equipped with dark sunglasses that they put on when they entered
their vehicles, even though it was a dank overcast day. Several
agents cradled stubby black rifles with large telescopic sights.
</P>
<P>
   Under its director, Louis Freeh, the bureau has been expanding
its overseas role. But this is the first major deployment of agents
to investigate war crimes. The contingent numbers about 60 agents
from six field offices and 95,000 pounds of equipment, including
Humvees, trucks, tents, communications gear and laboratory
equipment. Its commander is Roger Kniesly, head of the Critical
Incident Response Group in Quantico, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The team includes explosives experts, specialists in evidence
collection and forensic photographers. There are also forensic
anthropologists on loan from the Armed Forces Institute of
Pathology. Their tasks are to photograph and map crime scenes; to
analyze blood, bones, cartridges, clothing and to try to identify
bodies through DNA samples.
</P>
<P>
   But the bodies in the houses that they searched Thursday had
already been buried, according to Faton Pollushka, the municipal
official in charge of disposing bodies here, who added that there
were barely enough remains to fill one grave. There were a few
bones in the ruins of one burned structure, including a jawbone
that appeared to be that of a child.
</P>
<P>
   In April in an interview in the Albanian capital, Tirana, Hoxha
described the night when his family and friends were killed and
took this reporter's notebook to diagram the family compound, how
the killings had been carried out and where people had died. His
sketch precisely matched the layout, including a pool hall facing
the street with a charred basement in which he said people had been
killed and burned, and the now rusted-out car that they had pulled
in front of the gate in a futile hope of blocking entry.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that the Serbs were only looking for men, Hoxha
recounted, he and two other men had slipped out of a second-story
window, onto a wall, and escaped. He told how, wedged in hiding
between two buildings, he heard gunshots and cries in the night,
and how he found his family dead in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Gani Kadriv, said in a recent interview that he,
too, had heard gunshots and the cries of women and children that
night.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer, the war crimes specialist, said at a news conference
that the two sites that the FBI was investigating were ``only
representative'' of the Serbian massacres of Albanian civilians and
that new ``atrocity sites are popping up every day,'' found by
journalists or NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   He said the bureau's experts were conducting ``detailed forensic
work'' to ``support the indictment of the war crimes tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and other senior officials were charged with crimes
against humanity in Kosovo, including the murder, forced
deportation and persecution of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The other officials charged were Milan Milutinovic, the Serbian
president and a longtime close aide to Milosevic; Dragoljub
Ojdanic, the chief of staff of the Yugoslav armed forces and a
former commander of an army corps in eastern Bosnia; Nikola
Sainovic, the deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia, and Vlajko
Stojilkovic, the minister of internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accuses Milosevic of the persecution of Albanians
on racial, religious and political grounds and traces what it
describes as the mass execution of hundreds of them in several
towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serb army and police violated so many laws, they were a
perfect example of how not to conduct a war,'' Scheffer said. ``And
they were a perfect example of how not to withdraw. They
systematically burned, looted and destroyed evidence on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is continuing, he said, adding, ``One would
not expect the indictments issued by the tribunal to be the end of
the story.''

 &HT;    MARINE FIREFIGHT MARKS TENSION, VIOLENCE IN KOSOVO
 &HT;    600&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZEGRA, Yugoslavia _ U.S. Marines saw the tension in their little
corner of Kosovo building. It culminated in a deadly shoot out
Wednesday, and an exodus of defeated and frightened Serbs from this
village Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The little law that governs Kosovo right now could be summed up
by Marine Gunnery Sgt. William Post, of the 3rd Marine Battalion
from Camp Lejeune, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about killing a Serb gunman, he said: ``They
shot at my people unprovoked. He shot at me. So, it's better him
than me. That's the way I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Around war-shattered Kosovo, violence continued Thursday,
despite NATO forces vowing to make the province secure and the
KLA's promises to demilitarize.
</P>
<P>
   Three Serbs were found shot to death in the Serb-run economics
department at Pristina University. NATO soldiers sealed off the
basement and were investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Going to the cause of the bitterness, NATO troops arrested a
Serb man identified by residents of the village of Solvinije as one
of the perpetrators of the massacre of 43 Kosovar Albanians there
in the horrific ethnic cleansing campaign during the 78-day NATO
air war against Yugoslavia. Witnesses also said two women were
raped before being killed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties confronting his troops trying to keep a
lid on ethnic tensions, Clark, the NATO commander, said he was
pleased so far with the alliance's operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going extremely well,'' he said. ``We're meeting
all of our objectives and milestones.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the previous 24 hours, Zegra, a southeastern Kosovo farming
village of about 4,000 with a 10 percent minority of Serbs to
ethnic Albanians, had become a microcosm of troubled Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines, behind their sandbags and M-16s, have grown used to
receiving cherries to eat and magazines to read from ethnic
Albanian children grateful that NATO has chased the Serb police and
paramilitary forces from their town. Meanwhile, they have gotten
suspicious glares from Serbs now afraid for their safety.
</P>
<P>
   With growing frequency, ethnic Albanians, who had seen their
homes burned and neighbors shot by Serbs during the NATO bombing
campaign, stepped up their revenge. On Wednesday, for instance,
Marines saw two Albanians beating a Serb paramilitary commander and
there were threats made against others.
</P>
<P>
   These smaller incidents, however, were only precursors to the
gunfight later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling something was going to happen,'' said John
Holmstrom, a Marine Corps medic from Michigan, who had treated a
Serb for a broken nose suffered in a beating.
</P>
<P>
   Around 5:20 (local time) Wednesday, a few Serbs took to the
streets with guns. They appear to have fired toward the homes of
their Albanian neighbors and then, one of them, toward the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines were in a sandbag post and the gunman was across a
bridge less than 100 yards away. According to Marine accounts, they
returned the fire and hit the man in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about 10 other Marines made a flanking run from their
schoolhouse headquarters here, through a creek bed and around the
side of the Serbs. One group answered automatic fire coming from a
grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Gunnery Sgt. Post and a Marine translator focused on the injured
gunman, now taking refuge in a white Yugo. They ordered him to get
out and give up his weapon. Instead, he ran bleeding to a niche in
a wall and fired at them. Post shot him in the head and the Serb
died a couple hours later at the Marine base.
</P>
<P>
   The other Serbs escaped to surrounding houses. In house-to-house
searches aided by ethnic Albanians, the Marines arrested two
wounded men and a third who had not been shot.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Marines were sizing up their tenuous role as
peacekeepers against a bleak backdrop. More than 45 cars and
tractors formed a convoy carrying almost all the last Serbs out of
Zegra.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some complained that the Marines could not protect them. Others
said they were being threatened and beaten by members of the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Two Serb houses were burning. Marine Col. Kenneth Glueck
speculated that the Serbs set their own homes on fire, but that
could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is new. This is something we haven't seen before,'' said
Capt. Robert Riggle, as he watched the Serbs pull out of town as
they have in so many other areas of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus is a small defeat for NATO, which has encouraged
Serbs to remain under the protection of the Kosovo peacekeeping
force, called KFOR.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite the smiles of the ethnic Albanians, the Marines
know they must be ready to exert the only real authority in Kosovo
now, that of weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Cpl. Matthew Simmons of Missouri, one of the Marines who
shot at the Serb gunmen, said the tension didn't get to him until
after the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I thought about it a while, I was a bit shaky,'' he
said.

   PHOENIX - The bead of sweat ran down the length of my nose,
paused silently on the very, very, very tip before it rolled
suddenly forward, leapt and careened toward the floor, flattening
when it hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I CAN follow directions! I built THAT!'' I yelled, pointing to
a bookcase on the far side of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refinished and reassembled THOSE!'' I bellowed, pointing to
the mantel of my fireplace and the two flanking glass-fronted
cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I GOT AN ELECTRIC MITER SAW FOR MY BIRTHDAY,'' I roared at the
ceiling, my arms open wide, ``AND A CHAINSAW FOR CHRISTMAS!''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, I was indeed qualified for the task at hand. It
shouldn't have been any trouble at all for me to assemble the
two-shelf cabinet that I had just hauled into my living room from
the home improvement store.
</P>
<P>
   My troubles began after I poised the 70-pound box against the
wall and sliced it open with a utility knife, only to discover that
both the instructions and the hardware were MIA. To remedy the
situation, I called the store to inform them of the situation, and
to inquire if they could locate another set for me.
</P>
<P>
   The first fellow I talked to listened to me patiently, then put
me on hold in search of the hardware grail. Moments later, another
fellow, Daniel, picked up the line and asked if he could help me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, but I'm already being helped,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously NOT,'' he snapped at me. ``If you were, they'd be on
the phone RIGHT NOW.''
</P>
<P>
   Who am I to judge the wisdom and expertise of a warehouse
worker? Clearly, I knew not of which I spoke, being a mere amateur
in the world of home improvement customer service. So I repeated my
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any of those cabinets left,'' Daniel informed me
simply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you . . . check?'' I brazenly ventured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to CHECK,'' he said. ``I KNOW.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' I started, ``there was a whole stack of them there two
hours ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel took a deep breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``YOU KNOW,'' he said in his best spouse-abuser voice, ``I'm
standing IN FRONT of the cabinets right now and they're all gone,
but I guess (begin ital) you know best. 9end ital) They must all be
invisible to ME!''
</P>
<P>
   What could I do now? I bit my nail, and looked at the box in my
living room filled with useless wooden planks. Then I got my keys.
</P>
<P>
   When I got to the home improvement store, I slipped down the
cabinet aisle, found the box I needed and, well, helped myself to
the parts that were missing from my box and wrote, ``This Box is
Incomplete and Invisible: See Daniel,'' on the top.
</P>
<P>
   Then I ran out of the store as fast as I could without further
aggravating the inner-thigh burn I had acquired the week before at
the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Back at home, I got my screwdriver and went to work. With the
illustration-only instructions in hand, I assembled the frame of
the cabinet according to the pictures, even though I was missing
the part that looked like a gumdrop and used the part that looked
like a Chicklet instead.
</P>
<P>
   I stepped away from the cabinet, and looked at it. Then I did a
bad thing. With the brush of one fingertip, it was reduced to a
pile of laminated chipboard that scared my little dog so bad she
tinkled on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   I noticed the first bead of sweat streaming down my forehead
when I saw the toll-free number at the bottom of the booklet, and
the words ``FOR HELP CALL'' next to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, this is Melissa, how can I help you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragically, Melissa,'' I began, ``I have just purchased $300
of your merchandise (a gross exaggeration, but necessary for
impact) and I'm returning it ALL. I have never seen such poor
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly have the right to do that,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the answer I thought I'd get, since I was looking
for something more along the lines of ``I am so, so sorry,'' ``Oh,
no! Please don't! Please!'' or some gulping, audible sobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tools,'' I stammered. ``So I know poor quality when I
see it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' she answered before she disconnected me.
</P>
<P>
   I stared at the phone, then at the heap of cabinet. I was more
determined than ever to put it together. For the next two hours, I
wrestled, wrangled and fought with the planks, studying the
instructions, and following them step by step. I didn't touch the
finished product this time. It fell apart when the oscillating fan
turned toward it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, this is Sandy, how can I help you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy,'' I began, ``can you explain to me why _ after I have
spent $700 on your products _ that they have such a problem getting
along with gravity?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sorry,'' Sandy replied, and that's when I thought we were
finally getting somewhere. ``Gravity doesn't come with the
cabinets. It's an accessory that's purchased separately! Would you
like a list of stores that carry it?''
</P>
<P>
   I looked back at the pile. Then I kicked it. A plank flew across
the floor and put a gaping fresh dent in the bookcase I had built.
</P>
<P>
   I picked up the instructions and looked at them again. On the
very last page, next to a diagram of what should have been my newly
assembled cabinet, it said, ``You will need:'' and showed a picture
of a drill, then the words ``Quizas necesite ayuda,'' which, with
the help of my Spanish dictionary, I tentatively translated as ``An
assistant may be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, this is Denise, how can I help you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Denise,'' I said wearily, my voice cracking, ``who's writing
these instructions? My drunk Uncle Rossie? Is he being helped by my
Cousin Tommy with the one eye that always stays looking at his
nose?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think so,'' Denise said, pausing for a moment. ``I
think his name is Hadjim. Yes. Haaah-JEEEEEM.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you leave Hadjim a message for me?'' I continued. ``Can
you ask him why _ after I've spent $2,000 and nine hours trying to
assemble your merchandise _ why he failed to mention that I'd need
a drill until the very last page? Could you also tell him that
you'll also need some superglue, staples and a bunch of rope,
though I'm saving a bit of that to hang myself with. Oh, and one
more thing, tell him this, too: NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE A
SPANISH ASSISTANT!!!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, boy, I can't do that!'' Denise cried. ``Hadjim doesn't
work here anymore! He got a job at Los Alamos last year and moved
to New Mexico! But I would if I could, totally!''
</P>
<P>
   Another bead of sweat rolled down my face and jumped from my
chin to its death.
</P>
<P>
   I was sure that somewhere in China, a thousand beads of sweat
were doing the exact same thing. &QL;

RISING STAR TEDESCHI GETS A LITTLE HELP FROM STEVIE'S FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Susan Tedeschi's gonna be in Double Trouble when she
gets to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts-bred singer and guitarist with the red-hot
blues album ``Just Can't Burn'' is on the road with the late Stevie
Ray Vaughan's rhythm section, Double Trouble, featuring drummer
Chris Layton and bassist Tommy Shannon. Completing the band is
Tedeschi's longtime keyboardist, Tom West.
</P>
<P>
   The four musicians played in front of a live audience for the
first time last week on ``Late Night with David Letterman.''
Tedeschi, West and Double Trouble are now on the road, opening for
Keb' Mo' Saturday night in Seattle. It's only the third gig on the
foursome's current cross-country tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna be fun because how many times do you get to play
with guys like that?'' Tedeschi said in a phone interview from Los
Gatos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwell, Mass., native discovered the joys of performing in
front of a live audience before she started grade school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to be an entertainer. I love being
onstage,'' she said in a girlish voice quite unlike the big-mama
howl of her live shows.
</P>
<P>
   Tedeschi, whose mother was active in musical theater, made her
stage debut at age 4 in a local production of ``Oliver!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being in day care, my mom would put us in shows
that she was either directing or producing or whatever,'' Tedeschi
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great because I wanted to do it anyway. I got to hang
out with other kids and it was actually better than day care
because you're accomplishing something and working toward a common
goal instead of just hanging out and not doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Tedeschi is convinced her early theatrical training helped
motivate her later in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been really motivated. I've always had ridiculous
career goals. And I've always achieved them. So I feel very lucky
to have had that experience at a young age,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old musician has sold more than 300,000 copies of
``Just Can't Burn,'' her explosive debut album. The album includes
five Tedeschi originals, as well as such tunes as John Prine's
``Angel From Montgomery,'' Junior Wells' ``Little by Little'' and
the Ruth Brown classic ``Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Tedeschi won four Boston Music Awards in April and two W.C.
Handy blues awards in May. Her largest followings are in Boston,
Seattle, San Francisco, Minneapolis, Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin,
Denver, Chicago and Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Tedeschi has now jumped onto the rock charts. Last week, the
rambunctious single ``Rock Me Right'' made its debut on Billboard's
Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reaching a whole new audience of men between 25 and 45,
which is kinda cool,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tedeschi, whose parents owned many LPs while she was growing up,
recalled liking the blues when she was a small child. Her dad's
collection included music by Lightnin' Hopkins and Mississippi John
Hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably more into blues when I was 5, 6 or 7 than I was
in my teens,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up Catholic, she sang in church. Later she was drawn to
gospel music and sang at predominantly African-American Baptist and
Methodist churches.
</P>
<P>
   In her late teens, Tedeschi moved to Boston to attend the
Berklee School of Music. It was while living there that she began
discovering, through friends, some of the greatest blues albums
ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden one day when I was 22, I said, `Damn, what the
hell have I been missing out on? I've been looking for this kind of
music my whole life and it's been right there.'''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Tedeschi began jamming at local clubs and
polishing her singing and guitar playing.
</P>
<P>
   People often compare her to singers such as Janis Joplin, Etta
James and Bonnie Raitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't get too upset when they compare me to people
like that because I just do what I do. I don't really try to sound
like anyone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Tedeschi's fans come from many different age groups, they
seem to be getting younger and younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting the really young kids _ 3, 4, 5 and 6 years old,''
she said. ``They come with their parents. The parents are playing
the record at home and their kids are hearing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really funny because the kids know all the words.''

 &HT;    MICROSOFT TRIAL ENDS AS IT BEGAN, WITH GATES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft antitrust trial ended Thursday on the
same note on which it began last October _ with explosive evidence
from Microsoft chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, a constant if distant presence in the courtroom
throughout the 21-week trial, was quoted in handwritten notes from
Microsoft's still-secret files as having dismissed the threat posed
to the software giant by the recent $10 billion merger between
America Online Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp., a deal in
which Sun Microsystems Inc. also plays a key role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Platform threat _ AOL doesn't have it in their genes to attack
us in the platform space,'' said Gates. ``If you want to lose sleep
tonight, worry about Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates' comments at a Dec. 14, 1998, Microsoft strategy meeting _
the rest of the document remained sealed _ seemed to contradict the
line that his lawyers had taken in the courtroom during 78 days of
often rancorous testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft was clearly engaged in a broad pattern of illegal
behavior,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney General Joel Klein told
reporters on the courthouse steps when the trial ended. ``They used
every trick in the monopolist's book. ... You name it, they did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the software giant, which stands at the apex of
booming high-tech industry, argued that its dominant Windows
operating system could fall prey at any time to dynamic industry
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing minutes of the trial. Microsoft lawyer Michael
Lacovara dramatically produced what was to become the final item of
more than 2,000 defense exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   It was an MSNBC news story, broadcast within the hour, reporting
that AOL, the nation's leading Internet access provider, is in
talks with Microworkz(cq) Inc., a maker of low-cost computers, to
produce an AOL-branded PC dedicated to running a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who has presided
over the landmark case without a jury, thereupon called it a day.
``It has been almost a pleasure,'' Jackson said. ``Let's keep it
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring an unexpected settlement, Jackson is unlikely to issue
his verdict before the end of the year. A lengthy appeals process
could keep the case winding through the federal courts for several
more years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Jackson gave Microsoft and the Justice
Department, which joined with 19 states in suing the company, until
Aug. 10 present competing ``findings of fact.'' A month later, on
Sept. 10, the two sides must submit their revised findings after
having assessed each other's submissions.
</P>
<P>
   Once those two voluminous rounds of paperwork are out of the
way, Jackson said he will hear closing arguments in his courtroom
on Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The trial's final witness, economist Richard Schmalensee of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argued forcefully Thursday
that Microsoft has been unfairly portrayed by the government as a
hard-core monopolist that illegally wields unchecked power in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Schmalensee, an $800-an-hour expert appearing on
Microsoft's behalf, exploded in a rage when David Boies, the
government's lead lawyer, accused him of presenting ``selective
testimony'' to shore up Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that a blanket challenge to my ethics?'' Schmalensee
declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you at least grant that you are here in part as an advocate
for a particular position?'' Boies responded.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Schmalensee had dismissed Gates's assessment of the AOL
threat to Microsoft. ``This is a judgment from someone who hasn't
seen those documents,'' the economist said.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening phase of the trial, Boies played in the courtroom
a videotaped Gates deposition in which the world's richest man
seemed so evasive that even Jackson felt bound to tell his lawyers
privately: ``I think it's evident to every spectator that, for
whatever reasons, in many respects Mr. Gates has not been
particularly responsive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates came to Washington at least twice during the trial, but
never visited the courtroom.

SMOOTHIES: HEALTHFUL QUALITIES DEBATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Arizona Republic &QL; 
(at)6 They fly the flag of health, sometimes right in the face of
McDonald's and Burger King, these ubiquitous juice bars that have
popped up in every strip mall from Malibu to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Their franchise player is a 24-ounce milkshake called a
smoothie, a quotidian beverage actually, consisting primarily of
fresh or freshly frozen fruits, non-fat yogurt and ice. Also on
board are the juices, both fruit and vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the heart of this business, the part that keeps the hard
core coming back for more, is the wide array of dietary
supplements, ginkgo biloba to bee pollen, that can be added to
these drinks for an additional charge.
</P>
<P>
   Are these health-food-stores-in-a-blender really as good for us
as their bright brochures proclaim?
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic visited four juice bars in the Valley,
three chains (Smoothie King, Jamba Juice, Juice Works) and one
independent (Sun Valley Smoothies), and faxed their menus to local
nutritionists for professional opinions on the true health benefits
of the juice-bar scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking at these as a healthy snack, they're fine,''
said Debra Laundau-West, a Scottsdale consulting dietitian. ``Most
of them are a good source of vitamin C. The fresh fruits are an
excellent source of fiber and antioxidants.''
</P>
<P>
   Laundau-West also praises the vegetable juices because of their
use of fresh carrots as a base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful source of beta carotene, another
antioxidant that also provides fiber,'' she said. ``Natural beta
carotene can reduce your risk of cancer and heart disease.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Laundau-West takes issue with juice-bar brochures
stating that smoothies are a multicourse meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're a substitute for consuming a wide
variety of fruits and vegetables,'' Laundau-West said. ``It's not
like having a meal with bread that has complex carbohydrates, or
tuna fish or chicken or turkey that's a high-quality source of
protein.''
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Baker, Phoenix dietitian and spokeswoman for the American
Dietetic Association, believes that a smoothie can be a meal in
some situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every meal doesn't have to include 100 percent of your RDAs
(recommended daily amounts) of everything,'' Baker said. ``You are
getting protein, a number of nutrients and far less fat from a
smoothie than a hamburger and fries. I think a smoothie can be
considered a healthy treat but also used occasionally as a lunch
meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who is a long-distance runner, says she averages a
smoothie a week, usually after working out.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Stremble, community nutrition program manager in the
Maricopa County Office of Nutrition, said that if you're on the run
and have a choice between a smoothie and another fast-food
alternative, she'd recommend the smoothie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a more healthful choice,'' Stremble said.
``But it's not something you want to do on a day-to-day basis.
Fruits and vegetables are great, but they're primarily
carbohydrates. You need a blend of carbohydrates, protein and
fat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you don't want to do is eat a regular meal and then drink
a smoothie also, unless you can burn it off,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of the calories. It's no secret that smoothies
are loaded with them, 300 to 550 calories for a 24-ounce serving,
or about the same as a McDonald's Quarter Pounder hamburger. Adding
peanut butter and chocolate, as some smoothie recipes call for, can
bring the calorie count to 700, a hefty total for a drink perceived
to be healthful.
</P>
<P>
   ``These smoothies are high in simple sugars because of the
frozen yogurt or sherbet and all the fruit juices that go into
them,'' Laundau-West said. ``Unless you're a really active person,
you're going to gain weight if you have a 550-calorie snack over
and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Doreen Mahar, manager of Sun Valley Smoothies at the Arizona
Center in downtown Phoenix, said you can buy smoothies that contain
fewer calories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on what you put in it,'' Mahar said. ``But
there are a lot of calories in 24 ounces of any food. Managing your
calories is the important thing. People tell me they've replaced
their breakfast and lunch with a smoothie and lost a pound a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Our nutrition specialists agree that a healthy dose of
skepticism may be in order when choosing nutritional supplements
offered as optional extras, allowing customers to customize their
smoothies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, juice bars claim that adding lecithin nutrients to
your drink will help prevent arteriosclerosis, protect against
cardiovascular disease and improve brain function. Quite a bargain
for 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything really happens with these supplements
if you just have them put in your drink one time,'' Landau-West
said. ``If you take an herb one time, nothing really happens,
either. Herbs take approximately 30 days of consistent use to have
an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I really like smoothies, I don't have (additional)
supplements,'' Baker said. ``I think that's throwing your money
away. Supplements for therapeutic effects really need to be taken
over the course of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many physicians, Dr. Karla Birkholz, a family practitioner
with Your Family Physician in Glendale, questions the value of
synthetic supplements anyway.
</P>

is the natural nutrients from the real vegetables and fruits.''

   Mahar, who said she has studied nutrition for 30 years,
acknowledges that vitamins and certain herbs do need time and

nutrient package, which contains bee pollen, ginseng root and
ginkgo biloba root.

   ``You have one, and you'll be zooming for the rest of the day,''
Mahar said. ``You really will be more alert and energetic. People
who try it for the very first time come back the next day and tell

</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Moss, a general practitioner in Fountain Hills, said
he's not even familiar with some of the supplements, such as
citrimax, being offered at local juice bars, but what concerns him
most is the lack of warnings on juice-bar brochures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thermogenic herbs, for example, can cause problems for
individuals with hypertension or cardiac problems,'' Moss said.
``Echinacea, the so-called cold buster, might cause problems if you
have autoimmune problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Francis, a staff pharmacist for CIGNA Healthplan of
Arizona Inc., agrees with Moss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful what they do throw in there,'' Francis
said. ``Some of these supplements are stimulants. Not good if you
have high blood pressure. People with health conditions shouldn't
go nuts on these supplements without consulting their physicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue is the amount of nutrient supplements used in
juice-bar drinks. Some critics claim that no one knows whether
enough is used to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a problem with supplements in general,'' Baker said.
``They simply aren't regulated close enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Stremble said it's important that consumers realize that herbs
and dietary supplements aren't magic bullets, even though people
selling them often present them that way. She said the Dietary
Supplement and Health Education Act, passed by Congress in 1994,
``opened the floodgates'' for this kind of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 act allows manufacturers to make any claim they want as
long as they avoid assertions that products can cure or prevent a
specific disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herbal products and supplements don't have to be proven safe
or effective to be sold,'' Stremble said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheri Roberts, owner of Juice Works at Camelback Road and 32nd
Street in Phoenix, has been in the business a little more than a
month, but she said one thing in particular has impressed her in
the brief time she's managed Juice Works.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a core of loyal customers,'' Roberts said. ``I'm not
a nutritionist, so I'm not going to go out on the limb and say a
smoothie takes care of your meal for the day. I will say we watch
people in the parking lot. And we can tell just by looking at them
who is coming to visit us and who is going next door to A Taste of

SMOOTHIES: HEALTHFUL QUALITIES DEBATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - They fly the flag of health, sometimes right in the
face ofMcDonald's and Burger King, these ubiquitous juice bars that
have popped up in every strip mall from Malibu to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Their franchise player is a 24-ounce milkshake called a
smoothie, a quotidian beverage actually, consisting primarily of
fresh or freshly frozen fruits, non-fat yogurt and ice. Also on
board are the juices, both fruit and vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the heart of this business, the part that keeps the hard
core coming back for more, is the wide array of dietary
supplements, ginkgo biloba to bee pollen, that can be added to
these drinks for an additional charge.
</P>
<P>
   Are these health-food-stores-in-a-blender really as good for us
as their bright brochures proclaim?
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic visited four juice bars in the Valley,
three chains (Smoothie King, Jamba Juice, Juice Works) and one
independent (Sun Valley Smoothies), and faxed their menus to local
nutritionists for professional opinions on the true health benefits
of the juice-bar scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking at these as a healthy snack, they're fine,''
said Debra Laundau-West, a Scottsdale consulting dietitian. ``Most
of them are a good source of vitamin C. The fresh fruits are an
excellent source of fiber and antioxidants.''
</P>
<P>
   Laundau-West also praises the vegetable juices because of their
use of fresh carrots as a base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful source of beta carotene, another
antioxidant that also provides fiber,'' she said. ``Natural beta
carotene can reduce your risk of cancer and heart disease.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Laundau-West takes issue with juice-bar brochures
stating that smoothies are a multicourse meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're a substitute for consuming a wide
variety of fruits and vegetables,'' Laundau-West said. ``It's not
like having a meal with bread that has complex carbohydrates, or
tuna fish or chicken or turkey that's a high-quality source of
protein.''
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Baker, Phoenix dietitian and spokeswoman for the American
Dietetic Association, believes that a smoothie can be a meal in
some situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every meal doesn't have to include 100 percent of your RDAs
(recommended daily amounts) of everything,'' Baker said. ``You are
getting protein, a number of nutrients and far less fat from a
smoothie than a hamburger and fries. I think a smoothie can be
considered a healthy treat but also used occasionally as a lunch
meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who is a long-distance runner, says she averages a
smoothie a week, usually after working out.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Stremble, community nutrition program manager in the
Maricopa County Office of Nutrition, said that if you're on the run
and have a choice between a smoothie and another fast-food
alternative, she'd recommend the smoothie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a more healthful choice,'' Stremble said.
``But it's not something you want to do on a day-to-day basis.
Fruits and vegetables are great, but they're primarily
carbohydrates. You need a blend of carbohydrates, protein and
fat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you don't want to do is eat a regular meal and then drink
a smoothie also, unless you can burn it off,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of the calories. It's no secret that smoothies
are loaded with them, 300 to 550 calories for a 24-ounce serving,
or about the same as a McDonald's Quarter Pounder hamburger. Adding
peanut butter and chocolate, as some smoothie recipes call for, can
bring the calorie count to 700, a hefty total for a drink perceived
to be healthful.
</P>
<P>
   ``These smoothies are high in simple sugars because of the
frozen yogurt or sherbet and all the fruit juices that go into
them,'' Laundau-West said. ``Unless you're a really active person,
you're going to gain weight if you have a 550-calorie snack over
and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Doreen Mahar, manager of Sun Valley Smoothies at the Arizona
Center in downtown Phoenix, said you can buy smoothies that contain
fewer calories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on what you put in it,'' Mahar said. ``But
there are a lot of calories in 24 ounces of any food. Managing your
calories is the important thing. People tell me they've replaced
their breakfast and lunch with a smoothie and lost a pound a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Our nutrition specialists agree that a healthy dose of
skepticism may be in order when choosing nutritional supplements
offered as optional extras, allowing customers to customize their
smoothies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, juice bars claim that adding lecithin nutrients to
your drink will help prevent arteriosclerosis, protect against
cardiovascular disease and improve brain function. Quite a bargain
for 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything really happens with these supplements
if you just have them put in your drink one time,'' Landau-West
said. ``If you take an herb one time, nothing really happens,
either. Herbs take approximately 30 days of consistent use to have
an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I really like smoothies, I don't have (additional)
supplements,'' Baker said. ``I think that's throwing your money
away. Supplements for therapeutic effects really need to be taken
over the course of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many physicians, Dr. Karla Birkholz, a family practitioner
with Your Family Physician in Glendale, questions the value of
synthetic supplements anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take creatin,'' Birkholz said. ``No one knows if that's OK or
whether it provides any value. I think the true value in juice bars
is the natural nutrients from the real vegetables and fruits.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahar, who said she has studied nutrition for 30 years,
acknowledges that vitamins and certain herbs do need time and
repetition to perform optimally in the body. But she also believes
that certain combinations of nutrients can have an immediate
effect.
</P>
<P>
   She points to Sun Valley Smoothies' 93-cent ``energy boost''

ginkgo biloba root.

Mahar said. ``You really will be more alert and energetic. People
who try it for the very first time come back the next day and tell

PAINTING THE NATION RED: CELEBRATING AN ICON

<P>
   In honor of the 130th anniversary of Heinz, the company proudly
cites University of Pennsylvania psychologist  &UR; Paul &LR; 
 &UR; Rozin &LR; , who calls ketchup ``one of the few constants in our
culture. ... It's surprising how strongly people feel about this
condiment.''
</P>
<P>
   To wit, the top per capita ketchup consumers in the nation live
in Salt Lake City. Women prefer to dunk foods in ketchup; men pour
it on. And one thing more: Ketchup comes out of the bottle at a
rate of 25 miles per year.

   &UR; HOW WOODY ALLEN LIKES TO WATCH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Fervent Knick fan  &UR; Woody Allen &LR;  was so excited leaving Monday's
game at Madison Square Garden that he and his wife,
 &UR; Soon-Yi &LR; , got into the wrong Rolls Royce afterward, reported the
New York Post. When they realized their mistake, they got out and
searched for their own limo.
</P>
<P>
   Allen explained to the New York Daily News why he doesn't gab
with the other celebrities at games, and always appears unexcited:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been teased about this many times. I'm not interested in
all the promotions on the floor, or the propaganda that comes over
the TV screen. I just watch the guys play basketball, and as I do,
I quietly make lists in my mind, remembering the great moments and
the players who made the great plays....''
</P>
<P>
   Allen called  &UR; Latrell Sprewell &LR;  ``the magic ingredient.'' Even
when he misses, he said, ``he finds a way to score. He does
something to the chemistry, to the psychology, and it looks
beautiful.''

   &UR; ROSEANNE'S PILGRIMAGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Roseanne  &LR; was in Jerusalem this week for the grand opening of a
kabbalah school run by the institution at which she studies in Los
Angeles. When Mayor  &UR; Ehud Olmert &LR;  took her to the roof of City Hall
to point out Jerusalem's historic sites, she cried and they held
each other close.
</P>
<P>
   She said she wanted to study kabbalah right there, and that she
had brought many scholarly tomes with her for that reason. She also
said she likes the Bible, which she called ``very funny. ... It's
like one great sitcom.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &UR; RESTING IN PEACE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Alice Adams &LR; ' memorial service in San Francisco Sunday at the
Presidio's Golden Gate Club, will be a significant literary
gathering. Among the speakers scheduled:  &UR; Annie Lamott &LR; ,  &UR; Orville &LR; 
 &UR; Schell &LR;  and  &UR; Mary Gaitskill &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Bob Geary &LR; , the police officer who had a horse named after
him a few weeks ago, says that Bob's first duty was Monday, when
the horse and his mount,  &UR; Phil Downs &LR; , were assigned to stand guard
at St. Gabriel's church in the Sunset District, during the funeral
of  &UR; Joseph Geary &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Geary, Bob Geary's father, was 96 years old, and his son
said he had a special fondness for horses, having learned to ride
bareback by American Indians in his native Nebraska.
</P>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Arriving at a party after a premiere showing of ``Rogue
Trader'' in London on Monday night,  &UR; Jerry Hall  &LR; gave  &UR; Mick Jagger &LR; 
a peck on the cheek. As the couple are said to be getting divorced
_ although Jagger claims they were never married _ this kiss was
viewed as significant, but no one could say exactly how.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Bob Harrington &LR;  is seeking a translation of this sentence,
which appeared on the back of his DMV Registration Renewal Notice,
form number DMV83VR: ``An annual $4 smog abatement fee is due for
vehicles registered in a biennial smog area, which are four model
years old or newer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Nichols set the whole thing up on this hydraulic platform
so that the platform would descend hundreds of feet with the
wallpaper moving in the background. We had to do 40 takes ... over
several weeks to get the descent just right. Then when he was doing
the final edit he called us back and we had to do it again another
40 times because the air bubbles in the machine made all these
jerks and jiggles. ... At the time, (it) seemed so shocking and
discomforting, but now I just see it as bold and brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Rita Moreno telling Baird Jones at an HBO party for ``Oz''
about her most embarrassing movie task, performing what would later
be known as a Monica in ``Carnal Knowledge.'' The camera focused on
her face, which seemed to be moving downward in the film.

X GAMES SOAR TO NEW HEIGHTS IN THEIR FIFTH YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle news file)

 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Stunt biker Dave Mirra hopes he doesn't leave
his heart in San Francisco. He's already left his spleen in Dallas,
thanks to an accident in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mirra, at 25 the world's premier stunt rider, is understated
about what he expects from the 1999 X Games, which open Friday at
San Francisco's Pier 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``A challenge. I've ridden in San Francisco before, and I'm
hoping to break more records.''
</P>
<P>
   And, with a little luck, no bones.
</P>
<P>
   Through July 3, ESPN's fifth annual extreme sports competition
will bring more than 400 world-class alternative athletes to the
Bay Area. The games were held in San Diego the past two years. The
nine-day event should be an eye-opener for those who think the X
Games cater to slackers.
</P>
<P>
   This year's games will be televised on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC.
Corporate sponsors such as Sony and Adidas have been jockeying for
position all year, and the U.S. Postal Service is issuing more than
150 million commemorative stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes have never been higher for X athletes. They're
competing for nearly $1 million in prize money in nine different
categories and 24 disciplines _ from aggressive in-line skating,
bicycle stunt riding and skateboarding to sky surfing, sport
climbing and big-air snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
   The graffiti are on the wall: Extreme sports are big and getting
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken what's happening now in extreme sports to what
happened with rock 'n' roll in the early '60s,'' said ESPN Director
of Programming Ron Semiao. ``Traditional music critics said it
wasn't real music and wouldn't last. But the kids dug it, and it's
become an accepted part of our culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``With extreme sports, the initial reaction was that these
weren't real sports and these weren't real athletes. But the
culture has gained acceptance over time. Parents understand now
that their kids might be into skateboarding instead of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive Director Jack Wienert said people who are put off by
extreme athletes' frequently extreme slacker appearance need to
look closer. ``Mainstream folks say that what these athletes do is
extremely dangerous and that they're crazy. Well, it is extremely
dangerous, but they're not crazy or they'd be crippled or dead.
These are real athletes. They're serious about their sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Extreme sports culture was once easy to peg: a soundtrack of
hard-core Southern California punk bands, colorful hair in
bristling buzz cuts and clothes baggy enough to fit three people at
once.
</P>
<P>
   But as their ranks swell with enthusiasts from around the world,
the clothes and music of X athletes have become as diverse as the
sports they love. These days, not every skateboarder boasts
multiple tattoos and listens to Pennywise or Blink 182; they're
just as likely to be low-key jazz enthusiasts or dreadlocked cosmic
surfers with a Beastie Boys fixation.
</P>
<P>
   X Games skateboarder Danny Gonzalez, 20, likes everything from
punk to rap, preferably combined. He moved to San Francisco from
Texas two years ago, he said, ``because everyone in the entire
world knows about San Francisco. You've got families in Japan
sending their kids over here to skateboard. The scene at the
Embarcadero started a new breed.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their stylistic preferences, extreme athletes cherish
both their individuality and their sense of community.
Skateboarders and stunt bikers consider each other friends, not
competitors, insists San Francisco skater Drew Walker, 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real skateboarding is about bonding,'' he said. ``It's more
than just learning how to do tricks. It's the music, the people.
It's all linked.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Uyehara, 30, owner of FTC Skateboards in San Francisco's
Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, said, ``Mainstream recreation people
are trying to make things more competitive, because they think
that's what it's about. But the athletes don't care about that.
They don't want to compete _ their sponsors do.''
</P>
<P>
   With traditional sports stars' salaries going through the roof
and stadium costs climbing even higher, these highly
individualized, do-it-yourself athletes are increasingly being
courted by the sports establishment. Skateboarders are featured in
ads for everything from soft drinks to phone companies, and X Games
prize money has increased by 166 percent since the first games in
1995. NBC recently announced plans for its own extreme sports
competition, the Gravity Games.
</P>
<P>
   Uyehara concedes that such commercialization is inevitable. ``At
least if we're involved, we can give feedback and make sure it
retains its essence.''
</P>
<P>
   To bolster the X Games' credibility with kids on the street,
ESPN has recruited an array of athlete commentators and reporters.
Fans following the games on the Internet will have an opportunity
to vote for the winner in the skateboarding vert trick event and to
send in their own digital photos. A live chat crawl at the bottom
of the screen will accompany some events, similar to the crawls
used in MTV's video chats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be real, and we're always learning,'' said Wienert.
``We want our people to relate to this culture and these sports.
We've given the athletes respect, and we've earned theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pros like Dave Mirra say they're grateful to finally be earning
a living doing what they love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think that riding for corporate sponsors is
wrong,'' he said. ``But I've lived this sport for a long time, and
if I can get good endorsements, it helps me. We went a lot of years
with no money involved. It's not like we're basketball players
making millions of dollars. Money isn't a bad thing.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ As skateboarders, dirt bikers and other
``extreme'' daredevils gear up to take over some of the city's most
scenic spots this weekend, civic and business leaders are preparing
for crowded streets, parking madness _ and a big boost in the
city's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN, which produces the X Games, expects about 200,000 people
to come to San Francisco over the next 10 days. The games are being
held in San Francisco for the first time and may return next year.
</P>
<P>
   Like the events themselves, the parking and traffic could get
extreme. Events will run from noon until 9 p.m., and some roads
will be closed or severely restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Pristash, a 52-year-old city librarian, said he learned only
recently that ``the street luge, or something like that,'' would
result in road closures near his home in the Outer Richmond, on the
west end of town near the Pacific Ocean. Even so, he's looking
forward to watching contestants lying on sled-like boards zoom down
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have cable,'' Pristash said. ``So it'll be fun to see
in my neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Parking and traffic figure to be congested at Piers 30 and 32,
where skateboarders, snowboarders, dirt bikers and the majority of
X Games contestants will compete. Big crowds are also expected on
Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay for wakeboarding, described as
water skiing with a surfboard. The event will be held at Clipper
Cove on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's the crowds, not the closures, that city and business
leaders are looking forward to. Mayor Willie Brown sees the games
as ``a good opportunity to showcase San Francisco and bring in more
revenue,'' said spokeswoman Kandace Bender.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the games generated $32 million for San Diego,
according to a study commissioned by the San Diego International
Sports Council. The event drew 230,000 people, more than half
younger than 24.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN spokesman Chris Stiepock said it is hard to know exactly
how many people or how much money San Francisco will get. But with
the Bay Area as the draw, he said, these games should attract at
least as many as found their way to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important than the money, supporters say, is the
exposure San Francisco will get during 28 1/2 hours of TV coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really aimed at the youth market,'' said G. Rhea
Serpan, president of the Chamber of Commerce. ``They are an
important and fast-growing market segment, particularly for our
retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   Serpan plans to check out some of the events himself. ``I don't
understand the board-shredding stuff, so I gotta go find out what
it's about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the events are free to the public, ESPN officials loaded
up on sponsors such as Walt Disney Pictures, the Marines and the
Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsorship for San Francisco, however, did not come as easily.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN gave its national corporate sponsors exclusive rights to
hang their logos and banners at the games. As a result, few local
businesses were interested in fronting cash for an event at which
they will get little or no on-air exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials feared that the city would have to tap taxpayer
funds to pay for police, traffic control and maintenance crews. But
Brown and Supervisor Gavin Newsom finally persuaded several local
businesses and individual donors to come forward with a total of
nearly $700,000. Providian Financial Corp., Pacific Bell, Rite Aid,
KMEL and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. are among the city's
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any fund-raising effort, it was challenging,'' Newsom
said.

</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, San Francisco, the world skateboarding and
stunt-biking mecca, doesn't have a skate park. And kids who try to
skate on the sidewalk for lack of options can expect to have their
boards confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Jake Phelps, the 36-year-old editor of Thrasher, the

<P>
   ``Regular kids can't skate the X Games. It's a Madison Avenue
sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Even X Games fans see the irony. Rob Holmes, a 14-year-old San
Francisco skateboarder, can't wait to watch his favorite athletes
perform this coming week. But his excitement is tinged with
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a week to watch all these great pros skating, but we
don't have a chance to have fun like they do,'' he said wistfully.
``Wherever I skate, people tell me to get lost. It's so stupid.''

between afternoon and evening competitions with an indie-rock

</P>
<P>
   For some hard-core aficionados, though, the music and free
admission are just part of a corporate package they'd rather not
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can hype it until it's gone, but the people who are
really core will still be out there on the concrete when the
corporate sponsors have forgotten about skateboarding,'' said
Phelps, who won't be attending the games. ``That's the bottom line:
It's the concrete that teaches you how to skate.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BANK ON IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They give you this target, a huge glass board, and
they paint thick white lines in the middle, right above the
cylinder in which you'd like the ball to drop. They do everything
but write in the words: Aim here, win valuable prizes.
</P>
<P>
   There is money in the bank shot, so why is it that almost no one
in professional basketball besides Tim Duncan seems to have figured
this out?
</P>
<P>
   The best offensive basketball minds in the country have been
asked to develop new and improved ways to increase scoring in the
game before it requires shoot-outs, like soccer, to determine a
winner. After watching Duncan dominate the Knicks in three of the
four games of the NBA finals and lead the Spurs to the brink of
their first championship, sources tell me that David Stern's crack
committee has begun its report with the following recommendation:
</P>
<P>
   To all shooters:  &UR; Duh! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm surprised that more guys don't use the
backboard,'' Duncan said. ``It's just that it's a bit easier, a bit
easier for me, to throw it off the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I wouldn't exactly say throw, and nor would Duncan's
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows where his soft touch comes from?'' said Gregg
Popovich, after the Spurs finished Thursday's workout in
preparation for Game 5, Clinch Night I, Friday night at Madison
Square Garden. ``If we knew, all our guys would have it.''
</P>
<P>
   That still didn't answer the question of why the bank shot has
generally become more loathsome in basketball than the 1-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Popovich, leaving the court for the interview room, pointed to a
San Antonio television person and said, laughing, ``Because of
people like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he was standing behind a blue curtain, waiting for David
Robinson to finish talking, and saying: ``Seriously, I think it is
the whole television thing, the kind of shots that kids see on the
highlights every night. They just don't practice bank shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pressey, Popovich's assistant, was Don Nelson's ``point
forward'' in Milwaukee in the 1980s, when already the memories of
Sam Jones pulling up for a banker on the break at Boston Garden
were as dated a Sixties' staple as Jimi Hendrix's rendition of the
Star Spangled Banner. He said he often used the backboard from
``8-to-10 feet and in.'' In the mind of the modern player, Pressey
said, the bank shot came to look too much like a lucky ricochet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most players like to see the ball go through the net because
they think it looks better,'' said Pressey. ``But I always felt it
gave you not only a target but more of a gray area to shoot at.''
</P>
<P>
   In this era of falling field goal percentages, forgotten are
those _ Julius Erving then, Scottie Pippen now _ who weren't
naturally gifted shooters but helped themselves by using the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Popovich dispatched Pressey to Wake Forest
to run Duncan through a series of drills prior to the draft,
Pressey could barely believe what he was watching. A gifted giant
moving side-to-side, banking in one 15 footer after another. At
dinner, Pressey asked Duncan why he had developed the angled
banker, when the majority of players can't make the mid-range
jumper but still can't be talked out of aiming for the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan _ no child of the Nike summer camps _ compared it to
playing the angles in his beloved video games. Pressey called
Popovich, sitting pretty back home with the No. 1 pick. Pressey
said, ``This is the next coming, the player who's going to have the
huge impact on the league. I don't know how soon, but soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan retired in this, Duncan's second season. He is
shooting 52 percent in the finals, to the Knicks' 38. In the
probable event this concludes with the Spurs as champions, only the
sympathy vote for Robinson could prevent Duncan from winning most
valuable player. Is this soon enough?
</P>
<P>
   We'll never know how much of a difference even a sub-par Patrick
Ewing would have made, but Larry Johnson on Duncan has to be one of
the most unfair matchups in the history of the league. Chris Dudley
and Marcus Camby have only been marginally better. When he isn't
ripping L.J., Bill Walton _ who, when healthy, was the most
diversely skilled big man I ever saw _ must love watching Duncan
catch, turn and score off glass. Walton wore opponents out with
that shot.
</P>
<P>
   But there I go again, getting all nostalgic about old-school
fundamentals, when everyone knows that the rim is hip and the
backboard is square. Here is what Tim Duncan knows: one more
victory and he will stand tall, at the pinnacle of his sport. Bank
on that.

X GAMES SOAR TO NEW HEIGHTS IN THEIR FIFTH YEAR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Stunt biker Dave Mirra hopes he doesn't leave
his heart in San Francisco. He's already left his spleen in Dallas,
thanks to an accident in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mirra, at 25 the world's premier stunt rider, is understated
about what he expects from the 1999 X Games, which open Friday at
San Francisco's Pier 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``A challenge. I've ridden in San Francisco before, and I'm
hoping to break more records.''
</P>
<P>
   And, with a little luck, no bones.
</P>
<P>
   Through July 3, ESPN's fifth annual extreme sports competition
will bring more than 400 world-class alternative athletes to the
Bay Area. The games were held in San Diego the past two years. The
nine-day event should be an eye-opener for those who think the X
Games cater to slackers.
</P>
<P>
   This year's games will be televised on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC.
Corporate sponsors such as Sony and Adidas have been jockeying for
position all year, and the U.S. Postal Service is issuing more than
150 million commemorative stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes have never been higher for X athletes. They're
competing for nearly $1 million in prize money in nine different
categories and 24 disciplines _ from aggressive in-line skating,
bicycle stunt riding and skateboarding to sky surfing, sport
climbing and big-air snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
   The graffiti are on the wall: Extreme sports are big and getting
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken what's happening now in extreme sports to what
happened with rock 'n' roll in the early '60s,'' said ESPN Director
of Programming Ron Semiao. ``Traditional music critics said it
wasn't real music and wouldn't last. But the kids dug it, and it's
become an accepted part of our culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``With extreme sports, the initial reaction was that these
weren't real sports and these weren't real athletes. But the
culture has gained acceptance over time. Parents understand now
that their kids might be into skateboarding instead of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive Director Jack Wienert said people who are put off by
extreme athletes' frequently extreme slacker appearance need to
look closer. ``Mainstream folks say that what these athletes do is
extremely dangerous and that they're crazy. Well, it is extremely
dangerous, but they're not crazy or they'd be crippled or dead.
These are real athletes. They're serious about their sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Extreme sports culture was once easy to peg: a soundtrack of
hard-core Southern California punk bands, colorful hair in
bristling buzz cuts and clothes baggy enough to fit three people at
once.
</P>
<P>
   But as their ranks swell with enthusiasts from around the world,
the clothes and music of X athletes have become as diverse as the
sports they love. These days, not every skateboarder boasts
multiple tattoos and listens to Pennywise or Blink 182; they're
just as likely to be low-key jazz enthusiasts or dreadlocked cosmic
surfers with a Beastie Boys fixation.
</P>
<P>
   X Games skateboarder Danny Gonzalez, 20, likes everything from
punk to rap, preferably combined. He moved to San Francisco from
Texas two years ago, he said, ``because everyone in the entire
world knows about San Francisco. You've got families in Japan
sending their kids over here to skateboard. The scene at the
Embarcadero started a new breed.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their stylistic preferences, extreme athletes cherish
both their individuality and their sense of community.
Skateboarders and stunt bikers consider each other friends, not
competitors, insists San Francisco skater Drew Walker, 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real skateboarding is about bonding,'' he said. ``It's more
than just learning how to do tricks. It's the music, the people.
It's all linked.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Uyehara, 30, owner of FTC Skateboards in San Francisco's
Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, said, ``Mainstream recreation people
are trying to make things more competitive, because they think
that's what it's about. But the athletes don't care about that.
They don't want to compete _ their sponsors do.''
</P>
<P>
   With traditional sports stars' salaries going through the roof
and stadium costs climbing even higher, these highly
individualized, do-it-yourself athletes are increasingly being
courted by the sports establishment. Skateboarders are featured in
ads for everything from soft drinks to phone companies, and X Games
prize money has increased by 166 percent since the first games in
1995. NBC recently announced plans for its own extreme sports
competition, the Gravity Games.
</P>
<P>
   Uyehara concedes that such commercialization is inevitable. ``At
least if we're involved, we can give feedback and make sure it
retains its essence.''
</P>
<P>
   To bolster the X Games' credibility with kids on the street,
ESPN has recruited an array of athlete commentators and reporters.
Fans following the games on the Internet will have an opportunity
to vote for the winner in the skateboarding vert trick event and to
send in their own digital photos. A live chat crawl at the bottom
of the screen will accompany some events, similar to the crawls
used in MTV's video chats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be real, and we're always learning,'' said Wienert.
``We want our people to relate to this culture and these sports.
We've given the athletes respect, and we've earned theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pros like Dave Mirra say they're grateful to finally be earning
a living doing what they love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think that riding for corporate sponsors is
wrong,'' he said. ``But I've lived this sport for a long time, and
if I can get good endorsements, it helps me. We went a lot of years
with no money involved. It's not like we're basketball players
making millions of dollars. Money isn't a bad thing.''

New York Post. When they realized their mistake, they got out and
searched for their own limo.
</P>
<P>
   Allen explained to the New York Daily News why he doesn't gab
with the other celebrities at games, and always appears unexcited:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been teased about this many times. I'm not interested in
all the promotions on the floor, or the propaganda that comes over
the TV screen. I just watch the guys play basketball, and as I do,
I quietly make lists in my mind, remembering the great moments and
the players who made the great plays....''
</P>

ANALYZE THIS, SAY WALTON AND COLLINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Doug Collins strode rapidly across the Madison Square
Garden hardwood Wednesday night before Game 4 of the National
Basketball Association finals. When he stopped, Collins, an NBC
Sports analyst and former Detroit Pistons coach, sounded overly
caffeinated, overly excited. Only his brush cut lacked conspicuous
animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's mellow compared to when he coached,'' said Bob Costas,
his partner on the air. ``He sweats through his shirt and jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking slowly on the Garden floor on painful feet was Bill
Walton, who is with NBC's pre- and post-game programs. The night
before, on Charlie Rose's PBS talk show, Walton unloaded a dump
truck's worth of outrageousness, from saying, ``I'm for anything
that gets Charlie Ward off the court'' to failing to name the five
smartest NBA players. He managed four _ slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The question, he said, flummoxed him, having never been asked
such a stumper before. Now, he could name more than five (he
regretted forgetting Chris Mullin) but would rather list brainy
old-timers and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   And so, our tale of two analysts, both former players: Collins,
the X's and O's overlord, and Walton, the full-time loose cannon
with zero tolerance for players who fail to follow the tao of
teamwork as taught by his personal Yoda, John Wooden, who coached
him at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Collins talks faster than Walton and is kinder when players err,
which isn't difficult; he avoids personal attacks (a bad shot is
not a license to excoriate) and offers focused commentary. Costas'
whimsy leavens Collins' single-minded resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Collins quickly saw that San Antonio was calling numerous
screen-and-rolls, rather than post-ups, to promote team movement;
he cautioned that Marcus Camby, starting as the Knicks' center, had
to be a little too tired from expending his nervous energy to be
effective; he suggested that the key to handling the Knicks'
Latrell Sprewell was to let him shoot from the field and keep him
off the foul line, and he linked Knicks point guard Charlie Ward to
the word ``great'' for scoring 10 points in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The praise for Ward put him on a collision course with Walton,
whose halftime demeanor _ he was on a set with Hannah Storm, Isiah
Thomas and Pete Vecsey _ is that of a serene assassin, ready for a
portentous pounce. Having no air time for over an hour had him
bubbling to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about my man, Charlie Ward!'' said Walton. Was this his
newest flip-flop (like his sudden, recent playoff embrace of ``my
Knicks'') from wishing exile for Ward to exulting over him? ``But
please _ here's a guy _ $30 million _ and all he gets is a couple
of baskets in a half of a half? Please!''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Knicks hung around gamely before losing, 96-89,
they fell prey to what Collins expected just as the second half
began: the tightening of the Spurs' defensive noose led by Tim
Duncan and David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The harshest nugget from Collins was: ``It's been a nightmare
for Larry Johnson in the paint.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a retirement party tribute compared with Walton's
post-game censure on CNBC. Walton stirred Johnson's bad
performance, obscene tirades and remarks about the Knicks being
``rebellious slaves'' into a withering broadside: ``What a sad
human being. This is a disgrace to the game of basketball, to the
NBA _ he played like a disgrace tonight. He deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton first scorched Johnson on Tuesday on ``MSG SportsDesk''
(which nearly overlapped with his taped ``Charlie Rose'' gig),
saying his actions and comments are a ``disgrace to anyone who's
ever worn the NBA jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed not only for the league, but for the human
race,'' Walton added.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Johnson said, ``Isn't that the same Bill Walton that
was at UCLA and smoked pot, a hippie?''
</P>
<P>
   While Walton was protecting those of genteel constitutions from
L.J.'s oratory, Collins was revisiting the game after the final
buzzer. Inside NBC's production truck outside the Garden, Collins
stood opposite producer David Neal, planning video packages and
statistical tales for Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should lead with San Antonio,'' said Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Collins said, easing into his fast-talking mode.
``We've talked about the Twin Towers, but in games they've won,
it's the supporting cast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What if we do bar graphs on all four games?'' said Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supporting cast,'' said Collins, riffling though his
scoresheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One bar has Robinson and Duncan's combined points,'' said
Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty to 50 each night,'' said Collins. ``For Game 4, it'll be
higher for the supporting cast. They had 46.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the Knicks?'' Neal asked. ``Let's do Spree and
Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the stars,'' Collins said. ``But offense wasn't their
problem tonight. It was San Antonio's defense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's do a package of San Antonio defensive stops,'' said
Neal. ``There was that terrific block Duncan didn't get credit
for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had nine blocks,'' said Collins. ``Robinson and Duncan
were always there.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Collins's post-game relaxation. He did not seem tired,
yet talking about the game he had just talked about somehow calmed
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, it's a way to unwind,'' Collins said. ``It's fresh
in our minds, so why not talk about it?''

VAN GUNDY, ASSURED HIS JOB IS NOT IN JEOPARDY, SET TO RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying he had been assured by Madison Square Garden
president Dave Checketts between two and three weeks ago that his
job is not in jeopardy, Jeff Van Gundy gave the clearest indication
yet Thursday that he will return to coach the Knicks next season.
</P>
<P>
   The day before his team faced elimination in Game 5 of the
National Basketball Association finals, the once-embattled coach
reluctantly ended any looming speculation that he and the franchise
would part ways after a 10-year association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really up in the air,'' Van Gundy said Thursday
before the Knicks practiced at Madison Square Garden. ``Dave made
it clear to me that he wants me back. That's not the question. It
hasn't really been a question for two or three weeks. We just said
we're not going to talk about it until after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it clear that's what he wants. We just have to make
sure that it's the right thing. I'm sure it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments came as the Knicks, down by 3-1 in the
four-of-seven-games series against San Antonio, prepared for Friday
night's game. It has been nearly a month since Van Gundy's job was
thought to be in jeopardy if the Knicks did not get out of the
first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts has been mum about Van Gundy's situation, saying only
that he planned to meet with the coach after the season. Thursday,
he declined comment through a spokesman, who added that Checketts
was sticking to his original plan of discussing the team's future
with Van Gundy after the finals.
</P>
<P>
   But the feeling among most observers inside and outside the
Garden hierarchy is that if Van Gundy was in any danger of losing
his job, the Knicks' implausible run to the finals after a mediocre
regular season helped secure his future in New York.
</P>
<P>
   After the disclosure before Game 3 against Atlanta in the second
round of the playoffs that Checketts had secretly met with Phil
Jackson in April about taking over the team, Van Gundy went from
another beleaguered coach on the firing line to instant martyrdom,
the persecuted underdog trying to save his job with each victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made it clear to me that he wants me back; I don't think
that's a revelation,'' Van Gundy said of his informal discussion
with Checketts. Told that the news of his probable return as coach
was a revelation, Van Gundy added: ``Well, I didn't mean it to be.
That's not even what I'm thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just saying, he's made that clear to me. In the process,
he's also said we're going to wait until after the season to talk
about it. Which is exactly what I wanted, too. Because why would we
want to talk about next year when this year is still happening?''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy was unclear about when Checketts relayed the message,
but it appears to have taken place between the Hawks series and the
Eastern Conference championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about whether Checketts' clandestine meeting with Jackson
would prevent him from again trusting the Garden president, Van
Gundy said: ``That was never a huge issue. Some other things _ not
with Dave _ were more of an issue to me.''
</P>
<P>
   After a tumultuous season that included a covert and often
bitter feud with the deposed general manager, Ernie Grunfeld, over
personnel decisions _ Grunfeld reportedly was on the verge of
firing Van Gundy twice during the regular season _ Van Gundy
appears headed toward a long-term extension after the season.
</P>
<P>
   By making the finals, Van Gundy insured himself $6 million _ $2
million to be paid next season, a club option that automatically
kicked in for the following year at $3.5 million and a $500,000
bonus for guiding the team to the championship round.
</P>
<P>
   Given that most of the game's premier coaches have signed
five-year deals in the last two seasons _ including Jackson's $30
million, five-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers last week _
Van Gundy's agent, Rob Ades, will most likely try to work out an
extension on his client's current deal, which expires in 2001. The
spiraling salaries of his peers could put Van Gundy in line for a
package worth about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen who will take over the Knicks' general
manager duties. Checketts, who has returned to the role on an
interim basis since re-assigning Grunfeld in April when the team
was 21-21, will not remain in that role.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant general manager Ed Tapscott has ties to Grunfeld, but
has worked closely with Checketts and Van Gundy on a multitude of
personnel matters for much of the last decade. Van Gundy has
intimated he wants a more defined role in personnel decisions, but
it is unlikely he would be offered the general manager position, or
accept it, if it involved day-to-day duties at the team's midtown
corporate offices.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the coach, who has been on and off the firing line
since March 8, 1996, the day he replaced Don Nelson, seems
committed to the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only thinking about coaching here,'' Van Gundy said.
``I've been fortunate to be here a long time and I've really never
wanted to be someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he believed he had done a good job this
season, he refused to comment on his own performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, our team has done a great, great job of finding
itself in a shortened season with a lot of change and hanging in
there and playing its best basketball when it counts,'' Van Gundy
said. ``I've said it before: this is not a magical run. This is not
Cinderella.''

KLA LEADERS KILLED RIVALS WITHIN OWN RANKS, OFFICIALS SAY  
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The senior commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who have a
signed agreement with NATO to disarm, carried out assassinations,
arrests and purges within their ranks to thwart potential rivals,
say current and former commanders in the rebel army and some
Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, in which as many as half a dozen top rebel
commanders were shot dead, was directed by Hashim Thaci and two of
his lieutenants, Azem Syla and Xhavit Haliti, these officials said.
Thaci denied through a spokesman that he had been responsible for
any killings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States has long been wary of the KLA, the
rebel group has become the main ethnic Albanian power in Kosovo.
Rebel commanders supplied NATO with target information during the
bombing campaign. Now, after the war, the United States and other
NATO powers have effectively made Thaci and the KLA partners in
rebuilding Kosovo. The agreement NATO signed with Thaci, for
example, envisions turning the KLA into a civilian police force and
leaves open the possibility that the KLA could become a provisional
army modeled on the U.S. National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the KLA officials interviewed saw Thaci or his
aides execute anyone, they recounted, and in some cases said they
had witnessed, incidents in which Thaci's rivals had been killed
shortly after he or one of his aides had threatened them with
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the war started, everyone wanted to be the chief,'' said
Rifat Haxhijaj, 30, a former lieutenant in the Yugoslav army who
left the rebel movement last September and now lives in
Switzerland. ``For the leadership, this was never just a war
against Serbs _ it was also a struggle for power.''
</P>
<P>
   Thaci's representative in Switzerland, Jashae Salihu, denied
accounts of assassinations. ``These kind of reports are untrue,''
he said. ``Neither Thaci nor anyone else from the KLA is involved
in this kind of activity. Our goal has been to establish a free
Kosovo and nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusations of assassinations and purges were made in
interviews with about a dozen former and current Kosovo Liberation
Army officials, two of whom said they had witnessed executions of
Thaci's rivals; a former senior diplomat for the Albanian
government; a former police official in the Albanian government who
worked with the rebel group, and several Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department Wednesday challenged some aspects of
these accounts. ``We simply don't have information to substantiate
allegations that there was a KLA-leadership-directed program of
assassinations or executions,'' James Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he could not exclude the possibility that the rebel
leaders were somehow tied to the killings. But he said department
officials had checked a wide range of sources in the past 24 hours
and could not confirm the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official and a Western diplomat in the
Balkans, citing intelligence reports and extensive contacts with
KLA officials inside and outside Kosovo, said they were aware of
executions of middle-grade officers suspected of collaborating with
the Serbs, but said they had no evidence to link those killings
with Thaci.
</P>
<P>
   The Western diplomat in the Balkans said, however, that Thaci is
legendary in the region for ruthless tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thaci has engaged in some pretty rough intimidation'' of
officials in a rival party, the diplomat said, ``but none of them
have been killed.'' He added: ``There have been detentions, and the
victims allege beatings. We cannot prove that. Thaci, according to
them, was in charge of the team that detained them and was in
charge of the interrogation and personally threatened them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thaci has a reputation for being pretty tough,'' the diplomat
continued. ``Haliti and Syla are not known for their sweet tempers.
This is a rough neighborhood, and intimidation and assassinations
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Former and current KLA officials also charge that a campaign of
assassinations was carried out in close cooperation with the
Albanian government, which often placed agents from the Albanian
secret police at the disposal of the rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the State Department did not have any information to
suggest that the KLA leadership directed an execution program in
conjunction with the Albanian security services.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Western diplomat in the Balkans said he knew of at least two
Albanian secret police officers who were fighting with the KLA.
``The two officers are brigade or battalion commanders, and they've
been in the field fighting,'' the diplomat said. ``They're
volunteers from Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   Albania has long waged a campaign to unite with Kosovo, a
Serbian province where Albanians are in the majority. Such
unification was briefly achieved during Fascist occupation in World
War II and was held out as a goal by radical groups financed and
backed by Tirana in the later part of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the close relationship between Thaci and the Tirana
government, which has a reputation for corruption and has been
linked by Western diplomats to drug trafficking, is one of the
factors that disillusioned many former fighters who were
interviewed in Germany, Switzerland and Albania. The fighters said
they had fought to create a more Western, democratic state, free
from Albanian influence and control.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian minister of information, Musa Ulqini, said that
there was ``never any violation of our constitutional law.'' He
added: ``The Albanian government has relations with all of the
political and military forces in Kosovo, but it insists that these
forces unite and speak with one voice.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two former rebel leaders and a former Albanian police official,
interviewed in Tirana, said that Haliti, who is officially Thaci's
ambassador to Albania, was working in Kosovo with 10 secret police
agents from Albania to form an internal security network that would
be used to silence dissenters in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci, 30, has named a government, with himself as prime
minister, and denounced Ibrahim Rugova, who for nearly a decade was
the self-styled president of Kosovo and ran a successful campaign
of nonviolent protest after the Serbs stripped Kosovo of its
autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci has long ties to radical groups that called for the
violent overthrow of the government in Belgrade. He joined a
clandestine organization known as the Kosovo Popular Movement that
existed on the fringes of Pristina University.
</P>
<P>
   The group was financed and backed by the Stalinist dictator of
Albania, Enver Hoxha, until his death in 1985. Its members,
including Syla, whom Thaci appointed his defense minister, and
Haliti have become the core of the leadership that dominates the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has long swirled around Thaci, whose nom de guerre was
Snake.

   In June 1997, in an incident that many in the underground
guerrilla movement found ominous, a Kosovar Albanian reporter who
had close links with the movement was found dead in his apartment
in Tirana, his face disfigured by repeated stabbings with a
screwdriver and the butt end of a broken bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, Ali Uka, was supportive of the rebel movement, but
he was also independent enough to criticize it. At the time of his
death, he was sharing his apartment with Thaci.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thaci inspired fear and respect in his home base of the central
Drenica region in Kosovo as he organized armed units and carried
out ambushes against Serbian policemen. In the early days of the
rebel uprising, in March 1998, Thaci moved about from his hometown
of Broja in a small compact car with a few bodyguards and wore an
unadorned camouflage uniform.
</P>
<P>
   There were persistent reports at the time that he personally
carried out executions of Kosovar Albanians whom he had branded as
traitors or collaborators, but no witnesses have surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci was involved, along with Haliti, in arms smuggling from
Switzerland in the years before the 1998 uprising, say current and
former senior rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thaci and Haliti both have wives and children in Switzerland,
although Haliti has formed a new family in Tirana, where he has a
large villa and close links with senior government leaders, say
former and current rebel officials in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When the uprising began, and money and volunteers flooded into
Albania from the 700,000 Kosovar Albanians living in Europe, Thaci
and Haliti found themselves in charge of thousands of fighters and
tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The arms smuggling mushroomed into a huge operation that saw
trucks loaded with weapons, most bought from Albanian officials,
headed for KLA camps on the border. By the war's end, former and
current KLA officials estimate, the KLA. paid $50 million to
Albanian officials for weapons and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, a KLA commander who transported many of the
weapons, Ilir Konushevci, was ambushed and killed on the road
outside Tropoja in northern Albania. A few days earlier, in a
heated meeting with senior commanders, he had accused Haliti of
misusing funds, according to commanders who were present.
</P>
<P>
   The commander had charged that Haliti was buying boxes of
grenades at $2 apiece and charging the movement $7 for each
grenade. The killing, although it took place in a rebel-controlled
region in northern Albania, was blamed on the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Other killings of rebel commanders and political rivals ascribed
to Thaci are attributed to a struggle to consolidate control and
eliminate potential challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cadavers have never been an obstacle to Thaci's career,'' said
Bujar Bukoshi, the prime minister in exile in Rugova's
administration, which is often at odds with the KLA. One Western
diplomat, citing intelligence reports, said that Thaci planned an
unsuccessful assassination attempt on Bukoshi last May. ``Thaci has
a single goal and that is to promote himself, to be No. 1,''
Bukoshi said.
</P>
<P>
   As the rebels suffered reverses on the battlefield in the summer
and fall of 1998, in large part due to inexperience and a lack of
central command, they turned to Kosovar Albanians who had served in
the former Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   The most experienced was a former colonel named Ahmet Krasniqi
who had organized some 600 former officers, most living in
Switzerland and Germany, to join the fight. Krasniqi had
surrendered his garrison in Gospic, Croatia, in 1991 rather than
defend Slobodan Milosevic's regime in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi had the blessing of Bukoshi, who allowed him to pass on
$4.5 million to the KLA raised by Rugova's administration. He
swiftly set up training camps in the border region and formed
special units. Bukoshi named him commander of a rival military
structure known as the Armed Forces of the Kosovo Republic. The
effort to join the armed struggle was a belated attempt by the
Rugova administration, which had swiftly lost political support in
Kosovo, to regain credibility by playing a role in the
``liberation'' of the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci and Haliti accepted the money and the trained volunteers,
integrating them into KLA units, but began to thwart Krasniqi's
attempt to build an independent military force. In June 1998 the
KLA, which controlled the border, began to divert or block arms
being taken over the mountain to these rival units fighting around
Pec and Decane. As tensions rose, Thaci and the Albanian
authorities decided to eliminate Krasniqi, according to former
rebel commanders and two former Albanian officials interviewed in
Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   They said that in the middle of September 1998, Albanian police
stopped Krasniqi and several aides and confiscated their weapons.
Krasniqi's office in Tirana was raided by about 50 policemen and
emptied of guns and munitions. On Sept. 21 at 11 p.m. on the way
back from a restaurant in Tirana, Krasniqi ran into a police
checkpoint about 300 yards from his office, according to a former
KLA commander who was with Krasniqi. Krasniqi and his two
companions were again frisked for weapons, and their vehicle was
searched. The two cars behind Krasniqi, which carried aides, were
not allowed through the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   When Krasniqi and his two companions got out of their gray Opal
jeep they saw three men emerge from the shadows with black hoods
over their faces. The men, speaking in an Albanian accent that
distinguished them from Kosovar Albanians, ordered the two men with
Krasniqi down on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which one is it?'' asked one of the gunmen, according to one
of the commanders who was prone on the asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one in the middle,'' said another. The gunmen, who held a
pistol a few inches from Krasniqi's head, fired a shot. He then
fired two more shots into Krasniqi's head once he fell onto the
pavement.
</P>
<P>
   American officials also had reports that the KLA killed
Krasniqi, but said there were also subsequent, conflicting reports
from the region that he was killed by disaffected members of his
own unit.
</P>
<P>
   After Krasniqi's death, former KLA commanders said, the
killings, purges and arrests accelerated. KLA police, dressed in
distinctive black fatigues, threw into detention anyone who
appeared hostile to Thaci. Many of these people were beaten.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One commander, Blerim Kuci, was taken away in October 1998 to a
KLA jail and hauled before a revolutionary court. He was held for
weeks on charges that he was a Serb collaborator and then suddenly
released in the face of a large Serb offensive and allowed to
rejoin the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw an accused collaborator tried before a revolutionary
court and then tied to the back of a car in Glodjane and dragged
through the streets until he died,'' said a former KLA officer in
Albania, who asked not to be identified. A senior State Department
official and a Western diplomat in the Balkans confirmed this
account.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As NATO bombs fell on Kosovo this April, two more outspoken
commanders, Agim Ramadani, a captain in the former Yugoslav army,
and Sali Ceku, were killed, each in an alleged Serb ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Although a former senior rebel officer in Tirana said that Thaci
was responsible, a Western diplomat contends that that Ceku was
killed by a Serb sniper. He said that his contacts indicated that
Ramadani was killed in battle, but those contacts did not mention
an ambush, or politically related killing, in either case.
</P>
<P>
   The former KLA officer said, however, that rebel officials had
told Ceku that he and his lieutenant Tahir Zemaj should leave the
movement, but the stubborn Ceku had refused to depart. Zemaj,
however, fled to Germany. ``Tahir knew they were serious, and he
got out,'' said the officer said. ``Sali stayed, and he was
killed.''

BLACKJACK ON THE WEST BANK, SURREAL IN ISRAEL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ Israeli-Palestinian relations have
entered into a bizarre twilight. Quite simply, thanks to the Oslo
peace process, Israelis and Palestinians have become
psychologically disconnected enough in their daily lives to be more
concerned with their respective internal politics than each other.
Yet, in reality, they are physically more connected than ever.
</P>
<P>
   When you are with secular Israelis today, they spend all their
time complaining about the ultra-Orthodox; when you are with
Palestinians today they spend all their time complaining about
Yasser Arafat, corruption and their lack of democracy. But
Palestinians and Israelis talk very little about each other
anymore. They remind you of a couple who have decided to get
divorced, but still can't agree on how to divide up their property
_ and may never agree _ so they live separate existences under the
same roof. They try to ignore each other, but can't help bumping
into each other.
</P>
<P>
   You can really see this when it comes to the issue of democracy.
Palestinians will tell you that what impressed them most about the
latest Israeli election was not Ehud Barak's victory, but the swift
way Benjamin Netanyahu conceded defeat and disappeared. That just
would not happen in any Arab state.
</P>
<P>
   More and more Palestinians will now tell you frankly that they
would like a Palestinian state like Israel _ with a strong supreme
court, a civil liberties union and real freedom of speech. More and
more Israelis will now tell you that they would like a Palestinian
state like Syria _ with no real supreme court and no civil
liberties union, so that Arafat will have no inhibitions about
kicking in Palestinian doors at 3 a.m. to find Hamas terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   More and more Palestinians are starting to realize that they
cannot make peace with Israel without Yasser Arafat, and that they
will never have democracy with Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the Nablus-based Center for Palestine Research found
that 71 percent of Palestinians feel there is corruption in the
Palestinian Authority, and 57 percent feel they cannot criticize
their leaders. When asked if they had a ``positive'' assessment of
Palestinian democracy, 27 percent of Palestinians said yes. When
asked if they had a ``positive'' evaluation of Israeli democracy,
70 percent of Palestinians said yes.
</P>
<P>
   But while Israelis and Palestinians have never seemed more
separated psychologically, they have never seemed more integrated
physically. The web of roads, tunnels and settlements that connects
Israel and the West Bank is increasingly seamless. This is creating
some weird interactions. Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli Arab and former
adviser to Arafat, was just elected to the Knesset, and he has
asked for a place on the Knesset's most important committee _ The
Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee, which oversees the Mossad _
where no Israeli Arab has ever been allowed to serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house is the symbol of Israeli democracy,'' Tibi told me
in an interview in his Knesset office. ``This democracy has to be
absolute, not relative. I cannot accept that there are secrets I
can't hear because I did not serve in the army. We have many
members of this Knesset from the Orthodox Jewish parties who did
not serve in the army. I was elected by the people to express my
opinion on every issue. There is no government post that I would
restrict myself from, except chief rabbi.''
</P>
<P>
   Another blurring of lines happened this week when Israeli police
opened fire with rubber bullets on Arab protesters _ in the Israeli
Arab town of Lod _ and wounded an Israeli Arab Knesset member in
the process. The Arabs pointed out that Israeli police had fired on
the Israeli Arab demonstrators as if they were no different from
Palestinian refugees in Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Palestinian casino in Jericho, which is now
raking in roughly $1 million a day from Israeli visitors.
(Palestinians are not allowed to gamble.) Whatever peace deal is
achieved, Israeli gamblers will insist on their legitimate rights
to be able to go to Jericho for blackjack.
</P>
<P>
   It is often said that the Israeli doves won the debate about
peace _ a majority of Israelis now favor the creation of a
demilitarized Palestinian state _ but that the Israeli hawks won
the land, because the amount of territory they have claimed in the
West Bank will make a separate, contiguous Palestinian state
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The hawks may be sorry. If the psychological separation between
Israelis and Palestinians cannot be turned into physical
separation, you may end up with Israeli Arabs and West Bank
Palestinians one day merging, and declaring: ``Maybe the Israeli
hawks are right. Maybe we should just have one state between Jordan
and the sea. Rather than having a corrupt little Palestinian
dictatorship, maybe we should focus instead on fighting for equal
rights in Israel. After all, under a Palestinian state, my standard
of living will go down, my civil liberties will go down, my press
freedom will go down. The only thing that will go up is my flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't rule it out.

NATO CHIEF CALLS FOR SPEEDUP IN TROOP DEPLOYMENT

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark called
for an accelerated deployment of peacekeeping troops Thursday as
the cycle of violence between ethnic Albanians and Serbs continued
to escalate here.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and NATO Secretary General Javier Solana basked in the
cheers of ethnic Albanians who came out by the hundreds to greet
them in the Kosovo capital chanting, ``NATO, NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   But only blocks away the death toll from brutal revenge attacks
was mounting.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of three men, including a Serb professor, were found
at the Serb-run economics department at Pristina University. Two
were bound and gagged and a third lay on the floor. They were
apparently beaten with a hammer, which lay next to the bodies, and
then shot to death, said the dean of the department, Milos Simovic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops sealed off the basement and were investigating.
</P>
<P>
   In another neighborhood, a Serb was killed and an ethnic
Albanian wounded in a gunbattle Thursday when a family of Albanian
refugees returned to their Pristina apartment and found it occupied
by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were taken to the capital's main hospital, where
relatives of the dead Serb again opened fire in a hallway, wounding
a guard and a nurse. British officers intervened and told them to
lay down their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the homes of Serb families who had fled Kosovo
continued to burn throughout the province, especially in the
northern city of Pec, where scores of homes smoldered as ethnic
Albanians looted Serb homes block by block. They filled tractors
and trucks full of sofas, televisions, and refrigerators as the
smoke rose from fires.
</P>
<P>
   With only half of the requested 55,000 international
peacekeeping team deployed in Kosovo, Clark said, ``We've asked
member governments and contributing partner governments to speed
the deployment of those troops to the maximum extent possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain and France have agreed to put thousands of soldiers on
standby for rapid reaction service, officials said Thursday.
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Britain would put the
equivalent of a brigade -- usually from six to eight thousand
soldiers -- at U.N. disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Serbs held a demonstration here to highlight
their fears over the looting and killing by ethnic Albanians. The
demonstration turned violent as Serbs gathered in the street began
pelting with rocks several ethnic Albanian families who were
returning on tractors from refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the rising tension, Clark said, ``KFOR will look after you.
Stay and give peace a chance. This is the message I delivered to
the Serb political and religious leaders when I met them a few
minutes ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need for anyone to leave Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Solana also met with KLA leaders and the Serbian Orthodox
Church's Bishop of Pristina who he said shook hands and agreed to
hold further meetings. Church officials say that at least 20 Serbs
have been victims of vengeance killings in the week since the
withdrawl of Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Solana and Clark said that they believe the horrors being
uncovered in Kosovo provide clear justification for the alliance's
punishing bombing campaign of Serb forces that began on March 24
and lasted 11 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Solana and Clark arrived a day after US Marines came under fire
by Serb attackers armed with AK-47s in the southeastern Kosovo town
of Zegra. The Marines, who called in attack helicopters, killed one
of the assailants and wounded two others, a NATO spokesman in
Pristina said.
</P>
<P>
   No Marines were injured, but the shooting underscored the risks
facing NATO troops trying to restore security after 17 months of
ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO leaders toured the burned sections of Pristina,
Yugoslavia's parliament voted to end the state of war declared when
NATO began its bombing campaign on March 24. The measure, which
takes effect Saturday, lifts media restrictions, a ban on
military-age men leaving the country and a ban on public
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   But the parliament is to vote Friday on measures to give the
Milosevic government power to crack down on dissent and keep its
wartime controls over banking and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressure, disgruntled Yugoslav army reservists
blocked roads in central Serbia for the second straight day
Thursday, demanding back pay for service during the bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But in Pristina, the celebrations of NATO were thunderous.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds swarmed central Pristina for a look at the men they see
as liberators -- Solana, Clark, and Lt. General Mike Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest demonstration in Pristina since ethnic
Albanians took to the streets to plea for NATO intervention shortly
before the bombing campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   Several men dressed in traditional white conical hats worn by
ethnic Albanians broke through the crowd to kiss the smiling Solana
before he disappeared into the former Yugoslavia headquarters now
home to the UN mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KFOR forces are now working hard to end the violence that
for many dark months was part of everyday life in Kosovo,'' Solana
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the KFOR troops would continue to fight to make
Kosovo a place ``where justice can prevail and all the refugees can
return home.''
</P>
<P>
   But for that justice to prevail ethnic Albanians say the Serb
leaders who ordered and executed the murderous campaign of ethnic
cleansing throughout Kosovo must be brought to trial in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   FBI forensic experts began gathering evidence at two sites in
the western Kosovo town of Djakovica to build the case for the
indictment of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. The US
ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues, David Scheffer, said
their work would be vital to uncovering evidence Serbs tried to
hide or destroy.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops were holding a man who residents of the northern
village of Slovinia identified as taking part in the April massacre
of 43 men and of two women who were raped before being killed.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department announced a $5 million
reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of
people sought by the UN tribunal trying war crimes cases from the
conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo.

FOR JURORS, NO CLEAR-CUT VILLAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The verdict was a metaphor for the case itself.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors in the Reggie Lewis medical malpractice case, peppered
for weeks with duelling experts, contradictory evidence, and one
witness who testified both ways on the crucial question of drug
use, gave back what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   They saw shades of gray, not black and white.
</P>
<P>
   They saw nuance and complexity, not clear-cut villains or
victors.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day you've got one of the city's leading
cardiologist's reputation dragged through the mud,'' said Boston
attorney Robert A. Sherman. ``At the end of the day, you've got the
former Celtic captain's reputation tarnished by allegations of
cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no winners. Reggie Lewis is dead and nothing can be
done to alter that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after he declared a mistrial in the case against Dr.
Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., who Lewis's family claimed was negligent in
his diagnosis and treatment of Lewis, Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith
searched fruitlessly for a champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense nobody's a winner or a loser here,'' he said before
dismissing the jury. ``Everybody is a loser. We've all lost Mr.
Lewis. Everybody's reputation has been attacked on both sides of
the case. I think it's a sad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Donna Harris-Lewis, Lewis's widow, abruptly
canceled plans to speak to reporters at a news conference at the
Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center at Roxbury Community
College. She issued a brief statement, saying that her husband's
reputation ``has emerged from this stronger than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   But some observers struggled to see how anyone could reach that
conclusion in a case where only the ancillary players -- two
consulting physicians cleared of wrongdoing -- walked away with a
clear-cut verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mudge can't feel good tonight, but he's got to feel better
than Donna Harris-Lewis,'' said Michael E. Mone, a Boston
plaintiff's attorney. ``This is not the worst-case scenario from a
plaintiff's point of view but, boy, it's right up there. If you're
going to try the same evidence again, who's to say another jury is
going to come out any differently?''
</P>
<P>
   That legal calculation had many courtroom observers predicting
that the case against Mudge would ultimately end in settlement, not
a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine having to try this case again?'' asked David
White-Lief, chairman of the Massachusetts Bar Association's civil
litigation section.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show that the Reggie Lewis case is just like
every other medical malpractice case in Massachusetts: tough, tough
cases to win,'' said White-Lief. ``With all the demystification of
many professions in the last 20 years, the profession of medicine
retains a lot of mystery and honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Frances H. Miller, a professor of law and public health at
Boston University said that while Harris-Lewis did not win, she
accomplished two things by putting her case before a jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to be heard on something that she thought was not
right and she got that forum,'' said Miller, referring to
allegations -- vehemently disputed by her Harris-Lewis -- that her
husband had used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``She might not be happy with what came out of it, but she got
her forum,'' Miller said. ``And she sent a deterrent signal that
was heard loud and clear in the medical profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Mudge's testimony that he had misled the public
about Lewis's condition, and his comments regarding Lewis's alleged
admission of cocaine use, Miller said, ``You play with fire when
what you say to the media is not what you fully believe, and you
play with fire when you talk about your patients after the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Harris-Lewis, who grew up in public housing in
Bridgeport, Conn., worked her way through Northeastern University
and married her college sweetheart, began the journey to Thursday's
verdict with a newspaper story, a 1995 Wall Street Journal story
suggesting that cocaine use was a factor in Lewis's death.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball star's widow said the allegations of drug use
sparked the civil suit that she hoped would redeem her late
husband's reputation as a man of easy smiles and charitable works _
a man whose body now lies in Forest Hills Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Harris-Lewis was criticized for exposing her
husband's memory to further assault even after she collected more
than $10 million in insurance money paid through policies the
Celtics had taken out on Lewis and his basketball contract.
</P>
<P>
   But Harris-Lewis steadfastly maintained that it was the search
for truth _ not money _ that propelled her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't physically bring him back, but his character is
something that never dies, and this lawsuit was my way of not only
understanding the circumstances surrounding his death, but
restoring his name and good character,'' Harris-Lewis said on the
eve of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, when it was over, Harris-Lewis, who has called her
late husband her soulmate, claimed through a terse statement that
somehow she had accomplished just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no telling how much good he could have done if he had
been treated properly and lived,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But where Harris-Lewis saw vindication, others saw a verdict as
divided as the evidence itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, as it stands right now, the only thing
that's been accomplished is the tarnishing of the memory of her
husband and the jury's verdict shows it wasn't clear cut in the
mind of those jurors _ as often in real life things are not clear
cut,'' Sherman said.

COMMENTARY: SLAVES, STAY OUT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Switzerland, Sudan, Tibet)   By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Very quietly, without a word about it on paper, the United
Nations is creating a new human rights policy for the organization
and putting it into operation one step at a time.
</P>
<P>
   If it were a document, honestly and clearly written, it would
read so:
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. will honor and from time to time try to uphold the
human rights of oppressed countries and peoples _ provided that
they have reasonable power of their own or effective help of
nations with economic and military strength. If not, the U.N. will
not be of use to victim-nations, and in some cases will increase
the power of the oppressor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past week alone, while still pondering the lessons of the
war over Kosovo, the beneficiary of all-out Western support, the
U.N. used its power against the interests of two of the most
persecuted, isolated and abandoned peoples on earth _ one Asian,
the other African.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the World Bank, a U.N. agency that distributes
low-interest loans to countries desperately in need of money for
health care, food and water supplies and other causes, approved
another loan to China, this one of $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stated purpose: to help Chinese in particularly poor districts,
and to move some of them to areas where they might live better. Of
the 58,000 who would be moved, at a cost of $40 million, all would
go from China to Tibet, the Qinhai area.
</P>
<P>
   This infuriated supporters of Tibet and set off a dispute in the
bank, headed by James D. Wolfensohn, a much-respected man in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Americans can take pride that the U.S. voted against the loan,
joined only by Germany in the 24-nation bank board. The loan is the
deliberate use of U.N. money that will speed the steady increase of
the Chinese population of Tibet since the Chinese Communist
invasion in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a judgment that the occupation is permanent, worthy
of international U.N. support. It is one more shackle to the work
of the Dalai Lama, since he fled Tibet in 1959, to keep Tibetan
nationhood and religion strong in his people's hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Tibet is claimed in its entirety by Beijing _ despite 3,500
years as a nation broken by a total of 400 years of domination by
China, Mongolia and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   No country except India, where he lives in refuge, has helped
the Dalai Lama. By world leaders, Tibet is mentioned only for brief
spurts of hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   But enough people of good heart raised so much protest about the
loan helping China occupy Tibet that the World Bank ordered an
``inquiry'' before the $40 million is actually spent. Wolfensohn
said that the project would be entirely ``transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   The delay does not satisfy Tibet's supporters, at all. But at
least the protests tell Tibetans they are not alone, not entirely.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, a U.N. human rights committee removed voice and
representation from Sudanese who have been defending themselves
against their own government. Khartoum is carrying out a civil and
religious war aimed largely at Sudanese Christians and followers of
native African religions.
</P>
<P>
   The committee refused to hear the appeal of the resistance
leader, John Garang. The offense was writing his request on his
letterhead instead of the stationery of Christian Solidarity
International, his sponsor for the meeting. Then the organization
was disaccredited.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss-based group had the status of ``nongovernmental
organization'' at the U.N. Hundreds of such help organizations,
each with a specialization in fields like medical relief, human
rights, the welfare of children and aid to refugees, have a forum
at the U.N. They are allowed to speak, but not vote, at specified
U.N. committees or the special agencies that supervise U.N. action
and spending in world health, banking, agriculture, aviation and
other major U.N. fields.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Solidarity International was impudent enough to prove
the existence of slavery in Sudan by buying 1,000 people, and of
course setting them free. By disaccrediting the organization the
``human rights'' committee established the penalty of ouster for
incurably forthright groups, and for itself the punishment of
infamy.
</P>
<P>
   If allowed to stand, the decisions on Tibet and the Sudanese
resistance will live on as a U.N. message to nations weak, isolated
and persecuted: Slaves, stay out.

<P>
   The New York Times News Service calls to your attention the
package of articles on Ernest Hemingway produced by The Kansas City
Star in connection with the 100th anniversary of his birth, July
21.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway's first writing job was as a police reporter for The
Star in 1917 and '18, and he returned to Kansas City periodically
over the years, including stays there for the births of two sons.
</P>
<P>
   During one of those visits, in 1928, he was writing the
difficult final passages of ``A Farewell to Arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the articles The Star has moved are too tightly
localized to be of use by most NYT News Service clients. But
several are of broader interest and could provide centerpieces or
sidebars in presentations that clients may be planning around the
publication in July of the last book from Hemingway's unfinished
manuscripts, ``True at First Light.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the stories in The Star's package that may be of wider
appeal. All are for use Sunday, June 27, and thereafter. (All have
moved in the ``l'' and ``e'' categories.) Questions or reruns:

was all brawn and swagger. And in one of the surest ways to extend
one's life beyond its natural boundaries he wrote it all down, and
much of what he wrote down was very good. This year marks the
centennial of Ernest Hemingway's birth, and unlike the 100th

FAA, AMERICAN AIRLINES REVIEW SAFETY PROCEDURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal aviation officials and American Airlines are closely
examining safety procedures, pilot training, and flight operations
in the wake of this month's accident at Little Rock, Ark., that
killed 11 people. That crash was the most recent in a series of
accidents and close calls involving American going back to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its investigation into the June 1 accident, the
National Transportation Safety Board will look at several past
accidents to see if there is a connection, although the board,
issued a press release saying there was no separate investigation
into the practices of the airline. The Wall Street Journal Thursday
reported that there was such an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA and American are also conducting reviews of the nation's
second largest airline, a spokesman for the airline said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   American has had a series of incidents _ one at Bradley
International Airport in Connecticut where the plane sliced through
trees on a ridgetop before landing _ and two fatal accidents: one
in December 1995 in Cali, Columbia, that killed 157 when the flight
crew put wrong information into a computer, became lost, and hit a
mountain while trying to land, and the one this month in Little
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be some similarities in the history of
accidents and incidents over the past six years and our commitment
to safety requires our vigilance in maintaining industry-leading
training and operating procedures,'' Robert W. Baker, American's
vice president for operations, said Thursday. ``For that reason, I
have ordered a thorough top-to-bottom review of our flight
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   American said it will focus on six incidents _ Hartford, Cali,
Little Rock, a 1993 accident when a DC-10 went off the runway at
Dallas-Fort Worth; a 1997 incident in Cleveland where a DC-9 was
heavily damaged when it slid off a runway during landing; and a
Feb. 9, 1998, incident at Chicago's O'Hare Airport where an
American Boeing 727 with 121 people on board landed in heavy fog
some 200 feet short of the runway, struck light poles, and skidded
some 2,000 feet before landing coming to rest in a muddy field.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a high-ranking NTSB source said the review by the
agency _ which has no power to regulate and can only recommend
changes _ may include other incidents and crashes involving
American Eagle planes, whose pilots receive the same training
program as American Airline pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not unusual when there is a series of incidents, as few
as two, involving one carrier that calls into question the actions
and thoughts of a flight crew that we will go down the road a
little ways,'' said the NTSB source. ``We will look at training, at
corporate culture. We have gone down this path before with other
airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, there were two fatal American Eagle crashes. In
October, an ATR-72 crashed in Roselawn, Ind., killing all 68 on
board. Icing and the French manufacturer's failure to disclose
information concerning icing during operation were blamed for the
crash. In December, an American Eagle plane crashed while landing
at Raleigh-Durham, N.C., killing 15.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB found the pilot failed to follow procedures for engine
failure identification and AMR Eagle training was lax. AMR is the
corporate parent of American Airlines and American Eagle. AMR stock
closed Thursday at 64, down 2 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the NTSB investigated two hard landings by American
planes in 1997 and 1998 which resulted in substantial damage to the
tails of the airplanes. One incident occrred in St. Johns, Antigua,
the other in La Paz, Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   Several aviation sources also expressed concern that relations
between American's management and the pilots union for the carrier,
Allied Pilots Association, have reached a nadir with the costly
sickout earlier this year by the pilots group, protesting two-tier
wages and that should be a part of any investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bradley incident, which occurred in November 1995, the
NTSB found that crew members failed to ask for an updated altimeter
pressure reading even though they knew that weather was changing,
which would necessitate an updated reading.
</P>
<P>
   In the DC-10 case, the pilot overruled his first officer and
decided to land in a wind-whipped rainstorm. The plane skidded off
the runway and caught fire. More than 30 passengers were injured.

ABORTION FOE SOLE DISSENTING VOTE IN SENATE JUDICIAL
RECOMMENDATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Judiciary Committee, over the objection
of an ardent abortion opponent, recommended Thursday that the full
Senate confirm Houston attorney Keith P. Ellison to be a federal
trial judge.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote within the next few weeks to
confirm Ellison, a sole practitioner, to be a judge on the U.S.
District Court for southern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H. and a GOP presidential candidate, was the
sole senator on the 18-member committee to oppose sending Ellison's
name for full Senate consideration. Smith, who opposes any judicial
nominee who indicates support for abortion rights, said he objected
to Ellison's unacceptable answer to his question of whether an
``unborn child'' is a human being.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to Smith's inquiry, Ellison wrote,
``Current law does not appear to conclude whether an unborn child
is a human being per se.'' Ellison cited the Supreme Court's 1992
decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania vs.
Casey, which reiterated the justices' landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade
ruling legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has urged the high court to overturn Roe vs. Wade,
also objected to four other judicial nominees Thursday who, like
Ellison, did not echo the senator's view that life begins at
conception. The committee, despite Smith's misgivings, also
recommended Senate confirmation of these other nominees from
Mississippi, California, South Dakota and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Following his likely confirmation, Ellison, 49, would give up a
law practice that grossed $1 million for him last year in return
for life tenure and an annual salary of $136,700. Ellison listed
his net worth at nearly $3.59 million in a financial-disclosure
statement he provided to the Senate committee in January.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison's smooth sailing in committee was in contrast to the
controversy that preceded President Clinton's nomination of the
attorney in January.
</P>
<P>
   Local Democratic members of Congress had favored state District
Judge Ruben L. Guerrero, and his and Ellison's names were sent to
the White House for presidential consideration. When Ellison
emerged as the Clinton administration's preferred candidate, local
Hispanic leaders threatened to stage a protest rally at the
president's April 1998 forum on race in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was called off after the White House agreed to
consider Houston Hispanics for high-profile federal jobs. Houston's
Democratic members of Congress then supported Ellison's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, a New Orleans native, has been practicing law in
Houston for 14 years.

DOCTORS LAUD, HMOS CRITICIZE AMA UNION VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The historic vote by the American Medical Association to form a
union for doctors as a way of fighting back against powerful
managed-care interests drew criticism Thursday from some HMO and
hospital officials, but energized an already-growing physician
labor movement across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The endorsement of a doctors' union by the AMA is an enormous
boost to the doctors' unionization movement,'' said Dr. Barry
Liebowitz, president of the National Doctors Alliance, a newly
formed 15,000-member group that just affiliated with an AFL-CIO
union, the Service Employees International Union. ``This movement
is not based on economics. This movement is based on patient care
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that the AMA finally realized that this was
a good model,'' said Sandy Shea of the House Officers' Association,
which represents interns, residents, and fellows at Boston Medical
Center, and is part of the National Doctors Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Medical Center association has a two-year-old case
pending before the National Labor Relations Board, to get formal
government acknowledgment of the right of house officers across the
country to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   But national organizations representing health plans, hospitals,
and even manufacturers Thursday objected to the AMA's vote to
create a separate labor union, saying it will threaten patient
care, lead to anti-trust violations by some physicians and drive up
health care costs as unions demand higher wages for physicians,
among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``In conjunction with proposed legislation...(the) AMA vote
could, in fact, increase health insurance premiums by up to 11
percent and add at least two million Americans to the rolls of the
uninsured,'' said Chip Kahn, president of the Health Insurance
Association of America, in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignani, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, said in an interview Thursday that one of her greatest
objections is that the AMA vote will lead to the formation of
``cartels'' on the part of the nation's 350,000 self-employed
physicians, particularly if pending legislation to give doctors
anti-trust exemptions gets passed. ``It's anti-competitive,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allowing doctors to unionize will be utterly disastrous for
our health care system because it will completely undermine efforts
to monitor quality and control costs,'' said Neil Trautwein, the
health care lobbyist for the National Association of Manufacturers,
in a statement. The Washington-based group was founded more than
100 years ago to promote a pro-growth, pro-manufacturing policy
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA vote on Wednesday came on the heels of a similar one by
the American Nurses Association, to create a separate national
labor union, United American Nurses, to strengthen existing
collective bargaining, according to an association spokeswoman. The
same pressures of managed care and hospital cutbacks were cited
during the debate over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of where they stand on the issue, nearly all involved
_ doctors, HMO administrators and hospital officials _ agree that
the AMA vote to unionize its doctors is an indication of a health
care system in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harry Greene, executive vice president of the Massachusetts
Medical Society, said, ``I think it's bringing this to a head. I
think we have to have a major dialogue about how to bring people
the care they need for the next millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17,000-member professional society last year created a
committee to study the issue of unionization, but that committee
has not yet reported back, according to Greene. With the AMA's
vote, he said he is sure the society will also tackle the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Philip Boulter, senior vice president and chief medical
officer for Tufts Health Plan, said while he does not expect to see
physician unionization sweeping across Massachusetts, he
acknowledged it is a response to cost pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managed care has been put in the unenviable position of being
in the middle,'' Boulter said. ``We are in a tough position from
that standpoint.''

HOUSE APPROVES BILL SCALING BACK POLICE POWER TO SEIZE PROPERTY 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An unusual coalition of liberals and conservatives
persuaded the House of Representatives Thursday to approve
legislation to make it much harder for federal and state law
enforcement authorities to confiscate property before they bring
criminal charges in narcotics and other cases.
</P>
<P>
   By a lopsided vote of 375-48, the House for the first time
rolled back nearly 30 years of criminal measures passed at the
height of what were then called wars on drugs and terrorism. Those
measures substantially broadened the authority of federal and state
authorities to seize houses, cars, cash, boats, planes and other
assets before obtaining criminal convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Without actually threatening a veto, the Clinton administration
opposed the legislation, saying it would make it more difficult to
combat crime. A substitute measure diluting many of the central
features of the bill and supported by the White House was defeated,
268-155. No similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate,
but supporters of the House bill said that its huge victory would
put pressure on the Senate to act.
</P>
<P>
   The measure _ which raises the legal standard for seizure,
expands possible legal defenses and provides lawyers to indigent
property-owners involved in such cases _ attracted a remarkable
coalition of lawmakers and organizations across a broad ideological
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who has spent six years trying to pass
the measure, said it ``puts civil liberties back in our judicial
system.'' He likened the current system of confiscation before
conviction to ``a throwback to the old Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   After those remarks, the other House Judiciary Committee members
who rose to endorse the measure included Rep. John Conyers,
D-Mich.; Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.; and Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   What made their alliance so incongruous was the fact that less
than a year ago, the four lawmakers had been engaged in a bitterly
emotional debate over the impeachment of President Clinton, first
in the House Judiciary Committee, and later on the floor of the
House. Hyde, the conservative chairman of the committee, and Frank,
one of its ranking liberal Democrats, are often foils in law
enforcement matters.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday they were not only unified in their support of
the measure, but also in accord in denouncing the
administration-backed weaker substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Frank called the alternative an effort ``to lower the standards
too low.''
</P>
<P>
   He was joined in denouncing both current law and the
administration's measure by Barr, another traditional political
opponent, who said that the existing law had ``become the monetary
tail wagging the law enforcement dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Balancing the important needs of law enforcement means
striking the criminal where it hurts, in the pocket book, but not
with a blunderbuss,'' said Barr.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the measure said it went too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us not turn back the clock on the war on drugs,'' said
Rep. Jim Ramstad, D-Minn., a supporter of the alternative bill that
failed.
</P>
<P>
   With a growing number of cases of innocent people seeing their
assets seized, the lawmakers adopted a bill that would require the
government to prove ``by clear and convincing evidence'' that the
property was subject to forfeiture because of illegal use.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, the burden of proof lies with the person
whose property was seized, and the government has to show only
``probable cause'' that the property is subject to forfeiture, a
fairly easy standard to satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation broadens the available defense to such seizures
and eliminates the requirement that a property-owner post a 10
percent bond to challenge a seizure. It also would require the
government to provide lawyers to property owners who could not
afford them and gives property owners more time to challenge
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal supported by the Clinton administration would have
had a far lower standard for confiscating evidence, permitting
forfeitures if a ``preponderance of the evidence'' showed they were
part of a criminal act. The Clinton proposal also would have
sharply limited the provision that gives property-owners the right
to have lawyers provided by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Existing law, which gives wide discretion to federal and state
law enforcement officials to seize property, is the product of
three measures adopted since 1970 during a period when Congress
appeared less preoccupied with civil liberties issues and more
concerned about combatting terrorism and drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, public sentiment has begun to turn about
the issue, and was reflected by the breadth of the coalition
pushing for Thursday's measure. The group included the American Bar
Association, the National Rifle Association, the American Civil
Liberties Union, Americans for Tax Reform, the American Bankers
Association, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers,
the United States Chamber of Commerce, and pilot, boating, hotel
and housing organizations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that coalition and powerful anecdotal evidence of
abusive government conduct, critics of the new legislation were
unable to counter the growing view that federal forfeiture laws
were being stretched beyond reasonable limits.
</P>
<P>
   Among the examples cited during the congressional debate
Thursday was the case of a landscaper, Willie Jones, who went to a
Nashville, Tenn., airport with $9,000 in cash to travel to Houston
to buy nursery stock. He was detained at the ticket desk after
paying for his plane ticket in cash, and he had the rest of his
cash confiscated after officers told him that anyone carrying that
much money had to be involved in drugs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill also pointed to a 1997 case involving the
seizure of $506,231 in cash from the Congress Pizzeria in Chicago.
A federal court ordered that the return of the money to the owner,
Anthony Lombardo, and reminded the U.S. attorney in Chicago that
``the government may not seize money, even half a million dollars,
based on its bare assumption that most people do not have huge sums
of money lying about, and if they do, they must be involved in
narcotics trafficking or some other sinister activity.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most compelling example of abuses of the law was
the seizure by the U.S. attorney's office in Houston of the Red
Carpet Motel last year. There were no allegations that the hotel's
owners had participated in any crimes. But prosecutors claimed the
management had failed to implement ``security measures'' dictated
by law enforcement officials, including raising room rates to make
them less affordable to criminals.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, supported by local police groups who
have reaped millions of dollars in assets from the existing scheme,
has strongly opposed the measure. The local law enforcement
organizations often prefer the federal law because under many
similar state forfeiture laws, the assets seized do not go to law
enforcement, but to other state agencies. By contrast, the federal
law allows for federal authorities to share any bounty they seize
with local law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Forfeitures have proved to be a significant source or revenue
for the federal government and for local authorities who share in
the bounty. As of the end of the last year, a total of 24,903
seized assets valued at $1 billion were on deposit _ 7,799 cash
seizures valued at $349 million, 1,181 real properties valued at
$205 million, 45 businesses valued at $49 million, and 15,878 and
other assets valued at $398 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This harvest has led critics to conclude that the administration
has opposed change largely out of financial interests, an
accusation that White House officials today denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not right,'' said Barry Toiv, a White House
spokesman. ``This bill would undermine our ability to combat drug
trafficking, alien smuggling, terrorism, consumer fraud and many
other criminal offenses.''

JULIUS TOBIAS, PAINTER AND SCULPTOR, DIES AT 83 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)   (Eds: Leger requires an accent   on the first e.)  (DW) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Julius Tobias, a Manhattan painter and sculptor who
was best known for the abstract, gallery-filling Minimalist
environments he created in the 1970s, died on June 16 at the
Veterans Administration Hospital in Manhattan. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias was born in Manhattan, dropped out of school during the
Depression and fought as a bombardier with the Air Force in Europe
in World War II. His interest in art had formed early, and he
returned to Paris on the GI bill after the war to study art with
Fernand Leger, whose politically charged humanism had a lasting
effect on his work.
</P>
<P>
   Moving back to New York, Tobias explored Abstract Expressionist
and Constructivist styles. In the 1960s he produced wall-size
all-white paintings, which evolved into cubicle-like structures,
often holding geometric sculptural forms, upright or suspended
horizontal beams and curblike bars. These forms gradually increased
in size and weight and were exhibited by themselves in the gallery.
The curblike bars grew into cast-concrete barrier walls that
prevented easy movement around the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Such work later assumed ceremonial implications, taking on the
shape of crosses and rows of church pews. In the 80s, after years
of abstraction, Tobias returned to figurative painting and a
socially conscious content. The new work was dark and
expressionistic, with repeated images of stacked bodies. It
reflected both his memories of war, with specific references to the
Holocaust, and his perception of escalating violence in the late
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In the 90s, he began a series of abstract geometric black
paintings. He showed a group of them at the Pardo Sheehan gallery
last spring, his first exhibition of paintings in Manhattan in 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias had his first New York solo show in 1959 and several at
Max Hutchinson Gallery and 55 Mercer Street in the 70s. A traveling
survey of his work was organized by the State University of New
York at Stony Brook in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   His work is in the collections of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery
in Buffalo, the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Herbert F. Johnson
Museum of Art at Cornell University in Ithaca. He received two
Guggenheim fellowships, two Pollock-Krasner awards and National
Endowment for the Arts grants.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Suzanne Tobias of Manhattan.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ A Serb professor and two Serb workers at
the University of Pristina were shot to death overnight in a
classroom building, according to the school's dean.
</P>
<P>
   Later a Serb and an Albanian were wounded in a gunbattle when a
family of Albanians returned to Pristina to find Serbs living in
their homes, NATO officials said. Relatives of both families opened
fire on each other in the city hospital, wounding a nurse and
guard, the hospital said.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents point out the growing lawlessness in Kosovo even
as NATO spreads out to try to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Looting by Albanians has broken out in the cities of Mitrovica
and Vuciturn in northern Kosovo. And two days ago, two Serbs were
shot dead by what were believed to be Albanian gunmen in Urosevac
in southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   More Serbs streamed out of Pristina Thursday, saying they are
being threatened by Albanian gunmen and expelled from their
apartments. A group of Albanian children looted a Serb newsstand
across the street from the new U.N. headquarters in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues of the slain professor and university workers said a
series of killings, kidnappings and lootings carried out against
Serbs in the last several days are part of an organized campaign by
the Kosovo Liberation Army to drive them from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just going on here. It's going on in Pec, in
Urosevac, everywhere,'' said an Serb assistant economics professor
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``NATO promised to protect
us, but it's not doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Liberation Army officials have denied involvement in the
attacks and blame them on civilians. They say teenagers or
criminals are masquerading as KLA soldiers by placing insignias on
their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Milenko Lekovic, the professor, Miodrag
Mladenovic, a guard, and Jovica Stamenkovic, a waiter in a cafe in
the building, were found in the basement, according to Milos
Simovic, the dean. The hands of each person were tied, their
colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to make all the Serbs leave,'' said Emilia, a
22-year-old student who was one of a dozen students and professors
gathered in the Serb-run department Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily armed British paratroopers who patrol the streets of
Pristina have prevented large-scale gun battles in the city. But
they have been less able to prevent lone criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Urosevac, Buda Lukic, 61, and Olga Zdravkovic, 57, said
their house had just been robbed by a group of young Albanian men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no protection,'' Ms. Lukic said. ``They said we have
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   As they spoke, their Serb neighbor drove out of his driveway in
a car packed with luggage and sped off.
</P>
<P>
   Only 20,000 of the 45,000 NATO troops to be stationed in Kosovo
are in the province and the full deployment of a 3,000-person U.N.
civilian police force is up to twelve weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   For now, several hundred military policeman stationed in Kosovo
are struggling to keep up with a crushing load of criminal cases
ranging from disputes over furniture to war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, British military police arrested a Serb civilian
suspected of taking part in the killing of nearly 50 people in the
village of Slovinje. The arrest was the first case of NATO soldiers
arresting a potential war criminal inside Kosovo.

STUDY SAYS HUMANS' INTERNAL CLOCKS SIMILAR TO ANIMALS'  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Kent., Mass., Pa.) (rk) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For over three decades, basic texts in biology and psychology
have informed their readers that humans' internal clock works
differently from other animals'.
</P>
<P>
   But a report by Harvard University researchers in Friday's issue
of the journal Science indicates that the textbooks are wrong.
Humans, it turns out, keep time the same way other animals do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of other differences between us, our clocks are
extremely similar and our timing is first rate,'' Dr. Robert Y.
Moore, chairman of the department of neurology at the University of
Pittsburgh, writes in a commentary accompanying the article.
</P>
<P>
   Like every other living creature, humans adapt their daily cycle
of sleep and wakefulness, rest and activity, to the 24-hour solar
cycle of darkness and daylight. But while many other animals, in
the absence of light and other environmental cues, maintain an
intrinsic circadian rhythm that approximates 24 hours in length and
varies little from individual to individual, previous studies
suggested that humans varied widely in their intrinsic rhythms.
Some people seemed to have a natural cycle as short as 13 hours;
others required up to 65 hours for their sleep-wake cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The average human cycle, scientists believed, was 25 hours, and
the cycle's length appeared to shorten with age, perhaps accounting
for why older people often woke up earlier and had trouble sleeping
through the night.
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, however, Dr. Charles Czeisler and his
colleagues at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston undercut past findings, demonstrating that humans' intrinsic
cycle in fact averages 24.18 hours _ about 24 hours 11 minutes _
and differs little from person to person. The length of the
circadian cycle also appears to remain unchanged with age,
Czeisler's team found.
</P>
<P>
   The results, sleep researchers say, have implications for the
understanding of basic sleep physiology, as well as for the
treatment of many sleep disorders, including problems caused by jet
lag and shift work and the sleep difficulties of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies, Czeisler said, came up with inaccurate
measurements of intrinsic circadian rhythms because researchers did
not realize that ordinary room lights and other factors, like
activity level, could have an impact on the body's clock, shifting
it earlier or later.
</P>
<P>
   Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and
his colleagues overcame these problems by turning to a methodology
pioneered six decades ago by a University of Chicago researcher,
Dr. Nathaniel Kleitman, who carried out an experiment on circadian
rhythms in Mammoth Cave in southwest Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Kleitman put his two human subjects, who lived for a month in
the cave, on a 28-hour sleep-wake schedule, their bedtime shifting
four hours later each day. He then compared fluctuations in the
subjects' core body temperatures with readings taken when the same
subjects were living in a laboratory at the university on a normal
24-hour schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In that 1938 study, Kleitman found that in the cave, one
subject's body temperature rhythm ``desynchronized,'' passing
through seven full cycles per week, even though, on the 28-hour
schedule, only six ``days'' of sleep and waking elapsed. In the
years since, however, the Kleitman study was all but forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Czeisler and his fellow researchers adopted a similar ``forced
desynchrony'' strategy for their 24 subjects (11 young men, and 13
men and women in their 60s and 70s), who lived in the laboratory
for 3 1/2 to four weeks on a 28-hour schedule, the timing of sleep,
activity, showers and meals shifting four hours later each day.
Light levels were kept low, and the laboratory staff was trained
not to give any hint of what time it was.
</P>
<P>
   Under these conditions, the subjects' internal clocks, unable to
synchronize with external cues, oscillated freely, offering the
researchers a much more accurate indicator of how long the
intrinsic cycles might be. All the subjects had cycles close to 24
hours _ the shortest was 23 hours 53 minutes, the longest 24 hours
28 minutes _ and the rhythms did not differ significantly between
younger and older subjects.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Scientists studying the brain have determined that the body's
circadian clock is situated in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN,
a tiny structure in the hypothalamus. The clock receives input from
the retina, and also from other brain structures. Through a
complicated series of molecular processes, it serves as a pacemaker
for a variety of cyclical functions, including sleep-wake cycles,
body temperature and the secretion of hormones like melatonin.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, said Dr. David Dinges, chief of the division of
sleep and chronobiology in psychiatry at the University of
Pennsylvania, is valuable in part because it advances the notion
that clock physiology is not greatly different between humans and
other animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely important observation,'' Dinges said, ``if
for no other reason than it's the final step, from a circadian
standpoint, of putting humans back in the animal kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also suggests that as in other animals, some humans
may have genetic variations that cause their intrinsic cycles to be
longer or shorter and perhaps predispose some people to sleep
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Monjan, chief of neurobiology at the National
Institute on Aging, which provided financing for the Harvard study,
said the findings had practical implications for the treatment of
sleep difficulties in the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Czeisler's paper says there's no problem with the clock _ it's
working fine,'' Monjan said. Instead, researchers must look to
other influences, like exposure to room light, or perhaps an
increased sensitivity of older people to internal alerting signals
from the body clock.
</P>
<P>
   For shift workers and transcontinental travelers, the new
findings support the use of bright light to help push sleep-wake
cycles earlier or later, depending on when the exposure occurs.
</P>
<P>
   And for the average working person, the study removes a
convenient excuse that leads to sleep deprivation: that going to
sleep later on weekends, simply because one does not feel like
getting to bed, is nothing more than a reversion to the clock's
natural rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Czeisler said, people unwittingly shift their clocks by
leaving room lights on until late at night.
</P>
<P>
   The study's findings, he said, mean ``we're not being dragged by
our physiology to go to bed later, we're dragging ourselves by our
self-selected exposure to light.''

R.G. NEUMANN,   DIPLOMAT FIRED BY HAIG FROM SAUDI POST, DIES AT 83 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Mass. , Calif. )  By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert G. Neumann, whose dismissal as the American ambassador to
Saudi Arabia in 1981 revealed fissures in President Reagan's first
foreign policy team, died of cancer in Los Angeles on June 18. He
was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann's firing by Secretary of State Alexander Haig _ and the
conflicting explanations offered at the time _ proved an early
embarrassment for the Reagan administration and revealed the
personality conflicts and discord over foreign policy that led Haig
to resign a year later.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, 1981, Haig announced that Neumann, a former
professor with long and close ties to Republican Party leaders, had
resigned ``for personal reasons,'' after just two months as
ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Because Neumann had headed Reagan's
transition team at the State Department, reporters eagerly sought
more details.
</P>
<P>
   David Gergen, the White House spokesman, said: ``I can say he
was not fired, and there have not been differences of policy.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later an anguished Gergen acknowledged that he had put
out ``misleading information'' that ``had stuck in his craw.''
Statements that Neumann had resigned because of health problems of
his wife, Marlen, were not true, Gergen said.
</P>
<P>
   Though no definitive explanation for the dismissal emerged and
though Neumann kept his silence aside from saying that he missed
his job, several likely motives were cited to account for the
dramatic firing.
</P>
<P>
   One centered on Neumann's activities as head of a lobbying
effort in Congress in support of sales to Saudi Arabia of Airborne
Warning and Control System aircraft, the Awacs. The delivery of
such planes, which would have permitted the Saudis to monitor
Israeli military flights closely, alarmed the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Neumann were quoted in news articles as saying
that he believed U.S. policies toward Israel were overly supportive
and that it was not a secret that Israel's supporters in Congress
and within the administration opposed his advocacy of the Awacs
sales and his perspective on the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible explanation for the firing was said to be
Haig's outrage at learning that Neumann had strenuously criticized
policy statements by Haig to Sen. Charles H. Percy, R-Ill., with
others present.
</P>
<P>
   A third version focused on Haig's displeasure at back channel
correspondence between Neumann and Richard Allen, Reagan's first
national security adviser, with whom Haig had many differences.
</P>
<P>
   Though Haig, a retired general, criticized and deplored the
overlapping and conflicting lines of command relating to foreign
policy in the Reagan White House, in his memoir, ``Caveat,''
(Macmillan, 1984), he did not specifically mention his firing of
Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   However, newspaper reports citing unnamed associates of Neumann
asserted that in late July of 1981, the secretary of state summoned
Neumann and severely rebuked him, even yelling at him. Neumann
reportedly apologized for his cable contacts with Allen and thought
the incident was over. A few days later, after obtaining White
House approval, Haig called him in and told him he could resign or
be fired.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the State Department, Neumann was appointed vice
chairman of the American-Saudi Business Roundtable, which is made
up of executives of corporations that do business with Saudi
Arabia, and also joined Georgetown University's Center for
Strategic and International Studies, eventually becoming vice
chairman. Before entering the foreign service he taught political
science at the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gerhard Neumann was born in Vienna and came to the United
States in the late 1930s, after studying in France, Austria and
Switzerland. In his entry in Who's Who, he referred to having been
a prisoner in camps for anti-Nazi activities and then a penniless
immigrant to America.
</P>
<P>
   He received a master's degree from Amherst in 1940, served in
the U.S. Army in Europe and received a doctorate from the
University of Minnesota in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote three books on foreign policy, one on Germany, one
comparing governments in Europe and his last work, ``Toward a More
Effective Executive-Legislative Relationship in the Conduct of
America's Foreign Policy.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sons, Ronald E., who is deputy assistant
secretary of state and a former ambassador to Algeria, and Gregory,
of Los Angeles, and five grandchildren.

ARGENTINE POLITICS-SOCCER DRUG CASE REVERSES FIELD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ The boundary between politics and
soccer can be extremely fine in Argentina, especially when it comes
to the travails of Diego Maradona, the former World Cup sensation
and on-again, off-again political ally of President Carlos Saul
Menem.
</P>
<P>
   When Maradona's manager was arrested three years ago by the
police, who said they found a vial of 500 grams of cocaine in his
luxury apartment, the political opposition and the media gleefully
linked the scandal to the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   The manager, Guillermo Coppola, was widely known to be a close
friend of Menem's personal secretary, and the president's two adult
children were often photographed partying at Coppola's nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   But the twists and turns of the case came to an astonishing
climax on Wednesday night, when a judge threw out the case against
Coppola for lack of evidence. The judge took the action a day after
a federal prosecutor called for an investigation into the federal
judge who had initiated the case, asserting that the judge had
forged documents as part of an effort to ``target Guillermo Coppola
and Diego Maradona's inner circle without any justification.''
</P>
<P>
   It should have been a resounding victory for Maradona, and
indirectly for Menem, even though some in the media and legal
sector suggested that the often politicized judicial system was
again working to protect the political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But Maradona, who admitted years ago that he was addicted to
cocaine, looked far from ebullient most of this week as he appeared
in court. Television news programs showed the former star athlete,
who has gained a lot of weight, speaking incoherently and nodding
out on his wife's shoulder while seated in the Buenos Aires
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The political shock waves of the case only grew when Maradona
testified on Wednesday that Menem had made contact with him after
his manager's arrest and ``offered me whatever I wanted, all that
he could possibly do.''
</P>
<P>
   Maradona said he responded to Menem by saying, ``Look president,
if I accept anything from you, I'll be one more corrupt guy.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed by a judge to explain what type of help Menem
offered, Maradona said the offer was vague. The president's press
office did not respond to questions about the supposed
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Maradona had long accused the Buenos Aires governor, Eduardo
Duhalde, a political foe of Menem, of being behind the arrest of
his manager although he never offered proof. This week in court he
said Duhalde, who is gradually making peace with Menem as he runs
for president, had dropped his pursuit of the case and left the
prosecuting judge in the lurch.
</P>
<P>
   Menem administration officials have studiously avoided comments
on the case, hoping to steer clear of its fallout. But few
Argentines have forgotten that when Menem was far behind in the
polls in 1995, Maradona helped save his re-election bid by
appearing in his television advertisements and beside him at his
campaign rallies.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship went into hibernation after Coppola's
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola had long been held responsible for Maradona's drug
problems even after charges that he had dealt cocaine to Maradona's
teammates in the Italian league were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's office at
the time of Coppola's arrest in 1996 took the unusual step of
announcing to local news agencies that the manager was on a DEA
list of suspected traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Coppola said the cocaine found in his
apartment had been planted. His charge has now been supported by
Raul Perotti, the federal prosecutor, who originally intended to
prosecute the case against the manager but is now turning his fire
on the federal judge who initiated the case, Hernan Bernasconi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernasconi knew that he was ordering raids on the basis of
fake accusations,'' Perotti said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bernasconi faces a probable impeachment trial in the
Argentine Senate, making him the latest in a string of judges over
the last two years who have been impeached or forced to resign
because of scandals. Bernasconi's secretary has been placed under
arrest, along with three police officers involved in the
investigation that lead to Coppola's arrest.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On paper, Richard T. Santulli seemed an unlikely candidate to
revolutionize the elite business of owning private jets. Raised in
Brooklyn, N.Y., where his family lived with one set of grandparents
and across the street from the other, he did not take his first
plane flight until his honeymoon in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 54, he travels worldwide, is worth hundreds of millions
of dollars, raises expensive thoroughbreds and talks almost daily
with Warren E. Buffett, whose company, Berkshire Hathaway, bought
his, Executive Jet, for $730 million last year. Santulli, however,
remains the chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Santulli came up with a concept for joint ownership of
private jets, thus broadening their market. Under the plan, a jet
that costs $6.7 million, for example, can be split among 16 people
for $417,500 each _ plus $4,850 a month for maintenance and $1,242
per hour flown. A number of jets are pooled to insure availability
to owners.
</P>
<P>
   At those prices, Santulli's invention still has not touched as
many lives as Henry Ford's Model T. But it has put private jets
within the reach of many more individuals and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   When Santulli, who is not a pilot, first approached makers of
private planes about his idea, many dismissed him. Now, Executive
Jet, in Woodbridge, N.J., is their biggest customer, helping to
produce record sales in an industry that has suffered violent booms
and busts.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at the Paris Air Show, he announced an order for as
many as 100 new Hawker jets from Raytheon, a deal worth $2 billion.
In the last four years, Executive Jet has ordered 587 new aircraft
worth $9.75 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that we are grateful would be an understatement,'' said
Russell W. Meyer, chairman of Cessna Aircraft, the first
manufacturer to back his concept.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Santulli had the fractional-ownership market to
himself _ and with 1,300 owners and 165 planes, he remains the
market leader. But success spawns imitators. Two manufacturers _
Bombardier of Canada and Raytheon _ have started their own
joint-ownership plans.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier, which makes Lear jets and other models, says its
program, Flexjet, offers superior service and support. It says that
Flexjet will have 90 planes by year-end and that it will eventually
overtake Executive Jet. But some analysts wonder how well any of
the players will do if the economy turns down and demand cools.
</P>
<P>
   Santulli is not worried. He sold to Berkshire Hathaway, he said,
so he could manage for the long term. ``Warren says when things go
bad, we will buy more planes,'' Santulli said.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett first learned about Executive Jet in 1995, when he
bought a quarter share in a Hawker 1000 for his family. He was so
pleased that he later did a rare testimonial advertisement. Last
year, when Goldman Sachs, which held a 20 percent stake in
Executive Jet, was pressing Santulli to take his company public, he
approached Buffett, who offered to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked him and I liked the business,'' Buffett said in a
recent interview. The two men are now planning Executive Jet's
overseas expansion. ``I talk to him more than almost anybody
else,'' Buffett said.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to Santulli's success, and one of his bonds with
Buffett, is his head for numbers. ``If you understand math, you
don't have to study it,'' Santulli said. ``All my friends would
spend hours on history and philosophy. To me, I hate to say it,
math was the easy way out.''
</P>
<P>
   After attending the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, Santulli
taught mathematics. He went to Shell Oil in 1967, helping the
company crunch numbers. Two years later, he received a call from a
Goldman executive who wanted to start a group to do computer
analysis of companies and deals. Santulli was soon heading the
firm's new quantitative analysis group and, later, a unit that used
computers to structure leases for real estate and equipment. But in
1979, on the verge of a partnership _ he decided to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you are a partner at Goldman, the money is too large for
you ever to leave,'' he explained. ``I didn't like that. I always
wanted the freedom to do what I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Santulli started his own leasing company and soon became one of
the world's biggest lessors of helicopters. In 1984, he bought
Executive Jet, a perennially unprofitable charterer of private
jets.
</P>
<P>
   He knew that owning a jet made no financial sense for most
people unless they flew at least 400 hours a year. But joint
ownership of such a high-priced toy posed problems, too, because
each co-owner wants to use the plane at his leisure.
</P>
<P>
   Using his math skills, he worked out the problem. ``I knew that
if we could come up with a way to share the cost and at the same
time guarantee service, we would hit a home run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Jet's fleet has nine types of planes, including
Cessnas, Hawkers, Gulfstreams and the new Boeing Business Jet, a
modified 737. Owners buy stakes in a specific airplane but don't
necessarily fly in it. Executive Jet promises to have whatever
model they share available on four hours' notice.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, Santulli has also applied his math skills to
breeding race horses. He estimates that his stable is now worth
about $60 million. In November, he paid $3.5 million to buy out his
partner's share of a prize mare.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Santulli married Peggy Casey, his longtime assistant
in the horse business. They now have a 5-month old daughter, Mary
Ann. He also has an adult son, Richard Jr., from his previous
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Santulli spends much of his free time figuring the odds of
breeding champion horses and valuing the thoroughbreds he sells.
``It's very mathematical, in my opinion,'' he said. ``There is a
logic to it and I like that.''

ULSTER POLICE `ORDINARY PEOPLE,' UNION CHIEF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Les Rodgers is a plumpish, pink-cheeked man who spends
his spare time tending roses and reading Tom Clancy novels. He also
is the hard-line head of a union that represents the membership of
one of the world's most reviled police forces _ the Royal Ulster
Constabulary of Northern Ireland. Catholics curse his men as
``black bastards,'' a reference to uniforms they once wore, and
``SS RUC.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks we're devils with horns,'' said Rodgers.
``What we're trying to say is that we're ordinary people _ ordinary
police officers _ upholding the law and order.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, the chairman of the Police Federation in Northern
Ireland, was in Boston, this week where he met Wednesday with
Boston Police Commissioner Paul Evans.
</P>
<P>
   With a report on the RUC's future looming, Rodgers has traveled
to the United States on a two-prong mission: To burnish his 13,000
member organization's tarnished image and to pick up some tips
about community policing, Boston style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately we've had to deal with the scourge of
terrorism,'' Rodgers said. ``We've had to live in a mode we want to
get out of. We'd like to go back to being a community police force
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Though its presence is more muted than it was before the 1996
cease-fire, the RUC still seems more like an occupying army than a
police force. Its Kevlar-clad riot police roam the streets in
armor-plated Land Rovers or hunker down in their heavily fortified
headquarters buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But the terms of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 specify that
the RUC must be reformed. Sometime in the next several months a
commission headed by Chris Patten, the former Hong Kong governor,
will issue a report specifying what changes exactly are to be made
by the RUC.
</P>
<P>
   With pressure mounting, the RUC has already announced some
internal reforms. The organization, which is 92 percent Protestant
in a region that is 40 percent Catholic, has been struggling to
recruit more Catholics. In five years, the RUC hopes to have a
70-30 Protestant-Catholic ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers said the organization now puts its members through
``community sensitivity'' training that includes visits by a
Catholic priest. A course in human rights is in the works. Rodgers
said there have even been visits from gay and lesbian community
members to teach police not to persecute homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers and the Police Federation secretary, David McClurg, said
the lessons of Boston's effort to improve relations between its
police department and minority communities had been instructive.
While both men firmly eschewed the use of hiring quotas (``It
hasn't worked here,'' Rodgers said), they talked excitedly about
implementing a program in Northern Ireland similar to the 10 Point
Coalition initiated by black ministers in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``That struck such a chord with me,'' McClurg said.
</P>
<P>
   But many in Northern Ireland wonder if the 13,000 member
organization will ever be a truly non-sectarian police force.
Skeptics point to a speech Rodgers delivered earlier this month at
the RUC's annual convention. Rodgers said he believed the
nationalist party Sein Fein was organizing an ``evil conspiracy''
against the RUC, assisted by human rights groups and academics. He
was also insistent the name of the RUC must never be changed.
``Attacks on the name, in particular, are really attacks on the
very existence of the RUC.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the RUC find such rhetoric unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very disturbing,'' said Maggie Beirne, the research and
policy officer at the Belfast-based Committee on the Administration
on Justice. ``The problem with remarks like Les Rodgers' is they
highlight that there still is a strong antipathy toward change in
the RUC.''
</P>
<P>
   And congressional staff members familiar with Rodgers' visit to
Congress earlier in the week said they were disappointed by his
uncompromising approach. ``He still seemed to be in a state of
denial about the need for serious reform,'' one senior Capitol Hill
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers vociferously rejected that assertion. ``Serious reform
means we've done something wrong,'' he said. He said many parties
in the peace process, including Sein Fein, won't be satisfied until
the RUC is disbanded completely. ``That's something I'd be
completely against,'' Rodgers said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Rodgers said he looked forward to the day when the
RUC could tear down its fortified buildings and get rid of its
guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could take a generation for things to be forgiven, though
I'd like to think it would be sooner,'' Rodgers said. ``I'm an
eternal optimist.''

 &HT;    Black veteran to be awarded Bronze Star _ 55 years late
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When a desperate call went out for black support
troops to join all-white combat units during the Battle of the
Bulge in December 1944, Marteller Pollack Jr. didn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately signed up, along with 4,500 other
African-Americans who were performing secondary roles in the
service. Pollack was one of 2,221 quickly accepted, given M-1
rifles and assigned to one of 41 white infantry units that were
being desegregated by necessity. There weren't enough white troops
to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack, now 79, will be rewarded for heroism with a Bronze
Star, one of the nation's highest awards for combat valor. The
medal _ delayed for reasons the Army can't specify _ will be
presented today in a military ceremony at Fort McPherson, complete
with an honor guard, a military band and several hundred troops
standing stiffly at attention.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack, a native Atlantan and a carpenter by trade, says he and
the other black men felt it was their ``duty as patriotic people''
to do all they could to beat back the Germans, who at the time had
overrun Allied positions in Belgium in what turned out to be the
bloodiest battle of World War II. The fact that the U.S. armed
forces were almost completely segregated, and blacks were mostly
relegated to supporting roles, didn't stand in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened the way for more colored to get in, even though I
knew it might kill me,'' Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   To volunteer, black soldiers with rank had to agree to give up
their stripes and become privates again. Pollack, already serving
behind the lines in Europe, was a private at the time, but within a
few months had risen to sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   The African-Americans were called on because they were badly
needed, says Army Lt. Col. Guy Shields at the Pentagon. As combat
support troops, they had already been through some infantry
training.
</P>
<P>
   Allied headquarters issued a statement at the time conceding
``every available weapon at our disposal must be brought to bear
upon the enemy. To this end, the commanding general is happy to
offer a limited number of colored troops who have had infantry
training the privilege of joining our veteran units at the front to
deliver the knockout blow.''
</P>
<P>
   They wound up fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with white soldiers
more than three years before President Harry S. Truman ordered the
military desegregated, Shields says.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack is one of only five of the black volunteers to be
awarded the Bronze Star _ the others got theirs last year _ but he
doesn't recall ``doing nothing special. I just fought on into
Germany and then got an honorable discharge as an infantry sergeant
and came on home.''
</P>
<P>
   Shields speculates that it might have taken this long to bestow
the Bronze Star because the Army had lost track of Pollack, or
because of a fire at an Army archives center in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these men left the service before everything they
were authorized could be given to them,'' Shields says. ``They
cared more about getting home than getting another medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Pentagon spokesman, Shari Lawrence, says delayed rewards
like Pollack's are given fairly often. Usually, old veterans, their
wives or children petition the military seeking recognition.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't happen in Pollack's case.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to Atlanta to become a carpenter again, he says
he gave his war experiences little thought. He ``just went back to
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence says it's possible his unit commander or a fellow
soldier petitioned the Pentagon on Pollack's behalf at some point,
but no one knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember it too much,'' Pollack says of the fighting.
``I do remember men falling all around me, some of my friends got
shot and got killed, but I knew it was going to happen. It had to.
And I just did what I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack adds: ``We were all supposed to be fighting for our
country. That was the job. I know a lot of us died, a lot of
colored guys. And a lot more died in there after I went through.''
</P>
<P>
   He also remembers some battle successes. ``Me and my platoon
captured a few,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel real good about it all,'' he says. ``I went because I
was an American. For the most part, there wasn't no colored in the
infantry, but I was in combat until the end of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   The military relaxed its strict segregation rules only until the
Germans were defeated in the Battle of the Bulge, Adolf Hitler's
desperate gamble to push back the Allies that almost succeeded, and
which would have certainly prolonged the war. When the war in
Europe ended, segregation became the rule again, and Pollack was
reassigned to a support unit.
</P>
<P>
   Records don't indicate how many of the black volunteers died or
were wounded in battle.
</P>
<P>
   But, says Army spokesman Shield: ``We're proud of what these
soldiers did. They made great sacrifices to do what's right, and
we're proud to give the recognition, although it's late.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack's wife, Rosa, 67, is proud, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how all this got started. One time a man came
here and talked to him, but we didn't hear any more about it,'' she
says. ``We're just shocked, and happy, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``And very proud.''

 &HT;    USS Atlanta relics to be presented in ceremony
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Relics from the last of five American warships named
after the city of Atlanta will be permanently loaned to the Atlanta
History Center in a ceremony today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great way to honor all men who served on the
Atlanta,'' says Robert Shaw, 75, of Hiawassee, who survived the
sinking of an earlier USS Atlanta by a Japanese torpedo near
Guadalcanal in November 1942. ``We hope this will make people
remember those who were not as fortunate as I was.''
</P>
<P>
   That ship, the third Atlanta, went down with 300 of its 700-man
crew on Nov. 13, 1942. ``It never seemed to get publicized much,''
Shaw says. ``I went through a lot of Novembers and nobody ever said
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The relics in today's ceremony will come from the submarine USS
Atlanta, which was decommissioned this year. Artifacts will include
the ship's silver bell, an enlisted man's bunk, a duffel bag and
the vessel's periscope.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 a.m. event at the history center is being sponsored by
the Atlanta Metropolitan Council of the Navy League of the United
States. The former commander of the submarine, Maurice Montana,
will be among the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Several other men who served on the ship that sank near
Guadalcanal are expected to be on hand, but Shaw said ``there's
only a few of us left.'' He joined the Navy shortly after Pearl
Harbor with 12 other Georgians who were guaranteed that they'd be
allowed to serve on the USS Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has no plans for a sixth ship named Atlanta. But Shaw
said, ``Those of us at Guadalcanal would like to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the relics ``are a good way to honor all the young men
who died, and I'm thrilled to death.

 &HT;    New Salinger bio: His literature, life and loves
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   J.D. Salinger's troubles apparently are not over. Yes, a
collector who bought 14 letters that Salinger wrote to teenage
admirer Joyce Maynard plans to return the correspondence to the
reclusive writer, but a new book published this week not only
delves into Salinger's private life, it gives detailed directions
to his Cornish, N.H., home.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in ``J.D. Salinger: A Biography'' (Renaissance Books,
$24.95), author Paul Alexander traces Salinger's literary career,
his success after ``Catcher in the Rye,'' and his mysterious
withdrawal from the public eye. Alexander also describes Salinger's
various romances with younger women, including the teenage Oona
O'Neill before she married Charlie Chaplin.
</P>
<P>
   As for Salinger's letters to Maynard, software entrepreneur
Peter Norton bought them for $156,500 at a Sotheby's auction
Tuesday. ``My intention is to do whatever he indicates to me he
wants done with them,'' Norton told The New York Times. ``He may
want them returned. He may want me to destroy them. He may not care
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Salinger had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Giants of the century: A collection of profiles about the most
influential people of the past 100 years could have been dull, but
Time magazine wisely decided to commission distinguished authors
and leaders to write about the heroes and icons of the 20th
century. Now Time, CBS and Simon &AMP; Schuster have announced they
will publish an illustrated book this fall. CBS anchorman Dan
Rather will write the foreword and Time's managing editor Walter
Isaacson will write the afterword.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the essays include Lee Iacocca on Henry Ford, Budd
Schulberg on Louis B. Mayer, Colin Powell on the American GI, Rita
Dove on Rosa Parks, Arthur M. Schlesinger on Franklin D. Roosevelt
and Salman Rushdie on Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 100 figures profiled in the book will be selected as
``Person of the Century'' and will be featured in the year-end
issue of Time and be the subject of a CBS News television special.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Eye-opener: Book tie-ins to movies are nothing new, but the
edition of ``Eyes Wide Shut'' by Warner Books is unique. The book,
which won't be released until nearly a month after the film opens
July 16, includes the screenplay for the much-anticipated Stanley
Kubrick film as well as a new translation of the book on which the
movie is based: Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novel, ``Dream Story.''
Meanwhile, Frederic Raphael, the screenwriter for the film, has
written ``Eyes Wide Open: A Memoir of Stanley Kubrick''
(Ballantine, $12 paperback), which arrives in stores this week. The
book is Raphael's account of his turbulent relationship with the
director while adapting Schnitzler's novel for the screen.
According to Raphael, Kubrick talked extensively about everything
from Julius Caesar to the Holocaust, and reminisced about Kirk
Douglas, Audrey Hepburn and other actors he directed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Literary deals: The adventure books continue. Scott Cookman
has signed a six-figure deal with John Wiley for ``Ice Blink: The
Mysterious Fate of Sir John Franklin's Lost Polar Expedition.''
Cookman examines the theory that the explorers died from eating
tainted canned meat. ... Knopf has paid six figures for ``The
Northern Lights'' by Lucy Jago, the story of Norwegian scientist
Kristian Birkeland, who solved the mystery of the aurora borealis.
... British journalist Howard Sounes (``Charles Bukowski: Locked in
the Arms of a Crazy Life'') has signed a six-figure deal with
Grove/Atlantic for a major biography of folk legend Bob Dylan.
Publication is scheduled in 2001, in time for the singer's 60th
birthday.

 &HT;    Reading the South: New fiction by regional authors
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 27.
 &HT;    BY Teresa K. Weaver
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This new monthly column will showcase the best of what's new in
Southern literature.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Lamb in Love'' by Carrie Brown (Algonquin, $21.95). Brown, a
professor at Sweet Briar (Va.) College who got some critical
acclaim for her first novel, ``Rose's Garden'' (1998), sets this
story in a rural English village. Vida Stephen, a 40-year-old
nanny, and Norris Lamb, a 55-year-old stamp-collecting bachelor,
are surprised by love.
</P>
<P>
   OPENING LINES: ``Here's Vida now, passing through the faint bars
of afternoon sunlight striping the lane, come to meet Manford. High
above her head, in a perfect proscenium arch, the boughs of the oak
trees rise and fall on the wind. Pairs of clouds slide by,
soundless against the blue sky. Vida's long shadow trails behind
her over the grass. To Norris Lamb, the postmaster who has hidden
himself behind a nearby horse chestnut tree, Vida's passage takes a
churchlike eternity, and his ears fill with the deafening sound of
his own racing pulse.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Courting Disaster'' by Julie Edelson (Zoland Books, $24). In
this black-comic, Southern neo-Gothic novel _ Edelson's third (``No
News Is Good,'' ``Bad Housekeeping'') _ one crazed family tries to
get through a Thanksgiving from hell. Edelson teaches English at
Wake Forest University.
</P>
<P>
   OPENING LINES: ``It was ten years ago, two weeks before
Christmas. Another dreary Christmas we'd have to spend with my
in-laws, marking time between meals, and failing them, every one of
us, in every way, at every moment. We'd motor north through the
perilous mountains, away from our own mild winter, in the gasping,
ten-year-old Dodge that couldn't die, to the very buckle of the
Rust Belt _ I mean there's a live bait vending machine on Main
Street, next to an empty shop window offering `Rat Poison' and
`Knives Sharpened' on cardboard signs, and not a man in Joe's
family has held a regular job since the glass factory folded. Last
February, one of them blew his brains out for his son to discover
when he came home from school. Waste disposal is the growth
industry. I'd already picked and lost the annual fight over
going.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Eleanor Rushing'' by Patty Friedmann (Counterpoint, $23). A
charming but delusional woman wanders through glorious, gaudy New
Orleans, where the author lives. This darkly comic novel is her
third book (``Too Smart to Be Rich,'' ``The Exact Image of
Mother'').
</P>
<P>
   OPENING LINES: ``I think it's impossible to change the world
unless you are truly evil and so mad for control you never sleep.
And it's ridiculous to try to change yourself at all. Scientists
have studied identical twins who feel pain in the gut at the same
time, as if everything were laid out from the moment they were
conceived. Sometimes I figure all you can do is watch yourself, as
if you're viewing a simple, dull film; eventually you find out what
was going to happen. Unless death catches you by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Mother of Pearl'' by Melinda Haynes (Hyperion, $23.95). Set
in Petal, Miss., in the late 1950s, this first novel revolves
around 28-year-old Even Grade, a black man who grew up an orphan,
and Valuable Korner, a 15-year-old white girl who is the daughter
of the town whore and an unknown father. Literary luminaries
including Pat Conroy, Connie May Fowler and Willie Morris use words
such as ``dazzling,'' ``wonderful'' and ``vivid'' to describe this
book. And Oprah Winfrey chose the novel as her book club selection
for July. Haynes, who grew up in Hattiesburg, Miss., lives in Grand
Bay, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   OPENING LINES: ``Even Grade walked past the spot on the bridge
where Canaan caught the bottle with his head and saw the blood mark
was still there, but just barely. The two-week bake of August sun
beginning to mask its humiliation, blending the old man's emission
to a color like that of rusted girder. On a day not spent dealing
with death, Even would have stopped one more time to wonder over
the bigger insult: that Canaan's middle-aged forehead got split by
glass and bled out, or that the bottle bearing skin and blood
soared over a rail and dropped into the water that he loved. Death
or no, Even's suspicion was the same as two weeks back: both. Both
were equally bad.''

   &QR;  ``Doors: Stories'' by William Hoffman (University of Missouri
Press, $17.95 paperback). Primarily set in Tobaccoton, a fictional
town in southern Virginia, ``Doors'' deals with cross-class
marriages and romances, adultery and its consequences. Hoffman, the
author of three previous short-story collections and 11 novels,
most recently ``Tidewater Blood,'' teaches at Hampden-Sydney
College in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   OPENING LINES: ``He was presumptuous and loose-mouthed, not that
I didn't like talking myself but believed it unseemly in a man,
especially Horace Puckett. Horace Horsecollar I called him, that
first name a mockery of the Latin poet, one of whose Sabine odes
I'd translated during my senior year at St. Elizabeth's by the Sea.
Horace Horsecollar arrived to fix my furnace. I'd been left the
house by my father, who for seventeen years and to the day he died
served as chairman of the Board of Supervisors for Howell County,
Virginia, a tobacco-growing region shaped like a teardrop dangling
above central North Carolina. You couldn't throw a stone to the
border, but you might've reached it with birdshot.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Poachers'' by Tom Franklin (William Morrow, $22). The
characters in this powerful debut collection of nine stories and a
novella _ hunters, corrupt factory workers and drunks _ all share
parasitic tendencies. Franklin, a writing teacher at the University
of South Alabama, spent his youth in Dickinson, Ala., where his
parents formed their own rural church, complete with faith
healings, book burnings and speaking in tongues. Before becoming a
writer, he worked in a sandblasting plant, at a hazardous-waste
cleanup site and in a hospital morgue.
</P>
<P>
   OPENING LINES: ``Standing on a trestle in south Alabama, I look
down into the coffee-brown water of the Blowout, a fishing hole I
loved as a boy. It's late December, cold. A stiff wind rakes the
water, swirls dead leaves and nods the tall brown cattails along
the bank. Farther back in the woods it's very still, cypress trees
and knees, thick vines, an abandoned beaver's lodge. Buzzards float
overhead, black smudges against the gray clouds. Once, on this
trestle, armed with only fishing rods, my brother Jeff and I heard
a panther scream. It's a sound I've never forgotten, like a
madwoman's shriek. After that, we brought guns when we came to
fish. But today I'm unarmed, and the only noise is the groan and
hiss of bulldozers and trucks on a new-cut logging road a
quarter-mile away.''

 &HT;    USS Atlanta relics to be presented in ceremony
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Relics from the last of five American warships named
after the city of Atlanta will be permanently loaned to the Atlanta
History Center in a ceremony today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great way to honor all men who served on the
Atlanta,'' says Robert Shaw, 75, of Hiawassee, who survived the
sinking of an earlier USS Atlanta by a Japanese torpedo near
Guadalcanal in November 1942. ``We hope this will make people
remember those who were not as fortunate as I was.''
</P>
<P>
   That ship, the third Atlanta, went down with 300 of its 700-man
crew on Nov. 13, 1942. ``It never seemed to get publicized much,''
Shaw says. ``I went through a lot of Novembers and nobody ever said
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The relics in today's ceremony will come from the submarine USS
Atlanta, which was decommissioned this year. Artifacts will include
the ship's silver bell, an enlisted man's bunk, a duffel bag and
the vessel's periscope.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 a.m. event at the history center is being sponsored by
the Atlanta Metropolitan Council of the Navy League of the United
States. The former commander of the submarine, Maurice Montana,
will be among the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Several other men who served on the ship that sank near
Guadalcanal are expected to be on hand, but Shaw said ``there's
only a few of us left.'' He joined the Navy shortly after Pearl
Harbor with 12 other Georgians who were guaranteed that they'd be
allowed to serve on the USS Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has no plans for a sixth ship named Atlanta. But Shaw
said, ``Those of us at Guadalcanal would like to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the relics ``are a good way to honor all the young men
who died, and I'm thrilled to death.

 &HT;    Penguin bio gets to heart of Mozart's gift
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 27
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something satisfying about the sorry spectacle of the
genius neglected,'' Peter Gay writes of the most revered name in
classical music, ``something romantic about the contrast between
the lonely artist and the philistine world in which he is forced to
live, and die.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a genius _ or so we imagine _ was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,
buried in a pauper's grave, unappreciated in his own time. It makes
for a real tear-jerker, and the Mozart that Peter Shaffer conceived
for stage and screen 15 years ago brought forth buckets.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth, as usual, is less romantic, and, as Gay deftly
shows, closer to the grain of ordinary life. ``Mozart'' is another
in Viking's Penguin Lives series, brief biographies of major
figures by contemporary writers, and it is by all odds a signal
achievement. Gay, whose first volume of his study ``The
Enlightenment'' won a National Book Award, might be the most
elegant stylist among contemporary academic historians. Here, as in
his previous works, he is gracefully in command of a vast sweep of
our cultural past.
</P>
<P>
   In fewer than 180 pages he introduces us to the Wunderkind who
was composing at age 5 and dead by age 35, traces Mozart's lifelong
emotional burdens to the expectations of a father who held himself
beyond arm's reach, and gives us an understanding of the time as
well as the man.
</P>
<P>
   The human being behind the genius
</P>
<P>
   The man was no more admirable than most of us. He was given to
crude, scatological humor, he was self-indulgent and unable to
support his family even though playing for royalty, and he never
overcame the infantile dependency his father helped create. He grew
musically, but not in other ways. It is doubtful he could have and
still have been Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child prodigy,'' Gay writes, ``is, by its nature, a
self-destroying artifact: what seems literally marvelous in a boy
will seem merely talented and perfectly natural in a young man. But
by 1772, at sixteen, Mozart no longer needed to display himself as
a little wizard; he had matured in the sonata and the symphony, the
first kind of music he composed, and now showed his gifts in new
domains: operas, the oratorio, and the earliest in a string of
superb piano concerts.''
</P>
<P>
   From childhood on, he lived on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe, more than 60 years after seeing Mozart as a child
performer in Frankfurt, recalled ``the little man in his coiffure
and sword.'' Yet the age of rapt attention, as Gay writes, had not
yet dawned for classical musicians, even Mozart: ``There is a
much-reproduced painting of 1766 by Michel Barthelmy Ollivier which
shows the 10-year-old Mozart bravely at the keyboard while a
select, elegantly garbed assembly help themselves at a lavish
buffet table.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at a tender age Mozart knew he was a commodity. Leopold
Mozart had made it clear, happily raking in what the son's
performances brought in the cultural capitals of Europe. From
Salzburg to Munich to Paris to Prague to London, some combination
of the Mozarts traveled, much like the family of a modern teenage
tennis pro. ``Even though he was with his parents and sister and
the subject of flattering attentions,'' Gay tells us, ``he seems to
have felt unanchored and needy.''
</P>
<P>
   Plumbing psychological depths
</P>
<P>
   Gay is not only a historian but a psychoanalyst, wearing a
second hat that does not always fit writers or scholars well. In
his most recent books he has not hesitated to poke around in the
dark attic of a subject's mind, but he is restrained and even
common-sensical in suggesting how one particular child prodigy
became Mozart. His understanding of the period and his intuitive
grasp of his subject's inner life allow him to portray a man whose
genius was more than a gift of Providence. In particular, he sees
in the relationship between Leopold Mozart and his son an age-old
story: the father who can never be fully pleased, and the son who
cannot do enough to win the approval of the central figure in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must,'' Gay writes, ``have taken offense at his father's
scattershot and undeserved recriminations, swallowed the replies
they deserved, and then, as people with a strong conscience will,
turned his anger against himself.'' It is not a prescription for a
long life, and Mozart's ended as he was in the midst of composing
his Requiem. The tug of irony should be resisted. It was just
another piece written to order, Gay argues, and not a summation of
his lifework. He needed money. And the cause of death was certainly
not poison, as legend has had it, but probably rheumatic fever.
</P>
<P>
   As Gay writes, ``There was less pathos in his end, sad as it
was, than many have liked to think.'' But if the truth lacks the
romance of the legend, there is the consolation of knowing it has
taken 200 years to realize the full measure of Mozart's greatness.
Some, but not many, knew it in his own time. Goethe ranked him with
Shakespeare and Raphael, a judgment that would have struck many as
rash but seems obvious today. In the ups and downs of reputation,
Gay writes, the place our own time has assigned Mozart ``remains
one of the achievements of which the dismal 20th century can
rightfully boast.'' There is Mozart, and then there is everyone
else.

SELF-PROMOTION, MADE EASIER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Calif.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Some years ago, I left the corporate world to start my own
public relations firm. Most of my work involves writing and media
relations. I love what I do, but since my divorce two years ago,
I've had trouble making ends meet. My clients seem happy, but I
obviously need to do a better job of attracting new business. Any
advice?
</P>
<P>
   A. You have been using all kinds of public relations skills to
promote your clients' message. Now it's time to put that knowledge
to work for yourself. Break out that Rolodex and start dialing for
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Your first target should be all those clients who are already
familiar _ and satisfied _ with your work. ``The idea isn't to
immediately start networking broadly, but to become more focused on
existing clients,'' said John Chuang, chief executive of Aquent, a
Boston-based networking and placement firm for independent
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cross-sell,'' Chuang advised. ``If you're doing work for a big
company, find out if another division could use your services.''
</P>
<P>
   William Shear, president of Guerrilla Marketing International, a
consulting and training firm in Mill Valley, Calif., agrees that
talking to existing clients is also the best way to start expanding
your network. ``Use them as a base, Shear said. ``Get testimonials
from them and send those out to people you want to become clients.
Get clients to call the people they know and recommend you.''
</P>
<P>
   If you aren't comfortable asking others to call for you, ask for
their suggestions on potential clients, get clearance to use their
names and work the phones yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Current clients, of course, shouldn't be your only sources,
Chuang said. Check in with everyone you know _ friends, past
clients, former colleagues from your corporate days.
</P>
<P>
   And be persistent. The biggest obstacle for most people trying
to succeed as independent contractors is not that they lack talent,
he added, but that they are not dogged enough in their
self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people become discouraged if they don't see an
immediate payoff from networking. ``They keep changing tactics,
because they think what they're doing is not working,'' Shear said.
Prepare yourself for a certain amount of rejection and just keep
going, he added.
</P>
<P>
   You also should recognize that marketing your business is just
as important as your basic work _ and perhaps more difficult.
``Starting out, you may need to spend half your time on this,''
Shear said.
</P>
<P>
   Because financial security is an immediate concern, you might
tap your network for part-time opportunities with a company. You
could accept a slightly lower hourly rate for a guaranteed, steady
amount of work.
</P>
<P>
   Companies, of course, like assigning part-time work,
particularly if they don't have to provide employee benefits, Shear
said. But such an arrangement has an advantage for you, too: It can
provide you with a financial cushion while still giving you freedom
to build your outside client base. &QL;

HOUSE VOTES TO PROHIBIT FLAG DESECRATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted overwhelmingly Thursday to amend
the Constitution to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the measure said it would cover burning, but there
seemed to be some disagreement over what other assaults on the
nation's symbol of freedom would also be banned.
</P>
<P>
   The argument over whether the symbol or the freedom it
represents is more important was at the heart of a two-day debate
that began Wednesday and ended with a vote of 305-124. That was
more than enough to garner the two-thirds support required to pass
a measure aimed at amending the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the amendment, including Rep. Kevin Brady, R-The
Woodlands, suggested that the flag ought to be treated more like a
government institution, noting for example that while it may be
acceptable to criticize city council actions, it's against the law
to vandalize city hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly protect the right of every American to criticize
the government, but not to desecrate the American flag. Too many
lives have been lost defending it,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   But another Texan, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Surfside, said that lives
were lost defending the ideals of freedom and democracy envisioned
by the Constitution, not the Red, White and Blue itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I served our country to protect our freedom and our
Constitution. ... To change it because some misfits burn flags, is
a dangerous step,'' said Paul, who suggested that flag burning
ought to be protected like free speech or expression under the
First Amendment ``just like most of our rights.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul was one of only five Texans _ and the only Republican
member of the 30-member House delegation _ to vote against the
amendment. He was joined by Democrats Lloyd Doggett of Austin,
Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, Eddie Bernice Johnson of Dallas and
Charles Gonzalez of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
END OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The vote marked the third time the House has approved
legislation calling for a flag protection amendment to be added to
the Constitution, which also would require a two-thirds vote of the
Senate and then ratification by three-fourths of the states.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved a similar amendment in 1995, but it fell
three votes short of passage in the Senate. The House also easily
passed it in 1997, but it was never taken up by the Senate that
year because there was no chance of approval.
</P>
<P>
   This year, House supporters are hopeful the outcome in the
Senate will be favorable. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., has said he hopes to have a vote on it this summer. But
the measure still appears at least two votes short of the 67 needed
in the Senate to send it on to the states for ratification, and
some Senate aides say it might not be brought up at all.
</P>
<P>
   In his argument on behalf of the amendment, Rep. Duke
Cunningham, R-Calif., noted that legislatures in 49 states _ with
the exception of Vermont _ have already passed resolutions backing
it. Cunningham, the chief sponsor of the amendment, said his
purpose was not to limit free speech, but to ban the physical
desecration of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   He said an amendment would help restore the 48 state laws
protecting the flag that were struck down by Supreme Court rulings
in 1989 and 1990. The court said flag burning was labeled a form of
free speech and expression protected under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Although attempts to prohibit flag burning by amending the
Constitution have been primarily a Republican-driven effort, it has
cut across party lines, with some Democrats joining the move and
some Republicans deserting it.
</P>
<P>
   Even opponents say they understand the frustrations expressed by
supporters. Still, they argue that the freedoms represented by the
flag are far more important than the symbol itself. They also argue
that the number of flag desecration incidents are greatly
exaggerated and not significant enough to warrant a change in the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the threat?'' Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., asked
supporters of the amendment during the House debate. ``The real
threat to our society is not the occasional burning of the flag,
but the permanent banning of the burners. Even a despicable,
low-life malcontent has a right to disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed by the House would, if accepted by the Senate
and ratified by the states, call for the addition of a 17-word
amendment to the Constitution, which has been altered 27 times
since it was ratified in 1788.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would read, ``The Congress shall have power to
prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Most lawmakers believe that the amendment would have no impact
at all on free-speech rights. Basic rights would still be
protected, said Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, in offering his support
for the measure. But he added that a protection amendment would at
least ``put burning or desecrating the flag ... on the same level''
as ``yelling fire in a crowded theater,'' for which people can be
arrested and prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's too much to ask ... for protecting the
flag,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents fear that one step toward making an exception for flag
burning could spawn a movement to criminalize other forms of speech
or expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we open the doors to criminalizing constitutionally
protected expression related to the flag,'' said Rep. John Conyers,
D-Mich., ``I am afraid that there will be further efforts to limit
and censor speech or conduct that we do not like.''

UNDER THE FOOD SCARES, A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mad cow disease. Dioxin contamination. Now, a scare over
Coca-Cola. Shoppers in Europe might be forgiven for hesitating
before even setting foot in a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies a serious problem for food manufacturers and
retailers alike.
</P>
<P>
   Each new food scare causes immediate dislocations, of course, as
grocers empty shelves, consumers hunt for alternatives and
producers eat the losses and scramble to salvage their reputations.
</P>
<P>
   But underlying the headlines are more fundamental concerns: why
food scares seem to be happening more often, what the cumulative
impact will be on consumers and the food industry, and, not least,
whether consumers are justified in their growing suspicions about
the safety of their food.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Goldberg, the Moffett Professor of Agriculture and Business
at the Harvard Business School and head of the agribusiness program
there, surveyed the causes and implications last week. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is it about food scares that causes so much anxiety in
people so readily? And why do there seem to be so many lately? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You basically have people changing the kinds of foods they
want and not believing in the authorities who are supposed to
protect them. It's a terrible combination.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe in particular, the credibility is very low. In the
United Kingdom, the handling of mad cow disease destroyed the
credibility of the government, the scientists and, to some extent,
even the news media. It was downplayed, and they really believed
that you couldn't have such a disease transmitted from animals to
humans.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the FDA and the EPA and the USDA have done
a better job, but even so, there are other factors that have caused
these problems. We want more fresh prepared foods. We prefer
unpasteurized fruit juices. So certain kinds of problems didn't
exist before because of the various controls on processes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do the reactions to food scares in Europe seem so much
more dramatic? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The reason is twofold. First, many of these countries are
reluctant to admit they have a problem, for political reasons. With
mad cow disease, the European Union knew about it, and almost went
out of its way to hide the information, so there wouldn't be a
scare.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the immediate reaction of other nations, when they
find out about it, is that the problem must be worse than they say.
</P>
<P>
   And in the case of genetically modified foods, especially,
Europe seems to be much more sensitive. It goes back to World War
II and genetic experimentation by the Nazis. The word ``genetic''
is almost a red flag.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing is that, in Europe, they cannot get people to
comply. In the middle of mad cow disease, there were people
grinding up dead animals and putting that back into the food
system. Even when they have good rules and regulations, they can't
get people to comply. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there any hope that the recent wave of scares in Europe
will lead to greater compliance? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It is changing. The problem is so bad that is has to change.
And they have got a whole new generation of men and women who are
just fed up with the politics of the past and the mistakes of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   I just came back from an agribusiness conference in Italy. And
do you know what the theme was? Trust. We had business leaders and
the heads of consumer organizations, and in every case they were
reaching out to each other. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. And they were sincere? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Absolutely. I would say they were extremely sincere. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. On the technology side, are there advances coming that might
cut down on the frequency of food scares in the future, or help
keep them from getting out of hand? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Traceability is becoming much more important in our food
system. In the not too distant future, we are going to be able to
bar-code every product, from a grain of cereal to a loaf of bread.
These huge multinational corporations that have huge plants
throughout the world have to lead the way.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there are firms that basically have developed ways to test
and protect the authenticity of products that are being sold. Just
as you have knock-offs of designer jeans and luggage, you have
knock-offs of food. So people are constantly testing to reassure
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And as consolidation grows in the food system, it will become
safer, because the unethical parts of the system will try to cut
corners, but they will find themselves left out of the system.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The heated accusations of monopoly, the lively
e-mail flavored with capitalist aggression and the spirited
testimony alleging and denying misconduct came to a close Thursday
as the last witness stepped off the stand in the Microsoft
antitrust trial, eight months after proceedings began.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft trial is by no means over, but it sharply shifts
gears as the daily theater in the courtroom gives way to a more
sober weighing of facts and law. ``Now the showmanship ends and the
legal maneuvering really begins,'' observed Andrew Gavil, a
professor at the Howard University law school.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the points in the daily courtroom drama went to the
Justice Department and the 19 states suing Microsoft Corp. Led by
trial lawyer David Boies, the government team caught Microsoft's
witnesses off guard again and again, presenting them with
embarrassing e-mails or previous statements that appeared to
undermine their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Even William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, found it
impressive, if not convincing. Since the start of the trial, Neukom
notes that he has fielded expressions of concern that things are
going badly for the company from many of his colleagues, even his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has put on a great performance,'' he said,
``but it does not add up to a solid antitrust case. It's all fluff
legally.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, counters that the evidence and
testimony presented in court has been occasionally entertaining but
consistently incriminating. It adds up to a detailed and convincing
portrait, Klein said, of ``Microsoft's ability and willingness to
do whatever is necessary in using its market power to protect its
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal reckoning that matters, however, will be made by Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will rule in this trial without a
jury. Both Microsoft and the government will make further written
and oral arguments over the summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson must then comb through the mountains of evidence to try
to answer one essential question: What are the appropriate legal
restraints on the behavior of a powerful company in a dynamic
high-technology industry?
</P>
<P>
   The issue extends well beyond the Microsoft case, and the stakes
are high. The ruling could set ground rules for competition in the
modern economy, affecting companies and consumers alike for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The legal guideposts to help Jackson reach his decision,
antitrust experts say, are not clear-cut. The major antitrust
rulings over the last two decades are few, and they mostly involve
mundane businesses including ski resorts in Colorado, a rural Ohio
newspaper, a bowling alley in New Jersey and an egg processor in
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the plaintiffs brought a very traditional
antitrust suit. The government says Microsoft repeatedly and
illegally used its market power to thwart new competition
represented by the rise of the Internet, especially software for
browsing the World Wide Web. With exclusionary contracts and
threats, Microsoft, according to the government, used its market
power to defend its monopoly product _ the Windows operating
system, the software that serves as the central nervous system of
90 percent of the personal computers sold today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is mainly an old-fashioned contract case,'' said Herbert
Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school and
leading antitrust scholar, who is advising the government. ``There
is nothing novel about the practices. The one thing that is novel
is that the case is in the software industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the industry context is a crucial consideration. The
software business is regarded as the forerunner of what has been
called ``the new economy'' _ a fast-moving, fluid environment in
which market leadership can be fleeting, but technology can also
hasten the concentration of market power and the creation of
monopolies. In short, new-economy theories can cut both ways in
antitrust cases. There has been plenty of talk of ``network
effects'' and ``winner-take-all markets'' from both sides in the
Microsoft trial.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Microsoft case focuses on a fast-moving,
technically complex industry complicates the legal judgment the
court must make. ``It makes the toughest issues that courts have to
deal with in antitrust cases _ determining market power, evaluating
the significance of conduct and designing remedies _ far more
difficult,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George
Washington University law school.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many antitrust experts who have followed the trial expect
that Jackson will side with the government on some of its many
charges against Microsoft. They base that view partly on a reading
of Jackson's behavior _openly questioning the testimony of some
Microsoft witnesses, and showing impatience with Microsoft's
lawyers _ and partly on a reading of the law, that some Microsoft
contracts with online services and personal computer manufacturers
did inhibit competition from software rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is by no means conceding defeat in Jackson's federal
district court. But Neukom suggests that its legal strategy is to
prevail on appeal. ``The thing to remember is that we're engaged in
a legal decathlon, and we're still at an early stage,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the two sides reach a settlement, Jackson's ruling,
expected by the end of the year, will certainly be reviewed by a
federal appeals court and possibly by the Supreme Court as well. If
it goes to the Supreme Court, the Microsoft case may well not be
finally determined until 2002, legal experts say.

 WASHINGTON: experts say. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A crucial decision by Jackson a month before the trial began
last October determined what the courtroom proceedings became: a
sweeping portrayal of Microsoft by the government as a bullying
monopolist, supported by a parade of industry witnesses making a
litany of allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The government's original complaint, filed in May 1998, charged
that Microsoft was ``engaged in a series of anticompetitive
activities.'' But it focused largely on the company's tactics in
the browser market against Netscape Communications Corp., and
specifically on Microsoft's decision to fold its browser into its
industry-standard Windows operating system. Microsoft, the
government contended, had illegally tied a second product to its
monopoly product in a predatory effort to stifle competition and
reduce consumer choice.
</P>
<P>
   But a month later, the government's tying theory suffered a
severe blow when a federal appeals court ruled in a related case
that Microsoft should be free to blend its browser into Windows as
long as it can make a ``plausible claim'' of business efficiency or
consumer benefit from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, the Justice Department and states continued
investigating Microsoft's dealings with other companies and came up
with new evidence involving Intel, Apple Computer and others _ all
of it, the government said, fit into Microsoft's ``pattern of
behavior'' intended to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   Over Microsoft's objections, Jackson permitted the new evidence.
Suddenly, the focus of the case widened well beyond the ``browser
wars'' to a broad, multifaceted scheme by Microsoft to protect its
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   With the retooling, the government case also acquired a broad
narrative theme that rose above the arcane details that are an
inevitable part of a high-tech antitrust trial. Whatever the legal
merits, the approach made the government's case a much more
compelling story to tell in court. So when an Intel executive
testified to a ``credible and fairly terrifying'' threat from
Microsoft, or when an America Online executive testified that it
had no choice but to adopt Microsoft's browser in return for a
coveted place on the Windows desktop, it all added detail to the
government's picture of Microsoft as an arm-twisting monopolist,
stifling competition and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The government and states believe that they have shown not only
that Microsoft crossed the legal line repeatedly, but also that its
monopoly is fairly durable, a crucial consideration for the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think that Microsoft's operating system monopoly is
going to go away in two or three years, then we shouldn't have
brought this case,'' said Klein of the Justice Department. ``But I
obviously don't believe that. What this case is about is protecting
innovation to make a dynamic industry even more dynamic and
innovative.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft agrees that innovation is the goal, but counters that
heavy-handed antitrust enforcement is the real threat. Microsoft's
legal team insists that the law is on its side in this case,
despite the evidence presented by the government. They point to a
general drift of pro-defendant rulings in antitrust cases over the
last two decades, which speak approvingly of ``fierce,
no-holds-barred competition'' and ``the great race of
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what's in the government's case doesn't sound good,
but it doesn't rise to the level of an antitrust violation,'' said
Steven Holley, a Microsoft lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, Microsoft has leaned on two key themes. The
first, in essence, is: Our actions may have hurt some rival, but
where is the harm to competition in general and to consumers? And
the second theme, linked to the first, is: This is a vibrant
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The harm, the government and states reply, is that Microsoft's
actions would be fine if it were still a scrappy entrepreneurial
upstart rather than an industry-dominating force. ``What Microsoft
did not recognize is that it had crossed the line to become a
monopolist, so its behavior had to change,'' said Thomas Miller,
the Iowa attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft disputes the monopolist label, but argues that the
rules for dominant firms are not much different. ``We should be
competing as hard as we can for the next customer because that
behavior is good for consumers,'' Neukom of Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, clarifying the rules of legal behavior for powerful
companies in the modern economy could well be the lasting legacy of
the Microsoft case. ``This case can really determine the boundaries
on the conduct of dominant firms for decades,'' observed Kovacic of
George Washington University.

LED BY BIG TRADING GAINS, MORGAN STANLEY POSTS 35% INCREASE IN
EARNINGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SHOLNN FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., demonstrating
strength in its securities trading and credit card businesses,
posted second-quarter results Thursday that beat analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported that its net income in the quarter ended
May 31 rose 35 percent, to $1.15 billion, or $1.95 a diluted share,
compared with $852 million, or $1.37 a share, in the period a year
earlier. Analysts had expected profit of $1.56 a share, according
to the First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength was across the board,'' said Michael J.
Freudenstein, a managing director of J.P. Morgan. ``In particular
what stood out was that trading revenue was significantly higher
than expected, and on the securities side we saw a marked
improvement in credit quality. It was hard to identify a weak
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenue increased 23 percent, to $5.65 billion from $4.6
billion. Morgan's return on equity, one way to judge its
profitability, rose to 31 percent in the second quarter from 25
percent a year ago. It was the company's third record quarter in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's strong results come after similar reports from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. this
week. On Wednesday, Goldman, in its first quarterly report as a
public company, reported a 30 percent increase in profit. The day
before, Lehman also reported earnings well above analysts'
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had proof this week that prognosticating even short-term
results for securities firms has become a very difficult art,''
said Samuel G. Liss, a managing director of Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Five analysts told First Call Thursday that they were raising
their 1999 earnings estimates for Morgan Stanley to an average
$6.96 a share from a previous estimate of $6.25 a share
</P>
<P>
   Despite the solid results, shares of Morgan Stanley fell
$1.9375, to $91.3125, on a day when the rest of the market was
down. Brokerage and other financial stocks have been hurt recently
because of concern over rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Robert G. Scott, the company's chief financial officer,
expressed frustration that the company's excellent results were
overshadowed by the stock's decline. ``It's a little disappointing,
frankly, to watch a stock trade down,'' he said, adding that
investors might have driven the stock up last week on expectations
of the good profit report.
</P>
<P>
   In Morgan Stanley's securities business, net income jumped 54
percent, to $829 million. Scott pointed to record growth in
investment banking and trading for big investors as well as growth
in the retail consumer business.
</P>
<P>
   Like other firms, Morgan reported big gains from trading.
Trading revenue increased by 77 percent, to $1.9 billion. The firm
also reported a 29 percent increase in commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from underwriting new stock issues and advising
companies on mergers and acquisitions gained 3 percent, to $1
billion. The dollar volume of announced mergers and acquisitions
rose to $308 billion, compared with $196 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Net income at the company's Discover card unit increased by 23
percent, to $211 million, compared with $171 million in the period
a year earlier. Scott said that gain came from the improved credit
quality of Discover card customers and credit card holders in
general. The company reported big drops in the number of card
holders who walk away from their credit card debt and those with
balances delinquent more than 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Profit in the last leg of Morgan's business, money management,
fell 23 percent, to $111 million, even though assets managed by
Morgan Stanley rose 7 percent, to $402 billion. Scott attributed
the decline to the volatility of the merchant banking business.

 &HT;    Shelves still bare as Belgian bottlers gear up
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Berrasaa Mohammed rounded the corner of the
beverage aisle at a Delhaize supermarket here Thursday, only to
again find disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, no Coke again?'' Mohammed asked no one in particular. He
discovered the bright red shelves that usually hold his favorite
soft drink nearly empty _ nearly, except for a few 2-litre bottles
of Pepsi-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   After glancing at a store management's note asking for
customers' patience while Coca-Cola prepares for its return,
Mohammed took solace in a big bottle from the brand's archrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Coke, but how long can I wait for it?'' he asked as he
tossed the Pepsi bottle into his cart with a thud and rolled on.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the Belgian government set out the path Coca-Cola
must take to return its full line of products to stores, both
Coca-Cola Co. and Coca-Cola Enterprises are desperately trying to
get ready for Mohammed's next visit to the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   CCE, which owns the bottling plant in Antwerp that was the
target of a health safety investigation, said Thursday it had
planned to resume production at either Antwerp or its other plant
at Ghent before the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But it still will be two weeks or more before production returns
to full form, said Coca-Cola Co. spokesman Randal Donaldson.
Coca-Cola Co. provides CCE and other bottlers with the concentrate
used to produce Coke brands.
</P>
<P>
   Before CCE can get into full swing with production, it must
first complete the grim task of destroying cases upon cases of its
beverages as a safety precaution demanded by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the challenge has been that the employees have to
destroy the product before they can get to producing new product,''
Donaldson said. ``It will be next week before we can get any
product out of one of the plants.''
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian government lifted restrictions on the sale of Coke
products Wednesday, a move followed quickly by Luxembourg and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring France lifted its restrictions Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be safe to say that we're up and running in Europe,''
Donaldson said. Coca-Cola has offered refunds to Belgians made ill
by its products and intends to pay the medical expenses of those
who became sick after drinking its products.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester also offered to buy everyone in the country of 10
million a Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a prominent toxicologist went on Belgian television
to say he accepted Coke's explanation for the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Nemery de Bellevaux, professor in toxicology at Leuven
University, told VTM television that the illnesses were probably
psychosomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying they weren't ill,'' Nemery de Bellevaux said.
``They were ill; that was obvious. But they were not poisoned.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientist said Belgians were ripe for such a response
because of recent food scares, particularly the fresh one over the
discovery of cancer-causing dioxin in animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have the feeling that our food is poisoned, and so it
was, partly, with the dioxin case,'' Nemery de Bellevaux said.

 &HT;    Recall to cost CCE about $60 million
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Enterprises estimates the massive recall of
its products because of the European health scare will cost $60
million.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest soft drink bottler also said there will be a
``negative impact on sales, cash operating profit and earnings per
share in the second quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company said the extent of the lost sales and
profits ``is difficult to determine until the company can assess
the effect of product reintroduction campaigns in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Marc Cohen of Goldman Sachs estimated Thursday that
the company's cash operating profit will be cut by $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very significant hit for the quarter,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Cohen reduced his second-quarter earnings estimate
to 21 cents a share, from 27 cents. That does not include the
nonrecurring $60 million charge for the recall, which would reduce
earnings per share by another 8 cents, CCE said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was more pessimistic than some other analysts. A First
Call survey of analysts Thursday came up with a consensus of 23
cents a share for the quarter. That was down from 28 cents before
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it may recoup some of the $60 million cost of
the recall through insurance. About 14 million cases were affected
by the recall, which amounts to less than 1 percent of CCE's annual
volume.
</P>
<P>
   Two CCE plants, one in Antwerp, Belgium, and the other in
Dunkirk, France, were blamed for causing illnesses in nearly 250
people who drank the bottler's beverages.
</P>
<P>
   To try to win back consumers, both CCE and Coca-Cola Co. will
share in the costs of an increased marketing and advertising
campaign that will extend into the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies hope that consumers regain confidence in a
relatively short time, so that the problem does not carry over into
next year's financial results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that we can minimize the short-term impact on
sales, and we are confident that this situation will not materially
affect financial results in the year 2000 and beyond,'' Henry
Schimberg, CCE's president and chief executive officer, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wilkins, an analyst for Deutsche Bank, generally agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the consumer reacceptance of Coke will occur in a
relatively short period of time,'' Wilkins said. ``For the most
part, I think people are rational.''
</P>
<P>
   For fiscal 1999, Cohen predicts CCE will earn 23 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The First Call consensus is now 25 cents, down from 30 cents
before the incident. Last year, the company earned 28 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the seasonal nature of its business, CCE generally
makes money in the second and third quarters and loses money in the
first and fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Cohen reduced by a penny a share his second-quarter
estimate for Coca-Cola earnings because of the crisis. He now
expects the company to make 40 cents a share, instead of 41 cents.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, CCE fell 68 3/4 cents Thursday to close at
$31.68 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Coca-Cola Co., which owns 40 percent of CCE, rose 87
1/2 cents to close at $62.62 1/2.

RAFTER DEFEATS DOUBLES PARTNER BJORKMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ They've seen more of each other in the last two days
than some celebrity couples do in the course of an entire marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But such is the ambivalent nature of tennis unions that they
were partners one afternoon, adversaries the next _ which, come to
think of it, does describe some celebrity marriages. At any rate,
Patrick Rafter proved the better half Thursday as he barely beat
darkness and his doubles accomplice of 24 hours earlier, Jonas
Bjorkman, 6-2, 7-6, 6-7, 6-2. It was a 2-hour 57-minute endurance
test that concluded the Wimbledon festivities on a day when a
record 40,312 zealots stampeded through the All England Club gates.
</P>
<P>
   This duel in the gloaming on Court 1 came in the wake of a
2-hour 40-minute exercise in cooperation Wednesday when Rafter and
Bjorkman, the third-seeded doubles duo here, won a five-set
first-round struggle against Brent Haygarth and Marius Barnard. And
they'll be reunited Friday for another go at doubles, unless
they're sick of one another by then.
</P>
<P>
   Small chance of that, since both understand the dictates of
their profession, though facing one's regular ally is hardly a
match made in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's going to happen when you go into a
tournament,'' said Bjorkman, ``so you just go out and let the best
man win, and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   This time that was Rafter, though that hasn't always been the
case. The two-time defending US Open champion and No. 2 singles
seed at Wimbledon evened his career record against Bjorkman at 4-4.
But his old buddy, with whom he won this year's Australian Open
doubles crown, still gave him fits. After a first-set breeze,
Rafter was forced to a second-set tiebreaker, which he captured
handily, 7-3. He wasn't as fortunate in the third set, when
Bjorkman survived match point at 5-6, then prolonged the ordeal
with a 9-7 tiebreaker decision.
</P>
<P>
   By then, both the combatants and the conditions were entering
the twilight zone, and Rafter petitioned umpire Kim Craven to
suspend the match. Craven informed him that tournament referee Alan
Mills wanted the proceedings to continue _ to the roaring crowd's
delight and Rafter's displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Alan Mills isn't playing, so how's he going to judge
that?' '' recalled Rafter. ``I don't see much point in playing
four, five more games and walking off.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter was able to take care of business before sundown, but
neither man was in much shape to walk off. In the final set, both
soaked their towels and chewed ravenously on bananas during
changeovers, and Bjorkman, laying flat out at courtside, required
treatment for a pulled leg muscle he believes was a souvenir from a
slippery surface Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorkman vows that it won't force his withdrawal from doubles,
but Rafter will understand if it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the attitude for doubles that if we're not ready to
play or it's going to interfere with our singles, then we'll give
it a miss,'' he said. ``We've always had that arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why their union can withstand the occasional
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, notorious Court 2 _ which didn't earn its
nickname, ``The Graveyard of Champions,'' because of its curative
powers _ claimed another notable victim, No. 7 women's seed Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, who bowed to Lisa Raymond, 7-6, 6-1. The former
French and US Open winner joined a notable memorial list that
includes Ilie Nastase, John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Arthur Ashe,
Boris Becker, Pat Cash, and Andre Agassi _ all winners of major
tournaments who were interred in the emerald tomb across from
Centre Court.
</P>
<P>
   Even one who avoided regicide, 1996 Wimbledon king Richard
Krajicek, is duly daunted by the court's reputation and his
experiences on it. After easily handling Todd Woodbridge, 7-5, 6-4,
6-4, in the day's first match on Court 2, the No. 5 seed said, ``I
don't have my best memories on 2. I have lost to (Arnaud) Boetsch
one year. I've lost in the first round one year to (Darren) Cahill.
And the year I won, I played my toughest match, my worst match _
however you want to say it _ against Brett Steven. So somehow maybe
it does play with your mind a little bit, especially in the
beginning. When you come out there, you almost want to ask the
referee to measure from the baseline to the back fence, it's so
small.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Agassi found Court 1 more comfortable as he dominated
Guillermo Canas, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. The No. 4 seed, still cresting from
his surprise French Open win that made him the fifth man ever to
capture the career Grand Slam, now has another quest: becoming the
first since Bjorn Borg (1978-80) to hold the French and Wimbledon
titles in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Ivanisevic would be happy with one major title, especially
after three runner-up finishes here, including last year. The No.
10 seed stayed in the hunt, but with some difficulty, shaking off
Sandon Stolle, 7-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Defending women's champion Jana Novotna, seeded fifth and
virtually unnoticed amid the furor over top seed Martina Hingis's
first-round ouster and No. 2 Steffi Graf's second-round scare,
quietly removed a difficult obstacle from her path. With a 6-3, 6-1
decision, she got even with Sylvia Plischke, who had beaten her at
the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis slayer Jelena Dokic _ the qualifier who is so new to
these surroundings that she still isn't sure whether the cream goes
on the strawberries or the strawberries go in the cream _ had a
considerably tougher time against a considerably lesser opponent.
Unseeded Katarina Studenikova pushed her to the limit, 6-0, 4-6,
8-6, as Dokic rallied from a 4-2 deficit in the deciding game.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't play as well as Martina did,'' said Dokic, ``and
Martina forced me to play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Studenikova merely forced her to escape.

 &HT;    Recall to cost CCE about $60 million

   But company officials acknowledged that their work has only
begun to restore their brand's good name in Western Europe after a
health scare erupted two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   French food safety officials determined there was no evidence
that Coca-Cola's beverages were contaminated at a factory in the
northern city of Dunkirk. The decision in France came a day after
officials in neighboring Belgium completely lifted a ban there.
</P>
<P>
   The Dunkirk plant, which employs 240 and produced 1.5 million
cans last year, could resume production as soon as today.
</P>
<P>
   Some supermarkets in Paris were restocking their shelves with
cans of Coca-Cola just hours after the morning announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The top executive at Coca-Cola Enterprises, which owns the plant
in Dunkirk, said the French decision should remove any doubts about
the quality of Coca-Cola beverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any allegation or insinuation that beverages produced at the
Dunkirk plant are unsafe is factually, medically and scientifically
unfounded,'' Henry Schimberg, president and chief executive officer
of CCE, said in a statement after the lifting of the French ban.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola and CCE are left to counter lingering, unanswered
questions over why nearly 250 people became ill after drinking the
companies' brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we don't know what caused those
illnesses,'' said Stephane Muracciole, a representative of France's
consumer affairs ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola had maintained that the problems in France were caused
by a foul odor that came from the bottom of cans transported in
treated wooden pallets.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, CCE executives said an internal
investigation determined that 800 out of 150,000 wooden pallets
used to transport beverages were contaminated with the chemical
phenol, which is used as a disinfectant.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical, which ``polluted the bottom of the cans,'' created
a foul smell that caused consumers in France and Belgium to feel
ill, said Dominique Reiniche, president of Coca-Cola Enterprises
France.
</P>
<P>
   Reiniche said the problem resulted from a ``malfunction in the
distribution chain'' that has been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   She said the company ``profoundly regretted'' the distress and
inconvenience caused by the bad odors.
</P>
<P>
   But in the public mind, uncertainty is likely to persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been holding on to this one to get a refund,'' said Jean
Luc Gassean, a Paris hotel clerk, producing a can from his lunch
sack. He said it had been there since the government banned sales
on June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think it is safe to drink it?'' he asked a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola executives recognize they must rebuild public
confidence after the biggest product recall in the company's
113-year history.
</P>
<P>
   With the reappearance of Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light (the
European version of Diet Coke), Sprite and Fanta on store shelves,
the company will launch a massive advertising and promotional blitz
beginning this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be the familiar theme ``Always Coca-Cola,'' but only in
French: ``Toujours Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's Web site for French consumers and print ads in
newspapers this week have declared that the quality of its brands
is ``beyond reproach.'' A toll-free number also has been set up to
invite consumers to call with questions or complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The first reports of illnesses emerged in Belgium two weeks ago,
and the crisis quickly spread to other European countries,
including France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. These are all
countries served by CCE.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lifting of the sales ban, a separate judicial
inquiry into the health scare is ongoing. A French prosecutor
opened the case Monday after traces of rat poison were discovered
on the outside of one can.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Muguet, the state prosecutor in Dunkirk, said his probe
would proceed in an effort to determine the cause of the illnesses.
He told reporters Thursday that his investigation is not meant to
suggest wrongdoing by Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not accusing them of misleading anyone or of hiding
anything,'' Muguet said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, by the evening Thursday, an anchorman on French
television TF2 was declaring, ``The crisis for Coke is ended in
France.''
</P>
<P>
   France trails most other Western European countries in its
per-capita consumption of Coca-Cola products.
</P>
<P>
   But for those with a taste for Coca-Cola, they never really had
to do without. Fountain sales were never interrupted. Neither were
sales of Coca-Cola soft drinks in bottles.

CHINA TO GET WORLD BANK LOAN DESPITE U.S. OBJECTIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)   By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The World Bank overruled the United States Thursday
and approved a $160 million antipoverty loan for China. It agreed,
however, to delay financing for the resettlement of 58,000 farmers
in a traditionally ethnic Tibetan area until an independent review
board determines whether the program meets the bank's environmental
and resettlement standards.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to postpone payment for that portion of the loan
was in part a last-minute effort by the president of the World
Bank, James Wolfensohn, to keep the United States from opposing the
loan.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call Wednesday evening, however, Wolfensohn
apparently failed to convince the Treasury Secretary-designate,
Lawrence Summers, that American objections to the resettlement
program had been fully addressed. The United States, in an unusual
breach between the Bank and its largest shareholder, still voted
against the project, as did Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has such a small World Bank program, especially one aimed
at helping some of the world's poorest farmers, attracted such
controversy. In this case, the plan to move farmers who earn
roughly $40 a year to more fertile land ran afoul of objections
from pro-Tibetan groups, whose cause _ autonomy or independence for
Tibet _ has become a rallying call for opponents of China's
Communist government.
</P>
<P>
   The groups said that the voluntary resettlement of the farmers
would dilute the population of ethnic Tibetans in western Qinghai
province, which lies on the Tibetan Plateau north of the Tibet
Autonomous Region. The farmers, about 40 percent of whom are ethnic
Chinese and the remainder Hui Muslim and other minority groups,
would be moved from the northeastern part of Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics compiled by the World Bank and the State Department
suggest that, in fact, the ethnic composition of the area would not
change radically. But the issue quickly caught the attention of
Congress, came up during Summers' confirmation hearings, and became
enmeshed in the tensions between Washington and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank officials said Thursday that they expected the
program would ultimately go ahead, but only after substantial
modifications to assure that several environmental objections have
been addressed _ and to ensure that China does not use the program
to dilute the presence of Tibetans in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the harshest critics of China should prefer this solution
to having the entire project canceled,'' Wolfensohn said in an
interview Thursday afternoon, after he had flown back from a trip
to Europe to quell the dispute over the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``China didn't need our $40 million to resettle these farmers,''
he said, referring to the portion of the loan that would go to this
move. ``But now they have agreed to a further study, and to allow
foreign visitors into the area, unattended by Chinese officials, to
assess what is happening. That is a big breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn's proposal for an independent inspection of the
project by a three-member fact-finding body, appointed by the
bank's board, was supported by the Chinese government. But only
hours earlier, Beijing had accused Washington of interfering in
Chinese domestic affairs by seeking to block the project.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Zhang Qiyue,
said that the American concerns were politically motivated ``on the
pretext that this will undermine the status of Tibetans.''
</P>
<P>
   The compromise, however, apparently did not convince either
pro-Tibetan groups or the United States. They said that the project
had been rushed through the Bank's review process, largely because
later this month China will lose its eligibility for the
40-year-long, no-interest loans provided to the world's poorest
nations. Now classified as a richer country, China will have to
compete for loans at interest rates closer to what commercial banks
charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration insists that, in its haste, the Bank
never conducted satisfactory environmental studies of the effects
of moving the farmers. But the real objections centered on the
concern that the Tibetan influence in the region would be watered
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this project never should have gone to the board,''
said John L. Ackerley, the president of the International Campaign
for Tibet. ``We don't think the bank has any business diluting
ethnic populations.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank argues that its poverty reduction program would benefit
1.7 million of China's poorest people. It was designed, the bank
said, to help farmers escape eroded lands where malnourishment is
common. It would also improve health, education and employment
opportunities for people in some of the country's most inaccessible
villages, bank officials said, by providing farmers with seeds and
fertilizers, basic roads and clean drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Though the bank never says so, it also provides Western aid
workers and observers with an outpost in a remote and politically
sensitive corner of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are some of the best projects in the bank,'' said
Wolfensohn, an Australian-born former investment banker who was
appointed to his post by the Clinton administration. ``I've seen
barren areas transformed to look like they are as lush as
Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   After the independent board reports its findings, the bank's
board of directors will determine whether to release the $40
million portion of the loan that was frozen Thursday. The United
States has about 18 percent of the voting power on the board. But
apart from Germany, it had no allies Thursday in its effort to stop
the China loan.

and more apparent _ Native Americans fishing near Hanford have
developed rashes suggestive of exposure to chromium, and juvenile

PARIS FLIGHT DELAYED 24 HOURS, PASSENGERS IRATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RYAN DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A 24-hour delay in their flight to Paris left
passengers on American Airlines Flight 146 in a state of revolt
Thursday at a time when the airline industry and Congress are
talking of the need for a passenger Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The American flight was supposed to leave Logan Airport at 6:10
p.m. Wednesday. But after numerous delays, punctuated by airline
excuses and angry passenger reaction, it finally took off at 5:45
p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we were hostages,'' said passenger Rosemarie
Beskind of Hanover, N.H., describing the hour-by-hour announcements
of delays due to mechanical problems Wednesday night before the
flight was cancelled at 10:30 p.m..
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one more instance of an airline being arrogant and
totally disorganized,'' passenger Theo Melas-Kyriazi of Brookline,
said after American failed to deliver on the promise it made
Wednesday night to get Paris-bound passengers off by 10:30 a.m.
Thursday. The crew that was supposed to fly the plane couldn't
because they didn't have the federally required hours of downtime
from the night before.
</P>
<P>
   An American spokeswoman in Chicago said mechanics ran into
trouble Wednesday night trying to find a bolt to fix the engine
cooling system. But the airline should have known that the crew
would not have been able to take off this morning, spokeswoman Mary
Frances Fagan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dropped the ball,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan defended the actions of American's people against
passenger complaints, however. ``To the passengers it may have
appeared (employees) were not very organized,'' said Fagan, ``but
appearances are sometimes deceiving.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the snafus on Flight 146 come at a time when passenger
complaints have caused the airlines to plan the implementation of
the Bill of Rights. Moreover, people stranded in a snowstorm on a
Northwest Airlines flight in Detroit in January are contemplating a
class action suit.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before the alleged lunacy at Logan began, the Senate
Commerce Committee passed the passenger Bill of Rights, a measure
aimed at helping people like those stranded at Logan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll find a lot of people supporting that here,''
said passenger Michael McElroy of Groton.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill of Rights includes a clause that requires airlines to
provide passengers with honest information about delays,
cancellations and diversions, David Fuscus, a spokesman for the Air
Transport Association, said.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said truthful information was hard to come by at
Logan on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had us wait for hours, continuously telling us that the
flight would leave in an hour,'' said Jean Matheson of Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Just before leaving Logan Thursday, passengers angrily recounted
the frustrating events of Wednesday night and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wenesday, the daily flight to Orly International Airport in
Paris was supposed to take off at 6:10 p.m..
</P>
<P>
   At 6:10, they were told it would leave at 7.
</P>
<P>
   At 7, they were told it would leave at 8.
</P>
<P>
   At 8, the pilot told them the plane was fixed and they would
``definitely'' leave that night.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 they were told it would leave at 10.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:30 the flight was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers said they didn't receive dinner vouchers until
almost midnight. They said confusion erupted when American
employees could not find taxi and hotel vouchers, but eventually
American paid for hotel rooms and taxis.
</P>
<P>
   American told passengers to return for a 10:30 a.m. flight
Thursday, but that too was canceled. The flight finally left at
5:45 p.m. because if it left earlier a curfew at Orly would have
prevented the Boeing 767-300 from landing.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, the passengers each received a $1,000 voucher
for future travel, a letter of apology and a promise from the
airline to pay for all unused Paris hotel rooms from Thursday
night.

 &HT;    From one-man start up to major Internet player
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The MindSpring story is the stuff legends are made of.
</P>
<P>
   In countless speeches and interviews, Chairman and founder
Charles Brewer has honed the tale of how a bright young man looking
for a business to start wound up running the fourth-largest
Internet service provider in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer founded MindSpring in his appartment in the Ansley Park
section of Atlanta where he employed himself as founder, chairman,
product manager and customer service representative. In his spare
time, he also tried desperately to spread the word about his
service via Usenet newsgroups and word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Later as the company grew, Brewer moved into modest office space
on West Peachtree Street. Subscribers, analysts and consumers were
charmed by Brewer's low-key self deprecating style, the lawn
furniture decorating his office and his three-legged dog Louie.
When Brewer founded the company in 1994, the Internet was a hippie
wonderland of mavericks, entrepreneurs and hip Web geeks looking to
break even doing work they loved. Brewer's now-legendary core
values and beliefs, which guide the company, also helped the
company's reputation as the type of ISP the Internet's earliest
adopters would want to use.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1994, MindSpring had a few hundred customers
and had attracted the attention of ITC Holding and it decided to
invest in the company. ITC Chairman Cam Lanier had a long record of
building successful and profitable telecommunications companies.
The ITC influence would be one of the major drivers in MindSpring's
overall philosphy of keeping an eye on the bottom line and working
toward profitability. That, combined with Brewer's commitment to
providing service and support to MindSpring users, separated them
from the pack of companies in the ISP industry.
</P>
<P>
   ITC's funding helped MindSpring expand to eventually become the
largest ISP in the Southeast. In 1996 the company went public,
trading under the NASDAQ symbol MSPG.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, MindSpring was the largest ISP in the Southeast with
about 350,000 subscribers. In March, the stock took its first huge
leap as Internet stocks began to take off. Takeover rumors were
rampant, but MindSpring insisted it had no plans to sell the
company. Instead as the stock prices soared, MindSpring began a
string of acquisitions culminating with the SpryNet acquistion in
1998. The acquisition of Netcom for $245 million in 1999 doubled
MindSpring's subscriber base and made it a major industry player.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with 1.2 million subscribers, MindSpring has progressed
from a funky start-up, to one of the top Internet companies in the
United States. In January, Brewer talked about the problems of
becoming a major corporation while trying to hold on to the core
values he founded the company with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net is going from being a relatively minor and kind or
quirky branch of the telecommunications business to being the main
thing,'' he said. ``It's certainly something I never anticipated
when I started the company and its very exciting for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer also talked about the conflicts facing a company that had
grown from a one-man operation into a million-dollar corporation.
``As we got bigger, some things have gotten harder and in other
ways things have gotten easier,'' he said. ``I compare it to
gravity. The bigger we get it seems like there's a force trying to
suck us back to being like any other company.''

COCA-COLA FACES TASK OF REGAINING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BORNEM, Belgium _ Sixteen days ago, Sasha Cockx bought his
midday Coke at the School of St. Mary and flipped back the
bottlecap to collect the token underneath. Collecting 500 points _
one from each small bottle, three from a large one _ could produce
a cellular telephone for only about $75, the 14-year-old scholar
said. It is a prize he is not likely to collect.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after he drank the Coke, his head began to ache and his
stomach hurt. His friend Timothy Alen, who drank two Cokes, even
though both he and Cockx said they thought the soda had smelled
strange, said his knees started to tremble and he felt nauseated.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, both boys were on their way to the St. Joseph's
Clinic in this neat, prosperous town of 20,000 people to be told
that they were suffering from what a physician there called
``probable intoxication.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never drink Coke again,'' Cockx said Thursday. That is
exactly the sentiment Coca-Cola Co. fears most in Belgium and many
other parts of Europe after the biggest recall in its 113-year
history, caused by the experiences of people like Alen and Cockx
who blame Coke for their sickness. Since then, Coca-Cola products
have been under suspicion in European countries ranging from
Portugal to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The routine lunchtime drink was the beginning of a nightmare for
the Atlanta-based company, which has now discovered that the
venerable Coke brand is vulnerable, not just to lapses in quality
control that may have led to the contamination of its products, but
to the shifting perceptions and political sensitivities of its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   First, Coca-Cola recalled 2.5 million bottles around this area
of Belgium, 25 miles northwest of Brussels. Then, Coca-Cola plants
in Antwerp and Ghent were ordered closed. ``Quite honestly, we let
the people of Belgium down,'' said M. Douglas Ivester, the
Coca-Cola chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Only on Wednesday, when the government lifted a 10-day ban, was
the giant American company permitted to restart production in
Belgium. (France followed suit Thursday, permitting a bottling
plant at Dunkirk, which had supplied the Belgian market, to
reopen.) And whatever the financial cost to the company, the
challenges in regenerating faith in its brand may only be
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coca-Cola has said they'll pay the medical expenses, but
there's a moral responsibility, too,'' said Odilon Hermans, the
director of the School of St. Mary, whose 280 students are 13 and
14 years old and which was unusual among the six schools here
because in addition to other beverages, it sold Coke to its pupils
to augment their lunch-packs from home. ``For two weeks now the
children have not been so good. The parents are distressed. Four
pupils are still off school.''
</P>
<P>
   The school, he said, has instructed a lawyer to write to
Coca-Cola saying it holds the company legally as well as morally
responsible. Altogether, he said, 39 children at his school were
taken ill, 33 on the first day of the crisis and six more the
following day. All underwent throat X-rays and urine and blood
tests. Some needed to use respirators. Fifteen were hospitalized
overnight. Two days later, some were still complaining of sickness
and were sent home again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not psychological or mass hysteria,'' Hermans said,
referring to suggestions by the Belgian government that some of the
scores of Coke drinkers who subsequently reported becoming ill
might have overreacted _ a view shared by some sociologists and
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, in this town, as elsewhere in Belgium, there is a
questioning not so much of consumers' reactions but of the
company's and the government's.
</P>
<P>
   The Coke crisis erupted at a particularly fraught moment. Across
Europe, supermarket shoppers have begun to question the provenance
of products on store shelves. And in Belgium the government was
reeling from a scandal over the contamination of meat and poultry
traced to the discovery of the cancer-causing chemical dioxin in
animal feed grains.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the government faced elections on June 13, so anything
that smacked of negligence in the food chain carried heavy
political freight. Then came the Coca-Cola recall _ just days
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Spiessens, an administrator in a local mental health clinic,
said: ``There had been the dioxin business. Elections were coming.
This was the last straw.''
</P>
<P>
   As he shopped Thursday at an outlet of Colruyt, a discount
Belgian supermarket, where the soda section offered mineral water,
Pepsi and a local brand of cola called Eldorado, Spiessens
commented: ``Most people still have doubts. They fear that they
haven't been told the whole truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the government in Brussels said on Wednesday that it did
not accept Coca-Cola's explanation, which attributed the illnesses
to traces of sulfur used to produce carbon dioxide bubbles in the
soda, and to creosote, an oily liquid distilled from tar that is
used on wooden storage pallets as a preservative and disinfectant.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hugo Bontinck, medical director of the St. Joseph's Clinic,
said he was one of the first physicians to treat the sick children
here. ``Mainly they had headaches, dizziness, nausea and muscular
vibration,'' he said in an interview Thursday. ``Some of them were
vomiting, but there was no fever.''
</P>
<P>
   He, like the government, has doubts about Coca-Cola's version of
events. ``The mechanism that created the symptoms is not very
clear,'' he said, arguing that the contaminants identified by
Coca-Cola were found in such small amounts that ``it is not so
likely that these low concentrations can explain the symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said, the cause of the sickness may never be
determined because the contaminants may have dispersed rapidly
enough so that they did not show up in the blood and urine samples.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Belgian toxicologists, he said, are examining the plant extracts
and sulfide gases used in the recalled Coke, trying to establish
whether it had higher-than-normal levels of substances that are
usually found in Coke. But that seemed to be problematic as well,
because the formula for Coke is secret _ so secret, in fact, that
it resides in a locked bank vault in Atlanta and even top
executives are said to be unable to see it without a formal vote by
the company's directors.
</P>
<P>
   A senior government official in Brussels said investigators were
examining whether any of a staggering 15,000 substances could have
caused the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a marketing drive to reclaim the public trust,
Ivester, the Coca-Cola chief, said on Wednesday that he would buy
everyone in Belgium a Coke. That might not be too enticing for
people who were sickened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't accept it,'' Alen, one of the stricken
14-year-olds, said shortly before his year-end English exam
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola might have better fortune with people like Diane
Heymans, a worker in one of the light industrial plants fringing
this town. She stopped buying Coke only when it was recalled, she
said at the Colruyt store Thursday after buying a bottle of
Eldorado cola, whose label proclaims ``The Original Taste.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll buy Coke again as soon as it comes back onto the
shelves,'' she said. ``I'm not afraid. I'm sure it's safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Safe or not, it will disappear from the School of St. Mary. ``We
had decided even before this to stop selling Coke at school,'' said
the director. ``We thought there was too much sugar in it for the
children's health.''

DEMOCRATS BACKING AWAY FROM CLINTON'S PLANS FOR MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Ill., Wash.)  (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Medicare officials said Thursday that they had told
the White House that its initial hopes of offering coverage of
prescription drugs for a premium of no more than $25 a month were
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, House Democrats said they had become nervous
about the plan being drafted by President Clinton to revamp
Medicare, because they feared that the prospect of higher premiums
could alarm elderly voters.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare generally does not cover prescription drugs for people
outside the hospital, even though elderly people fill an average of
18 prescriptions a year.
</P>
<P>
   Federal health officials and actuaries who work for the Medicare
program said the premium for new drug benefits would have to be at
least as high as the existing premium for coverage of doctors'
services, $45.50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats said they worried about being drawn into an
election-year battle over details of the Medicare plan that Clinton
intends to unveil next week.
</P>
<P>
   Senior House Democrats conveyed their concerns to John D.
Podesta, the White House chief of staff, at a meeting on Wednesday
night in the office of Dick Gephardt, the House Democratic leader.
And they elaborated on their concerns in interviews Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said they were frustrated at their inability to
confirm details of the president's plan, even though they would be
expected to defend it.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of the Democrats' message, as described by one
lawmaker, was: ``Don't make us walk a plank that will blow up on
us.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, White House officials have refused to rule out the idea
of charging higher Medicare premiums to high-income beneficiaries.
House Democrats said they had told Podesta that the president would
be courting political disaster if he proposed ``income-related
premiums.'' They said that such a proposal reminded them, and could
remind many elderly voters, of the surtax that Congress adopted in
1988, as part of a bill to provide catastrophic health insurance
coverage under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The law provoked such an outcry from the elderly that it was
repealed a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., said the House Democrats had told the
White House that Clinton's proposal, if not carefully designed,
could create a ripe political target for Republicans and could do
political damage to the presidential hopes of Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Our message to the White House was, `Don't sell us out,''' Stark
said. ``I have heard from people inside the administration,
including high-level health policy-makers, who worry that the
president will cut a deal with the Republicans on Medicare in
October.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark said the secrecy of the White House process and the
administration's last-minute rush to meet self-imposed deadlines
reminded him of the way in which Clinton's proposal for universal
health insurance was developed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., said: ``If the president provides
too many specifics, he will simply give the Republicans ammunition
for an endless battle over the future of Medicare. That would be
wasteful and stupid. The issue of Medicare can't be dealt with on
the back of a galloping horse for public relations purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the president returned to the United States from Europe
around 1 a.m. on Wednesday, White House aides have been scrambling
to get his approval for details of his Medicare plan.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said Thursday
that the president would announce his proposals next week, although
there are still several unresolved questions about the financing
and the scope of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the president's plan would be ``comprehensive,''
Lockhart declined to characterize it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said, ``I was delighted that Podesta
came up to solicit our views, and I expressed my opinion that
Medicare should not be means-tested in any way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Likewise, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., said: ``The president's
Medicare plan must not include premiums based on income, and must
not increase out-of-pocket costs for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schakowsky, a former director of the Illinois State Council
of Senior Citizens, said she told Podesta: ``Don't do it. It's bad
policy, and it's very bad politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, elderly people from Ms. Schakowsky's group jeered Dan
Rostenkowksi, then chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
because they held him responsible for the surtax, or ``supplemental
premium,'' that was to have financed prescription drug coverage for
about one-sixth of Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, William Roth, R-Del., who is chairman of the
finance committee, said Thursday that he intended to move Medicare
legislation through his committee this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to put together a bipartisan Medicare bill,'' said
Ginny Flynn, a spokeswoman for Roth. ``He wants to include a drug
benefit for the sickest elderly and for low-income elderly
people.''

 &HT;    Thriving Mindspring stock splits 2-for-1
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since its initial public offering in March 1996,
shares of MindSpring Enterprises have shot up along with the
company's national presence.
</P>
<P>
   Had you invested $1,000 in MindSpring stock March 14, 1996, and
kept it there, you would have $29,758, based on Thursday's closing
price of $82.12 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Atlanta-based MindSpring originally sold for a
split-adjusted $2.67. Shares of the fourth-largest Internet access
provider are due to split 2-for-1 today. This year, while
MindSpring's share price has grown more slowly than in the past, it
has bucked the trend set by the rest of the Internet stocks. The
company's shares are up 34.5 percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Russ, an analyst with Atlanta-based Robinson-Humphrey,
said MindSpring's stock suffered initially because of a perception
by investors that ISPs are a commodity. In 1996 and 1997, there was
a lot of competition and very little to differentiate the
companies.

   MindSpring had its first positive cash flow in mid-to-late 1997,
which is what started the stock moving, Russ said. In August 1997,
MindSpring traded for about $5 a share. By the end of that year,
shares had more than doubled. By the end of 1998, the first year
MindSpring turned a profit, shares were selling for $70.
</P>
<P>
   ``MindSpring management recognized that building a brand name
and offering quality customer service can make an ISP stand out,''
Russ said. ``It earned its first profit in 1998 and showed you can
really make money. The stock price snowballed from there.''

 &HT;    MindSpring seeks to join industry joinings
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring's Thursday announcement that it was ``in
discussions'' with businesses about ``possible business
combinations'' added more grist to the rapidly spinning rumor mill
that the computer hardware industry is looking to add Internet
properties to its holdings.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring's shares rose $3.50 to $82.12 1/2 and are up 45
percent in the past eight days, giving it a market value of about
$2.52 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of California-based competitor Earthlink, another
Internet service provider, soared Thursday on news South
Dakota-based Gateway Inc. was considering buying the company.
MSNBC.com, which seems to be computer-rumor central, also reported
Thursday that America Online was in talks to produce AOL-brand PCs
in conjunction with Microworkz.com, a manufacturer of inexpensive
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Microworkz.com Chief Executive Rick Latman was later reported by
Bloomberg News as saying his company was talking with several
''major ISPs'' to provide service on its new $199 iToaster
Internet-ready computer, which has no Microsoft Corp. software or
floppy disk drive. The iToaster is expected to begin shipping in
mid-July. ''We are talking to AOL about the potential of AOL
getting new subscribers from Microworkz machines,'' Latman said.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent from any hardware merger discussions is
Midtown-based MindSpring. Spokesman Ed Hansen said Thursday's
cryptic release was in response to rampant speculation that the ISP
was also considering an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the Internet/hardware speculation continues, Jupiter
Communications broadband and telecommunications strategies director
Abhi Chaki says it would be wrong to count MindSpring out of the
derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all boils down to the concept of who distributes Internet
access,'' he says. Earlier this year, Jupiter issued a report
predicting that companies not currently in the business of
providing Internet access will begin offering Internet access. That
someday looks like today, as more and more partnerships and
alliances are announced in an increasingly consolidated
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more and more difficult to survive going solo,'' he says.
``That's what this is all about, partnering and partnering
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaki says the notion of MindSpring or Earthlink teaming with a
PC maker could be a good move for both parties. ``What Gateway is
doing with Gateway.com is promoting their goods and services all
the time,'' he says. ``They still have a relationship with the
customer after they buy a PC. They don't want to make it a one-time
sale as PC margins are eroding. On top of that, the computer
companies get a nice recurring revenue stream from partnering with
an ISP.''
</P>
<P>
   Still there might be other suitors for MindSpring, including
telecommunications and cable companies. There's also an outside
chance that MindSpring's stated desire to see its service delivered
via the broadband cable TV wires has caught the interest of a cable
company looking to expand its subscriber base. Chaki says that the
Excite/AtHome cable modem service could be considering acquiring a
dial-up ISP like MindSpring with the eventual goal of converting
them to cable modem subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Chaki says a potential alliance between MindSpring and a PC
maker or telecommunications company would definitely give
MindSpring the financial ammunition it needs to continue building
its subscriber base to eventually reach its stated goal of becoming
the No. 2 ISP in the country behind America Online, which has 17
million subscribers, compared with MindSpring's 1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would give them more financial reach,'' Chaki said.
``MindSpring is a very frugal company. For once they could take
their eyes off the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin, Texas-based Dell Computer Corp. already offers ISP
service with its computers in Europe, and Michael Dell confirmed
this week that Dell was going to announce an ISP relationship later
this summer. He wouldn't say when or with whom the company would
team. ``Stay tuned'' is all he told reporters meeting with him in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent flurry of initial public stock offerings for
Internet-related companies such as Media Metrix, TheGlobe.com and
Salon, stock prices have soared even though their filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission state quite clearly that they
don't even expect to turn a profit in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not terribly important for Internet companies to show a
profit right now,'' Chaki says. ``The market is rewarding people
who are taking risks and show the potential to build very large
businesses.'' MindSpring is ... justifiably proud of its recent
string of profitable quarters. However, when it comes to the
Internet, Wall Street seems more impressed by flashy mergers and
gutsy deals than solid companies making money.
</P>
<P>
   Strategic relationships are becoming more and more important to
companies like MindSpring as high-speed Internet access via cable
modems and DSL telephone lines threaten the ISP industry.
MindSpring has a deal with sibling cable company Knology to provide
cable modem service to several markets in the Southeast and also
has a deal with BellSouth to offer high-speed Internet telephone
access beginning this fall. However, industry pundits believe that
an alliance with a major PC manufacturer could attract greater
numbers of new users to MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   Dark horses in the MindSpring sweepstakes include the Microsoft
Network, the Redmond, Wash., software maker's dial-up Internet
service that MindSpring Chairman Charles Brewer recently said he
would like to acquire. Analysts are divided on whether Microsoft
wants to hold on to the dial-up venture or divest it and focus on
its Web offerings.

IN HUGE WIN FOR LABOR IN SOUTH, TEXTILE WORKERS APPEAR TO APPROVE
UNIONIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANNAPOLIS, N.C. _ Workers at the nation's largest textile plant
_ a huge brick fortress of resistance to labor organizing in the
South _ apparently ended a 93-year epoch on Wednesday night and
voted to allow a textile workers union inside the walls to
represent them.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned officials of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
Textile Employees, known as UNITE, declared victory Thursday in the
long-running battle to organize the Fieldcrest Cannon plant, not
quite believing they had won after so many years of defeat. With
more than 5,200 workers at the complex of six plants, Fieldcrest
Cannon would represent the largest victory ever for labor in the
South, particularly given the company's history of intense
hostility to labor, which repeatedly drew angry citations from the
National Labor Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like we just organized GM,'' said Bruce Raynor, the
union's organizing director. ``Suddenly, we've got a beacon to show
other textile workers that they can do it. And it sends a message
to other owners that they're going to have to take into account the
needs of workers as they modernize.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor experts said the turnabout, after four previous
unsuccessful elections at the plant, which makes sheets and towels,
was apparently due to fear caused by shifting ownership in the
textile industry, the increased demands of modern production lines
and a growing number of immigrants in the workforce, who tend to be
more likely to support unionization.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's social climate _ with the kneejerk anti-union
attitude of most major manufacturers and the use of every tool
available to fight off unionization _ it's a stunning victory for
the union,'' said Leon Fink, a labor historian at the University of
North Carolina. ``It's the biggest breakthrough in a traditional
Southern industry for probably the past quarter century.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials were not conceding the outcome of Wednesday
night's vote, and the NLRB said the outcome remained too close to
call. At the moment, the vote stands at 2,270 in favor of the union
and 2,102 against it, with challenges to about 285 votes. Charles
Hansen, the chief executive of Pillowtex Corp., which owns the
complex of six mills, said that the company has not challenged any
of the votes, and would await an official announcement by the labor
board.
</P>
<P>
   The board challenged 53 of the votes; the rest of the challenges
came from the union, which said some of those who participated may
have been in supervisory positions, making them ineligible to vote.
Union leaders said it was virtually a mathematical impossibility
that the labor board would not eventually award the election to the
union, in a matter of weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we've won,'' said Mike Zucker, the union's
chief organizer at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen Thursday said he was not conceding.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, the percentage of the workforce that belongs to
unions is lower than in the rest of the country. While 13.5 percent
of the workforce belongs to unions nationwide, two professors at
Florida State University, Barry T. Hirsch and David A. Macpherson,
found that just 4.2 percent of workers belong to unions in North
Carolina and 4.5 percent in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   And unions in the South have had many of the same problems as
unions elsewhere in the country. They have lost members as
companies have closed factories and moved operations overseas. In
the South, perhaps more than elsewhere, employers have bitterly
fought unionization efforts. Employers have been helped by a lack
of union tradition in the South and by right-to-work laws that
permit workers at unionized workplaces not to pay union dues.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, unions have mounted organizing efforts, with
various success rates, in the South, with the Cannon Fieldcrest
effort being labor's biggest victory in the private sector. Unions
have recently organized nursing home workers in Miami, and more
than 600 food workers at a New Orleans convention center. But
organizing drives have also fallen flat at many poultry plants and
nursing homes across the South.
</P>
<P>
   The first Cannon mills were built here in 1906 by James Cannon,
who also created the village of Kannapolis out of the surrounding
cotton fields as a white-clapboard company town for his employees.
The first effort at organizing came in 1921, when workers grew
angry about their $5 weekly paychecks and walked out. Most came
back 10 weeks later, broken by hard times and the refusal of the
management to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   The first real election at the plant came in 1974, the same year
as labor's famous triumph at the J.P. Stevens mill in Roanoke
Rapids, N.C., depicted in the movie ``Norma Rae.'' But the Cannon
company actually worked harder to fight off the union, firing some
employees and threatening others, and the vote failed that year and
again in 1985. Similar tactics in an unsuccessful 1991 election
infuriated the labor board, which accused Fieldcrest Cannon of
engaging in ``numerous, pervasive and outrageous'' unfair labor
practices. That election was thrown out by the board and by the
court, and was run again in 1997, when again the board threw out
the results and ordered a new vote.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote was in effect a rerun of the one in 1991. The
company had been purchased by Pillowtex, a Dallas-based bedding
manufacturer which has several unionized plants. Raynor, who has
spent the better part of a career trying to organize Kannapolis,
said that for the first time this year, the company did not engage
in any illegal tactics, and simply tried to state the case to
workers why they should not vote for the union.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the various buyouts and shifting ownerships in the industry
left many workers uncertain of the future. Mitchell High, a
dye-range operator in the plant who controls the color of finished
goods, said he voted against the union because he is satisfied with
his working conditions. But his colleagues who voted for it told
him they're worried about their job security, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what's coming, so they're hoping the union can
protect them,'' he said. ``I guess we'll find out if they're
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemberly Shoaf Taylor, who hems sheets at the plant, said she
voted for the union because management is using technology to prod
employees into working much too hard. When she started 19 years
ago, she said, she was part of a crew of seven people who turned
out 300 sheets a day. Now three people have to do much more work on
each sheet, she said, but are being paid little more. Other workers
said they hoped the company's low pension benefits would be a major
issue once negotiations between the union and the company begin.
</P>
<P>
   The vote comes at a time when the percentage of unionized
private-sector employees in the South continues to fall faster than
in the country as a whole, 7.1 percent in 1985 to 4.1 percent in
1998, according to the Bureau of National Affairs, a private
research organization in Washington. But several Southern states _
notably the textile belt of North Carolina, South Carolina and
Virginia _ have actually seen increases in unionization during the
last three years. UNITE, a successor to the old Amalgamated
Clothing and Textile Workers Union, has recently won several
victories at smaller textile plants in the South.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, black workers have been more amenable to the
appeal of unions than the old all-white work force, said Thomas E.
Terrill, a history professor at the University of South Carolina.
Hispanic and Asian workers, who are gaining a foothold in the labor
market of the South, have also voted in increasing numbers for
unions, although they make up only about 5 percent of Fieldcrest
Cannon's workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Raynor said he hoped the outcome would convince workers at other
plants they too can support a union.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote puts the lie to the notion that manufacturing
workers in the South can't be organized, that they're anti-union,''
he said. ``If companies conduct themselves fairly, southern workers
will vote for a union in very large percentages.''

 &HT;    AGL won't become a `stealth company,' top executive says
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Atlanta Gas Light Co. will not become a ``stealth
company'' when Georgia's natural gas deregulation is completed this
fall, and its marketing affiliate may even sell gas and electricity
in other Southeastern states that deregulate, Chief Executive
Walter M. Higgins said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Natural Gas Roundtable, an industry group,
Higgins said that once SouthStar Energy Services, the partnership
that operates Georgia Natural Gas Services, gets Georgia under its
belt, the company intends to enter Southeastern markets as they
open up to competition.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins is chief executive of both Atlanta Gas Light and its
parent company, AGL Resources, which is the lead partner in
Atlanta-based SouthStar, technically the parent of Georgia Natural
Gas. He found a receptive audience of industry insiders as he
outlined the company's experience with deregulation during a
luncheon address.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins recapped what he called the utility's bumpy road to
deregulation, which will be completed in October when Atlanta Gas
Light terminates gas sales and becomes a distribution company with
a regulated rate of return.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the ``bumps in the road'' the utility has experienced,
Atlanta Gas Light plans today to file papers with the Georgia
Public Service Commission seeking to pass on to consumers millions
of dollars in unexpected costs incurred in the transition to
deregulation. Included are the costs of operating call centers to
handle customer inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exact value of the potential stranded costs is not known
at this time,'' a draft filing says.
</P>
<P>
   Roger B. Cooper, executive vice president of the American Gas
Association, one of about 50 people who heard Higgins' speech, said
Georgia's 1997 deregulation law is closely watched in the $100
billion-a-year natural gas industry. It is the only law so far that
mandates that the monopoly supplier withdraw entirely from gas
sales, although the law did permit the parent AGL Resources to set
up a separate marketing affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins noted that Virginia recently enacted a gas deregulation
law, and other states won't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Higgins said that Atlanta Gas Light will
``continue to play an important but different role'' after
deregulation is completed. He said distribution will remain the
most profitable part of the business for some time.
</P>
<P>
   AGL Resources has begun looking for new marketing opportunities
as other states deregulate. Higgins noted that marketers will offer
``every imaginable service that can be provided,'' such as
electricity, telephone and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins has named Mark D. Caudill, vice president for energy
competition at AGL Resources, to keep track of deregulation
programs and urge enactment of the Georgia model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly it's an advantage if it's a system we're familiar
with,'' said Caudill. ``There are great opportunities for us in
those markets.''

TRADE AGENCY FINDS WEB SLIPPERY WITH SNAKE OIL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Fla.)   By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Snake oil salesmen have been around for ages. But
they are proliferating in the electronic age, according to the
Federal Trade Commission, which Thursday announced that it had
identified hundreds of Web sites promoting phony cures for 30
different ailments, including AIDS, multiple sclerosis, liver
disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The sites are so numerous, the agency said, that it cannot
possibly take action against all of them. But it has reached legal
settlements with four Internet companies: one that advertised shark
cartilage as a cure for cancer, another that sold a fatty acid to
treat arthritis, and two that promoted magnets for various
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sites touting unproven remedies for very serious diseases _
cancer, heart disease, HIV/AIDS and, particularly, arthritis _ are
absolutely exploding on the Web,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director
of the agency's Bureau of Consumer Protection.
</P>
<P>
   None of the four companies admitted wrongdoing, and the
settlements do not preclude them from doing business on the Web;
they must only stop making fraudulent claims. However, Melinda
Sneed, owner of Arthritis Pain Care Center of Arlington, Texas, one
of the four, said she shut her Web site down nearly a year ago _
not because of FTC pressure, but because other sites were touting
the same product, a fatty acid derived from beef tallow, for
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time they contacted us, we already had the Web site
down,'' she said. ``It was strictly competition that put us out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The cases announced Thursday stemmed from two ``health claims
surf days,'' one in 1997 and another in 1998, in which agency
investigators and public health advocates from 25 countries scanned
the Internet for fraudulent health claims. Each session identified
400 sites containing questionable promotions, said Richard Cleland,
an FTC lawyer handling the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said the trade commission did not have the resources to
conduct full-scale investigations of all the sites. The
investigations are extremely time-consuming and require a
comprehensive review of scientific literature to prove the agency's
contention that a company is behaving deceptively. Instead, the
agency acted against four of the most egregious sites, Cleland
said, and sent the rest e-mail messages, warning the site owners
that the government had paid them an electronic visit.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies reacted incredulously to the warnings, Cleland
said. One fired back, ``If you're from the government, what are you
doing here?'' Others sent stronger messages.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the 1997 warnings were sent, officials surveyed
a representative sample of 64 of the sites. Nearly three quarters
of them, 72 percent, were operating unchanged. About 13 percent had
dropped their unsubstantiated claims or disappeared from the Web;
10 percent had made some changes and 5 percent could not be found.
</P>
<P>
   When the survey was repeated in 1998, the government found that
the percentage of sites that had dropped their phony claims had
more than doubled, to 28 percent. Cleland characterized the
increase as a ``significant shift,'' which he said demonstrated the
agency's work was having an effect.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement was part of what the trade commission
has dubbed ``Operation Cure All,'' a consumer education campaign to
help patients sift through the maze of often confusing health
information available on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services used
the occasion to promote their own Web site (www.healthfinder.gov),
which they said was visited by 400,000 people a month and had links
to 5,000 other sites containing reliable health information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message is: It's quality, not quackery,'' Ms. Bernstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Arthritis Pain Care Center, the companies
that settled with the agency were Body Systems Technology, of
Casselberry, Fla., which sold capsules containing shark cartilage
for cancer and AIDS; and two selling magnetic therapies, Pain Stops
Here of Baiting Hollow, N.Y., and Magnetic Therapeutic Technologies
Inc. of Irving, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Body Systems Technology could not be reached, and
the owner of Pain Stops Here declined comment. Jim Richardson, the
owner of Magnetic Therapeutic Technologies, said he had cooperated
with the FTC from the outset. Thursday's announcement, he said, has
been blown out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 22.3 million adults in the United States sought
health care information on the Internet last year, said Scott
Reents, an analyst with Cyber Dialogue, a market research company
that tracks the Internet. He said most people visited the Internet
to understand their personal ailments; the most oft-visited sites
are those devoted to specific diseases and specific drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 15,000 to 17,000 health care sites on the
Internet. Consumers, Reents said, generally feel confident that
they can distinguish good information from bad _ a confidence many
doctors do not share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is perfectly obvious that some of the junk is junk,'' said
Dr. George D. Lundberg, former editor of The Journal of the
American Medical Association and now editor in chief of Medscape,
an Internet health information site (www.medscape.com). ``But there
is a lot of in-between stuff that is very difficult to discern.''

SENATE BILL WOULD GUARANTEE INVOLVEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Cal State Northridge cut four men's sports in
1997, supporters of the athletic department felt helpless and shut
out of the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure something similar doesn't happen again, state Sen.
Cathie Wright, R-Simi Valley, has proposed Senate Bill 338. The
bill would prevent a public college or university from cutting a
sport without public notice. The Assembly is scheduled to vote on
SB 338 later this summer; it has already passed the Senate 26-4 and
will be heard by the Assembly Higher Education Committee on July
13.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any kind of a system, when you are dealing with young
people who are developing life patterns, they have to have a
certainty,'' said Wright, who got the state to pay $586,000 to
bring the four CSUN men's sports _ baseball, volleyball, golf and
swimming) back in '97.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I bailed (CSUN) out. But I can't continue to do it in
every area, and I can't continue to do it for the whole of the
university system.''
</P>
<P>
   SB 338 doesn't guarantee sports in the UC, CSU or community
college systems won't be cut, but it forces school officials to
include the community in the decision-making process through public
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the decisions to be made with public knowledge,'' said
Lee Angela Reid, Wright's legislative assistant who wrote most of
SB 338. ``We've had several debacles ... Sometimes decisions are
made in an arena where (the university officials) are not aware of
a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the athletes deserve a fair shake.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to SB 338 originally came from the CSU and the
Community College League of California. They argued SB 338 would
force a financially strapped school to operate in a deficit for a
year, instead of clearing room in its budget immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches and athletes, however, are firmly behind the bill.
Wright's office has received 200 letters of support, including
personal notes from former USC baseball coach Rod Dedeaux and Jim
Brownfield, the president of the California Coaches Association.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the opposition, Reid added proposed amendments to
SB 338. A one-year notice requirement was dropped, and community
colleges also would be allowed to cut sports that don't have
adequate participation. A sport could also be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Fortunato, the Commissioner of Athletics for the
California Community College System, said the amendments made SB
338 ``more palatable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (they) will greatly assist the community colleges in
being realistic in what they are able to provide,'' Fortunato said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said often there are justifiable reasons for cutting a
sport, but her research showed many instances in which programs
were dropped without good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard too many situations that a school was going to cut
a program because the field was being reseeded,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Campbell, CSUN's head men's volleyball coach, was an
assistant at the school in '97. If SB 338 existed then, Campbell
said, the program would have continued without losing key players
who transferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``(SB 338) would prevent the knee-jerk reaction that we had when
the four sports were cut in '97,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Reid: ``Had notice been posted ahead of time,'' she said,
``those programs could have continued. At Northridge, those were
four successful programs. Why put people through that, and in
particular the students?
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're asking is that notification be made. We're not
trying to be unreasonable.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

INEXACTNESS OF MEDICINE ON TRIAL IN LEWIS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX AND JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When all was said and done, the laypeople of the jury
came to the same conclusion about Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. that the
experts did: no conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's inability to blame or acquit Mudge in the 1993 death
of Celtics star Reggie Lewis, after the most exhaustively argued
Massachusetts malpractice trial in memory, represents ``exactly
what the medical community'' thinks, said Dr. Deeb Salem, chairman
of medicine at New England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although at first blush, things may have seemed clear, when a
lot of data came out, it was not obvious what to do,'' said Salem,
a heart specialist who consulted for Mudge's defense. Another heart
specialist called it a coin toss.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Isner, chief of vascular medicine and cardiovascular
research at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, was also unsurprised by the
mistrial in Mudge's case. ``It was a very tough call,'' said Isner,
who had been prepared to testify for Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's decision to acquit Drs. Mark Creager and Peter
Friedman, who consulted on Lewis' case, underscores the uncertainty
that at least 13 of the 15 jurors felt about blaming the
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one lesson for patients, several doctors said Thursday,
is that for all its technological trappings, medicine is a far less
certain enterprise than many imagine. ``Much of what we deal with
is not an exact science,'' Salem said. ``Much of what we deal with
is uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty, in fact, is the accused physician's best ally.
</P>
<P>
   Malpractice lawyers said that if defense attorneys can
underscore this element of medical uncertainty, as Mudge's defense
team did with its parade of experts, it can undermine a lay jury's
willingness to find a doctor negligent, no matter how much they
struggle to reach a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, 94 percent of all medical malpractice cases
are won by the defense. ``The benefit of the doubt always goes to
the doctor,'' said Andrew Meyer, a prominent plaintiff's attorney.
``When a case was as well tried as this one was on both sides, it's
not surprising at all to see it arrive at a dead heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy O'Neill, who defends many Harvard-affiliated doctors in
malpractice cases, agreed. ``These cases are difficult,'' he said.
``It's difficult to convince people in an emotional case like this
on a particular point of view. Often the evidence doesn't make a
lot of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Another moral of the tragic Reggie Lewis story, said several
physicians and malpractice attorneys, is the importance of clear,
direct, one-on-one communication _ a difficult goal to attain in
ordinary cases but one that can be especially elusive with
celebrity patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notoriety of this case contributed to all the complex
20-20 hindsight,'' said Dr. Thomas Graboys, director of the Lown
Cardiovascular Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a member
of the so-called ``dream team'' originally assembled to advise on
Lewis's care, before Reggie and Donna Harris-Lewis transferred his
care to Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had been an ordinary patient who had had one primary
care physician and one cardiologist. . .it might have been a
different situation,'' said Graboys, who strongly supported Mudge's
position.
</P>
<P>
   Isner agreed that Lewis's care was complicated by his
celebrity-athlete status. Mudge ``was trying to make a decision not
just to prevent death but to preserve a career, and that is
probably too tricky a proposition,'' Isner said. ``It probably
exceeds the diagnostic acumen of any mortal cardiologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson of the case, many said, is that physicians tread
on dangerous ground when they call press conferences to discuss
patients' cases _ and then are forced to acknowledge, as Mudge did,
that they were less than truthful about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not going to be forthcoming, you ought not to come
forward at all,'' Meyer said. ``Public relations is a field that
doctors ought to leave to public relations professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   The malpractice attorneys said they expected Mudge's insurer
eventually to reach a financial settlement with Donna Harris-Lewis
to avoid a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff has every incentive to press for a retrial as
leverage for a settlement, attorneys said. Most of the plaintiff's
costs of retrial _ investigating, deposing witnesses, and other
preparation _ have already been borne, they said. A good part of
the lawyers' expenses have already been financed from the
settlement Harris-Lewis won from Dr. John D. Rutherford, a Dallas
cardiologist who consulted on the case.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the hung jury undoubtedly lowers the
settlement stakes, lawyers said. ``Dr. Mudge's insurer will say
`We're not going to pay full value because we almost won this
case,' '' Meyer said.

HOLBROOKE DEFENDS DEALING WITH MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Richard Holbrooke, whose Senate confirmation as
chief U.S. diplomat at the United Nations is all but assured,
Thursday defended his repeated dealings with President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia because ``my job was not to make moral
judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My highest goal here was to avoid war, bring peace,''
Holbrooke told lawmakers at his third and final confirmation
hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ``This isn't
fun. This isn't bridge or tennis. This is tough slogging.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing Thursday was intended to focus on Holbrooke's role
in policy-making in the Balkans, where he has served for several
years as President Clinton's chief envoy. And he spent much of the
session outlining early mistakes by the Clinton administration that
allowed ethnic hatreds in the region to flare into war.
</P>
<P>
   But time and again, he was asked specifically about his close
dealings with Milosevic, who was Holbrooke's chief interlocutor
during years of negotiations in the Balkans and who was indicted
last month by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he had agreed to continue dealing with the Serbian
leader despite mounting evidence that Milosevic was the mastermind
of a campaign of atrocities throughout the Balkans, Holbrooke
suggested that he was left with few alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are neither friends nor partners,'' he said, insisting that
he was forced into negotiations with Milosevic. ``He was the
recognized leader of the Serbs under international law,'' he said.
``I've spent a great deal of time with President Slobodan
Milosevic, during none of which, I would stress, he was indicted.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that Milosevic has been formally charged with war
crimes, ``he should face trial,'' Holbrooke said. ``I can't
conceive of the circumstances under which the kind of negotiations
that I conducted, under instructions, would be conducted again.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the years of bloodshed in the Balkans were the fault of
``the Serb leadership _ and that Serb leadership meant Slobodan
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke faced few hostile questions Thursday, and the
likelihood of his Senate confirmation was made clear at the
beginning of the hearing, when the panel's chairman, Jesse Helms of
North Carolina, pointedly referred to Holbrooke as ``ambassador''
and added, ``I don't hesitate to call you that, now.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is expected to vote next week, possibly
unanimously, to approve the nomination and to send it to the Senate
floor for a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Helms who directed the sharpest questions to the
nominee at Thursday's hearings and who asked whether it had been a
mistake for Holbrooke to reach a cease-fire agreement with
Milosevic last October over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the agreement say it was doomed to fail because it
allowed the bulk of Serb forces in the province to remain there and
did not require the presence of armed NATO troops as cease-fire
monitors. The deal collapsed earlier this year, leading to 11 weeks
of NATO bombing of Serbia and the exodus of more than a million
Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs who remained in Kosovo under the agreement, Helms
said, were ``the same forces who carried out the brutal ethnic
cleansing and mass murder that we have witnessed.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I'm concerned that the fact that the United States
felt obliged to go to war against Yugoslavia this past March was an
obvious conclusion of doing business with Slobodan Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke defended the cease-fire agreement, insisting that he
did not have the option of providing for ground troops to monitor
the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not able to negotiate armed international security
forces in Kosovo in October because it was not possible to do that
under the instructions I was given,'' he said, suggesting that he
had carried out Washington's instructions even though he strongly
disagreed with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe firmly and have stated repeatedly in public and
private that Albanians and Serbs will not be able to live together
in peace in Kosovo until they've had a period of time with
international security forces to keep them from tearing each other
to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had said that they did not push for the
presence of NATO ground troops in Kosovo last year both because of
Clinton's and the Pentagon's long-standing reluctance to commit
ground troops in any situation, and because Congress would have
strongly opposed the move.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke recalled Thursday that there ``was a very clear sense
of the Congress that, at that point, ground troops were not going
to be possible, and that was my instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Holbrooke defended the agreement as having saved the
lives of many of the estimated 150,000 Albanians who had fled their
homes and were then hiding from the Serbs in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Without the cease-fire, ``many of these people would have frozen
to death or starved to death in the winter colds of the hills of
central Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people all returned,'' he continued. ``Many of them were
displaced again during March and April and May. But far fewer died
as a result of our military action and what the Serbs did than
would have died had they been left in the woods and forests over
the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Holbrooke provided an abbreviated history of
American efforts to stem violence in the Balkans and acknowledged
that earlier action by the Clinton administration would have saved
countless lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made numerous mistakes,'' said Holbrooke, who was the
American ambassador to Germany in the early years of the Clinton
administration. ``Had the United States responded vigorously and
appropriately early in the crisis, we might have avoided three of
the four wars that the Belgrade leadership has caused.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I became directly involved in the issue, at the
end of 1994, three of the four wars had already taken place,'' he
said. ``The first one, in Slovenia, was a week long. The second one
with Croatia was a mess beyond messes. And by the time I got
involved, the war was raging out of control in Bosnia, where over
300,000 people were killed.''

 &HT;    Update your business plan, experts tell chief execs
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just when businesses are flying high and operating
profitably may be the time to start work on a radically new
business plan for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   That was the gist of the message conveyed Thursday to more than
400 chief executives and other managers attending a two-day forum
in Atlanta on ``corporate Darwinism,'' or survival of the fittest.
</P>
<P>
   What they heard from academic experts and other business leaders
is that new business approaches, including a ``digital business
plan,'' are links to survival in today's globally competitive
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Digital business plans are strategies for doing more work,
trade, distribution, sales and other activities on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The forum at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead, fifth in an annual
series sponsored by Forbes magazine, is viewed by the executives as
an opportunity to renew acquaintances, learn what others are doing
and listen to the latest studies by business consultants
specializing in strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's session, dealing with ominous subjects such as
``Adapt or Die'' and ``Disruptive Technologies,'' reminded them
that some of the most secure companies in business history, like
Sears, IBM, Digital Equipment and Wang, became stagnant and were
overtaken by change.
</P>
<P>
   James Kelly, chairman of Sandy Springs-based United Parcel
Service, told how his package carrier, alert to new demands, is
going electronic to stay ahead of the curve and be of greater use
to the its loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   George M.C. Fisher, chairman of Eastman Kodak, related how his
company decided that digital photography needed to be embraced _
even if it was at odds with the core business in chemical
processes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that the one unvarying fact for us was that
customers love pictures,'' said Fisher. ``Customers don't care
about chemicals or electrons, just pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the company now has a solid niche in digital
photography, which is expected to drive the industry for the
foreseeable future, it also still has solid business in the
traditional lines of film, chemicals, papers and other products
that are the main sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   G. Richard Thoman, president and chief executive of Xerox, told
how his company had rebounded, partly by providing more seamless
services for handling documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now spend 70 percent of our research and development
dollars on the 30 percent of new business.'' Asked why he comes to
meetings like the Forbes forum, David S. Pottruck, president and
co-CEO of Charles Schwab Corp., said there are several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to talk to people and get our name around, and look for
talent,'' he said. ``My company will hire between 3,000 and 4,000
people this year, most in the technology area. ... We're in this
battle for intellectual capital.''

 &HT;    CheckFree pulls offering of stock
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Stung by speculation about the timing of a $148.2
million stock sale, CheckFree on Thursday withdrew the offering.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic payment processor said it stopped the sale of 3.8
million shares to quiet speculation that its timing _ two days
before three major banks formed a rival company _ was anything more
than coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the shares were priced at $39. On Wednesday, three
CheckFree customers, Chase Manhattan Bank, Wells Fargo and First
Union, said they would form a company, called the Exchange, to
deliver bills electronically. That company eventually would compete
with CheckFree, one of a handful of companies trying to make the
Internet the place people get and pay their bills. That news took a
24 percent chunk out of CheckFree's stock, leading to speculation
it planned the sale to occur before the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree closed Wednesday at $28.75, down $8.93 3/4. Its shares
sold as high as $34.50 Thursday but closed at $28.12 1/2, down 62
1/2 cents. CheckFree shares are down 26.7 percent over the last
five trading sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.8 million shares _ 2.4 million owned by the company and
1.4 million by existing shareholders, including Pete Kight,
chairman and chief executive _ were priced Monday but were not to
be delivered to the underwriters in New York until today.
</P>
<P>
   Kight, whose 658,122 shares would have earned him $25.7 million,
said the company was reacting to speculation that the stock sale
was timed to beat the Exchange announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, CheckFree executives sat across the table from more
than 50 institutional investors, many of whom requested an
allocation of stock,'' Kight said in a statement. ``I don't ever
want to walk back into the offices of these analysts and portfolio
managers and have to think that they might be wondering whether we
had been honest with them. Our credibility with shareholders is
more important than any offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Pricing a stock for a public offering is a step toward
completing a sale. But the deal does not close until the shares are
delivered to the underwriters, who act are intermediaries between
the company and investors. CheckFree's stock sale was to have been
underwritten by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown and
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist Group.
</P>
<P>
   James Marks, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, upped
his recommendation on CheckFree to a ``strong buy'' from a ``buy''
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree spokeswoman Laurinda Wilson said the company still
might sell the shares.

CASE AGAINST REGGIE LEWIS DOCTOR ENDS IN MISTRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a torturous, inconclusive end to a
highly-controversial trial, a judge Thursday declared a mistrial in
the Reggie Lewis medical malpractice case after jurors twice said
they could not agree on whether Lewis's chief cardiologist, Dr.
Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., was negligent in treating the heart condition
that killed the 27-year-old Celtics star six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the jury could not reach a verdict on Mudge, it did clear
two consulting physicians, Peter L. Friedman and Mark. A. Creager,
of malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly seven weeks of a trial that saw the clash of
institutions and cultures that define Boston -- professional sports
and preeminent medicine -- the indefinite conclusion means that it
is not over, at least for Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be back to do it again,'' vowed attorney Robert G.
Harley, who represented Lewis's widow, Donna Harris-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the front row of the courtroom's spectator gallery,
where he sat each day since the trial began in early May, Mudge
showed no reaction as the jury announced for the second time that
it was deadlocked on the claims against him and Suffolk Superior
Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith declared a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   But after the jury was dismissed, Mudge smiled broadly and was
quickly surrounded by family members and friends, including several
of his patients, who offered congratulatory hugs and handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   Commended by one well-wisher, a beaming Mudge replied that, ``I
don't know what we've won, but . . .'' his voice trailing off as he
continued shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly absent from the courtroom was Harris-Lewis, who was
in the courtroom earlier but left before the verdict to return home
to her two children. Friends and relatives, including her brother
and Lewis's mother, Inez Ritch, were emotionless during the judge's
announcement, and then left the courtroom rapidly and silently.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis, who canceled plans to hold a post-trial press
conference, was said to be ``devastated'' by the outcome. In a
written statement, she said, ``No lies, no rumors, and no gossip
about my Reggie can ever change the good and kind and caring person
he was.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15 jurors, who deliberated for 38 hours over six days,
looked strained and weary as they filed into the courtroom shortly
after 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdicts were read, jurors were thanked personally by
Fremont-Smith, quickly dismissed, and ushered to a service
elevator. Once outside the courthouse, they immediately scattered,
leaving in groups of two and three. On the sidewalk, two white
female jurors who exited the building together remained
tight-lipped.
</P>
<P>
   Driving a green Saab convertible with the top down and radio
playing, Fremont-Smith -- who called the case ``a sad situation''
with ``good people on both sides'' -- also left quickly, ignoring
reporters' questions as he drove away.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering inside the courtroom, Tom Fall, whose wife, Linda, had
a heart transplant under Mudge's care seven years ago, said he
wished Mudge had been cleared, but expressed relief that the trial
had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big tragedy,'' said Fall, who attended several days
of the trial with his wife, ``and I just hope Donna Lewis thinks
long and hard and doesn't come back for another trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Testimony during the lengthy trial ranged from the technical to
the farcical, with the introduction of a convicted felon who
claimed he saw Lewis sniffing cocaine in a public bathroom, and an
elderly former Northeastern University doctor who contradicted
himself on the stand, saying that Lewis both had and had not tested
positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict comes one month shy of the sixth anniversary of
Lewis's death and three years after Harris-Lewis filed a medical
malpractice lawsuit accusing four cardiologists of failing to
diagnose her husband with a life-threatening heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   One of the cardiolgists, Dr. John D. Rutherford, now in practice
in Texas, settled out of court with Harris-Lewis in April, on the
day that jury selection began. Details of the settlement have not
been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Filed in May 1996, the lawsuit spurred furious debate over
Harris-Lewis's motives and timing. The suit came just months before
the state's three-year statute of limitations would have barred the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hailed Harris-Lewis as a grieving spouse determined
to clear her husband's name, which she said had been smeared
posthumously in media reports linking his medical troubles with
cocaine use, which can cause lasting heart damage.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, meanwhile, saw her as a greedy widow, willing to
sacrifice her husband's legacy and reputation for financial gain;
during the trial, a sports agent testified that Lewis could have
earned more than $117 million if he had continued playing
professional basketball.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Harris-Lewis, who denied that her husband used
drugs, said the suit was motivated by a 1995 Wall Street Journal
story suggesting that cocaine played a role in her husband's death,
and by Mudge's subsequent claim that Lewis confessed to him two
weeks before his death that he had used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge, now director of cardiac transplantation at Brigham and
Women's Hospital, has said Lewis's belated confession impeded him
from accurately diagnosing the player's condition.
</P>
<P>
   The first public sign that Lewis, nicknamed ``His Regginess'' by
local sportscasters, had a medical ailment came on April 29, 1993,
when the National Basketball Association All-Star collapsed on the
Boston Garden's parquet floor during a playoff game against the
Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of that collapse was shown numerous times to jurors,
who watched raptly as the 6-foot 7-inch player stumbled and fell on
the court, his legs appearing to become heavy and sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Lewis was admitted for tests to New England
Baptist Hospital, where a team of 12 prominent doctors from across
the city -- quickly dubbed the ``Dream Team'' -- concluded he had a
serious heart problem that could end his basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a bizarre turn of events three days later, Lewis left
the Baptist against medical advice in the middle of the night,
pulling off his heart monitor. He was transported to the nearby
Brigham and into Mudge's care.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt transfer sparked speculation that Lewis and his wife
were shopping for a rosier diagnosis, one that would allow him to
continue his lucrative playing career.
</P>
<P>
   Seven days after being admitted to the Brigham, Mudge announced
confidently at a press conference that Lewis had a ``poorly
understood,'' but benign, fainting condition, not a serious heart
condition. With medical supervision and unspecified treatment, he
would be able to play basketball again, Mudge proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven weeks later, Lewis collapsed and died of heart failure
while shooting baskets at a Brandeis University gym on July 27,
1993, leaving behind a pregnant wife and year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   His death prompted an outpouring of grief by fans in Boston and
beyond, who were charmed by Lewis's soft-spoken manner, gentle
demeanor and philanthropic nature, qualities that made him the
antithesis of the trash-talking, bad-boy athletes of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge, whose diagnosis had been publicly criticized by some
members of Boston's medical community, received death threats after
Lewis died and was given temporary police protection at his home.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy of Lewis's body found no evidence of drugs in his
system, and his death certificate listed adenovirus, a relatively
minor virus spread by coughing and sneezing, as the cause of
scarring found in his heart.
</P>
<P>
   But that finding came under intense public scrutiny when the
Wall Street Journal story was published nearly two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, lawyers for Harris-Lewis argued that
allegations of drug use were false, as well as irrelevant. Lewis's
doctors, they argued, were responsible for providing him with
top-quality care regardless of the cause of his heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors' lawyers, meanwhile, suggested that Lewis's death
was caused by his own failure to follow doctor's orders and avoid
strenuous exercise, noting that two witnesses testified they saw
Lewis sweating while working out.

FAA, AMERICAN AIRLINES REVIEW SAFETY PROCEDURES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal aviation officials and American Airlines are closely
examining safety procedures, pilot training, and flight operations
in the wake of this month's accident at Little Rock, Ark., that
killed 11 people. That crash was the most recent in a series of
accidents and close calls involving American going back to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its investigation into the June 1 accident, the
National Transportation Safety Board will look at several past
accidents to see if there is a connection, although the board,
issued a press release saying there was no separate investigation
into the practices of the airline. The Wall Street Journal Thursday
reported that there was such an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA and American are also conducting reviews of the nation's
second largest airline, a spokesman for the airline said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   American has had a series of incidents _ one at Bradley
International Airport in Connecticut where the plane sliced through
trees on a ridgetop before landing _ and two fatal accidents: one
in December 1995 in Cali, Columbia, that killed 157 when the flight
crew put wrong information into a computer, became lost, and hit a
mountain while trying to land, and the one this month in Little
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be some similarities in the history of
accidents and incidents over the past six years and our commitment
to safety requires our vigilance in maintaining industry-leading
training and operating procedures,'' Robert W. Baker, American's
vice president for operations, said Thursday. ``For that reason, I
have ordered a thorough top-to-bottom review of our flight
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   American said it will focus on six incidents _ Hartford, Cali,
Little Rock, a 1993 accident when a DC-10 went off the runway at
Dallas-Fort Worth; a 1997 incident in Cleveland where a DC-9 was
heavily damaged when it slid off a runway during landing; and a
Feb. 9, 1998, incident at Chicago's O'Hare Airport where an
American Boeing 727 with 121 people on board landed in heavy fog
some 200 feet short of the runway, struck light poles, and skidded
some 2,000 feet before landing coming to rest in a muddy field.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a high-ranking NTSB source said the review by the
agency _ which has no power to regulate and can only recommend
changes _ may include other incidents and crashes involving
American Eagle planes, whose pilots receive the same training
program as American Airline pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not unusual when there is a series of incidents, as few
as two, involving one carrier that calls into question the actions
and thoughts of a flight crew that we will go down the road a
little ways,'' said the NTSB source. ``We will look at training, at
corporate culture. We have gone down this path before with other
airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, there were two fatal American Eagle crashes. In
October, an ATR-72 crashed in Roselawn, Ind., killing all 68 on
board. Icing and the French manufacturer's failure to disclose
information concerning icing during operation were blamed for the
crash. In December, an American Eagle plane crashed while landing
at Raleigh-Durham, N.C., killing 15.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB found the pilot failed to follow procedures for engine
failure identification and AMR Eagle training was lax. AMR is the
corporate parent of American Airlines and American Eagle. AMR stock
closed Thursday at 64, down 2 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the NTSB investigated two hard landings by American
planes in 1997 and 1998 which resulted in substantial damage to the
tails of the airplanes. One incident occrred in St. Johns, Antigua,
the other in La Paz, Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   Several aviation sources also expressed concern that relations
between American's management and the pilots union for the carrier,
Allied Pilots Association, have reached a nadir with the costly
sickout earlier this year by the pilots group, protesting two-tier
wages and that should be a part of any investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bradley incident, which occurred in November 1995, the
NTSB found that crew members failed to ask for an updated altimeter
pressure reading even though they knew that weather was changing,
which would necessitate an updated reading.
</P>
<P>
   In the DC-10 case, the pilot overruled his first officer and
decided to land in a wind-whipped rainstorm. The plane skidded off
the runway and caught fire. More than 30 passengers were injured.

CASE AGAINST REGGIE LEWIS DOCTOR ENDS IN MISTRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a torturous, inconclusive end to a
highly-controversial trial, a judge Thursday declared a mistrial in
the Reggie Lewis medical malpractice case after jurors twice said
they could not agree on whether Lewis's chief cardiologist, Dr.
Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., was negligent in treating the heart condition
that killed the 27-year-old Celtics star six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the jury could not reach a verdict on Mudge, it did clear
two consulting physicians, Peter L. Friedman and Mark. A. Creager,
of malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly seven weeks of a trial that saw the clash of
institutions and cultures that define Boston -- professional sports
and preeminent medicine -- the indefinite conclusion means that it
is not over, at least for Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be back to do it again,'' vowed attorney Robert G.
Harley, who represented Lewis's widow, Donna Harris-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the front row of the courtroom's spectator gallery,
where he sat each day since the trial began in early May, Mudge
showed no reaction as the jury announced for the second time that
it was deadlocked on the claims against him and Suffolk Superior
Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith declared a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   But after the jury was dismissed, Mudge smiled broadly and was
quickly surrounded by family members and friends, including several
of his patients, who offered congratulatory hugs and handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   Commended by one well-wisher, a beaming Mudge replied that, ``I
don't know what we've won, but . . .'' his voice trailing off as he
continued shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly absent from the courtroom was Harris-Lewis, who was
in the courtroom earlier but left before the verdict to return home
to her two children. Friends and relatives, including her brother
and Lewis's mother, Inez Ritch, were emotionless during the judge's
announcement, and then left the courtroom rapidly and silently.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis, who canceled plans to hold a post-trial press
conference, was said to be ``devastated'' by the outcome. In a
written statement, she said, ``No lies, no rumors, and no gossip
about my Reggie can ever change the good and kind and caring person
he was.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15 jurors, who deliberated for 38 hours over six days,
looked strained and weary as they filed into the courtroom shortly
after 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdicts were read, jurors were thanked personally by
Fremont-Smith, quickly dismissed, and ushered to a service
elevator. Once outside the courthouse, they immediately scattered,
leaving in groups of two and three. On the sidewalk, two white
female jurors who exited the building together remained
tight-lipped.
</P>
<P>
   Driving a green Saab convertible with the top down and radio
playing, Fremont-Smith -- who called the case ``a sad situation''
with ``good people on both sides'' -- also left quickly, ignoring
reporters' questions as he drove away.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering inside the courtroom, Tom Fall, whose wife, Linda, had
a heart transplant under Mudge's care seven years ago, said he

had ended.

GOVERNMENT CLEANUP AT HANFORD `NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE,' REPORT
FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite evidence that soil and ground-water
contamination at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation may be threatening
juvenile salmon and causing rashes on Native Americans fishing in
the area, the government still isn't doing enough to clean up the
contamination, according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
   Solutions to the problem are elusive, and the Department of
Energy is so wedded to conventional methods that it is failing to
take advantage of recent technological advances, according to the
report released Thursday on ground water and soil cleanup in the
nation's nuclear weapons complex.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the National Research Council warns that even
after spending billions of dollars trying to clean up the nation's
nuclear weapons facilities, the government is not making enough
progress. The National Research Council is an arm of the National
Academy of Sciences chartered by Congress to provide advice on
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked in depth at their progress, and found that it's not
what it should be,'' said Herb Ward, a Rice University engineering
professor and chairman of the committee that wrote the report.
``They find a great deal of comfort in doing cleanup the standard
way, which is not very effective and is very expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the Department of Energy continues to rely
on the general philosophy that when ground water or soil is
contaminated, water or soil should be pumped or excavated. But
increasingly, scientists have concluded that those methods are
often ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they stress new technologies that treat contaminants
without removing them. For example, electrical fields can be used
to extract metal and radionuclide contaminants from soil, while
steam can be used to move contaminants into recovery wells.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those technologies have been developed in the private
sector, others at the Department of Energy. But the government
bureaucracy has made it difficult to take new methods from the
laboratory and into the field, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no downside for contractors to keep doing the same
thing, and it's dangerous for them to try something innovative,
because it hasn't gone through all the appropriate hoops,'' said
Richard Johnson, another committee member and a ground-water expert
at the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology. ``The
status quo is kind of institutionalized because of the way the
system is run, and it inhibits people from trying things that might
potentially be better.''
</P>
<P>
   One positive exception may be at Hanford, where scientists have
developed a method for treating chromium-contaminated water with
chemical agents. Chromium is one of many harmful chemicals of
concern at Hanford. Hanford officials hope soon to use the
methodology on a broad scale.
</P>
<P>
   The report cites a 1995 study by Tulane and Xavier universities
that asserted that ``Native Americans have reportedly developed
rashes consistent with exposure to chromium after being in the
vicinity of contaminated seeps'' at Hanford.
</P>
<P>
   The report also warns that contamination heading for the
Columbia River from Hanford has concentrations of chromium at
levels 25 times higher than that known to damage juvenile salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some significant improvements in identifying
research and technology needs for cleanup at Hanford, but the
deployment by the contractors and the Department of Energy is way
behind the promises,'' said Gerald Pollett, executive director of
Heart of America Northwest, a watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council recommended that the Department of
Energy place a higher priority on developing and using new methods
of treating contaminated soil and ground water.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy, which commissioned the report, said it
agreed with the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view the report as part of our ongoing process to improve
our cleanup efforts, particularly with respect to protecting water
resources,'' said James Owendoff, acting assistant secretary for
environmental management at the Department of Energy. ``The
department has already begun taking steps to address the
committee's concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Owendoff said the department is increasing coordination with
other government agencies and private companies to develop new
cleanup technologies, and is pushing project managers at
contaminated sites to increase their use of new technologies.

   ZEGRA, Yugoslavia _ If the U.S. Marines who have taken over this
remote part of southeastern Kosovo came to forge peace between
Kosovo's Serbs and Albanians, the result was anything but.
</P>
<P>
   After a firefight with Marines that killed one Serb and wounded
two others on Wednesday night, Zegra, like so many other villages
across Kosovo, was gripped by a new contortion of fear, violence
and retribution on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every Serb in this small village left at noon, most of
them in a single, bedraggled column of cars, trucks and trailers,
some pulled by tractors, others by oxen or horses. As they left,
ignoring the entreaties of their Orthodox priest to stay, smoke and
flames poured from at least a dozen houses in the village.
</P>
<P>
   Slavka Ristic sat in the back seat of a beaten-up car crammed
with all her belongings that would fit. She was crying, at times
uncontrollably. The night before, her son, Mikajovic Jugoslav, had
been seriously wounded in the firefight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not safe here,'' she sobbed, as she joined at least 100
Serbs who hurriedly packed their clothes, furnishings and whatever
else they could Thursday morning and left.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the flight of Serbs from Kosovo are reports of
violence against Serb civilians. A Serb professor and two Serb
workers at the University of Pristina were found shot to death
Thursday in a classroom building. Later a Serb and an Albanian were
wounded in a gun battle when a family of Albanians returned to
Pristina to find Serbs living in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs in Zegra blamed the Albanians and even NATO for the
fires, but the timing pointed to the Serbs, whose homes began to
burn just as their owners left.
</P>
<P>
   After the Serbs left, the Albanians, some of whom had returned
to the village only Thursday morning, went from house to house,
taking whatever they could. Some said they were simply retrieving
what Serbs had stolen from them after Yugoslav forces drove them
from their homes in March. But others sought only revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Feti Ajvazi, 19, and his brother, Ali, 17, carried a dining
table down a narrow back street littered with the wreckage of the
Yugoslav crackdown and now filled once again with smoke. ``They
took all our things,'' the older brother said. ``Now it is our turn
to take all of their things.''
</P>
<P>
   Platoons from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit were out in
force Thursday, rumbling around atop armored vehicles and manning a
checkpoint on the main road into town. But they did nothing to stop
the Serbs from leaving or the Albanians from looting. One captain
said the troops would intervene if they saw wrongdoing, but it was
clear that they were not looking very hard.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Marines arrived in the sector, Zegra, a
once-pretty village split by a river, has been one of the
flashpoints their commanders expected would erupt. Before
Yugoslavia's crackdown last fall, Zegra's population was
predominantly Albanian, but there were many Serbs, too. After
NATO's bombing stopped, the Serbs here remained, even though
thousands had fled from other parts of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after the shooting on Wednesday night, the Marines'
commander, Col. Kenneth Glueck, said NATO peacekeepers were
determined to be evenhanded in their dealings with Serbs and
Albanians alike. Now only Albanians remain.
</P>
<P>
   American and NATO officials defended the Marines' action in the
firefight, saying they fired only after a crowd of Serbs who had
gathered in a small plaza separating a grocery store and a house
had fired at a Marine checkpoint roughly 100 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Gunnery Sgt. William Post, who was there, said that after the
initial bursts of fire, he and three other Marines, one of them a
translator able to speak Serb and Albanian, approached the plaza
from a river gully and spent five minutes trying to persuade the
Serbs to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, bloodied, climbed into a car, but refused to come
out. ``We told him to lay down his weapon,'' Post said. ``He told
us, in Albanian, to lay down ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The wounded Serb then went from the car to a stoop on the house
and, the sergeant said, opened fire on the translator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He leaned forward,'' he said. ``And that's when I shot him in
the head.''
</P>
<P>
   The firefight created a panic among Zegra's Serbs, all that was
needed to persuade them to flee. Mrs. Ristic was sure that her son,
Mikajovic Jugoslav, had died because the Serbs here believed that
all three Serbs struck in the battle had been killed. The truth was
that Marines ferried two by helicopter to the Army's field hospital
near Urosevac.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO spokesman, Lt. Comdr. Louis Garneau of Canada, said
Jugoslav had been struck by a bullet in the neck, but not killed.
He identified the dead man as Momcilo Zivokovic and the other man
wounded as Sasha Stojanivic.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth man was arrested, and an AK-47 rifle, a shotgun, a
grenade and several clips of ammunition were seized. Garneau said
that the Serbs' motives for attacking the heavily armed Marines
remained murky and that it was not clear whether those involved had
any affiliation with Yugoslav army or paramilitary units that the
Albanians said had terrorized the village throughout NATO's war
with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Marine officials said, however, that the checkpoint had been set
up specifically to keep a watch on the store and house, which were
suspected of being gathering places for armed Serbs. On Thursday,
as departing Serbs formed their column on a side road at the site
of the firefight, they angrily denounced the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   They accused them of siding with the Albanians and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, even though the same Marines had disarmed a
company of rebel fighters after they marched through the village a
week ago. Several said the rebels, whose presence has grown in the
town, had become increasingly provocative and intimidating. They
said it was the Kosovo Liberation Army, not the Serbs, who had
fired first on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not only running from the KLA,'' one Serb yelled,
standing near the spot where the Serb had died, his blood smeared
on a doorway and pooled in the street. ``We are running from the
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   An Orthodox priest, a young man who would give his name only as
Father Zijar, said he wanted the Serbs to stay, to try to live with
their Albanian neighbors. Zegra is one of four villages in his
parish, he said, two of them now empty of Serb parishioners. ``I'm
trying,'' he said, ``but I can't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bearded and dressed in a black frock, he nervously fingered a
keychain. ``It's terrible,'' he said, as the column began to wind
slowly through the Marine checkpoint the Serbs had fired on only
hours before.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single Albanian on Zegra's worn streets was sorry to see
the Serbs go. Aslan Zeneli, 64, returned to Zegra Thursday from
Macedonia. After the Albanians fled in late March, he said, the
Serbs burned the Albanians' houses, stole their belongings and even
took over their farmland, raising the crops for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Zeneli returned to his home to find it destroyed. All he could
find to save was a mattress and two blankets. ``You see what they
did to me,'' he said, standing in his ravaged courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   Several Albanians, like Zeneli, insisted on giving tours of the
destruction that had taken place. The health clinic had been
sacked, along with a barber shop, a cafe and several shops. Dozens
of homes were little but ashes, charred beams and broken red tiles;
the walls of one were smeared with feces. The beautiful
silver-domed mosque in Zegra's center had been desecrated, its
windows broken and its carpets piled inside and torched.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians said that at least 10 Albanians, and possibly as
many as 20, had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, the Serbs can't stay here, because of all the things they
did in the village,'' said Sabri Idrizi, 49, who said two of his
uncles and an aunt were killed the day Serb paramilitary forces
arrived on March 29. ``They were thinking the Albanians would not
come back, but we came back.''

NHL ENJOYING SHOT OF REVENE FROM EXPANSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The National Hockey League is growing, again, and it
is all about business. Even Ted Turner wants a piece of the action
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Sports Inc. owns the latest addition to the NHL, the
Atlanta Thrashers, which will select some of its players in the
league's expansion draft Friday, beginning at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   For a league that not long ago was largely a regional
enterprise, desperate for more of the national exposure and money
that accrues to the NFL, the NBA, and Major League Baseball, the
current robust period of expansion should help grow important
sources of revenue, especially the value of crucial television
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sport whose footprint wasn't as strong as the other
sports leagues from a competitive standpoint, both for television
and from advertising,'' NHL commissioner Gary B. Bettman said in an
interview this week. ``In the early 1990s, we were only in 11 US
markets. It's not the millennium yet, and we got to 20 markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial implications are clear. The NFL's television
contract is worth $17.6 billion. The NHL's new agreement with ABC
and ESPN is worth $600 million. And even that marks significant
improvement in the 1990s. Expansion also has increased the
involvement of content-starved media companies in the ownership of
franchises, including Turner and Disney Sports Enterprises Inc.,
the owner of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   By 2000, the NHL will have grown by nearly half in the 1990s,
from 21 to 30 teams _ 24 in the US and six in Canada. The Nashville
Predators began play last year, the Thrashers will open in the new
Philips Arena in October, and the Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue
Jackets will begin play in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This expansion, we believe, will make the league stronger, a
more vibrant factor in the entertainment sports marketplace,''
Bettman said.
</P>
<P>
   But expansion has inherent risks, observers say. While Bettman,
who was once the deputy to NBA commissioner David Stern, continues
to receive high marks from observers for increasing the value of
the franchises and the league, the NHL is contending with some
major management and financial issues.
</P>
<P>
   Will more franchises mean a decline in the quality of play as
the talent pool is diluted? Will the increased demand for
top-of-the-line players exacerbate the salary inflation that some
owners feel has already reached crisis proportions?
</P>
<P>
   Why is the league trying to reestablish itself in Atlanta and
Minneapolis-St. Paul, where franchises have failed before? And how
successful can the NHL be if economic issues continue to block any
expansion in Canada, the sport's homeland, where the game is
revered?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's no doubt that it is key that the NHL expands
to potential major markets like Atlanta,'' said Bob Williams, who
compares the market for different sports as he links athletes with
advertisers for the Burns Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago.
``But I think you have to walk a fine line, in some areas,
especially on the issue of diluting talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bettman needs to avoid that, because the NHL is not nearly as
stable financially as, say, the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman says that adding three teams in four years is not too
much, too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the expansion franchises is very strong in terms of
the three most important criteria, namely ownership, market, and
arena,'' he said. ``Each of the three franchises starts with in
excess of 12,000 season tickets sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bettman asserts that European players will continue
to reinforce the talent pool. And the National Hockey League
Players Association has agreed to reduce rosters by one player,
from 24 to 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a league of our size, (the additional) jobs isn't that
significant,'' Bettman said. ``Now, 20 percent of our players come
from outside of North America, and they are some of the most highly
skilled and talented players in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But expansion means an increased demand for prime talent in the
NHL, which is bound to drive salaries higher. Salaries already have
increased markedly in the 1990s, from an annual average of about
$470,000 per player in 1992-93 to $1.3 million in the past season,
according to league and union sources.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins president Harry Sinden revealed last December that,
leaguewide, the NHL is paying 72 percent of its revenue to players.
When the NBA owners asserted that the players were gobbling up 57
percent of the league's revenue, they locked them out and canceled
much of the current season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is the expansion teams traditionally have the lowest
payrolls,'' Bettman said.
</P>
<P>
   But that logic seems easy to refute, when it comes to the demand
for star players. Harvey Schiller, president of the Thrashers, said
the emphasis in Atlanta will be on winning, and when he was asked
recently about the team's marketing strategy, Schiller told
reporters, ``Sign Pavel Bure.'' It was an obvious reference to the
Florida Panthers signing the flashy, Russian-born winger last
season, and experiencing an immediate spike in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   As for concerns about returning to two towns where the NHL has
previously failed, Bettman and others assert that the previous
failures had much more to do with the circumstances of the owners
than the acceptance of hockey in either town. Both the Atlanta
Flames, who left the South after seven seasons for Calgary in 1980,
and the Minnesota North Stars, who left Minneapolis for Dallas
after 26 seasons in 1993, developed a strong fan base. And while
the corporate community in Atlanta never quite poured money into
supporting the team, the city is a much different town now, almost
doubled in population, with a substantial influx of northerners who
will look forward to watching a little hockey in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta has now emerged as one of the truly dynamic cities in
terms of population growth, the economy, and it's a great sports
town,'' Bettman said. ``In addition to which, the Flames did very
well actually. They were regularly outdrawing the basketball team
the last time around. The move really had more to do with ownership
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing can be said with respect to the Stars,'' he
said. ``Norm Green had a number of issues, and the team wound up
moving to Dallas I think in part because of building problems, in
part because of ownership problems. But Minnesota is probably one
of the greatest hockey markets in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman and others say that Columbus has been an overlooked
market for major sports franchises, too, and it is ripe for a team,
with a population of 1.4 million and a substantial number of
corporate headquarters. Still, Columbus is the slowest of the three
new teams to reach the NHL minimum of 12,000 season tickets sold.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, none of the expansion teams is destined for Canada,
where higher tax rates leave owners paying 300 to 400 percent more
than their counterparts in the United States. And the national and
provincial governments, as well as taxpayers, are far less
interested in financing new arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Some Canadian politicians and observers predict that as many as
three of the six Canadian franchises may soon move to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a competitive bid for an expansion team from any
of the Canadian markets,'' Bettman said. ``Hamilton had put in an
application, but it did not have an ownership group.''
</P>
<P>
   But overall many observers think that Bettman's expansion plans
make sense _ as long as the talent holds out.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli fighter planes bombarded Lebanon on Thursday
night while Shiite Muslim guerrillas fired rockets into northern
Israel, reportedly leaving two Israelis and six Lebanese dead by
early Friday morning in a severe step-up in the conflict in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   It was a back and forth of retaliatory attacks, which began on
Thursday afternoon when Shiite Muslim guerrillas from the
Hezbollah, or Party of God, showered northern Israel with Katyusha
rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Israel then let loose a furious aerial assault on power
stations, guerrilla strongholds and bridges in Lebanon, causing a
blackout in Beirut, killing five and wounding 38 people, according
to The Associated Press in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   And, just after 11 p.m., Party of God guerrillas resumed fire on
northern Israel, where most residents were huddled in shelters. Two
Israeli civilians died and a third was severely wounded; they were
the first civilian deaths in northern Israel related to the Lebanon
conflict since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is stepping up at an intensely delicate moment,
days after Syrian Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak and President
Hafez al-Assad, who controls much of Lebanon, made public
declarations of their mutual intentions to reopen peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, the decision to bomb was made by the
departing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. He continues to run
the country one month after his election defeat on May 17 while
Barak assembles a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the bombing began, television reporters asserted
that while Netanyahu had authorized the attack, Barak had been
informed. But the prime minister-elect's office was quick to
respond that he was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a part of the decision-making process in this
matter,'' Barak's office said in a statement broadcast on Channel
One television.
</P>
<P>
   Barak promised during the campaign to end Israel's longstanding
military presence in southern Lebanon. Toward that end, he is eager
to kick-start the negotiations with Syria, and public compliments
he exchanged with Assad this week, through the press, signaled the
beginning of the thaw.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden intensification of the conflict is a reminder of
just how volatile the border remains, and how difficult it will be
to extricate Israeli troops from what has become a chronic
low-level war zone.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli troops have occupied a 9-mile-deep border zone in
southern Lebanon since 1985 to protect its northern towns from
attack by the Iran-backed Hezbollah. But the steady loss of from 25
to 30 Israeli soldiers a year has made its engagement there very
unpopular here.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening attack on northern Israel on Thursday afternoon,
four Israeli civilians and one soldier were lightly wounded by
Katyusha rockets and mortar bombs, which struck the border town of
Qiryat Shemona and the western Galilee town of Shlomi.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah said it was avenging a recent spate of civilian deaths
in southern Lebanon. According to a Web site of a
Hezbollah-affiliated television station, the initial attack was
provoked on Thursday by what it said had been the death of Saada
Mansour, a 45-year-old woman, in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah said Mrs. Mansour was killed by shrapnel when mortar
rounds struck her house, which was apparently caught in the
crossfire between guerrilla fighters and the Israeli-backed South
Lebanese army troops.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``In reprisal for the targeting of peaceful southern villages,
the Islamic resistance today shelled the Israeli settlements in
occupied northern Palestine with appropriate weapons,'' the
guerrillas' statement on their Web site said. ``In defense of our
civilians, our artillery reinforcement unit (ARU) bombarded with
Katyushas the settlements of Qiryat Shemona and Shlomi at 16:20 and
17:40 this afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli army statement on Thursday said that Israel had
``displayed much restraint'' after recent attacks by Hezbollah, but
that ``today's grave incident'' could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The strongly worded statement went on to threaten not only the
Hezbollah, ``but those backing them and standing behind them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Speaking on Israeli radio on Thursday evening, Shaul Mofaz, the
army chief of staff, said political leaders had denied two recent
army requests to retaliate in Lebanon. Radio reports said the chief
of staff had shuttled back and forth between the departing and new
prime ministers, neither of whom wanted to make the decision to
take action.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut on Thursday night, high-rise apartment buildings, many
of which are stocked with generators, gleamed in the darkened city.
At first, the Lebanese capital barely stopped in its busy Thursday
night routines. Cars clogged the streets; loudspeakers called
Muslims to prayer; and the restaurants were hopping as the weekend
began.
</P>
<P>
   By late night, though, the effects of the bombing began to be
felt _ and broadcast on television. Israelis struck a power station
on the outskirts of Beirut, three bridges south of Beirut, what
they called ``terrorist targets'' south of the Litani River, in an
area of Lebanon firmly under Syrian control, and a power substation
in the Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in northern Israel, reports of the two
civilians killed _ and one severely wounded _ began making their
way through the bomb shelters that have become like second home to
the residents.

SPURS' HOPES SEVEN FEET HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over there. Yes. That's Tim Duncan. He's the young
7-footer who has brought an old shot back to the NBA. He's the king
of subtle technique, too. He'll use it when he's taking the bank
shot, a shot no one has seen consistently since Elvin Hayes used it
in the 1970s. He'll also use that technique _ as he showed Thursday
_ when he wants to crack on that ugly hat you're wearing.
</P>
<P>
   And over there. Yes. That's David Robinson. He's the veteran
7-footer who went to Hawaii in May 1997 and quickly got a vision.
The vision was simple. It was of a college kid named Tim joining
the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long you want help,'' David said Thursday. ``Help!
Help! Send somebody down here to help me . . .''
</P>
<P>
   He began to laugh when he said that. His '97 vision was correct.
Help has arrived. Because of that, an NBA championship in '99 is
only 48 minutes away. Tim wouldn't be in this position without
David; David wouldn't be here without Tim. It is so obvious that a
few people at Madison Square Garden couldn't separate the two
7-footers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim,'' someone said to David. They caught themselves. ``Oh,
I'm sorry. David.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look like Tim at all,'' David replied. He smiled.
Later, as he answered questions about the Spurs' 3-1 series lead
over the Knicks in the NBA Finals, there was a questioner who
called him ``Tim'' again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim?'' he said. ``I'm David.''
</P>
<P>
   ``David,'' the questioner replied, ``I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a name, that's OK,'' David said.
</P>
<P>
   More laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Yes. That's 23-year-old Tim. That's 33-year-old David. And David
is right: sometimes it's just a name. The Knicks know that after
Wednesday night, when David had 14 points, 17 rebounds, and 4
blocked shots. Tim contributed 28 points, 18 rebounds, and 3
blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Missed shot? Tim or David has the rebound. Blocked shot? David
or Tim. A Knick wants to drive the lane? Watch out for Tim; watch
out for David; watch out . . .
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Tim, will be the MVP of the Finals if the Spurs win
Game 5  &UR; tonight &LR; . He'll also be officially annointed as the best
player in the league. The other, David, will finally silence the
people who have called him soft throughout his career. He will
silence those who have said his interests are too diverse to be a
basketball champion. No one will have anything silly to say as long
as these two are together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get this done,'' said the man named Tim, wearing
his Wake Forest hat backward. ``We don't want to give them any
life. We're really focused on what we have to do. And that's a
horrible hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Pow. No one was expecting that. The man Tim was talking to was
wearing a Duke hat. Duke is Wake's rival. Many people have called
Tim boring, but he notices everything, even a hat with the tiniest
Duke logo on it.
</P>
<P>
   That's Tim. He overwhelms you with observation and fundamentals.
He is a great rebounder not because he jumps better than everyone
else; he simply has better extension of his arms and gets better
position than everyone. He was on his way to being an Olympic
swimmer, a 400-meter freestyle champion, because his technique was
so good. His best shot is rooted more in mathematics than
acrobatics. He loves using the backboard because it's easier. He
likes the angles.
</P>
<P>
   David likes talking about Tim:
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got Tim, I knew Tim was a great player, but I didn't
know how good his basic skills were. I knew a little about his
attitude; he seemed to have a great attitude. I was very excited
(when the Spurs got him). I remember where I was. I was in Hawaii,
actually, and I remember the day of the draft lottery, when we
found out we got the first pick. And, I don't know, just something
about it, I knew it was going to happen. I told my wife and a bunch
of people. I didn't watch the lottery, but a bunch of people came
to me and said, ``Hey, you guys got the No. 1 pick.' I just felt
like I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   That's David. When you ask him a question, he embraces it. You
can ask him a four-word question and he'll respond with a 45-word
answer. He smiles a lot. He's got a musical voice, something that
doesn't surprise you when you know that he's a musical man (he
plays the piano). He and Tim both know about the water. Tim because
of his swimming; David because he attended Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Tim likes talking about David:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's been given enough credit by anyone for what
he's done for us. He's been the glue that kept our team together,
the person that really stepped up and made things happen both
defensively and offensively. Although his numbers aren't _ just
because they're not what they were a couple years back, he's doing
so much more for this team . . . He's just been everything to us.''
</P>
<P>
   You want stories? They could tell you stories. Both were No. 1
draft picks, 10 years apart. No one is saying test scores indicate
intelligence, but David aced his SATs. No one is saying being alert
in the classroom indicates intelligence, but Tim skipped the third
grade. David can be musical; Tim can be whimsical (one day he
decided to collect knives; he also owns a few Samurai swords).
</P>
<P>
   While in college, critics said Tim was soft. During an interview
once with the San Antonio Express-News, he was asked about that.
This is what he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want me to be mean? I can be mean. I'm leaving (the
interview) . . .''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't leave. But he made his point. Some rough guys off the
court can't play. Some nice guys off the court can be ferocious on
it. There's nothing complicated about that.
</P>
<P>
   Over there. Yes. The Larry O'Brien Trophy. They give that to NBA
champions. If two 7-footers do their normal work, they could be
holding that trophy  &UR; tonight &LR; .

NHL ENJOYING SHOT OF REVENE FROM EXPANSION

<P>
   BOSTON -- The National Hockey League is growing, again, and it
is all about business. Even Ted Turner wants a piece of the action
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Sports Inc. owns the latest addition to the NHL, the
Atlanta Thrashers, which will select some of its players in the
league's expansion draft Friday, beginning at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   For a league that not long ago was largely a regional
enterprise, desperate for more of the national exposure and money
that accrues to the NFL, the NBA, and Major League Baseball, the
current robust period of expansion should help grow important
sources of revenue, especially the value of crucial television
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sport whose footprint wasn't as strong as the other
sports leagues from a competitive standpoint, both for television
and from advertising,'' NHL commissioner Gary B. Bettman said in an
interview this week. ``In the early 1990s, we were only in 11 US
markets. It's not the millennium yet, and we got to 20 markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial implications are clear. The NFL's television
contract is worth $17.6 billion. The NHL's new agreement with ABC
and ESPN is worth $600 million. And even that marks significant
improvement in the 1990s. Expansion also has increased the
involvement of content-starved media companies in the ownership of
franchises, including Turner and Disney Sports Enterprises Inc.,
the owner of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   By 2000, the NHL will have grown by nearly half in the 1990s,
from 21 to 30 teams _ 24 in the US and six in Canada. The Nashville
Predators began play last year, the Thrashers will open in the new
Philips Arena in October, and the Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue
Jackets will begin play in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This expansion, we believe, will make the league stronger, a
more vibrant factor in the entertainment sports marketplace,''
Bettman said.
</P>
<P>
   But expansion has inherent risks, observers say. While Bettman,
who was once the deputy to NBA commissioner David Stern, continues
to receive high marks from observers for increasing the value of
the franchises and the league, the NHL is contending with some
major management and financial issues.
</P>
<P>
   Will more franchises mean a decline in the quality of play as
the talent pool is diluted? Will the increased demand for
top-of-the-line players exacerbate the salary inflation that some
owners feel has already reached crisis proportions?
</P>
<P>
   Why is the league trying to reestablish itself in Atlanta and
Minneapolis-St. Paul, where franchises have failed before? And how
successful can the NHL be if economic issues continue to block any
expansion in Canada, the sport's homeland, where the game is
revered?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's no doubt that it is key that the NHL expands
to potential major markets like Atlanta,'' said Bob Williams, who
compares the market for different sports as he links athletes with
advertisers for the Burns Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago.
``But I think you have to walk a fine line, in some areas,
especially on the issue of diluting talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bettman needs to avoid that, because the NHL is not nearly as
stable financially as, say, the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman says that adding three teams in four years is not too
much, too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the expansion franchises is very strong in terms of
the three most important criteria, namely ownership, market, and
arena,'' he said. ``Each of the three franchises starts with in
excess of 12,000 season tickets sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bettman asserts that European players will continue
to reinforce the talent pool. And the National Hockey League
Players Association has agreed to reduce rosters by one player,
from 24 to 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a league of our size, (the additional) jobs isn't that
significant,'' Bettman said. ``Now, 20 percent of our players come
from outside of North America, and they are some of the most highly
skilled and talented players in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But expansion means an increased demand for prime talent in the
NHL, which is bound to drive salaries higher. Salaries already have
increased markedly in the 1990s, from an annual average of about
$470,000 per player in 1992-93 to $1.3 million in the past season,
according to league and union sources.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins president Harry Sinden revealed last December that,
leaguewide, the NHL is paying 72 percent of its revenue to players.
When the NBA owners asserted that the players were gobbling up 57
percent of the league's revenue, they locked them out and canceled
much of the current season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is the expansion teams traditionally have the lowest
payrolls,'' Bettman said.
</P>
<P>
   But that logic seems easy to refute, when it comes to the demand
for star players. Harvey Schiller, president of the Thrashers, said
the emphasis in Atlanta will be on winning, and when he was asked
recently about the team's marketing strategy, Schiller told
reporters, ``Sign Pavel Bure.'' It was an obvious reference to the
Florida Panthers signing the flashy, Russian-born winger last
season, and experiencing an immediate spike in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   As for concerns about returning to two towns where the NHL has
previously failed, Bettman and others assert that the previous
failures had much more to do with the circumstances of the owners
than the acceptance of hockey in either town. Both the Atlanta
Flames, who left the South after seven seasons for Calgary in 1980,
and the Minnesota North Stars, who left Minneapolis for Dallas
after 26 seasons in 1993, developed a strong fan base. And while
the corporate community in Atlanta never quite poured money into
supporting the team, the city is a much different town now, almost
doubled in population, with a substantial influx of northerners who
will look forward to watching a little hockey in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta has now emerged as one of the truly dynamic cities in
terms of population growth, the economy, and it's a great sports
town,'' Bettman said. ``In addition to which, the Flames did very
well actually. They were regularly outdrawing the basketball team
the last time around. The move really had more to do with ownership
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing can be said with respect to the Stars,'' he
said. ``Norm Green had a number of issues, and the team wound up
moving to Dallas I think in part because of building problems, in
part because of ownership problems. But Minnesota is probably one
of the greatest hockey markets in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman and others say that Columbus has been an overlooked
market for major sports franchises, too, and it is ripe for a team,
with a population of 1.4 million and a substantial number of
corporate headquarters. Still, Columbus is the slowest of the three
new teams to reach the NHL minimum of 12,000 season tickets sold.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, none of the expansion teams is destined for Canada,
where higher tax rates leave owners paying 300 to 400 percent more
than their counterparts in the United States. And the national and
provincial governments, as well as taxpayers, are far less
interested in financing new arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Some Canadian politicians and observers predict that as many as
three of the six Canadian franchises may soon move to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a competitive bid for an expansion team from any
of the Canadian markets,'' Bettman said. ``Hamilton had put in an
application, but it did not have an ownership group.''
</P>
<P>
   But overall many observers think that Bettman's expansion plans
make sense _ as long as the talent holds out.

 &HT;    Anonymous testing for HIV decreasing, CDC report says
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Over just two years, the number of anonymous tests
taken to determine HIV infection has dropped sharply, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the option of anonymous testing must continue to be offered,
the agency added, because it is the only type of testing that some
groups at risk will use, and because new AIDS treatments make early
testing critical to successful treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In its weekly report on disease in the United States, the CDC
said the number of anonymous HIV tests taken from 1995 to 1997
declined 26.6 percent, from 636,069 to 466,560. In contrast, the
number of tests in which the patient's name was known to the
health-care provider but kept confidential rose 2.9 percent, from
1,394,921 to 1,434,709. The data comes from the CDC's National
Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention and covers the more than 2
million federally funded tests administered annually. Those tests,
which do not include tests given during blood donation, represent
about 15 percent of the HIV tests given in the U.S. each year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, white and Asian men who have sex with other men were
more likely to use anonymous testing, which is available in 39
states including Georgia. Women, black men and men who inject drugs
were more likely to use confidential testing, which might be
offered in a community clinic, drug treatment center or prison, as
well as in a center devoted to HIV testing.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy might indicate that those receiving confidential
services were tested in the course of other health care, or were
not tested until they showed symptoms. But because the groups using
the two types of tests are so disparate, all types of testing
should continue to be offered, the CDC said.

SOME DOCTORS SEE RELIEF IN PLAN FOR AMA UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (This story was eliminated earlier and has now been restored.)  
(lh) 
 By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ The weekly managers' meetings at the Family
Physicians Group, a private practice here, almost always include a
lot of angry discussion about the increasing frustrations of
dealing with health maintenance organizations and other
managed-care insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   But at this morning's meeting, the anger was tempered by hope,
said Dr. Charles J. Woodall, the group's medical director, in light
of the American Medical Association's decision on Wednesday to form
a union for doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long been hamstrung ``by managed-care regulations
that require needless procedures and don't cover useful
procedures,'' Woodall said. ``So I am quite pleased that the AMA
has taken it upon themselves to bring these problems to the
forefront.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the doctors in his group could join an AMA union because
they do not work for health maintenance organizations or hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But Woodall said the AMA move signaled a push by doctors across
the country to address growing feelings of helplessness in the face
of managed-care restrictions on services doctors are permitted to
provide, and the accompanying paperwork the companies require for
simple procedures. In the past five years, he said, his group of 15
doctors has hired 42 employees who deal solely with the paperwork
required by managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Woodall said of the AMA's decision, ``It's a start, and the fact
that the AMA, a credible national organization, has stepped in
shows that these are far-reaching problems which don't just affect
doctors in larger cities and larger states, but now affect doctors
in places like Memphis and rural Tennessee and Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Levine, 59, an internist at Massachusetts General Hospital
in Boston also supported the AMA decision. ``We're fighting to
control the control that the insurance companies have over us,'' he
said, ``We really do need some representation, or it's going to be
the MBA types who are telling us how to practice medicine.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But not all doctors interviewed Thursday agreed that a union
would solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the unions are the prescription,'' said E.
William Rosenberg, 69, a Memphis dermatologist and professor of
medicine University of Tennessee medical school. ``I don't think
the unions are the illness either. I think they're a symptom of the
changing economics of medical care. And while I'm not opposed to
them, I don't think they are the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Needleman, an assistant professor of economics and health
policy at the Harvard School of Public Health also questioned
unionization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the unionization push as a first-cut response to a very
real set of problems for the profession in terms of economic
power,'' Needleman said. ``It just doesn't feel to me like it will
be ultimately the response that prevails.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In California, where doctors' unions have long been in place,
Charles Goodman, 40, a pediatrician in private practice in the Los
Angeles suburb of West Hills, joined the Union of American
Physicians and Dentists, a 6,000-member division of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, about one and
a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a good idea for me and a direct help for many of
my patients as well,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   As with roughly two-thirds of the 620,000 practicing physicians
in the nation, the AMA union will not be able to bargain on
Goodman's behalf because he is in private practice and bargaining
for him would violate antitrust laws. But he said his union has
helped him and his patients in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have a problem with an HMO, I can ask a union to step up
to bat for me,'' he said. ``When the union calls, the HMOs take it
a little more seriously. It gives you more clout than if you were
alone against these enormous multibillion-dollar companies.''
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-year resident in at the University of Tennessee Medical
Center in Memphis, Cindy Woodall would qualify for membership in an
AMA union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am learning to be a doctor in this world of managed care,
and it has kind of burst my bubble to see how it works against the
patients,'' Dr. Woodall said. ``So if a union could address that
and help us provide better care for our patients, then I would
definitely want to join.''

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ For 70 years, Hippodrome Hatters has sold handmade
hats to fashion-conscious shoppers from a small store on North
Eutaw Street on this city's West Side. Lou Boulmetis, who took over
the business from his grandfather, has seen this area, once the
center of Baltimore's retail trade, suffer through a long decline:
the departure of old-line department stores, a rise in crime and
the erosion of once-glorious retail facades.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the so-called revival that has Boulmetis worried. His
shop is in a building built in 1810 that is now scheduled for
demolition in a sweeping city program to remake the shopworn
18-block retail district, whose patrons are now mostly
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The project could displace more than 100 small businesses, many
of them owned by African- or Korean-Americans, as roughly 100
properties are condemned and leveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,'' said Boulmetis, 47, a
scrappy, bantamweight hat maker with no patience for
``yuppification,'' as many opponents derisively refer to the
sprucing-up of urban neighborhoods to appeal to wealthy, young,
mainly white professionals. ``We've been here through everything,
and now they want to remake the place for the educated class on the
backs of the people who are already here.''
</P>
<P>
   The planned $350 million redevelopment of the West Side includes
2,000 new housing units, splashy retail stores, renovation of a
theater and new parking structures, reflecting the growing
confidence among investors in the economic health of city centers.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood revival plans are usually catnip to local business
people, and in cities across the country merchants have organized
business improvement districts to improve neighborhoods and attract
new shoppers and investment.
</P>
<P>
   But for many people, projects like Baltimore's that call for
sweeping demolition harken frighteningly back to the huge
redevelopment projects of the 1950s and '60s, and threaten to
destroy everything they are meant to revive: the unique fabric and
traditions of neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, including Baltimore's West Side, redevelopment
also threatens to obliterate a historic part of the city's
architectural heritage: as many as 100 retail and office buildings,
some dating to World War I or earlier.
</P>
<P>
   This has made the planned demolition a cause celebre with
preservationist groups like Baltimore Heritage and the National
Trust for Historic Preservation, which earlier this month named the
West Side one of the nation's 11 most endangered places. (Baltimore
has also drawn criticism recently for its sweeping demolition of
row houses, a staple of the city's working-class neighborhoods.)
</P>
<P>
   In some city neighborhoods, preserving architecture has mattered
less than fighting off the numbing sameness that increasingly
characterizes urban retail districts. Storied places like Old Town
in Pasadena, Calif., Harvard Square in Cambridge, Mass., and
Chelsea _ among others _ in New York City are in some ways becoming
victims of their own success as they attract wealthier urbanites
and the national specialty chains that cater to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be a place no one heard of, and if they did, they
never would want to move to,'' said Robert Trentlyon, a longtime
Chelsea resident and the former publisher of a neighborhood
newspaper, The Chelsea Clinton News. ``Then we got discovered about
10 years ago'' and rents and land values soared, he said, with
federal-era town houses that sold for $10,000 in the 1950's now
fetching $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, one of New York's more eclectic shopping
districts, with antique shops, thrift stores and local restaurants,
is being transformed into yet another homogenized urban
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Old Town Pasadena has already arrived where Chelsea seems to be
headed, and where many on the West Side of Baltimore fear to go.
When Old Town was first redeveloped in the early 1980s, it
attracted adventurous independent merchants while the larger chains
stayed on the sidelines. But as the area caught on, attracting an
increasingly prosperous customer base, the national chains poured
in.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rising rents and landlords' preference for financially secure
corporate tenants have all but driven out the small and unique
shops, according to one of Old Town's original redevelopers, Joseph
Paggi. ``The guys who came in originally, the independents, end up
losing economically,'' said Paggi, now chief operating officer of
Center Trust, a real estate investment firm in Manhattan Beach,
Calif. ``The change to the Crate and Barrels and Barnes &AMP; Nobles
puts everything into the stratosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Paggi says Old Town's evolution leads him to think that
successful urban shopping districts are destined to be
``pasteurized'' sooner or later. ``We'll have a Banana Republic on
every corner and a Starbucks right next to them,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   To officials leading the redevelopment of Baltimore's West Side,
that's no bad thing, and may even be indispensable. M.J. Brodie,
president of the quasi-public Baltimore Development Corp., says new
investment is needed in areas like the West Side to attract
middle-income shoppers and residents back into the urban core. To
save some old buildings, he said, there may be a need to replace
others with new structures like parking garages.
</P>
<P>
   Brodie's efforts are strongly backed by Baltimore's political
elite, many of whom are African-American, including the outgoing
mayor, Kurt L. Schmoke, and a majority on the city council. (Peter
Angelos, a powerful real estate developer who owns the Baltimore
Orioles, is also on board, as are Nationsbank and the Weinberg
Foundation, which owns large chunks of West Side real estate.)
</P>
<P>
   Brodie chafes at claims by Boulmetis and other local merchants
that the project's real goal is to replace the area's mainly black
shoppers with a more ``upscale'' population drawn from young
professionals and the University of Maryland campus nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you try to improve something, there's a trade-off,''
Brodie said. ``We want to create a success story that includes all
kind of people, working class, African-American, WASPs.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodie, who led the recent redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue
in Washington, says that demolishing old buildings and relocating
tenants is a price worth paying to revive the area.
</P>
<P>
   But many West Side merchants say the price he is willing to pay
is their destruction. To fight the project, they have enlisted
William Donald Schaefer, who was mayor of Baltimore from 1971 to
1987 and remains one of the city's most respected political
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer has said he favored improving the West Side using more
imagination and less of a ``bulldozer mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   With his support, and a threatened lawsuit, Boulmetis and other
West Side merchants still hope to stave off the wrecker's ball.
``This area evolved because it serves the market,'' Boulmetis said.
``Let it evolve. Not everything has to be the same, like any
suburban mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a matter of pretty buildings,'' he continued.
``It's our livelihood.''

FEDERAL OFFICIALS INVESTIGATING CLUSTER OF ACCIDENTS BY AMERICAN
AIRLINES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Honduras, Colombia)   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal safety officials said Thursday that they planned to
investigate why American Airlines, the country's second-largest
airline, has had more accidents in the last six years than any
other major domestic carrier. The announcement comes in the
aftermath of the crash of an American jet in Little Rock, Ark.,
earlier this month that killed 10 passengers and a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that it would
join with American over the next few weeks to examine all aspects
of its flight operations to determine what, if anything, the
incidents have in common and whether some action is necessary to
improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, American jets have been involved in six accidents,
two of them accounting for 171 deaths. The other accidents damaged
airplanes but did not seriously injure anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The latest accident occurred last week when a Boeing 757 jet hit
an airport fence while landing in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. The fence
shredded a tire and punched holes in the airplane's fuselage, but
none of the 190 passengers were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to determine whether there are some patterns
between the Little Rock accident and other recent accidents in the
American system to see if there is something we need to do,'' said
Paul Turk, a spokesman for the aviation agency.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday that it
might also review American's accidents as part of its investigation
of the crash in Arkansas of Flight 1420, a McDonnell Douglas Super
80 jet, which skidded off the runway while trying to land in a
severe thunderstorm at Little Rock's airport on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Baker, American's executive vice president in charge
of operations, defended the airline's safety record, saying that
American went 15 years, from 1980 to 1995, without a fatal
accident. The 1995 crash, which is American's most serious so far,
occurred when a Boeing 757 crashed into a mountain near Cali,
Colombia, killing 160.
</P>
<P>
   Baker acknowledged that the recent accidents may form a pattern
and said that American was beginning its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appear to be some similarities in the history of
accidents and incidents over the past six years,'' he said, ``and
our commitment to safety requires our vigilance in maintaining
industry-leading training and operating procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   American has long been known for having one of the most
aggressive management teams in the airline industry. Like many
other airlines, it has had its share of difficulties with the labor
unions representing its workers. In recent years, its relations
with its pilots have been particularly strained, leading to a
``sick-out'' by pilots in February that forced American to cancel
more than half its flights.
</P>
<P>
   Some American pilots point to a corporate culture at the airline
that they say values profits over safety as perhaps one reason for
the recent crashes. They say that American managers intimidate
pilots who force the cancellation of flights for safety reasons and
have skimped on pilot training to save money.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots are particularly critical of American's failure to
comply with federal rules requiring that pilots have at least eight
hours of rest in the 24 hours before they complete their flight
duty.
</P>
<P>
   The two pilots in the cockpit of Flight 1420 had been working
more than 13 hours when they tried to land in Little Rock.
Investigators are looking at whether fatigue may have clouded their
judgment or pushed them to try the landing rather than divert to
another airport merely to bring a quick end to a long day.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chiames, an American spokesman, said that American did not
compromise on safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day we go out and sell our product, which is safe
transportation,'' Chiames said. ``There is nothing in our interest
to call into question our commitment to safety.''

 &HT;    Top form for Smoltz until eighth
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Smoltz continued to distance himself from a 22-1
loss to Baltimore on June 13 and prove his elbow is well enough by
blowing past the Expos for seven innings Thursday. A couple
mistakes in the eighth cost him a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on top of his game,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``He was
that good today.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz continued to use a more over-the-top fastball, mixed in
an occasional slider and felt comfortable, he said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back RBI triples cost Smoltz a 1-0 lead in the eighth
inning. Vladimir Guerrero, the Expos' leading run producer (51
RBIs), didn't start because of a strained groin, but he looked fine
rounding the bases on a pinch-hit triple off Smoltz. Another triple
by Manny Martinez and the Expos had a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made one bad pitch, a hanging slider to (Chris) Widger,''
said Smoltz, who allowed Widger a double to lead off the inning.
``Guerrero is just Guerrero. ... This is an aggressive hitting
team, a lot of young guys who want to hit the ball. I mixed in some
good pitches and went right after them.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon to have MRI on knee
</P>
<P>
   Randall Simon will have an MRI today on his left knee, which he
injured last week sliding into home plate at the Astrodome. Simon
has been playing on it, but hasn't seen much improvement. ``The
doctor said there may be some stretched ligaments,'' he said. ``I'm
still feeling some pain for almost a week already. They want to
know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher's box
</P>
<P>
   Umpire Bob Davidson confronted the Braves on the size of their
catcher's box following Wednesday's game and had head groundskeeper
Ed Mangan draw up a new, smaller one for the game Thursday. The box
is supposed to be 43 inches wide. But catcher Eddie Perez said
Thursday's plate umpire, Mark Wegner, didn't make any special
effort to enforce it. ``He didn't really care,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   The catcher's box has been a source of debate this season as
some umpires have enforced the rule that a catcher must stay within
the box, to help them call a more narrow strike zone.

 &HT;    Thumbs up to Jimmy Spencer
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jimmy Spencer put the disappointment of a mediocre
season behind his struggling No. 23 Ford team at Pocono Raceway in
Long Pond, Pa., where he briefly led last week's Pocono 500 with
less than 20 laps remaining. Spencer, of Berwick, Pa., charged up
the hometown crowd when he passed Jeff Gordon on lap 172. ``My
spotter said, `You ought to see this crowd. They're going crazy,'''
Spencer said. ``I couldn't believe it. I said to myself, `There are
only 15 laps to go, and we're leading this race.''' It must have
been too good to be true, however, as Spencer's Ford hit some oil
on the track a few laps later and he slipped to finish 14th.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs down
</P>
<P>
   To NASCAR's wacky points system. Two-time defending Winston Cup
champion Gordon has put together an impressive run with three
runner-up finishes in a row. Yet, he made up only five points on
leader Dale Jarrett, who still holds a 349-point advantage over
Gordon. Jarrett's finishes in the last three events were sixth,
first and third. Last week at Pocono, both Gordon and Jarrett
scored 175 points. How's that for suspense?
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people expected Jeremy Mayfield to be a championship
contender this season after getting his first career victory and
finishing seventh in points last year. However, seven finishes of
17th or worse kept Mayfield out of the top 10 in points during the
first four months of this season. Mayfield, 30, of Owensboro, Ky.,
finally showed some consistency with three top-10s in the last four
races. His ninth-place effort in last week's Pocono 500, which he
led late, moved Mayfield to ninth in points, 560 behind leader
Jarrett. Since replacing fired crew chief Paul Andrews before The
Winston all-star race in Concord, N.C., on May 22, Peter Sospenzo
has an average finish of 10th with Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not?
</P>
<P>
   Less than three months ago, Rusty Wallace was coming off a
victory at Bristol and was eighth in points, trailing then-leader
Jeff Burton by only 173. Since then, however, Wallace has only
three top-10 finishes in eight events. Now he's 11th in points, 591
behind Jarrett. Wallace has three finishes of 12th or worse in the
last four races, including a 43rd at Pocono last week. In that
race, a blown tire sent Wallace into the wall after only seven
laps. It was his worst finish in a year.

 &HT;    A season up in smoke
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jimmy Spencer has watched his NASCAR season literally
go up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Spencer, 42, of Berwick, Pa., was ninth in the
points standings heading into Sears Point Raceway, the first of two
road-course events on the Winston Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   When the Winston Cup series makes its annual stop in the San
Francisco area on Sunday, however, Spencer will find himself 29th
in points, trailing leader Dale Jarrett by a whopping 1,056.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, who had eight top-10 efforts last year, is still
looking for his first top-10 with 15 of 34 races completed this
season. He didn't finish five races this season and finished 25th
or worse in eight events.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's main problem has been blown engines and his sponsor,
Winston cigarettes, says it won't be back next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we've just been getting down on ourselves,'' said
Spencer, one of the series' most popular drivers because of his
outspoken personality and aggressive driving style. ``We're really
pounding harder on each other than we really need to. And we're
wanting to do the best we can. Maybe we're putting too much
pressure on ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed Spencer was ready to turn the corner last year, his
10th season in NASCAR's highest series. He had four top-seven
finishes in the first nine races of the year and stayed in the top
10 in points for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's season came unraveled on Aug. 1, however, when he
wrecked at the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He
suffered a concussion in the wreck and missed races at Michigan and
Bristol, Tenn. He returned for the final 11 events and finished
14th in points.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer seemed poised for even greater success this year after
owner Travis Carter added a second team and veteran driver Darrell
Waltrip. But this season was a nightmare from the start, as Spencer
finished 20th or worse in four of the first five races.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it only got worse:
</P>
<P>
   _ A week after his car caught on fire in practice at Darlington,
S.C., Spencer wrecked his No. 23 Ford late in the Primestar 500 at
Texas Motor Speedway on March 28 and finished 28th. Spencer
suffered bruised ribs and used a relief driver, Steve Grissom, the
next week at Bristol. Spencer was pulled from the car midway
through the race after complaining of breathing problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ After finishing 36th at California and 29th at Richmond,
Spencer suffered perhaps his worst embarrassment May 22. He failed
to qualify for The Winston, NASCAR's annual all-star race, which is
sponsored by his primary sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   _ A week after The Winston, Spencer was the first driver behind
the wall for repairs during the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor
Speedway in Concord, N.C. His crew needed five laps to repair a
broken radiator and he finished 38th.
</P>
<P>
   _ At Michigan Speedway two weeks ago, Spencer was the only
driver not to finish the race. His engine blew up after 159 laps in
the 200-lap event.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. announced that its Winston
brand would not renew its contract with Travis Carter Enterprises
after this season, ending a six-year partnership.
</P>
<P>
   While Carter searches for another sponsor for his primary car,
Spencer, who is in the final year of his contract, remains quiet
about his future with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a lot of people will feed the press some rumors
just to see how far it will go, for no apparent reason,'' said
Spencer, who finished a season-best 14th at Pocono last week.
``I've not talked to any car owners about next year, including
Travis. I don't think it would be unfair to say I want to be with
Travis next year. But next year is a long ways away, in my mind,
and we can wait down the road to think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter also seems uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not spoken about next year,'' Carter said. ``I don't
know if he's ready to say he wants to stay. I don't know if I'm
ready to ask him to stay. We want to see if the team can get up and
run good with him again.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The absent star made a final appearance in the
Microsoft antitrust trial Thursday when a government lawyer
introduced as evidence a comment by Bill Gates, Microsoft's
chairman, that knocked the legs from under his legal team's most
important defensive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Gates has not appeared as a witness at his company's trial.
Nonetheless, he has exerted tremendous influence on the proceedings
_ most often in a manner that helped the government make its case.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six months, Microsoft's legal team has mounted a
concerted campaign to demonstrate that America Online, through its
purchase of Netscape Communications Corp., was in a position to
mount a strong challenge to Microsoft's dominance of personal
computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, on the last day of testimony, the lead government
attorney, David Boies, introduced a document that seemed to explode
that argument in a single stroke by showing that Gates did not
really believe it. It was an internal Microsoft memo titled
Microsoft Competitive Reviews, dated Dec. 15, 1998 _ about three
weeks after the AOL-Netscape deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The document includes notes that an unnamed Microsoft employee
took as Gates offered his views on the competitive threat posed by
the deal. One note quoted him as saying: ``AOL doesn't have it in
their genes to attack us in the platform space.'' In the industry,
operating systems are known as ``platforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure by Boies was the most important piece of evidence
introduced on the final day. After court had adjourned, Boies stood
on the courthouse steps with Joel Klein, the assistant attorney
general who heads the antitrust division, and expressed broad
satisfaction with the case they have presented.
</P>
<P>
   It showed that Microsoft ``intimidated, threatened, attempted to
preclude,'' Klein said. ``You name it, they did it. This is a
serious, serious competitive problem that merits a serious
solution.'' Microsoft lawyers did not comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom earlier, the Microsoft witness on the stand,
Richard L. Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan School of Management at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, dismissed Gates' comment
as barely relevant. ``Gates' judgment is entitled to some weight,''
he said, ``but he hasn't seen the documents I have seen'' _ the
internal America Online documents that Microsoft subpoenaed early
this year.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Boies to ask him if he was ever willing to
consider facts that did not support his position, to which
Schmalensee replied, ``Mr. Boies, I don't know if that is a blanket
challenge to my ethics, or how to interpret that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Boies showed him a contract between Microsoft and
Symantec, which makes utility software. It stipulated among other
things that if the company used a certain Internet protocol in its
product, ``Internet Explorer must be set as the default browser.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's campaign to force other companies to favor Internet
Explorer is at the center of the government's case. And with the
contract on display, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson asked the
witness a question that sounded as if it should have come from the
mouth of a government lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   He asked whether ``any of these conditions are, in your opinion,
anti-competitive.'' Schmalensee said he could not answer. So the
judge asked, ``Assuming Microsoft is a monopoly, are they
anti-competitive?'' Once again Schmalensee said he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   As the day drew toward its close, Boies introduced several
academic papers by Schmalensee over the years that held opinions
contradicting statements he had made in court. Schmalensee said his
views had evolved.
</P>
<P>
   But Boies' cross-examination seemed to peter out. That was not
so for Michael Lacovara, Microsoft's lawyer. Re-examining his own
witness, he offered as evidence a news article showing that a small
company was about to begin selling an inexpensive product that
allows Internet access without Microsoft software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has been trying to make the case that America Online
planned to offer such a product, nicknamed the AOL PC, that would
pose a competitive threat. America Online executives have denied
that.
</P>
<P>
   But Lacovara offered as evidence a news article that he said had
been issued just two hours earlier stating that America Online was
in negotiations to buy the company and use its product as the basis
for an AOL PC.

REALITY CHECK FOR JONES, DAVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ As Rosie Jones made the turn in Thursday's
opening round of the LPGA Championship at DuPont CC at 6-under-par
30, then went to 7 under on her 10th hole, thoughts of 59 danced
through her head. ``Sure,'' she said, ``and then everything stops.
I don't care who you are, you cannot stop thinking about it. I
don't think it stopped me, I just didn't have a good visual on a
couple of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   As Laura Davies, who along with Jones started on the back nine,
also made the turn to the front side at 30, she, too, had thoughts
of 59. ``People talk about the Hall of Fame,'' said Davies, ``but
my ultimate goal is to shoot a 59. It'll happen some day. No
question about it. Players have gotten too good and the courses are
not that long.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones and Davies both returned to reality. Jones, who nearly
won the US Women's Open at Salem CC in 1984 and still is searching
for her first major title, had a bogey on No. 5 and finished
34-30_64. Davies played it out with nine straight pars and ended up
one shot astern at 35-30_65 on a hard, firm course.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions were ideal for scoring and 48 of the field of 144
broke par 71. The grouping at 67 included Allison Finney, Jenny
Lidback, Liselotte Neumann, Alison Nicholas, Trish Johnson, and
Vicki Fergon. Se Ri Pak, who was the wire-to-wire leader last year
as she won the first of two major championships, was in a group of
nine at 68.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who has nine career tour wins, made a regulation par on
her first hole, then went on a birdie rampage. She birdied her
second (wedge, 20 feet), third (9-iron, 12 feet), fourth (wedge, 4
feet), fifth (wedge, 6 feet), eighth (6-iron, 15 feet), and 10th
(7-iron, 15 feet).
</P>
<P>
   She bogeyed her 14th hole when she drifted into the left bunker.
After picking up a final birdie on her 17th (6-iron, 25 feet), she
thought she had made the putt on her closing hole for a 63, but a
12-foot try rimmed out.
</P>
<P>
   Is this her best round over the course? ``I don't think it
counts because we've been here in May and that's not fair for me,''
Jones said. ``It's a whole different tournament. I knew coming into
the week we were going to be wearing shorts and not pants and rain
gear and mittens. It's always so wet. The greens were hard in the
afternoon. I'm not a bad mudder. It just needs to be warm for me
and I'm playing real well right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies, who has always had great length but has struggled with
her putter over the past few years, has regained the touch that
made her one of the top players in the LPGA. ``I'm really
disappointed,'' she said after missing six birdie putts of 15 feet
or less over her last nine holes. ``I'm disappointed I didn't do
better. Having said that, 65 is my best round in an LPGA
Championship. I admit I was a bit frustrated, but it's good because
that means you're playing very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   After starting on the 10th tee, she registered birdies on 10
(8-iron, 4 feet), the par-5 11th (two putts, 25 feet), and 14
(wedge, 25 feet). She eagled the par-5 17th (4-iron, 30 feet, two
putts) and just missed a 20-foot putt for a 29 on 18. ``I honestly
thought I was going to hole the putt,'' she said. ``Just at the end
it caught the lip. As it turned out, it pretty much stopped the
round.''
</P>
<P>
   Neumann, who was paired with Davies and ageless JoAnne Carner,
thought she might see a 59. ``She played so well,'' said Neumann.
``She could have had a 59. I couldn't believe how many putts just
didn't drop for her. It was very, very impressive. She was so
solid. She hit some great shots off the tee and great shots on the
green. It's tough to play with her when she's bombing them out
there so far. You have to stick to your game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak put together a round of five birdies and two bogeys. ``The
course was actually playing longer than it was last year.'' she
said. ``I had a very good driver today, and that's why it didn't
play hard. It's a very good golf course, conditions are perfect,
and I'm set.''

NABISCO BAKERY CRUMBLES AFTER 50 YEARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NELSON ANTOSH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Nabisco plans to close its 50-year-old cookie and
cracker bakery in Houston later this year, putting 425 hourly and
salaried employees out of work.
</P>
<P>
   The last day for the sprawling plant near downtown will be Nov.
20, company officials from the headquarters in Parsippany, N.J.,
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a phased shutdown, the first group of 140 employees will be
laid off Aug. 27, according to John L. Butler, senior vice
president of human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1949, when the plant was built, the smells of baking have
perfumed the area just south of downtown Houston. The combination
bakery and distribution center is in a 63,000-square-foot building
sitting on 20 acres. The area of the bakery where dough is mixed is
four stories tall.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the plant makes Ritz crackers, Air Crisps Cheese
Nips, Nabisco Graham crackers and Chewy Chips Ahoy chocolate chip
cookies. In the past, it also made Saltines.
</P>
<P>
   The bakery is being closed because the company's baking capacity
exceeds its needs, said spokesman Henry Sandbach. Industrywide, the
growth in demand for cookies and crackers is very slow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is one of the oldest bakeries in the system, the
Houston plant has been under-used, Nabisco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to close our Houston bakery was very difficult,''
said Thomas G. McBrady, Nabisco's vice president for operations.
</P>
<P>
   The bakery's current output will be handled by the company's
remaining nine bakeries in the United States, said Butler. The
plants nearest to Houston are in Atlanta and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Employees were concerned that the work might go to Mexico or to
a nonunionized plant, but that will not be the case, Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   After the plant is closed, Nabisco will have about 1,000
employees in Texas at sales offices and warehouse locations. The
number to remain in Houston was not available.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco is restructuring to try to cut costs, said Sandbach.
Last November, it closed a plant in Pittsburgh, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook appeared good in the spring of 1998, when Nabisco
announced plans to add an Oreo line to the Houston plant and
upgrade the facility, spending $40 million to $45 million while
getting a tax abatement.
</P>
<P>
   The Oreo line was never built, however, and the tax abatement
was never applied for, said Sandbach. Another plant handled the
Oreos that were to have been baked here.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston bakery survived a major scaling back in the summer
of 1996, said an official with the local Bakery, Confectionery,
Tobacco Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
   The closing makes no sense because the bakery is profitable,
said the union official, who preferred not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's recent profits have declined, with
first-quarter earnings off 18 percent as Nabisco spent heavily on
promotions to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   In April, it reported profits from operations totaling $45
million, compared with $55 million a year earlier. Last year, Chief
Executive Officer James Kilts said he would increase advertising
and promotion on major products to regain sales lost to Keebler
Foods.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst said the tactic was working because Nabisco's market
share went up for nine consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco is the nation's largest maker of cookies and crackers,
with more than twice the market share of any other company, Butler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco will negotiate severance benefits with the four unions
represented at the plant, Butler said. It will offer salaried
employees a package of severance pay, benefits and career-planning
services.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing the plant-closing Thursday morning, Nabisco
sent the employees home. The facility won't start baking again
until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, real estate professionals from the company will meet
with the Partnership to discuss possibilities for the site, which
Nabisco wants to sell. It could be used for manufacturing, for
warehousing or cleared for the land, Butler said.

STATE SENATOR HAS THE WRIGHT STUFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cathie Wright hands her legislative assistant a
piece of paper that has the words green beans and milk written on
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Why are you giving me a shopping list?' '' Lee Angela
Reid remembers asking her boss, the Republican state senator from
Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Wright responds, ``No, the other side'' and proceeds to tell
Reid how a woman approached her in the supermarket with a problem.
Wright wrote it down on the back of her shopping list.
</P>
<P>
   It was this kind of personal approach that caused Wright to help
save four Cal State Northridge men's sports two years ago. Cynics
might say Wright swooped into the CSUN debate for political reasons
_ she convinced a Legislative conference committee to approve a
one-time bailout of $586,000 from a system-wide general support
fund _ but she has steadfastly stayed on the case, working to
promote Senate Bill 338, which would require institutions to give
public notice if they plan to cut sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't jump on any issue when it makes headlines,'' Wright
said from her Sacramento office. ``I go with legislation that I
feel is important.''
</P>
<P>
   A sports fan, Wright believes in this cause and expects the bill
to pass. And this is what makes her a good legislator, said Sen.
Teresa Hughes, D-Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   ``She cares about her district,'' Hughes said. ``That's what
makes a good legislator: She passes a law because it's the right
thing to do. It crosses party lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, 70 and a grandmother, developed her stance after having
been on the other side of what's fair.
</P>
<P>
   _Upon graduation from Old Forge High in Scranton, Pa., Wright
was selected valedictorian yet didn't receive the $500 scholarship
that often went with the honor because a classmate's mother was the
organization's president.
</P>
<P>
   _As a 20-year-old junior college graduate, Wright earned a
purple seal on her diploma for her 95 percent average. That also
entitled her to be placed in a high-paying job that the school
helped her find, but the department in the accounting firm she was
to head said she was too young.
</P>
<P>
   _She went to workfor an air conditioning and heating company in
Lacrosse, Wis., and regularly worked 14-hour days in the hopes of
earning promotions. One day, the company told her she would train
the next manager.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 19 years in the Legislature, Wright's been standing
up for that elusive ideal of fairness. That's why she won't talk to
someone who is rude to a member of her staff. That's why she reads
all the mail first.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the hallway say, `Look, there goes Team Wright,'''
Reid said. ``When she has an issue, she won't let go.''
</P>
<P>
   When Northridge decided to cut baseball, soccer, volleyball and
swimming after the 1997 season, Wright found herself inundated with
calls and letters from her constituents.
</P>
<P>
   So she dove in, investigating university documents and finding
the money to keep the programs afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Wright also frequently checked on the Task Force on
Intercollegiate Athletics to make sure it was finding answers. When
she wasn't satisfied, Wright threatened an audit of Northridge, and
opposition toward the $586,000 stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Cathie Wright, I'm not sure how this would've played
out,'' said activist Duke Russell, who helped draft Senate Bill
338. ``Without that money, there might not be baseball now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright's sport of choice is basketball (she played the sport in
high school and attended various levels of games six nights a
week), but she shares with Russell a longstanding recognition of
the importance of athletics to a person's development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do anything when it affects people's lives without
knowing I can do it,'' she said. ``The point is fairness.''

directly linked to the person I am,'' says Jennifer Lopez, whose
debut album, ``On the Six,'' draws on her Bronx upbringing. The
record presents a polished urban mix of Latin, rhythm-and-blues and
soul-tinged ballads and dance numbers, with most of the songs in
English but a few in Spanish, like a salsa-flavored duet with her
fellow Nuyorican singer Marc Anthony. (Jeffery A. Salter/New York

GANNETT OFFERS $1.5 BILLION FOR NEWSQUEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After more than a decade in which foreign investors, from Robert
Maxwell to Conrad Black, bought newspapers in the United States,
the Gannett Co. reversed the trend Thursday, offering about $1.5
billion in cash plus assumed debt for Newsquest PLC, a regional
newspaper publisher in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Newsquest is the company that emerged after the investment firm
of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. put up the first portion of what
would eventually be an investment of 100 million pounds, or $168
million in British publishing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the company hired Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. to examine its
financial options, and has entertained a variety of bids. According
to Scott Stuart, a partner in Kohlberg Kravis, Gannett's offer was
the highest.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement issued by Gannett said that, because the
company's management and its two largest shareholders had accepted
its offer, 51.7 percent of the outstanding stock is pledged to
Gannett _ a majority stake that makes the success of their bid
highly probable.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett's other foreign venture is the overseas edition of USA
Today, which is printed in London, Frankfurt and Hong Kong and
distributed in 60 countries. In a prepared statement Thursday,
Douglas H. McCorkindale, vice chairman and president of Gannett,
said, ``This acquisition is the right opportunity to expand our
international operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven N. Barlow, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston,
said Thursday that Gannett's investment in overseas newspapers ``is
unusual, but if anyone could do it, it would be'' Gannett. With a
market capitalization of $19.75 billion, ``they have the financial
wherewithal to make a large acquisition,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   With 74 newspapers and 21 television stations in the United
States, ``they cover a lot of geography in the United States,'' and
it is more likely that a large acquisition could run afoul of
regulatory requirements, like the Federal Communications Commission
rule against owning both a newspaper and a television station in
the same market.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Barlow said, U.S. newspaper companies have had
little inclination to invest abroad because ``there have been
enough opportunities in the United States.'' When it comes to
foreign newspaper investments, Barlow added, American companies
have often shied away because ``there has been trepidation about
trying to manage a far-flung empire.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Broadwater, a managing director of Veronis Suhler &AMP;
Associates Inc., a company that has handled several newspaper
acquisitions, said the Gannett-Newsquest deal made sense in part
because the two companies' businesses are similar. He also pointed
out that ``The way the British media marketplace as developed over
the years,'' regional newspapers ``are very attractive businesses,
particularly for financial investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Since about two-thirds of the slightly less than 1,500 dailies
in the United States are owned by chains, Gannett's options for
large investment in this country are becoming rare, Broadwater
added. But given its size, he said, Gannett could well afford to
make the Newsquest purchase and, should it choose to, also invest
in a property like The San Francisco Chronicle, which is currently
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkindale told a meeting of investors and financial analysts
earlier this week that Gannett's 1998 cash flow was $1.75 billion,
and that it anticipated a cash flow of $1.89 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gannett's offer, Newsquest shareholders would receive 460
pence ($7.31) in cash for each of 200.4 million fully diluted
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, coupled with earlier sales of parts of its Newsquest
holdings, would give Kohlberg Kravis a cumulative return of 400
million pounds on their initial investment for a profit of 300
million pounds (or $504 million), Stuart said.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett stock closed at $70.6875 Thursday, down $2.75, or 3.7
percent. Newsquest's stock, trading on the London Stock Exchange,
closed at 455 pence, up 32 pence, or 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart of Kohlberg Kravis said that the current management team
at Newsquest would mesh well with Gannett's managers. He added that
``The regional newspaper industry in the U.K. is a terrific
business. It is the dominant form of local news and advertising for
the local communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 11 dailies that would come under Gannett's ownership
are The Evening Argus, based in Brighton, on Britain's southern
coast, and The Northern Echo, which covers northeastern Britain
from the town of Darlington. The Northern Echo was also the first
newspaper edited by Harry Evans, now the editorial director of The
Daily News in New York, U.S. News &AMP; World Report and The Atlantic
Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who in the late 1970s sought American investors when he
was trying to prevent Rupert Murdoch from taking over the
London-based Sunday Times, said that back then ``American newspaper
owners had a terror of the British newspaper unions.'' But since
Murdoch's battles with the unions sapped the unions' power, Evans
said, this fear has evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are a good group of papers,'' Evans added. ``It's good
for them to stay in a newspaper family, instead of being in some
international conglomerate.''

HIGH COURT ENDS TERM SHARPLY DIVIDED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, in its just-completed term,
reflected a sharp ideological split among the justices, including
conservative rulings that expanded state authority and liberal
decisions that broadened federal rights to protect schoolgirls.
</P>
<P>
   The court's slim five-member conservative majority asserted
itself in many other opinions, such as those that protected
employers in discrimination suits. It also rejected the appeals of
death-row inmates and gave police greater authority to search
passengers during traffic stops. But the high court's four-member
liberal minority also enjoyed significant victories, picking up
needed conservative support to limit the power that cities can give
their police officers in the fight against gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the enigmatic term, Steven Shapiro of the American
Civil Liberties Union said the justices have created confusion as
to the future of individual rights, citing the court's apparently
contradictory rulings in favor of states' rights and against
expansive police powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their long-term impact on civil rights and civil liberties is
uncertain but troubling,'' said Shapiro, ACLU's national legal
director, referring to the states' rights decisions. But ``the
court's record on more traditional civil rights cases was probably
better than expected,'' he said. Shapiro is a frequent critic of
the conservative-led judicial body.
</P>
<P>
   During the term, 5-4 decisions proved plentiful, with the same
justices often forming the majority or being relegated to the
minority.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative majority consisted of Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Sandra Day
O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy. Forming the minority were liberal
Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the ideological divide became apparent this
year as justices on both sides often took the deeply symbolic step
of reading their dissenting opinions from the bench. Justices
reserve this public gesture for themselves only when they have the
deepest philosophical differences with the majority.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Wednesday, the court's final public day this
term, three liberal justices _ Souter, Breyer and Stevens _ read in
somber tones their vehement objections to the majority's decision
that the Constitution gives states immunity from most civil suits
in federal and state courts. The dissenters said the court's
position will deny citizens the chance to vindicate their rights
against states that have abused governmental authority.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, Kennedy last month voiced his objection to
the court's decision that the federal law banning sex
discrimination at schools also prohibits sexual harassment by a boy
against a female classmate. Kennedy assailed the court's broad
reading of Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments, adding that
it will prompt a flood of litigation in cases of mere playground
teasing.
</P>
<P>
   The just-completed term mirrored past years, with Kennedy or
O'Connor often being the deciding vote in close cases, said
University of Houston law professor David Crump.
</P>
<P>
   These two justices remain ``relatively unpredictable swing
votes'' on a generally conservative court, Crump said. ``It looks
to me as though the coalitions on the court haven't changed much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy and O'Connor factor proved critical in three major
cases this term.
</P>
<P>
   In one, Kennedy and O'Connor joined their more liberal
colleagues in ruling unconstitutional a Chicago ordinance that
allowed police to disperse people congregating on street corners
with a suspected gang member. The court called the local law vague,
saying it gave police unbridled authority to order loiterers to
separate while providing city residents with no warning of what
behavior would constitute an illegal act.
</P>
<P>
   The second case was the one involving Title IX in which O'Connor
not only joined the liberal wing but signed the majority opinion
that said school districts can be held liable for ignoring severe
sexual harassment of one student by another.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy joined the liberals and wrote the majority opinion in
the third case, in which the court held 5-4 that a judge cannot
hand down a harsher sentence against a convict simply because the
criminal remained silent during a trial's sentencing phase. The
court, over the objections of its conservatives, said the
constitutional privilege against self incrimination extends to the
post-conviction part of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   In another 5-4 decision, the court's solid, though slim,
conservative majority said doctors, lawyers, accountants and other
professionals who make house calls enjoy no constitutional
protection against unreasonable police searches while conducting
business in someone else's home. The court's decision upheld the
conviction of two Minnesota men whom a police officer saw packaging
cocaine in a colleague's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The court, on another 5-4 vote along ideological lines, rejected
the pleas of two death-row inmates _ including one from Texas _ who
argued in vain that judges had violated their rights to a fair
trial by giving confusing sentencing instructions to the juries
that called for their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas case, the majority held that the judge was under no
constitutional obligation to tell jurors that Louis Jones Jr. would
spend the rest of his life in prison even if they did not vote to
sentence him to death for the brutal murder of Air Force Pvt.
Tracie Joy McBride. In the other case, the justices told a federal
appeals court that it should not have set aside a California death
sentence ``without first determining that the (judge's) error had a
substantial and injurious effect on the jury's verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives also held sway in ruling 5-4 that employers
can avoid being assessed punitive damages in discrimination cases
if they made a good-faith effort to comply with Title VII of the
1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits job bias.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also took a hit at the hands of the
conservatives, as the court on a 5-4 vote struck down as a
violation of the federal Census Act his proposal to use a
statistical formula to complement the traditional head count of the
U.S. population in the 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   The court, in another case, ruled against automobile passengers.
Breyer joined the conservatives in a 6-3 decision that the
Constitution's prohibition on unreasonable searches does not
protect passengers from having their belongings examined by police
who suspect the driver has committed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Souter and Ginsburg joined the conservatives in
reading the Americans with Disabilities Act narrowly to hold that
job applicants making discrimination claims under the law must
first prove their physical or mental afflictions cannot be easily
alleviated.
</P>
<P>
   The court, despite its sharp ideological split, found unanimity
in ruling that the Constitution forbids police officers from
automatically searching the cars of motorists they have pulled over
for traffic violations. The justices were also in agreement that
courts should defer to the attorney general's decisions in
political-asylum cases on whether an immigrant is justifiably
trying to escape political persecution at home or merely seeking to
avoid legitimate prosecution for having committed serious
nonpolitical crimes.

 &HT;    Marcis out, mad at Brett Bodine
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Driver Dave Marcis, injured in a nasty crash in
Sunday's Pocono 500, will sit out this week's race at Sears Point
Raceway. Marcis, 58, still is complaining of a sore collarbone,
ribs and ankle and headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Marcis' No. 71 Chevrolet made contact with Brett Bodine's No. 11
Ford in the ``Tunnel Turn'' on the 2.5-mile triangle-shaped
speedway at Pocono. Marcis' car was turned into the outside wall
where it hit, first on the nose and then on the tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body's still sore, and I'm still a little upset with Brett
Bodine,'' Marcis said. ``He did the same thing to his brother
(Todd) a couple of years ago at Indy. He just flat spun me out.
Robert Pressley was right behind us. I haven't spoken to Robert,
but he told guys on my team that it was a cheap shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ended up being a pretty bad accident, and my car is just
about busted in half. The car is junk, thanks to Brett Bodine. I'm
sure he's going to send me a check for it, but I don't suppose I
should hold my breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcis, who owns his car, hired road-course specialist R.K.
Smith to drive in this week's race. Smith, 61, of Rancho Sante Fe,
Calif., drove in the 24 Hours of Daytona earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hood tethers a success
</P>
<P>
   The new hood restraint NASCAR tried on selected cars last week
at Pocono got an early test when Rusty Wallace's No. 2 Ford slammed
into the wall on lap seven. The device seemed to work.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's car blew its right front tire before going into the
wall on the first turn, smashing the right side of the car. Wallace
was not hurt, but he called it ``one of the hardest hits I've ever
had in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hood, tethered to the chassis by a support cable, didn't
appear to move or be damaged. Also using the cable were Jeff Gordon
and Pocono 500 winner Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials rushed testing of the restraints after a May 1
accident during an Indy Racing League event at Lowe's Motor
Speedway in Concord, N.C. Three spectators were killed and another
eight were injured when a wheel and other debris flew into the
grandstands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is basically for fan safety, if these things happen to
get off the car,'' Wallace's crew chief, Robin Pemberton said. ``It
shouldn't be a big hassle, not for what you get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Third team for Petree?
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet owner Andy Petree couldn't wait for U.S. Tobacco Co.
to re-sign with his No. 33 Winston Cup car before seeking out
another sponsor. So Petree, who owns the cars of drivers Ken
Schrader and Kenny Wallace, went out and landed another sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Petree said Schrader, his top driver, won't be driving the No.
33 Skoal car next season. Instead, he will drive a car with the new
sponsor, which could be Oakwood Homes, a mobile home manufacturer,
which sponsors Schrader's Busch car this year.
</P>
<P>
   Petree said he will add a third team if U.S. Tobacco Co. returns
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Praying for rain
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear shipped 2,600 rain tires to Sonoma, Calif., and Watkins
Glen, N.Y., hoping finally to test them in one of the NASCAR races
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup drivers were allotted 1,200 tires, while Busch and
Craftsman Truck drivers have 800 and 600, respectively. The tires
can be used only on road courses.

   ATLANTA _ Go figure the Braves' 3-2 win over Montreal on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   How can John Smoltz dominate for seven innings, get a
season-high nine strikeouts and be trailing 2-1? And how does
Ugueth Urbina, one of the game's best closers, give up flares to
Otis Nixon and Keith Lockhart and blow his first save in a month?
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who've been stranding runners with regularity, left
another 10 in scoring position. But with two out in the ninth,
catcher Chris Widger let an Urbina pitch pass under his glove and
Nixon scored from third to tie it 2-2 and force extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan, who didn't expect to play because of a sore wrist,
drove in the game-winning run with a single in the 11th. But the
Braves aren't going to try to explain it, prefering to ride it into
a weekend series with the Mets, who won again Thursday to remain
three games back in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just happy to get out of here with a win,'' manager Bobby Cox
said. ``A good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz took a no-decision after allowing five hits in eight
innings, three of them in the eighth. He gave up two runs on
back-to-back two-out triples by a pinch-hitting Vladimir Guerrero
and Martinez. That set up more late-inning drama by the Braves, now
7-3 in extra inning games this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie Guillen led off the 11th with his third hit of the game,
then stole second as Chipper Jones swung and missed on a
hit-and-run try and Chris Widger's throw to second sailed wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get on base,'' Guillen said. ``Luckily I got
to second base. Then when they walked Chipper, we had a chance to
bring up best RBI man on the team, maybe baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was just glad to get through the game, and through the
Expos, who left with one win in three tries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate playing against teams like this,'' said Jordan, who was
2-for-5 and got his 58th RBI. ``Those guys have nothing to lose.
They go out there and they fight and scrap and they give everybody
trouble. I don't think any team in the league likes to see the
Expos come to town.

 &HT;    Robinson on verge of a title
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Robinson has been most valuable player of the
NBA, the league's best rookie, the defensive player of the year and
a scoring champion. He has made the All-NBA team and the
all-defensive team.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years in the league, though, and Robinson has not won a
title. When he went down with a bad back after six games in
1996-97, it appeared he could be one of those players who had
always missed the ring, who always would have a hole in his resume.
</P>
<P>
   His teams had a history of stumbling in the West, failing
against Utah, losing a conference final to Houston. The window was
closing, and the Admiral was standing on the outside. No matter
what happened to the Spurs, the perception was that Robinson lacked
something, not because there was a deficiency at shooting guard or
small forward or because the bench was thin or the coach
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before Michael Jordan started winning regularly, the
fault seemed to lie with the other Bulls players. The same was true
with Oscar Robertson in Cincinnati and Jerry West in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for Robinson. Yet, he accepted his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of that has been because I take that
responsibility on,'' Robinson said Thursday. ``And justified or
not, I think, as a leader, the results do lie in your lap. It's how
it is in this business, how it is in every aspect of your life. You
dictate the character of the team. You dictate the personality of
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   His wait probably will end tonight in Madison Square Garden, or
Sunday or Wednesday in San Antonio, when the Spurs get rid of the
pesky New York Knicks and crown themselves champions of this
bizarre season.
</P>
<P>
   And Robinson, leaning heavily on his young pal Tim Duncan, will
have reached the pinnacle a dozen years after the Spurs picked him,
knowing that they would have to wait two seasons for the Annapolis
graduate to finish his Navy tour.
</P>
<P>
   Among the perceptions of Robinson is that he's too nice a guy to
steer a title team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice when people see that I can have the personality that
I have and still be a champion,'' he said. ``That's a nice feeling
(because) it hurts when they question your ability to get things
done, say some things about me that I knew weren't true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the most competitive people I know. And when people
question your desire to be out there on the floor, that bothers
you. So, it just gave me a little bit more fuel to keep coming at
it, keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and Duncan have dominated the under-sized Knicks.
Combined, they are averaging 43.5 points, 27.1 rebounds and 5.5
blocks a game in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wear you down,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   And with no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to see them doing what they're doing,'' said Avery
Johnson, their point guard. ``To see Tim, a young guy, playing at
this level, and David finally getting his due really makes me feel
good. But that's what playoff basketball is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, waived twice by the Spurs in the early days of his
career, says this postseason world is a mix of ``pain and pleasure
_ pain when you lose, pleasure when you win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember sitting in the visitors locker room in Houston
(after losing Game Six of the West final 1995), and they announced
that tickets for the NBA Finals will go on sale tomorrow. That's
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs figure they've had enough pain. They are 14-2 in the
playoffs, and they don't want this thing to linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really going to be focused in,'' Robinson said. ``That's
what we talked about today. Getting better. Do better stuff than
you did in the last game. Get better. Win.''

 &HT;    Europeans not foreign to the NHL
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Wayne Gretzky played his final game two months
ago, it seemed appropriate that the game's deciding goal was not
scored by Brantford, Ontario's famous son, nor anybody else from
the northern provinces. Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr, a native of
Kladno, in the Czech Republic, sent Gretzky into retirement with a
loss. And with his winning goal, Jagr might have punctuated the
European overthrow of the ``National'' Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Gretzky implied that Jagr was the man to take
over as hockey's premier ambassador. If the Penguins' star needs
support, he can always turn to other NHL transplants. The game's
best goalie, Dominik Hasek, also is from the Czech Republic and the
best all-around forward, Colorado's Peter Forsberg, is from Sweden,
as is the best defenseman, Detroit's Nicklas Lidstrom. The three
MVP candidates this year are Czech, Czech and Russian _ Hasek, Jagr
and Alexei Yashin.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for the trend to end any time soon. Although North
Americans will continue to dominate in numbers, Saturday's NHL
entry draft is further evidence that foreign ingredients make up
the league's upper crust. The projected first four picks are
forwards Patrik Stefan and Pavel Brendl of the Czech Republic and
twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin of Sweden. It follows the Czechs'
defeat of Russia in the final of last year's winter OIympics, not
the U.S.-Canada showdown the NHL had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the apocalypse,'' said Brian Burke, Vancouver general
manager and former NHL vice president. ``This is still a strong
North American draft after the first few players. But I do think we
need to look at ways of changing how we develop our players. They
develop more elite players in Europe. If you look at all of our
finalists (for 1998-99 awards), it's dominated by Europeans.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's Central Scouting Service would have you believe the
power shift is not that extreme, but its rankings of players in
this draft are misleading. The scouting service issues two sets of
quarterly rankings: North American players and European players.
But the ``North American'' designation pertains to the player's
team in the amateurs _ not where he was born, lived for most of his
life and learned the game.
</P>
<P>
   The two best examples are the players who are listed 1-2 in the
North American rankings. Stefan is a native of Prague and Brendl of
Olomouc. But Stefan played this year with the IHL's Long Beach Ice
Dogs and Brendl with Calgary of the Western Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the top 10 ``North Americans'' in those rankings are
from Europe: Stefan; Brendl; No. 5 Denis Shvidki (Ukraine), who
played for Barrie of the Ontario Hockey League; No. 9 Branislav
Mezei (Slovakia), who played for Belleville of the OHL; and No. 10
Oleg Saprykin (Russia), who played for Seattle in the Western
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Hockey News' projected first round in
Saturday's draft, the first four players, six of the top nine and
14 of the first 28 are Europeans. But in total numbers, the actual
country breakdown still favored Canadians: Canada 11, Russia 5,
Czech Republic 4, United States 3, Sweden 2, Ukraine 1, Finland 1,
Slovakia 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question the more skilled players are coming out of
Europe,'' Los Angeles general manager Dave Taylor said. ``Players
there spend more time practicing and play fewer games, so they have
more of a chance to develop their skills. Over here, our focus is
on winning. When you look at teams with character and players with
the will to win, you see North Americans. But the top skill-level
players are coming from over there. We're producing some, but
they're producing more.'' Taylor said the Kings recently bought
into a team in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Moose Jaw forward Jamie Lundmark, the draft's top-rated player
who really is from North America, said he thinks that this year is
an aberration. ``I don't think it's anything to worry about,''
Lundmark said. ``We've dominated them for a long time. Maybe it's
their time for a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefan said he thinks the influx of such Czech stars as Hasek
and Jagr might have helped the NHL become more of a focus for
youths in his country. ``The Olympic games maybe helped a little,''
he said. ``The Czech team won the gold medal, and people around the
world see that Czech players are not so bad. But I think it's just
a good year for European players.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers general manager Don Waddell probably will take several
Europeans in the draft, including some older players in the later
rounds who never have signed with NHL teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe these things go in cycles, with all the top
players this year being from Europe,'' Waddell said. ``But if you
look around the league, with guys like (Anaheim's Teemu) Selanne
(of Finland) and Jagr, you can see where the highly skilled guys
are coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   And where they are going.

 &HT;    Thrashers set to make trades, history
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If the rumpled clothes, the half-eaten room-service
lunch, the player rosters spread over desks and the several mock
drafts taped to walls on the 33rd floor of a Boston hotel suite
don't indicate a certain lack of stability going into the
Thrashers' expansion draft today, maybe this will:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 17 trades on the table,'' general manager Don Waddell
said.
</P>
<P>
   They might as well be 17 dominoes, because any trades Waddell
cements before the draft will affect his selections. He doubts that
he will top the eight trades announced by Nashville general manager
David Poile after the Predators' expansion draft last year, but
Waddell said, ``We could make four or five for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this frenzied pace of trade talks and meetings with
other GMs has been about what he expected, Waddell said,
``Crazier.''
</P>
<P>
   The only certainty about the Thrashers' 26 picks today, starting
at 3 p.m., is that they will be largely devoid of goal-scorers. The
NHL mandates that Atlanta selects at least three goalies, eight
defensemen and 13 forwards, plus two free picks to use as they
like. Further complicating the selection process is that the
Thrashers can select only six restricted and/or unrestricted free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Finding 13 forwards hasn't been easy, but the allotment of
talented unprotected defensemen ``is a lot stronger than we
expected,'' Waddell said. ``There's not only good defensemen, but
they're young.''
</P>
<P>
   Two examples are Anaheim's Jamie Pushor and Dallas prospect Petr
Buzek. Conversely, the number of competent forwards is so low that
the Thrashers could be persuaded to claim some unprotected players
who are earning high salaries, such as Vancouver's Trent Klatt
($1.1 million) and Tampa Bay's Alexandre Daigle, the well-traveled
former first-round pick of Ottawa's ($900,000 plus incentives).
</P>
<P>
   Waddell had projected that the Thrashers' overall payroll would
be among the lowest in the league next season. But this week he
said, ``If we have to go to the well, the well's pretty deep. ...We
have enough money to buy any player on that list, and then some.
What we don't want to do is mortgage the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential deals have clouded what seemed to be certain Thrashers
selections.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit goalie Norm Maracle remains the team's most likely
backup to Damian Rhodes. But the Red Wings have stirred interest by
leaving center Igor Larionov unprotected. Atlanta doesn't have much
interest in Larionov, but several other teams do, and they might be
willing to offer enough to persuade Waddell to take him. Drafting
and trading Maracle would affect other potential draft-and-trade
deals involving Boston goalie Robbie Tallas, Carolina's Trevor Kidd
and possibly St. Louis's Jamie McLennan.
</P>
<P>
   A similar situation has developed on the Los Angeles pick. The
Thrashers long have focused on left wing Vladimir Tsyplakov. But
the Kings' exposure of tough winger Matt Johnson has caught the
attention of some general managers.
</P>
<P>
   How late will Waddell go with trade talks? ``The league allows
me to go until 3,'' he said. ``But I think I'll give myself a
self-imposed deadline of 12. For one thing, I have to spend some
time (preparing for Saturday's) amateur draft. But there are some
deals I'd really like to do. So if they don't happen by 12, I might
just wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainty, Waddell is comforted by the job he and
his scouts did this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be intimidating if we hadn't done our homework,''
he said. ``But as we went down the (protected) lists, there were
only about 10 guys we missed on. The most important thing is we had
our depth charts in place so we knew the players we were looking
at.

 &HT;    Special Olympics fanfare beginning
 &HT;    By Knight Chamberlain
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ In what is being billed as the largest peacetime
airlift, 2,000 athletes representing the United States were to
begin arriving today aboard 275 corporate jets at Raleigh-Durham
International Airport for the 10th Special Olympics World Summer
Games, being held in North Carolina beginning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The business jets, which will be landing or taking off every
three minutes for 12 hours, were donated for the occasion by 260
corporations from 40 states.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 7,000 athletes and 2,000 coaches from 150 countries
and territories have spent the week training and being entertained
in 150 communities across North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, they will begin competing at venues in Raleigh,
Durham and Chapel Hill. The Games will end July 4.
</P>
<P>
   The only hitch so far has been the mysterious disappearance of
two men associated with the Special Olympics delegation from the
Dominican Republic. A cab driver told police that he took two
Spanish-speaking men wearing purple Special Olympics T-shirts from
a Greensboro shopping mall to the Charlotte bus station. He said
they asked how to get to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainer Billy Crystal will host the opening ceremony
Saturday at Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh. Guests will include
actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, singer Stevie Wonder, rock band Sugar
Ray, North Carolina evangelist Billy Graham and Detroit Piston
basketball star Grant Hill, vice chairman of the '99 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five thousand volunteers are helping stage the Games, and
various organizations are providing special assistance to mentally
retarded athletes. Through the Special Olympics Healthy Athletes
Initiative, each athlete is being offered vision and dental
screenings.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Flame of Hope will arrive in Raleigh today in a
ceremony at the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning last Monday, 84 law enforcement officers from 26
countries escorted relays of the Special Olympic torch across North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors hope the Games will draw 400,000 spectators to watch
the athletes compete in 19 sports.
</P>
<P>
   The officers will escort the flame to Carter-Finley Stadium on
Saturday to light the cauldron during Opening Ceremonies to
officially start the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, a founding sponsor of the Special Olympics, plans to
distribute 1.6 million cans of Coca-Cola Classic in the
Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area promoting the motto of the '99
Games: ``It's All About Attitude.

 &HT;    Stars get exposure in nude calendar
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ So, all that ails track and field in this country
is a lack of exposure.
</P>
<P>
   That's been the party line for decades. Just get the sport some
regular TV coverage. Put some faces on the sport's marquee
performers. Create a buzz that extends beyond the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the latest gimmick is just that _ exposure. A year 2000
calendar featuring nude and nearly nude photos of a dozen of the
sport's leading ladies. Something every young track fan should
have, right?
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the TrackGirls 2000 calendar to go on sale here
Saturday and Sunday at the USA Track and Field Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, people have been really supportive,'' said high jumper
Amy Acuff, project coordinator and one of the calendar girls.
``It's very tasteful nudes. Very artistic and creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the models are sprinter Inger Miller, high jumper and
former Atlanta-area school teacher Tisha Waller and American pole
vault record-holder Stacy Dragila. The only defection from the
original dozen was triple jump champion Sheila Hudson, who Acuff
said ``got cold feet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a sport that gets recognition every four years (at the
Olympics), so to be able to create something like this is very
important in terms of the awareness of the athletes involved in the
sport,'' said high jumper Gwen Wentland, another calendar girl.
``It shows a lot of diversity _ ethnic diversity, event diversity.
We have throwers, sprinters, jumpers.''
</P>
<P>
   The calendar has the whatever-it-takes endorsement of the track
federation, though it has no role in its publication.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15,000 calendars have been printed. They're priced at $16,
and half of the profits are to go to the athletes and the remainder
to a community foundation founded by the late Florence Griffith
Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for liftoff
</P>
<P>
   After hyper-extending her knee almost two weeks ago, Marion
Jones returns to the long jump tonight. The 23-year-old is the
event's overwhelming favorite, though Jones relies largely on her
speed and is working to refine her jumping technique.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing she needs is a serious knee injury, eyeing five
gold medals at next summer's Olympics. Jones acknowledged Thursday
that the incident was scary enough that she can't watch a tape of
the jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the knee is not 100 percent, but it's well enough
that I can come out and win,'' she said. ``I hope I can win on the
first jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the track
</P>
<P>
   Florida freshman sensation John Capel sat out the 100 meters to
concentrate on the 200 this weekend, where the field is led by
world record-holder Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene. Capel, a
wide receiver/kick returner, had this year's world-leading time of
19.87 seconds in winning the NCAA title. ... A trio of Atlanta
residents _ Angelo Taylor, defending Olympic champion Derrick
Adkins and world record-holder Kevin Young _ advanced to the
semifinals tonight in the 400-meter hurdles. ... Other locals
advancing were: Milton Campbell, Derek Mills and Jonas Motiejunas
in the 400; and Derrick Peterson in the 800.

 &HT;    MindSpring announcement stirs speculation
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises on Thursday set off a storm of
speculation about a possible merger or acquisition, with a terse
announcement that it is holding talks aimed at forging some kind of
``business relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   After that brief statement, the company declined further
comment. But the notion that Atlanta-based MindSpring, the nation's
fourth-largest Internet service provider, might be edging close to
a high-stakes deal _ perhaps even being sold _ boosted company
stock and added to a spate of rumors already rife in Net circles.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation of a big-ticket agreement involving MindSpring
comes at a time of consolidation among Internet companies _ with
rumors of still more to come.

   Chatboards on the Net were filled with guesses: MindSpring will
be bought by BellSouth or Prodigy; it will snap up Microsoft's ISP
or merge with California-based Earthlink Networks. Meanwhile,
Earthlink was busy denying that it is about to be purchased by
Gateway Inc. A number of computer-makers are also being mentioned
as possible partners for MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   Pascal Aguirre, a principal in the Renaissance Group consulting
firm, said the rush to partner is inevitable. ``The players need to
gain scale so they can enjoy good revenue growth and reduce their
operating costs per customer. That applies to MindSpring.''
</P>
<P>
   It happens in every industry, just not as fast as it has
happened among ISPs, he said. ``The difference is less in the
nature of the expectation but (more) in the timing. You've had a
grace period. Now it's time to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring has about 1.2 million subscribers to its service. The
company last year had sales of $115 million and a $10.5 million
profit.
</P>
<P>
   Founder and Chairman Charles Brewer has set his sights on
becoming the nation's No. 2 ISP, behind 17 million-strong America
Online. Talk about a pending deal centered on the assumption that
rapid growth for MindSpring _ as well as renewed popularity among
fickle investors _ depends on a dramatic move, an agreement that
extends its marketing reach and delivers thousands of new
customers.
</P>
<P>
   That can happen in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could buy someone, get bought or buy part of a company,
the way they did with Netcom,'' said analyst Jeff Sadler of FAC
Equities. ``There are all sorts of ways to structure a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, MindSpring could buy the Net business from a
company whose specialty is something else, Sadler said. ``That is
probably what they are looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   That would mean a deal with a company whose specialty is
elsewhere _ say, AT&AMP;T or BellSouth, both of which declined comment
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring may be responding in part to the atmosphere on Wall
Street. A swarm of Net companies _ many, like eBay, Amazon.com and
Priceline, that are reporting nothing but large losses _ have
launched public offerings of stock whose value has soared hundreds
of percent.
</P>
<P>
   Prices have defied the old _ pre-Internet _ rules that linked
profitability to stock performance. While this week's dip in the
market has perhaps softened the impact some, many prices have not
returned to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Risk, not reticence, is rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, MindSpring is one of the few Net companies with a
record of profitability. But company stock slipped from a high of
$124.93 1/4 in April to below $60 earlier this month, though it has
of late rebounded with talk about a deal: It closed Thursday at
$82.12 1/2, up $3.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, MindSpring must try to maintain its
trajectory, the zoom from obscurity to national status within three
years. Previously, most of its expansion has come either on its
home turf in the Southeast or through acquisitions, like those of
Netcom's and PSI's consumer subscribers. But industry consolidation
has eliminated most easy purchase targets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, MindSpring's business is becoming more challenging,
even as those changes lure a number of companies toward the ISP
business _ and perhaps a marriage with MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is sluggishly but steadily shifting away from the
telephone dial-up Internet access on which MindSpring's business
was built. Increasingly, users will be routed to the Net via
broadband connections, high-speed wires. Those links are provided
mostly by telephone and cable companies, which will be _ or already
are _ Net providers.
</P>
<P>
   Many free services have popped up, offering Net access in trade
for consumer willingness to endure endless advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   A leveling off in sales of personal computers has spurred
manufacturers to consider providing their own Internet access. Dell
Computer's top executive Michael Dell recently confirmed his
company plans to partner with an ISP.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday came confirmation that AOL is talking to tiny,
Seattle-based Microworkz.com about putting AOL service in that
company's discount PCs. The specter of AOL as a rival for the
nation's computer business adds still more weight to the notion
that another worried computer-maker is seeking a union with
MindSpring.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On April 28, with the sun setting outside their elegant Hilton
Hotel conference suite in downtown Jackson, Miss., the key figures
in what was, on paper, a vast philanthropic and insurance empire
gathered together for the first and last time.
</P>
<P>
   Those present included two Tennesseans who managed the Franklin
American Corp., operator of a dozen insurance companies in five
states. Also attending, after a long flight from Rome, were two
elderly Catholic priests representing the charitiable foundation
which owned the Franklin company.
</P>
<P>
   The guest of honor, and the man who controlled the empire, was a
pasty 44-year-old who variously introduced himself as a genius bond
trader, a multi-millionaire and an amateur student of Catholic
theology. They knew him by different names _ Eric Stevens and David
Rosse _ but his real name was Martin R. Frankel. That day, he
appeared in person for the first time to many people in the room.
</P>
<P>
   They have not seen him since. Frankel did not show up the next
day when the group met Mississippi regulators in an attempt to
convince them that the companies' books were in order.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, court records show, Frankel wired as much as $334.6
million in insurance company money from Franklin American to
foreign bank accounts, incinerated documents in his $3 million
Greenwich mansion and fled. He left behind notes that show he was
researching which foreign countries have no extradition treaties
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suspect that Frankel looted at least seven
insurance companies in several states of money they had given him
to invest. While no charges have been brought against Frankel, a
warrant has been issued for his arrest in what authorities is one
of the largest insurance frauds in history.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel also left behind a trail of questions that authorities
are still trying to answer. Why did so many people ignore what
appeared, in hindsight, to be clear signals of fraud? Were the
people who gathered at the Hilton unwitting dupes, as they or their
lawyers now maintain, or did they have some inkling of what was
going on? And, finally, where is Frankel?
</P>
<P>
   Those mysteries will not be solved soon. But what does emerge
from court documents and interviews with friends, business partners
and neighbors is a picture of Frankel as a brazen but wily con man,
a master puppeteer whose dealings spanned the globe, from Franklin,
Tenn., to the rarefied address of Lake Avenue in Greenwich, to the
British Virgin Islands to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Athough he was investigated once, in 1991, by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and agreed not to associate himself with the
securities business again, he promptly disregarded that ban. And as
he expanded his business reach, he added characters to the plot.
</P>
<P>
   His main and most recent target appeared to be the Vatican. Born
to a middle-class family in Toledo, Ohio, he at times portrayed
himself as a Jew interested in the Catholic religion. He flattered
Catholics on both sides of the Atlantic and promised millions for
Catholic charities to get into the good graces of the church
hierarchy. He courted prominent Catholics with private jet trips or
tickets on the supersonic Concorde, even though many of them did
not repay his attentions with much support.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most spectacularly, Frankel persuaded Monsignor Emilio
Colagiovanni, who edits a Rome-based journal on canon law, to sign
a sworn statement indicating that the Holy See funded and stood
four-square behind an organization Frankel headed. Colagiovanni
acknowledged in an interview in Rome that the statement was
``misleading,'' but denied he had engaged in any wrongdoing or knew
anything about the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the affidavit helped persuade the prominent law
firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld to continue representing
the foundation. The firm and its famous partner, Robert S. Strauss,
the former Democratic national chairman and former ambassador to
the Soviet Union, collected several hundred thousand dollars in
fees working on possible acquisitions of insurance companies, none
of which came to pass, according to a person who has reviewed the
billings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of people were conned by Marty Frankel, Eric Stevens,
David Rosse _ whatever his name was,'' said Aubrey Harwell, a
Nashville, Tenn., lawyer who represents the two Tennessee
businessmen who attended the April 28 meeting in a lawsuit against
Frankel. ``It's a classic ponzi scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   There were warning signs. Frankel mixed and matched his aliases
so boldly that guests at his dinner parties in Greenwich sometimes
addressed him by different names. His intermingling of charity and
commerce was befuddling to many who dealt with him. He bestowed
gifts on friends so lavishly that many said they considered him
reckless with his money, as if it did not belong to him.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel also led an eccentric, even dark, personal life. He
turned his luxury Greenwich estate into a fortress, traveled with
body guards when visiting his hometown, and trolled the Internet
for women to serve as clerical help, neighbors and associates said.
</P>
<P>
   He met and lived with several women he found through personal
ads, according to a statement he gave Greenwich police after a
woman was found hanging from a noose tied to the deck of one of his
Connecticut homes in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   EARLY LIFE IN TOLEDO
</P>
<P>
   Martin Richard Frankel was born on Nov. 21, 1954, into a
respectable middle-class family of lawyers and public servants. His
father, Leon, worked as a referee at a domestic relations court in
Toledo, and his mother, Tillie, was a clerk in the Toledo city
government.
</P>
<P>
   Marty, as he was known, was the third of four children. By all
accounts, he was a bright youngster, even brilliant, friends say.
Almost 6 feet tall, Frankel was thin, weighing 135 pounds, and,
friends say, awkward and introverted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have many friends when he was growing up,'' said
Bradford Dolgin, who attended Whitmer High School with Frankel.
``He was pretty eccentric.''
</P>
<P>
   In class, his political views were left-wing and unconventional,
one faculty member recalled.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Frankel's high intelligence, though, friends and
faculty members say he had trouble finishing what he started. He
seemed to have a phobia about taking exams, and rarely turned in
class papers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from high school in three years, near the top of
his class. He took courses at the University of Toledo in the late
1970s and early 1980s, but never earned a degree. His academic
record is under privacy seal, at his request, according to the
school's registrar.
</P>
<P>
   It was during his college years that Frankel fell in love with
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty was kind of a jack of all trades, master of none,'' said
George J. Windau, a college friend of Frankel. ``And then he became
a master of one: the stock market, commodities, currencies.''
</P>
<P>
   He became a day trader, rapidly buying and selling stocks, often
many times a day.
</P>
<P>
   He took his first professional crack at the securities business
at the Toledo branch of a New York brokerage firm, Dominick &AMP;
Dominick. Details are sketchy, but John Schulte, who headed the
branch, says that he fired Frankel in 1987 for failing ``to
produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Other tensions emerged between the two men. Schulte said his
marriage with his wife, Sonia, fell apart and she began a long
relationship with Frankel. According to police records, the three
at times tussled over allowing Schulte time to visit his two
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Those confrontations, friends say, caused Frankel to grow
increasingly fearful that Schulte would retaliate against him. It
was, some friends believe, one reason he left Toledo and turned to
aliases.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he left, friends and neighbors say he began to
install security equipment at home and hired a man named David
Rosse, who would eventually travel with him to Greenwich as his
security guard and whose name Frankel would appropriate for his own
use.
</P>
<P>
   When Frankel returned home last November for the funeral of his
father, who died at the age of 87, he came with a small army of
security guards.
</P>
<P>
   EARLY FAILURE
</P>
<P>
   By the late-1980s, Frankel had struck out on his own, setting up
a money management firm he called Frankel Fund, which he operated
from a room in his parents' home. He recruited local people and
retirees as investors.
</P>
<P>
   As the fund grew, he moved to West Palm Beach, Fla., seeking to
strengthen his business with retirees. Friends say that he moved at
the suggestion of Douglas I. Maxwell, a Tennessee man who formed a
partnership with Frankel called PDS Securities Inc. The partnership
raised at least $1 million for the Frankel Fund, according to
securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Creamer, the lawyer for two Ohio retirees who filed suit
against Frankel, said he boasted of living an extravagant life and
of having attracted a Romanian queen and the king of Yugoslavia as
investors. ``He was a kind of Woody Allen character, kind of
goofy,'' Creamer recalled. ``It's kind of disarming.''
</P>
<P>
   But the venture did not last long. At least one of Frankel's
clients raised questions, and soon Frankel was back in Toledo,
telling investors that his partner, Maxwell, had bungled their
investments.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission had another view. It
froze the accounts of the Frankel Fund. In a settlement, Frankel
agreed to stay away from the securities industry forever as
punishment for having lied about the fund's performance, his own
experience and even how the proceeds would be used.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   INSURANCE INTERESTS GROW
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the SEC was cracking down on the Frankel Fund,
Frankel was teaming up with John A. Hackney, a Tennessee bank
executive, to buy insurance companies. It is an industry that is
regulated by the states, not by federal agencies like the SEC.
Frankel appears to have targeted small, troubled insurance
companies that were vulnerable to embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel and Hackney did not actually meet until eight years
later, in the Mississippi hotel. But over the phone, Hackney became
fast friends with the man he came to know only as Eric Stevens, who
portrayed himself as an experienced bond trader eager to employ a
novel and lucrative trading strategy to improve the returns on
insurance company assets, according to Harwell, Hackney's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said that Hackney was paid a straight salary for
managing insurance companies that he bought on Frankel's behalf and
had no other interest in Frankel's dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Hackney did agree to steer the insurance companies' investment
business to Frankel's Liberty National Securities.
</P>
<P>
   To make their first acquisition, of Franklin American Corp., the
two partners set up Thunor Trust. Frankel's name was not associated
with the trust, but several of his acquaintances are identified in
state documents as investors who put up the $3.8 million in startup
funds.
</P>
<P>
   They were Sonia Schulte, the Toledo girlfriend, Edward Krauss, a
Frankel family friend who now lives in Columbus, Ohio, and Mark C.
Shuki, an acquaintance from Chicago. Krauss said in an interview he
had nothing to do with Thunor and did not willingly lend his name.
The others could not be reached for comment. It is unclear where
the seed capital actually came from.
</P>
<P>
   Thunor grew rapidly. In half a dozen transactions between 1993
and 1995, it acquired controlling stakes in eight insurance
companies, including some based in Mississippi, Oklahoma, Arkansas
and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   All of the companies sent their money to be invested by Frankel
through his company, Liberty National. The address sounded
impressive, 82 Wall St., Dept. 1105, but it was nothing more than a
mail drop. Harwell said Hackney was not aware of that fact.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's Liberty National appeared to be doing an outstanding
job managing Franklin's assets, according to financial statements
the securities firm sent to Hackney. When Franklin needed money
back for some reason, Liberty National readily provided it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was every appearance of legitimacy,'' Harwell said. They
thought Frankel ``was a guru,'' he said. The companies' statements
from Liberty National showed they were earning outsized returns on
simple-sounding investments in U.S. government bonds _ performance
that would have been astounding from Wall Street's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty National was operating from Frankel's mansion in
Greenwich. He moved to the wealthy New York suburb in 1991, around
the same time he plunged into the insurance business. According to
associates and neighbors, Frankel converted his home into a
full-fledged trading floor, with 80 computers, satellite dishes and
direct links to the New York Stock Exchange. He later bought two
other residences in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But the major splash Frankel made had little to do with his
reputed trading prowess.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in August 1997, Arnold Courier, an elderly
Greenwich resident, heard a woman's screams echo through Lake
Avenue. The commotion seemed to be coming from the home of a
reclusive neighbor that he knew as Martin King, another alias for
Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Courier said, he and other neighbors learned that
something horrible had happened at 881 Lake Ave.
</P>
<P>
   A woman had hanged herself. Police arrived on the scene to find
Frances Burge, a heavy-set 22-year-old, lying dead on the ground
outside the house.
</P>
<P>
   The death was ruled a suicide. Days later, when the Couriers
read about what had happened in the local newspaper, they asked
their lawyer, Gregory Saum, to contact the police to tell the story
of the chilling screams. Saum said he later contacted the Drug
Enforcement Administration, fearing that the death may have been
related narcotics activity. DEA agents came to the neighborhood and
asked questions. The agency's inquiry does not appear to have led
to any action. A spokeswoman for the agency said it does not
confirm or deny the existence of any non-public investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is among the many bizarre events that unfolded at
the Frankel houses on Lake Avenue throughout much of the 1990s, as
Frankel used the money that the government now says was stolen to
create a lavish lifestyle. Interviews with people who knew him and
visited his homes paint a vivid picture of a reclusive and paranoid
man, obsessed with his physical safety.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel turned his properties into armed camps, posting
gun-toting guards, and erecting a 6-foot metal fence complete with
cameras and flood-lights perched on top.
</P>
<P>
   But associates also described a man who had trouble meeting
women and who scoured the Internet and placed ads in the Village
Voice in search of dates. Some of the women who befriended him were
from far-flung locations, like Switzerland, Alaska and Russia, the
associates said. Several ended up living in Greenwich homes that
Frankel rented for them, for prices ranging from $4,000 to $10,000
a month, according to local real-estate experts.
</P>
<P>
   Pornography and sexual fetishes were prominent features of the
house. According to police reports, during a search of the house
following the death of Ms. Burge, authorities discovered a leather
riding crop, ropes and sadomasochistic literature and videos.
Similar items were found by police following Frankel's
disappearance, along with a number of pornographic videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   When police interviewed him about Ms. Burge's death, he spoke
openly about how he found women in personal ads, invited them to
his home and often paid them to live with him or nearby. ``The
girls do not get paid a salary, but I give them money as they need
it,'' he told the police.
</P>
<P>
   To some who knew him, Frankel seemed odd rather than dangerous.
These people described him as a compulsive talker, who flitted from
topic to topic. They said he was a compulsively fussy eater who had
two live-in chefs who worked around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   But some neighbors said they worried about what was going on at
Frankel's Lake Avenue residences. The driveway bristled with fleets
of BMWs and Mercedes Benzes, as people traipsed in and out of the
Lake Avenue homes 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions erupted. In one case, when Frankel's fence cut off a
public riding trail, the director of the Greenwich Riding and
Trails Association, Donna Nives, said that she rang the doorbell at
881 Lake Ave., only to hear an electronic recorded voice: ``Who are
you and what do you want?'' She fled.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   COURTING CATHOLICS
</P>
<P>
   Though he was raised Jewish and expressed fervently pro-Israel
political views to friends, Frankel aggressively courted the
Catholic Church and the Vatican religious hierarchy beginning last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of his involvement with Catholic priests and the
Vatican differ, but one thing seems certain: Frankel promised
lavish financial contributions to Catholic charities in return for
support from their leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel told the priests he met with that his interests were
purely charitable. But from the moment last August when the Saint
Francis of Assisi Foundation was founded in the British Virgin
Islands with the motto ``To Serve and Help the Poor and Alleviate
Suffering,'' he used it as a vehicle for business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear why. One explanation advanced by associates of
Frankel is that a foundation backed by the Vatican might lend him
credibility in buying additional insurance companies that would
keep his scheme alive. Others suspect that he may also have seen an
advantage to creating another layer between himself and the
companies he controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his motives, he pursued his quarry with ardor. He
stacked the shelves of the library in his Greenwich home with
Catholic literature, including histories of the saints and papal
encyclicals, visitors to his home said. He familiarized himself
with the life of St. Francis of Assisi, renowned for helping the
poor. He told people he had repeatedly watched the Franco
Zefferelli movie about St. Francis.
</P>
<P>
   The books and the knowledge of the saints helped Frankel win the
trust of Thomas A. Bolan, a New York lawyer and supporter of
Catholic causes who became a foundation trustee. Frankel told
Bolan, who was the law partner of the late Roy Cohn, that he
planned to give at least $50 million to Catholic charities
immediately, and wanted Bolan's help in arranging an audience with
senior Catholic clerics to discuss the gifts, said Bolan's lawyer,
Maurice R. Nessen.
</P>
<P>
   Bolan introduced Frankel to another well-connected American
Catholic, the Rev. Peter Jacobs, who would also become a trustee of
Frankel's foundation. Jacobs, despite having had run-ins with the
Catholic church hierarchy in America, had connections in Rome,
where he lives in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jacobs who introduced Frankel to his most important
religious contact, Colagiovanni, 80, who serves as president of the
Monitor Ecclesiasticus Foundation, an educational organization that
has ties to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Colagiovanni, now retired, had served as a judge on an important
church tribunal, the Roman Rota. As president of the Monitor
Ecclesiasticus, he served at the behest of the Vatican Curia, or
Senate. Vatican officials said there was no connection between the
Monitor organization and the Vatican but declined to answer further
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Colagionvanni recalls being impressed with Frankel's
determination to help the poor, as well as the securities trader's
knowledge of St. Francis of Assisi. ``If I cannot trust the
Catholic Church, who can I trust?'' Colagionvanni recalls Frankel
asking him.
</P>
<P>
   The Church officials say they were also dazzled by Frankel's
personal generosity. While negotiating with the Vatican, he bought
Bolan tickets on the Concorde, and flew Jacobs across the Atlantic
in first-class cabins after the priest said he declined offers to
fly on Frankel's private jet. When Frankel learned that Bolan's son
was dying of multiple sclerosis, he paid for a nurse to attend to
the son at home, Bolan's lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The courtship paid dividends. Jacobs and Colagiovanni arranged
for the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation to have access to an
account at the Instituto per le Opere di Religione, the Vatican
bank, which is jealously guarded and off-limits to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most helpful to Frankel were two affidavits, drafted
by Frankel's lawyers and signed by Colagiovanni, several people
directly involved in the process confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The first, issued last November, claimed that the St. Francis of
Assisi Foundation was an organization within the Holy See, meaning
that it carried the imprimatur of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   A second, issued three months later, backed off that assertion.
It said the Monitor Ecclesiasticus Foundation contributed $1
billion to the Saint Francis of Assisi Foundation, and further
claimed that the money emanated from ``various Roman Catholic
tribunals and Roman Catholic cultural institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Both statements are now widely doubted. Colagionvanni calls the
affidavits a ``mistake'' and ascribes his willingness to sign to
misplaced trust in Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   But though Frankel clearly expected the religious overlay he put
on his operation to help him expand his empire rapidly, the
purported link to the Vatican ties did not, apparently, do him much
good. They might even have contributed to his demise.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation bought control
of Thunor Trust and, by extension, Frankel's growing network of
insurance companies. Frankel, however, quickly discovered that
invoking the name of the Vatican raised red flags everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations for two new purchases of insurance companies, one
in Colorado and another in Washington State, fell through after
Frankel arranged for the St. Francis foundation to become the
purchaser instead of Thunor Trust. Foreign ownership, prohibited by
some state insurance regulators, was one stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Francis was telling us that they were ultimately
controlled by the Vatican. But if that was the case, then they
could not buy Capital Life,'' said Joseph L. Blattner, president of
the Capital Life Insurance Company of Denver, which negotiated with
Frankel's organization for nearly six months before the talks
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, by late 1998, regulators were beginning to catch up
with Frankel. Tennessee state examiners questioned why the Franklin
insurance companies that they oversaw had placed so much money in
one pot _ Frankel's Liberty _ and worried about rapid turnover of
the Liberty accounts. Liberty reported trading volume in 1998 of
about $14 billion, in exchange for earning a negligible $40,000 in
commissions. Frankel dodged a bullet when he transferred assets
back to Tennessee before a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   He had a harder time fending off Mississippi officials a few
months later. Regulators in that state questioned the same trading
patterns. But Franklin's answers made matters worse. They revealed
that the change in ownership from Thunor to St. Francis of Assisi
had not been reported, as required, to local authorities. That is
what prompted the late April gathering in Jackson, where many of
Frankel's colleagues saw him in person for the only time.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show that Frankel may have known the end was near.
Even before that meeting, Franklin subsidiaries began transferring
large sums to Liberty National or other accounts directly
controlled by Frankel, including $161 million from Mississippi
insurance companies and $117 million from affiliated companies in
Missouri. The court records suggests that most of that money was
transferred into foreign bank accounts by early May.
</P>
<P>
   On May 7, two days after firefighters responded to a fire caused
by burning documents in the Greenich mansion, Hackney, Jacobs,
Bolan, Colagiovanni, legal officers at Akin, Gump, regulators in
several states and many others were told that Frankel had
disappeared without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all seemed so good, like Brooke Astor,'' Jacobs said,
referring to the New York benefactress and reflecting on his ties
to Frankel. ``Only he turned out to be the devil.''

CELLULAR ONE PLANS TO CHARGE FOR UNANSWERED CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cellular One already charges cell phone customers when they make
a call or take a call. Now it wants to make sure it charges them
even when no one answers the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Starting July 1, Cellular One plans to start imposing charges
for 15 seconds (the equivalent of about three rings) after the
customer hits the send button on a call. The charges would apply
even if no connection is made.
</P>
<P>
   Because Cellular One bills in one-minute increments, the new
policy means calls that ring more than 15 seconds will carry at
least a one-minute charge, or anywhere from 10 to 52 cents
depending on the customer's calling plan. If the customer has free
calling minutes, minutes will start being deducted after 15
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular One, a subsidiary of SBC Communications of San Antonio,
issued a two-paragraph statement Thursday defending the new charge,
stating that its network is utilized whenever a call is made. By
allowing a grace period of just 15 seconds, the company said more
channels will remain open for use by other customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to comment further, other than to say
customers have been notified of the change.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular One's grace period in the Massachusetts-Rhode
Island-New Hampshire market has been steadily cut over the past few
years from 60 seconds to 30 seconds and now to 15 seconds. SBC's
wireless operations in Connecticut and Washington, D.C., are not as
miserly, allowing a 30-second grace period. By contrast, officials
from most of SBC's wireless rivals said they charge customers only
if a connection is made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they're picking on you guys,'' said K.C. Choi, a
spokesman for the Telecommunications Research and Action Center in
Washington, a consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   Choi said he did not think most consumers were aware of the
calling grace periods. He said he was not aware of them, and he had
just signed up with Cellular One in Washington. He also said 15
seconds seemed to be unreasonably short, given the length of time
it takes for some people to answer the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular One's policy appears to be unique in the industry. John
Palmer, executive director of marketing for Bell Atlantic Mobile,
said his company does not buy into its rival's reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers are demanding value and are not willing to
tolerate unnecessary or hidden charges that they wouldn't normally
expect to pay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Nee, a spokesman for AT&AMP;T Wireless, had a similar
reaction. ``If no one picks up on the other end, no one gets
charged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Omnipoint and officials at Sprint PCS also said
their companies do not start charge until a connection is made.
</P>
<P>
   The grace period issue is very different from a proposal that
would change the overall billing structure for cellular phone
calls. Currently, cell phone customers are charged for incoming and
outgoing calls, but federal regulators are moving toward a billing
system that would charge all calls to the person placing the call.

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli fighter planes bombarded Lebanon on Thursday
night while Shiite Muslim guerrillas fired rockets into northern
Israel, with the exchanges reportedly leaving two Israelis and six
Lebanese dead and dozens wounded. The action was a severe step-up
in the conflict in southern Lebanon at a moment of political
transition in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It was a back and forth of retaliatory attacks, which began on
Thursday afternoon when Shiite Muslim guerrillas from the
Hezbollah, or Party of God, showered northern Israel with Katyusha
rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Israel then let loose a furious aerial assault, with nine
airstrikes on power stations, guerrilla strongholds and bridges in
Lebanon, causing a blackout in Beirut, killing six and wounding 45
people, according to The Associated Press in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   And, just after 11 p.m., Party of God guerrillas resumed fire on
northern Israel, where most residents were huddled in shelters. Two
Israeli civilians died. A third was severely wounded, with at least
12 others also reported hurt. The deaths were the first of
civilians in northern Israel related to the Lebanon conflict since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is stepping up at an intensely delicate moment,
days after Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak and Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad, who controls much of Lebanon, made public
declarations of their mutual intentions to reopen peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, the decision to bomb was made by the
departing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. He continues to run
the country one month after his election defeat on May 17 while
Barak assembles a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the bombing began, television reporters asserted
that while Netanyahu had authorized the attack, Barak had been
informed. But the prime minister-elect's office was quick to
respond that he was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a part of the decision-making process in this
matter,'' Barak's office said in a statement broadcast on Channel
One television.
</P>
<P>
   Barak promised during the campaign to end Israel's longstanding
military presence in southern Lebanon. Toward that end, he is eager
to kick-start the negotiations with Syria, and public compliments
he exchanged with Assad this week, through the press, signaled the
beginning of the thaw.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden intensification of the conflict is a reminder of
just how volatile the border remains, and how difficult it will be
to extricate Israeli troops from what has become a chronic
low-level war zone.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli troops have occupied a 9-mile-deep border zone in
southern Lebanon since 1985 to protect its northern towns from
attack by the Iran-backed Hezbollah. But the steady loss of from 25
to 30 Israeli soldiers a year has made its engagement there very
unpopular here.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening attack on northern Israel on Thursday afternoon,
four Israeli civilians and one soldier were lightly wounded by
Katyusha rockets and mortar bombs, which struck the border town of
Qiryat Shemona and the western Galilee town of Shlomi.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah said it was avenging a recent spate of civilian deaths
in southern Lebanon. According to a Web site of a
Hezbollah-affiliated television station, the initial attack was
provoked on Thursday by what it said had been the death of Saada
Mansour, a 45-year-old woman, in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah said Mrs. Mansour was killed by shrapnel when mortar
rounds struck her house, which was apparently caught in the
crossfire between guerrilla fighters and the Israeli-backed South
Lebanese army troops.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``In reprisal for the targeting of peaceful southern villages,
the Islamic resistance today shelled the Israeli settlements in
occupied northern Palestine with appropriate weapons,'' the
guerrillas' statement on their Web site said. ``In defense of our
civilians, our artillery reinforcement unit (ARU) bombarded with
Katyushas the settlements of Qiryat Shemona and Shlomi at 16:20 and
17:40 this afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli army statement on Thursday said that Israel had
``displayed much restraint'' after recent attacks by Hezbollah, but
that ``today's grave incident'' could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The strongly worded statement went on to threaten not only the
Hezbollah, ``but those backing them and standing behind them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Speaking on Israeli radio on Thursday evening, Shaul Mofaz, the
army chief of staff, said political leaders had denied two recent
army requests to retaliate in Lebanon. Radio reports said the chief
of staff had shuttled back and forth between the departing and new
prime ministers, neither of whom wanted to make the decision to
take action.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut on Thursday night, high-rise apartment buildings, many
of which are stocked with generators, gleamed in the darkened city.
At first, the Lebanese capital barely stopped in its busy Thursday
night routines. Cars clogged the streets; loudspeakers called
Muslims to prayer; and the restaurants were hopping as the weekend
began.
</P>
<P>
   By late night, though, the effects of the bombing began to be
felt _ and broadcast on television. Israelis struck a power station
on the outskirts of Beirut, three bridges south of Beirut, what
they called ``terrorist targets'' south of the Litani River, in an
area of Lebanon firmly under Syrian control, and a power substation
in the Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in northern Israel, reports of the two
civilians killed _ and one severely wounded _ began making their
way through the bomb shelters that have become like second home to
the residents.

ANALYSIS: FEDERALISM AWAITS '00 WITH THE HIGH COURT NARROWLY
DIVIDED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The angry language from the Supreme Court about
this week's federalism cases almost suggested the issue had the
vitality it enjoyed in the first 50 years of the Republic.
</P>
<P>
   It does not. Expect no duels, nor even billboards. But in fact
the reach of power from Washington is a vibrant issue to many
conservatives. They fear the advantages they have recently enjoyed
may be jeopardized by the presidential election next year.
</P>
<P>
   This week's narrowly decided federalism cases involved issues
like whether states had to obey federal wage and hour laws. But the
next Supreme Court battlegrounds are sure to be more explosive,
testing whether and how states can be compelled to follow federal
antidiscrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   With a slim 5-4 majority in place, the federalism decisions
underscored the political reality that the election could tip the
court's balance on the issue. One change on the court could change
policy on federalism, just as a different outcome in a court
appointment (the rejected Robert H. Bork instead of the approved
Anthony M. Kennedy) could have led to a reversal of Roe vs. Wade
and severe curbs on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The federalism issue may fly below the radar of next year's
presidential election. It has little of the voting or fund-raising
potential of abortion, an issue that probably helped Bill Clinton
when he promised to nominate justices who would uphold Roe vs. Wade
in 1992, or of crime, which Richard M. Nixon used effectively in
1968 when he promised to appoint tough judges.
</P>
<P>
   But the election will almost certainly have a more profound
effect on the issue than the issue will have on the election.
</P>
<P>
   The court's two oldest members, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, 74, and Justice John Paul Stevens, 79, are on opposite
sides of the question. A Rehnquist retirement would give a
Democratic president the opportunity to turn the court around. But
a Stevens departure would give a Republican president a chance to
solidify the majority.
</P>
<P>
   That is because even if no attorney general poses federalism as
a litmus test, and even if nobody bothers to ask about it in a
confirmation hearing (it was all but absent in the most recent
exhaustive hearings, those on Bork and Clarence Thomas), Democratic
and Republican judges see the question differently. Democrats side
with the federal government, Republicans with the states.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the justices appointed in the 1980s or 1990s only David
H. Souter, a New Hampshire Republican whose career has only
confirmed the worries of conservatives who were reluctant to
support him, deviated from that rule this week. The other
Republican appointee to dissent, Stevens, came from President
Gerald Ford's time, when Republican justices were not chosen
primarily to satisfy the right.
</P>
<P>
   By Supreme Court standards, the opinions were unusually blunt.
When Justice Stephen G. Breyer, dissenting, said the majority
opinion owed more ``to the thought of James I than of James
Madison,'' he was comparing five of his colleagues to a British
monarch with more concern for his prerogatives than skill in
getting along with Parliament, which he rarely summoned.
</P>
<P>
   Souter did not reach back to the 17th century, but to the time
of the founders. He compared the majority view to the now
discredited idea of industrial life as free and even democratic, a
concept he said was false to begin with and ``grew insistently
fictional over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority, Souter argued, ``has chosen to close the century
by conferring like status on a conception or state sovereign
immunity that is true neither to history nor to the structure of
the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the majority opinions had no need for similar
denunciations (after all, they had five votes), but Justice Antonin
Scalia dismissed the Breyer dissenting opinion:
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice Breyer reiterates (but only in outline form,
thankfully) the now-fashionable revisionist accounts of the 11th
Amendment set forth in other opinions in a degree of repetitive
detail that has despoiled our northern woods.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are comparable passions on the anti-federalist side
outside the court. Michael Greve of the Center for Individual
Rights, fears that ``one more Democratic replacement would wipe out
all the advances the Supreme Court has made'' on federalism issues.
For Democrats, Greve said, resisting any challenge to federal
authority ``is so deeply rooted, it's instinctive.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other conservatives fear that the dissenters are just
itching for a chance to reverse the decisions, as Rehnquist
admitted he was ready to do on the other side of the issue in 1985,
in a case whose ruling was reversed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Souter validated their concern in his dissent to the ruling that
employees of the State of Maine cannot sue to get time and a half
for overtime. He predicted that the majority's ``unrealistic'' and
``indefensible'' concept of state immunity would prove
``fleeting.''

FBI COMMAND CENTER WEEDING THROUGH THOUSANDS OF SIGHTINGS OF
SUSPECTED KILLER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few days ago, the command center that the FBI set up in
Houston to find suspected serial killer Rafael Resendez-Ramirez had
all the excitement of a telephone answering service.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 people sat at their desks, phones glued to their
ears, asking questions and taking notes.
</P>
<P>
   It was quiet, except for the hum of fax machines, printers and
desktop computers. Occasionally, an investigator called out
information to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are slow days and busy days,'' Houston FBI spokesman
Rolando Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was a busy day. After a noon news conference, the
command center, a clearinghouse for the multiagency task force
working on ``Operation Train Stop,'' began to look like a telethon.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the team had fielded 1,100 tips. Within a couple
hours, that number shot up to 1,800.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, men and women sit in
the converted conference room and methodically sift through the
often mundane minutia of an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   They are looking for leads, associates and family members as
they try to figure out how to catch Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Color and black-and-white mug shots of him are everywhere, on
the walls, on the tables, in the fax machine being sent to
law-enforcement agencies that can't download them from the FBI's
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of his fingerprints are spread across a table near a wall
covered with maps of train routes and rail yards in Greater
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteboards list information that includes more than a dozen
agencies involved in the case and the suspect's 30-plus aliases.
Televisions hang from the ceiling like in a sports bar, except
they're tuned to CNN's Headline News instead of ESPN. There's a map
of the U.S.-Mexico border and another of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, two investigators confer about reinterviewing some
Resendez-Ramirez family members. Another investigator talks on the
phone to a caller with a possible sighting in Oklahoma City.
Another investigator shows a co-worker how to access information on
a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the phones continue to ring.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Loader, FBI assistant special agent in charge, said one of
those calls might lead to the man suspected of killing at least
eight people since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well over 90 percent of the tips are possible sightings of him
in a store, a car or a train,'' Loader said. ``Hopefully, we are
getting some solid sightings. We would like to catch him before
another murder event.''
</P>
<P>
   Each tip is handled by the task-force members sitting in the
``switchboard area.'' A high-tech tape recorder registers sound
levels; lights blink on multiline phones.
</P>
<P>
   The people on the phones try to determine whether the tip has
any merit. If it does, it's passed on to a special agent or a
detective, who interviews the caller in depth.
</P>
<P>
   When a tip becomes a lead, it's sent electronically, via the FBI
Rapid Start system, to field officials in that area, and
investigators are sent out to interview callers and show them mug
shots of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, most tips are called in after a story has appeared
on local or national news broadcasts. While Loader said that all
the possible sightings are helpful, many turn out to be
look-alikes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes bad tips can be weeded out easily, as when callers in
different cities believe they saw the suspect on the same day and
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them can't be true,'' Loader said. ``But 250 million
eyes are better than one or two.''

5 IRAQIS FREED FROM U.S. DETENTION CENTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ After being held for two years in a detention
center in Los Angeles, five Iraqis were freed Thursday and were
reunited with their families here, where they will be allowed to
find jobs and stay until another country agrees to give them
permanent political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The five were among 7,000 Iraqi dissidents brought to the United
States after the unsuccessful effort to overthrow President Saddam
Hussein after the Persian Gulf War, but fell under suspicion of
being double agents working for Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998 an immigration judge found that the men were a
national security risk and signed an order for their deportation to
Iraq, after a hearing in which the information against them was
classified.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a former director of the Central Intelligence
Agency, James Woolsey, became involved in their fight to avoid
deportation, which he said could have meant their ``being sent to
their deaths based on classified information.''
</P>
<P>
   Their freedom came as a result of an agreement reached on June
11 with the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the Iraqi National Congress, Dr. Ahmad Chalabi, said
he new three of the men and could vouch for their integrity,
calling them ``fighters for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the immigration service in Washington, Russ
Bergeron, said the agency had acted properly. ``There was a broad
range of evidence collected that indicated that these men were a
threat to national security,'' Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five, Adil Hadi Awadh, said because of the aid of
Woolsey and others, he felt no bitterness. ``We're grateful for the
support from the American people,'' he said.

MARKET PLACE: DEALS REAL, DEALS IMAGINED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the Internet almost anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the bad news, for both companies and investors, who
must confront a menagerie of potential products and deals to find a
few that someday just might pay off.
</P>
<P>
   The painful confusion can be seen in several of the rumored
deals in the market this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Dan Dorfman, writing on the Jagnotes.com Web site,
said that Compaq Computer Corp. was interested in trading its Alta
Vista Internet service for stock in CMGI, an Internet investment
concern. The companies confirmed those talks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, someone using the name of Andy Nguyen posted a rumor
on a Yahoo message board that Gateway Inc., the computer maker,
would offer to buy Earthlink, a big Internet service provider, for
$75 a share. The companies decline to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Through subsequent and circuitous events, the Earthlink rumors
forced Mindspring, another Internet service provider, to publish a
cryptic statement that it was in talks about possible ``business
combinations.'' It declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   What all these possible deals have in common is that neither the
personal computer companies nor the Internet firms are really
comfortable in their own businesses, and they are wondering if the
grass is greener on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Selling computers these days has all the security of cliff
diving, as prices are falling as fast as an Acapulco diver.
Compaq's inability to keep from very painful belly flops, quarter
after quarter, was largely the reason that the board dismissed its
chief executive, Eckhard Pfeiffer, two months ago. Seeking profits,
both Compaq and Gateway, which is doing somewhat better as it uses
the increasingly popular direct sales approach, have decided to try
to funnel their customers to Internet services they control. That
way they can earn monthly fees or at least advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway, in fact, has been able to attract 400,000 customers to
its Gateway.net Internet service, although by offering one full
year free, it's hardly a big money maker yet. Compaq's Internet
activities revolved around Alta Vista, a popular search service
that it acquired with Digital Equipment Corp. last year. Compaq at
first ignored Alta Vista. But earlier this year it decided to plump
it up in preparation to sell a piece to the public. And it began
its own Internet service that directs users to Alta Vista.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet companies, meanwhile, have been struggling with
their own businesses. None of the Internet service providers has
found a way to break out of the pack to compete with America
Online, which continues to snare half the new online users.
Providing Internet access is largely a commodity telecommunication
service, much like long distance. As for the Internet portal
businesses, the biggest, like Yahoo, may well attract a big enough
audience to profit from advertising, but it's still unclear how
Alta Vista will survive.
</P>
<P>
   But it is certainly far from clear that computer makers and
Internet companies should jump into each other's arms. Potential
buyers for Internet service providers include telecommunications
companies that want to offer all-in-one packages, or a host of
other technology businesses. Microsoft, for example, has been
sniffing around looking to buy Internet service providers, a sharp
reversal from its stance a year ago, when it was considering
selling its MSN Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Internet portals, like Alta Vista, because they can attract
large amounts of traffic, could well be attractive for companies
including media companies and online retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, according to people close to its executives' plans,
appears to be intrigued by owning a smaller piece of a larger
Internet effort. CMGI is a combination of a venture capital
investment fund and an incubator that has started a number of
successful Internet companies, including Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   A potential purchase of Alta Vista by CMGI has the financial
advantage of being an exchange of one Internet stock for another.
CMGI's stock, which closed at $96.50 Thursday, is trading at nearly
two and a half times the value of its underlying holdings,
according to Keith Benjamin, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson
Stephens. That premium reflects the buoyant Internet market and
investor confidence in the company's management team. The value
also allows it to pay a reported $2 billion to $3 billion for Alta
Vista, which no traditional media company could afford.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the same sort of analysis shows that a
Gateway-Earthlink deal would be difficult, as Gateway suffers from
a real world valuation of 27 times earnings. Earthlink, like most
Internet companies, loses money. Walter Winnitzki, an analyst with
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, figures that buying Earthlink would cause
substantial dilution to Gateway's earnings, something its
management is loath to do.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway and Earthlink declined to comment on whether they have
had any talks. But Garry Betty, Earthlink's chief executive, said
in a telephone interview that the company did not want its main
method of finding new customers to be through buyers of computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that is all you had to rely on, it would be very risky,''
he said. Nor, Betty added, is the company focused on acquisitions.
The intention, he said, is to grow through aggressive marketing for
new subscribers, largely those who want to graduate from America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yahoo posting about an Earthlink Gateway deal may have
been nothing more than someone trying to hype a stock, it did have
the unintended effect of prodding the cryptic admission of deal
making by Mindspring. In response to the reports about Earthlink,
one Mindspring executive told a reporter that the company was not
in any merger talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't exactly true,'' Charles Brewer, the company's
chief executive, said Thursday. ``And the misinformation needed to
be corrected.'' Brewer did say, without elaborating, that Internet
service providers have the potential to become more profitable as
they grow larger. Analysts say that Mindspring could well be trying
to buy another Internet service provider, like Prodigy
Communications. Or it could be considering bids from a
telecommunications company, Microsoft or perhaps even a computer
maker.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet anything is possible.

DODGERS FANS SHOULD BEWARE OF BRENLY IN BOOTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Saturday afternoon in San Francisco looks to be a
Los Angeles Dodgers fan's worst recurring nightmare: Carlos Perez
on the hill, Todd Hundley behind the plate and Bob Brenly in the
Fox TV booth.
</P>
<P>
   At least Davey Johnson can prevent the oily rag and the leaky
can of gasoline from getting out of the shed. But no matter how
much wind is swirling at 3Com, the blow torch known as Brenly _
who's doing his fourth Dodgers Saturday afternoon regional
broadcast in four weeks _ will be ignited.
</P>
<P>
   If you're listening to the broadcast with your Dodgers filter
on, having Brenly present with access to a microphone will be about
as entertaining as the self-proclaimed office comedian doing
another Austin Powers impersonation while you're trying to blow off
his lunch invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm over that whole Giants-Dodgers thing pretty much,'' Brenly
said, trying to sound convincing. ``We kid a lot about it, but as a
broadcaster those hostile feelings are left well behind now. I
mean, a broadcaster can't afford to play favorites and both
organizations have changed so much since my playing career, I
hardly recognize anyone. For crying' out loud, there's Dusty Baker
managing the Giants and Ron Perranowski and Joey Amalfitano helping
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we believe you.
</P>
<P>
   So how did Brenly, who will do a Dodgers game in eight of the
first nine weeks of Fox's Saturday afternoon game of the week, draw
the short straw? Location. He and Thom Brenneman, the regular guys
for the Arizona Diamondbacks, handle most of the West Coast
regional games for Fox while the prime-time team of Joe Buck and
Tim McCarver generally stay on the other side of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Brenly says he doesn't delight in the Dodgers' early
unraveling, it'd be tough not to read between the lines of things
he's said on the air about them already. Doing the Dodgers-Phillies
game last week, he commented how much of ``a disaster'' the Dodgers
had during pregame infield practice. And they ended up winning that
one, 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an us-versus-them mentality and I think if anyone
from L.A. paid attention to the broadcasts, they'd realize there
isn't any pro-Giants or anti-Dodgers sentiments _ I'm for good
baseball and against bad baseball,'' Brenly said, starting to sound
a bit more believable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this _ a few years ago I did a Dodgers game right
after they picked up Otis Nixon and Eric Young near the end of the
('97) season, and they were an exciting team to watch. Then I did a
Giants game, and they were flat, and after Rod Beck blew a save I
said on the air that the NL race was over, that the Dodgers would
win it. I got a batch of you-know-what from friends in San
Francisco. `How dare you say that?' But given what I had seen, I
felt the Dodgers should have owned the division that year.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, right, that was the year the Giants beat out the Dodgers by
two games for first place. Probably no thanks to Brenly's
motivational speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is selfish, but all I like to see is a team playing
the game the way it's supposed to be played,'' Brenly said in an
almost captivating manner of credibility. ``When you see a team
looking discombobulated, that's a bad reflection on the whole
organization. How can a team go out to take infield practice and
not concentrate enough for five minutes to make the right throws at
the right bases? That wasn't pretty to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenly, for what it's worth, is dragging the whole family from
its Scottsdale, Ariz., home to San Francisco this weekend to catch
up with a bunch of his former Giants teammates and watch the
series. OK, so he was specially invited because the Giants are
honoring their ``Team of the 1980s'' on Sunday and Brenly, who
happened to start his S.F. career in '81 and end it in '89, was
voted onto the squad.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Brenly, who'll be at Dodger Stadium a week from
Saturday for a Giants-Dodgers rematch, says he doesn't hate the
Southern California visits as much as you'd think, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I've discovered the Burbank airport, you get in, do
the game, get right out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's spoken like a true fan of L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Rivalry follow-up: After Saturday's regional exposure, the
Dodgers-Giants contest Sunday night goes nationally over ESPN at 5
p.m. ... with Joe Morgan doing analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The spin cycle: NBC's sluggish NBA Finals ratings for the
Spurs-Knicks series _ through four games, they're about 33 percent
down nationally from last year _ is because:
</P>
<P>
   A) There's No Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   B) Last year was a record rating, they're actually higher than
anticipated this season, and they're only slightly down from a more
fair comparison _ the '94 Rockets-Knicks series, which was Jordan's
first year on baseball sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   C) No MJ.
</P>
<P>
   D) It's that darn New York media market that always drags the
ratings down.
</P>
<P>
   E) No M. Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably aced it by picking A, C or E. And NBC's spin on
it goes with answer B. But can you believe some of those overquoted
``media experts'' who've actually come up with the answer D?
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line is that these all-too-overrated ratings have been
better than anything else on TV right now as rerun summer begins.
Each of the four games has been the most-watched primetime show of
the night, as will tonight's (hopefully) series-ending Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, who can accurately analyze any part of this aborted NBA
season anyhow? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
_NHL broadcast partner ESPN did not sugarcoat the controversial
in-the-crease goal after the end of Game 6 in Saturday night's NHL
Stanley Cup Finals between Dallas and Buffalo. Following about 20
minutes of Dallas celebration coverage, Gary Thorne came back with
the report about Buffalo's dispute of the goal and called it ``the
worst way the NHL could've even thought to end this game.'' Analyst
Barry Melrose drew on his experience from the rule violation called
against his Kings in Game 2 of the '93 Finals _ ``that was a rule
in the books, it was called and we had to live with it'' _ and said
repeatedly this non-call of a rule was ``the NHL's worst nightmare
come true.'' &QL; 
_Set the calendar for July 19: Joe McDonnell and Doug Krikorian
reunite on a regular sports-talk show again thanks to One-on-One
Sports' L.A. affiliate KCTD-AM 1540. Breaking from their usual feed
of syndicated programming out of Chicago, the station has plans to
run McDonnell-Krikorian in a 1-to-5 p.m. slot. &QL; 
_It's with great pleasure to report that Fox Sports News' Keith
Olbermann did not perform ``Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' at
Wrigley Field nearly two Sundays ago as originally scheduled. He
said after considering the whole thing, he wanted no part of it and
canceled a few days prior. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
_NHL broadcast partner ESPN, in what appeared to be a goodwill
gesture after its coverage the night before, had this come out of
the mouth of ``SportsCenter'' anchor Jack Edwards on Sunday
morning: ``If you saw all six games of this series, and you still
don't like hockey, you better try another sport. But if you didn't
see all six games, you get another chance to get hooked when they
drop the puck in October right here on ESPN.'' &QL; 
_Bob Stevens' comb-over. &QL; 
_Finally, ESPN has decided to move its annual ESPY Awards to their
rightful place _ Las Vegas _ starting next year. ``Like the ESPYs,
Las Vegas has been evolving,'' ESPN president George Bodenheimer
said in a press release. ``It's now more than an entertainment
capital, becoming more popular with vacationers and families every
year.'' Obviously, the verb he meant to use in that quote was
devolving. &QL; 
_This whole Latin crossover mania _ KTLA Channel 5 has picked
Claudia Trejos, the sports director at Spanish-language KWHY
Channel 22, as its new weekend sports anchor/reporter to replace
the shoved-out Ed Arnold. We're more than happy to see females get
work in this city. And we know we're risking bodily harm from the
fact that the Colombia native has 13 brothers (she's one of 17 kids
in her family). But que?

GAME BLOCKER TO BE INSTALLED ON WINDOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., Conn., Calif.)   (af)  
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. plans to introduce a feature in its Windows
operating system allowing users to determine what kinds of games
can be played on the computer. Such a feature could enable parents
to keep a game with gruesome violence, offensive language or nudity
from being played, based on the game's content rating.
</P>
<P>
   The option, to be included in the next release of Windows, will
be similar to a feature on Microsoft's Web browser that can be used
to block access to some sites, said Kevin Bachus, a multimedia
group product manager at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   With the computer and video game industry under siege because of
concerns about marketing violent content to children, Microsoft's
offering could represent the most widespread program available for
parents to use to limit their children's exposure to games they
consider unsuitable.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said that the new release of Windows would be
available sometime next year. It is to be installed on all new
personal computers that run the Windows operating system and will
be available for purchase as an upgrade for most of the nation's
more than 60 million home computers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is in discussions with the Entertainment Software
Rating Board and the Recreational Software Advisory Council, the
primary groups that rate games, to incorporate their ratings into a
data base on which the feature would rely, Bachus said.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings from other organizations, such as religious or
educational groups, could be added as well, and parents would be
able to assign their own ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also trying to encourage game makers to embed code
information on ratings in new games. Ratings now appear on game
packaging and covers of software; they are not coded into the games
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The participation of the rating groups and game makers could be
the key to the success of the feature. So far, no game makers have
agreed to embed ratings in their new games, but executives at
several companies, including GT Interactive Software, Mindscape
Entertainment, Acclaim Entertainment and Interplay Entertainment,
said their companies would consider doing so.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, computer games represented approximately 40 percent of
the game software market, according to PC Data, a Reston, Va.,
research firm. Games using the Windows operating system accounted
for about 90 percent of the computer-game total.
</P>
<P>
   But console-based games, such as those played on Sony, Sega and
Nintendo systems, make up the bulk of the game software market,
which is estimated at $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Bachus said Microsoft had been working on the feature, expected
to be called Windows Game Manager, for more than a year. To
activate it, users would follow a series of prompts that let them
designate which content is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Access to games based on ratings or titles could be limited
based on user names, or a password, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The application could also be used to prohibit the running of
unrated games, thus providing some control over the use of games
that users have not entered into the system, Bachus said.
</P>
<P>
   One former game developer expressed skepticism about whether
Microsoft would be able to maintain the security of the
application.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after it's available, there's going to be a ton of
hackers trying to get around it,'' said Howard Schwartz, chief
executive of Heynetwork.com, a family entertainment Internet site
based in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a matter of possible,'' he said. ``If
people can put macro-viruses into Microsoft Word, I think there
will be a crack in this. No matter what Microsoft tries to do, it's
going to be easy to crack.''
</P>
<P>
   About three years ago, the National Institute on Media and the
Family developed its own video and computer game rating system. The
ratings are only available on the organization's World Wide Web
site, but the group would welcome a chance for broader
distribution, David Walsh, the institute's founder, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feedback we get is very positive,'' Walsh said. ``We would
be very interested in partnering with anyone to make the ratings
more widely available.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's rating system, called Kidscore, is based on how much
violence is contained in a game and how it is portrayed, the amount
of sex and nudity, as well as identifying any content that might
scare children. Thus far, the organization has rated more than 150
games.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's efforts do not represent the first attempts to limit
access to violent games.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bethesda Softworks created a parental control system
called Childgard for its games, like Dagger Fall, a medieval
role-playing game. The feature lets parents control the level of
violence on a scale ranging from realistic to nonrealistic,
containing blood or bloodless.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1997 Acclaim included a control feature in its first
version of Turok, a first-person shooting game in which a Native
American hunts dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. For both
the console and computer versions, players can elect to eliminate
the use of blood.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which primarily makes console games, may consider
encoding games with ratings, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to recent concerns about violent games, Interplay,
an Irvine, Calif., game manufacturer, postponed the release of a
new game, Kingpin, Life of Crime. Packaging for the game, which
combines elements of gang and Mafia warfare, now includes warning
information in larger detail about the game's mature rating, its
violence and language content, said Kirk Green, an Interplay
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, players can set controls to play a less or more
violent version of the game. At the low-violence level, there is no
blood, no dismemberment and foul language is not heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to go out of our way to make sure people are informed
and aware of what the game is about,'' Green said. The feature may
be included in future games designated for players older than 17,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though unfamiliar with Microsoft plans, Green said, Interplay
would also consider embedding ratings information in its games.
``We'd have to look at exactly what it would entail, but the idea
is a good one,'' he said.

A SECOND GUN CHARGE FILED IN LITTLETON CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ A man already charged with selling the handgun used in
the killings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., was
charged on Wednesday with another firearms violation, possession of
a shotgun with a sawed-off barrel and stock.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor said Thursday that on March 6, friends videotaped
the man, Mark Manes, 22, shooting the shotgun in the foothills
south of Littleton with two Columbine seniors, Dylan Klebold and
Eric Harris. Six weeks later, the two students used the shotgun in
the school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   It is illegal to use a shotgun with a barrel shorter than 18
inches. Last month, Manes was charged with providing Klebold and
Harris with the semiautomatic handgun used in the shootings, a
Tec-DC9. Providing a handgun to a minor and the possession charge
are felonies. If convicted on both counts, he could be sentenced to
nine years in prison.

SUMMIT _ The San Francisco Chronicle has learned that federal
antitrust investigators are on the verge of approving a
controversial East Bay hospital merger, leaving it up to state
officials to decide whether to oppose the deal alone. The federal
decision will disappoint those who fear that the merger of
Oakland's Summit Medical Center with Berkeley's Alta Bates Medical
Center would less competition and higher prices for medical care.
It will also put added pressure on state Attorney General Bill
Lockyer to either oppose or amend the controversial deal.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Continuing the culture war that dominated the
debate on gun control and youth violence last week, the House of
Representatives this week fought its perennial battle over
flag-burning.
</P>
<P>
   In five hours of speeches over two days, one lawmaker after
another sharply criticized flag-burners, and the Supreme Court that
gave them license. Then, just as it did in 1995 and again in 1997,
the House voted Thursday to approve a constitutional amendment that
would overturn the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling in 1989 that laws
prohibiting desecration of the American flag are unconstitutional
infringements on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters of the amendment, mostly Republicans, clearly
relished the discomfort that the opponents, mostly Democrats, felt
in voting against a measure that polls show 80 percent of Americans
favor.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, 305-124, was well in excess of the two-thirds majority
needed to approve a constitutional amendment. But as everyone in
the House knew, the debate was for political exercise and the vote
was for naught.
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional amendment also requires a two-thirds vote of
the Senate. All 100 senators have declared their position, and only
65 are in favor of the amendment, two shy of two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   No end is in sight to debates and votes in the House on matters
grounded in conservative principles. A week ago, the House voted to
enourage the display of the Ten Commandments in public schools.
Next week, the House will consider legislation that would make it a
federal crime to take a minor across state lines for an abortion
without notifying her parents. There may also be a vote later in
the year on a constitutional amendment that would permit organized
prayer in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the gun-control debate, when the House floor was
often crowded, few people were present for the debate on
flag-burning, and the arguments were the familiar ones given year
after year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed amendment states: ``The Congress shall have power
to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the supporters were emotional. ``I ask members to give
themselves a vision, Iwo Jima, and the men that put up that
American flag,'' declared Rep. Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, R-Calif.,
one of the chief sponsors of the amendment. ``Now allow some hippie
to go up there and burn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were more legalistic. Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla.,
argued that the Supreme Court had ruled that obscene and physically
threatening speech was not protected by the First Amendment and
that flag-burning could also be outlawed without damaging the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argued that flag-burning was not a problem _ only 72
cases have been reported in this decade, said Rep. John Conyers,
D-Mich. _ and that the First Amendment should not be tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I abhor flag-burners,'' said Rep. Melvin L. Watt, D-N.C.,
adding: ``I am here to defend the First Amendment. I am here to
defend the freedom of expression. I am here to defend the right of
people who have views that are contrary to mine to express those
views.''
</P>
<P>
   On the final vote, 210 Republicans and 95 Democrats voted to
amend the Constitution. Voting ``no'' were 10 Republicans, 113
Democrats and one Independent.
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional amendment must be approved by three-quarters of
the state legislatures, but 49 states _ all but Vermont _ have
passed measures expressing support for a flag amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Senate voted on the amendment was in 1995. The
vote in favor was 63-36, or three votes short of two-thirds. (There
was a vacancy.) Last year, a count showed that the amendment was
three votes shy, and no vote was taken.
</P>
<P>
   In November, three senators who favor the amendment were elected
to replace senators who had voted against it. But two opponents,
Charles Schumer of New York and John Edwards of North Carolina,
both Democrats, defeated senators who had voted for it. So the
proponents needed two more votes.

STUDENT STRIKE JARS MEXICO CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The student strike at Mexico's biggest university
began on April 20 as a protest against a plan by the administration
to make those who could afford it pay tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Seven long weeks later, the university's president, Francisco
Barnes de Castro, admitted defeat and agreed to make all tuition
payments voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Most people thought that would put an end to the protests, but
to the shock of the administration, the strikers at the National
Autonomous University of Mexico, the largest institution of higher
education in Latin America, were still not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The strike, which closed down classrooms for 270,000 students,
is now in its third month and shows no sign of moving toward
resolution. Mobilizations for and against it have spilled over from
the campus into the streets of the capital city. The strike
movement has escaped the control of national political and
intellectual leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable core of angry students is seeking to use the strike to
gain new power within the university and resist Mexico's decade-old
shift away from a costly welfare state toward lean government and
private enterprise. Many of Mexico's most prominent scholars,
however, have turned against the shutdown and warned that it could
permanently cripple the university.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, President Ernesto Zedillo made it clear that the
strike at the university has become a pressing national concern. He
called it ``brutal aggression'' against the university that is
``hurting the enormous majority who want to study to get ahead.''
But Zedillo said he would continue to support the administration in
seeking to solve the strike peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' original plan was to require students with economic
means to pay about $150 tuition for a year. The current fees amount
to only a few cents. But even though a governing council at the
university voted to cancel any obligatory tuition payments, the
strikers refused to lift the shutdown until all fees were
eliminated. Many financially-strapped departments collect small
fees for the use of laboratories and computers.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers are also demanding elimination of recently
instituted admission and graduation examinations, and lifting of
the limits on the time students can remain enrolled before
graduating. They also want to restore automatic admission for
students from a network of high schools linked to the university,
which was canceled in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Their most ambitious demand is to convene a congress to
``refound'' the university, giving students equal power in
decisions with the administration and faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, education is not a commercial service _ it is one of
the social rights we won in Mexico over the last decades,'' said
Higinio Munoz, a science major who is a spokesman for the students'
strike committee. ``Now the government wants to take that away from
us with a stroke of the pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides resorted this week to public displays of strength. On
Wednesday some 15,000 high-spirited strikers, many with their faces
grease-painted in the red and black strike colors, broke into the
university stadium and held a rally to proclaim their determination
to continue the shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   At one point two dozen young men stood up in a chorus line in
the bleachers, each with a letter painted on his naked chest
forming the words ``Long live the strike!'' They raised a frenzy of
approval when they turned around, spelling a vulgar insult to the
mother of the university president, Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, a group of faculty women at the university
hung banners from overpasses on a major highway through the
capital, calling on drivers to turn on their headlights if they
opposed the strike. Thousands of cars lit up.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning another student crowd, slightly smaller and
more heavily middle class than the crowd of strikers, turned out in
a central plaza downtown to call for the strike to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already done our part,'' Barnes told them in a
resolute speech. ``We already reached the agreements that could end
this conflict. There are no more excuses. The strike has got to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   In a communique marking the end of two months of the strike on
June 22, the protest leaders laid out their worldview, at once
cocky and defensive. They described Barnes and the Mexican
government as tools of a campaign by global organizations like the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to destroy public
education in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   They accused the administration of building a ``repressive
police apparatus'' within the university, pointing to a network of
video cameras recently installed around the campus. Administration
officials said the cameras were to help combat the wave of common
crime which has swept the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has become a problem for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
Solorzano, the left-of-center opposition mayor of Mexico City, who
is expected to run for president in national elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   At first, leaders of Cardenas' Party of the Democratic
Revolution, several of whom were once student activists themselves,
openly supported the strike, although they denied that they aided
it with resources from the city government.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 10 the strikers, led by some of their most militant
leaders, went outside the campus in street marches that snarled
traffic for hours on several of Mexico City's busiest
thoroughfares. Many city residents, already skeptical about the
strike, were furious at Cardenas, believing that he encouraged the
disruption.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas and other leaders of his party seem to have lost the
influence over the strikers they once enjoyed. Increasingly, the
huge all-night assemblies where the students decide their moves
have been dominated by activists from small socialist groups,
dubbed ``ultras'' by other students within the strike movement.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of students continued their studies in off-campus
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   University officials said that at least 162,500 students, or
about 65 percent of the undergraduates, were able to complete their
work for the semester.

 _ SF CHRON  
 East Bay Hospital Merger Nearing Federal Approval  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal antitrust regulators are leaning toward approval of a
hotly contested hospital merger in the East Bay, leaving it up to
state officials to decide whether to oppose the deal on the grounds
that it could diminish competition and raise hospital prices.
</P>
<P>
   Informed sources told The Chronicle that, after a three-month
investigation, the Federal Trade Commission seems poised to allow
Oakland's Summit Medical Center to merge with Berkeley's Alta Bates
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Summit is the East Bay's largest hospital. Alta Bates, which is
part of the Sacramento-based Sutter Health chain, is the
second-largest hospital in Alameda and Contra Costa counties.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would make Sutter the East Bay's most powerful
hospital chain. A Chronicle computer analysis shows that it would
control 28 percent of hospital patients in the two-county area, and
44 percent of patients in the triangle of East Bay cities from
Hercules to San Leandro to Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   If the FTC does approve the merger, it will put heat on state
Attorney General Bill Lockyer to block the deal under state law.
Lockyer is under pressure from East Bay elected officials, who fear
a Sutter stranglehold on hospital care if Sutter swallows Summit
and Kaiser follows through on its announced plan to close its
Oakland hospital and divert thousands of patients to Summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be concerned when you have an organization such as
Sutter controlling 50 percent of patient days in Alameda County, 60
percent in Oakland and 70 percent in Berkeley,'' said Supervisor
Keith Carson, whose district includes the heart of the Summit-Alta
Bates territory.
</P>
<P>
   An FTC spokeswoman said the agency never comments on
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But a source at Sutter Health said an announcement of the FTC
decision could come as early as today or sometime during the &LR;   &LR; next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter Executive Vice President Pat Fry and Summit Chief
Executive Irwin Hansen have been in Washington, D.C., this week,
trying to persuade FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky and his three
fellow commissioners to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really feel bringing together Summit and Alta Bates in the
Sutter Health system is the best decision for this community,''
said Summit spokeswoman Nancy Happel.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is still quite fluid and there remains a chance
the FTC could still raise some objection to the deal. ``After all
the effort they've put into this, it's not easy for regulators to
walk away,'' said Glenn Melnick, a health care finance professor at
the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust attorneys have been watching the Summit-Alta Bates
investigation for clues as to how the federal regulators feds &LR; 
 &LR; will assess future hospital mergers _ at a time when industry
critics say such consolidations will lead to spark  &LR; higher medical
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision will have national echoes,'' said Karen
Silverman Johnson, an antitrust attorney in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the federal government the feds have  &LR; has had
little luck stopping hospital mergers in the past. Although the
U.S. hospital industry has averaged 200 mergers a year for several
years running, government attorneys have taken only 11 deals to
federal court since 1984 _ and they  &LR; lost six of them.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of SUMMIT25 (93157 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Moreover, the government racked up this dismal record even though
its past challenges mainly involved mergers in rural areas _ where
hospitals are few and far between, Johnson said. To challenge a
deal in the East Bay, where 22 hospitals dot the Alameda and Contra
Costa landscape, would force the government feds  &LR; _ which hasn't
who haven't  &LR; won many in the countryside _ to fight in a one of the
country's largest metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the key variable affecting antitrust decisions is
how government attorneys define the size of East Bay hospital
market. If they decide the market is the ``inner'' East Bay, the
merger would raise greater fears of a monopoly than if all of
Alameda and Contra Costa counties were considered a single hospital
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   A Chronicle computer analysis illustrates the tough calls
federal and state officials have had to make in determining whether
a Summit-Alta Bates merger would give Sutter the market power to
stifle competition, raise hospital prices or decrease services.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis reviewed a state database of all 210,499 patients
who were treated in the 22 acute care hospitals in Alameda and
Contra Costa counties in 1997, the most recent year for which data
are available.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's computations &UR;  &LR; grouped the 22 hospitals into four
chains, plus a fifth category made up of hospitals that are either
independent or have no other affiliates in the target area. An
assumption was made that the merger had gone through and that
Summit and Alta Bates were part of Sutter.
</P>
<P>
   But calculating patient totals for each chain isn't enough.
Antitrust regulators must decide the boundaries of the competitive
market. If, for instance, they decide to include all 22 hospitals
in the two-county area, Sutter would control 28 percent of hospital
patients, probably not enough to warrant a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But if regulators define the market as the string of cities from
Hercules to San Leandro, and east to the Lamorinda hills, Sutter's
market share would be 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Should regulators adopt this smaller market and add Kaiser's
13,042 Oakland patients to Summit's total, Chronicle research shows
Sutter's share would grow to 58 percent _ a more worrisome total
from antitrust regulator's view.
</P>
<P>
   The most dogged critic of the Summit-Alta Bates merger has been
the Oakland-based Service Employees International Union Local 250,
which represents 1,065 workers at the two hospitals. SEIU has waged
a labor war against Sutter throughout Northern California and fears
job cuts in the event of a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of threatening strikes, SEIU has attacked Sutter's
merger plan with spreadsheets. SEIU President Sal Rosselli and
research director John Marshall have spent the past few months
immersed in the arcane formulas government antitrust lawyers use to
determine market boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The SEIU analysis, which shows a slightly smaller market than
the Chronicle analysis, eliminates two non-Sutter hospitals in San
Leandro, thus increasing Sutter's market share to more than
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of SUMMIT25 (93157 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``In Oakland it's a particular threat because of the monopoly
they'll have created'' if Kaiser sends its patients to Summit,
Rosselli said. ``People won't have the ability to go to Sutter's
competitors because there aren't any.''
</P>
<P>
   But merger supporters ridicule such an analysis. Wanda Jones, an
industry analyst with New Century Health Care in San Francisco,
said the Bay Area is becoming one big hospital market, as East Bay
patients routinely travel to San Francisco or the Peninsula to see
specialists at UCSF Stanford Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is very fluid and can't be demarcated by some
artificial government boundary,'' Jones said. ``People moan and
groan about mergers, but they don't step back to see the larger
picture. There are still too many hospitals with too many empty
beds, and more than enough competition to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutter spokesman Bill Gleeson said that no matter how the
government calculates market share, ``numbers don't tell the whole
story.'' He said government attorneys will also look at the
financial state of Summit and Alta Bates. The two hospitals get 70
percent of their patients from Medicare and Medi-Cal. Their overall
revenues declined last year, partly because of in part &LR;  due to
 &LR; federally imposed budget cuts. Both lost money in 1998 and project
even larger losses in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Merging Summit and Alta Bates, and eliminating administrative
overlap, is the best way to ensure the survival of both hospitals,
Gleeson said. Sutter will also argue that the government has
allowed two other recent mergers _ the UCSF Stanford Health Care
complex and the John Muir-Mount Diablo combine in eastern Contra
Costa County.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCSF Stanford is pulling patients away from us, so is
Muir-Diablo,'' Gleeson said, adding that competition is
particularly fierce for lucrative operations, like heart surgery.
``Right now, Summit and Alta Bates are at a huge disadvantage
because their competitors were allowed to merge.''
</P>
<P>
   If the FTC has accepted Sutter's arguments in favor of the
merger, it doesn't mean the deal has the final green light. State
antitrust officials must also approve the merger, and California
has shown some willingness to amend the terms of mergers federal
regulators the feds  &LR; have approved.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Columbia/HCA sought to acquire the Alexian
Brothers Hospital in San Jose, the state stopped the deal, after
the federal government feds  &LR; gave their  &LR; its blessing, until
Columbia promised to invest millions in hospital upgrades and local
charity care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other reason people are watching this is to see what the
state does,'' said Johnson. ``Alexian was the state's first effort
to take a more active and public role in hospital mergers,'' and if
it tries to stop or alter the Summit-Alta Bates deal, it would
signal California's intent to subject mergers to greater scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Lockyer's office declined to comment. But one
antitrust expert said it would be tough for the state to go into
court alone in an attempt to block a merger that has won federal
approval.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; tag  &LR;  Ramon McLeod of the Chronicle staff performed the
computer analysis.

 &HT;    Oft-maligned Spurs just a step from the summit
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For so long, they have been targets for ridicule,
absorbing enough verbal jabs from fans, media and opponents to
leave scars far beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson and Sean Elliott are too soft. Avery Johnson is
marginally talented. The San Antonio Spurs will never transcend
those flaws to win an NBA championship, even with superstar Tim
Duncan in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Then a strange thing happened. The Spurs kept winning games this
season, advancing farther than ever before. Now they lead New York
3-1 in the best-of-seven NBA Finals, and they can secure the
franchise's first championship with a victory tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' said Robinson, a 10-year veteran who has
earned everything _ scoring title, MVP, defensive player of the
year _ except a championship. ``I try not to think about it too
much because we still have a lot of work to do. But each game, I
was thinking, `We're four games away, we're three games away, we're
two games away, we're one game away.' You get a little bit more
excited and more excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about wiping out the past, individually and collectively. A
victory tonight, Sunday or Tuesday will validate the careers of
several Spurs players as well as the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' said Mario Elie, a former journeyman who won two
championships with the Houston Rockets. ``I told Dave yesterday,
`You can shut a lot of people up Friday night.'''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone has the right to aim counterpunches at their critics,
it is the Spurs. But don't expect much of that from them _ it's not
in their nature. R.C. Buford, the Spurs' director of scouting, said
he does not foresee gloating by players or from Gregg Popovich, the
no-nonsense, often gruff coach whom many fans and some reporters
have never liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not how we built this team,'' Buford said. ``And it's
mostly through his Popovich's direction.''
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, fans and reporters seem to have fallen
for the Spurs, particularly Robinson and Johnson, citing them as
the antithesis of everything Americans find distasteful about rich,
spoiled, egotistical athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Fans watching the NBC telecast of game four on Wednesday heard
announcer Bob Costas say that he witnessed Robinson receiving an
ovation from Knicks fans in a New York restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Popovich said Robinson never talks about what a championship
would mean to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we all know,'' Popovich said, ``if we are fortunate enough
to get this done, it would provide me with the greatest
satisfaction personally to see Sean and Avery and David in a room
celebrating. To be around when they finally do it will be an
amazing experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his own vindication as a coach who might have been
fired if the Spurs had struggled beyond their 6-8 start, Popovich
said, ``I'm not trying to be humble. Everyone likes credit to some
degree, but they took me to the NBA Finals. I didn't take them.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie said he joined a ``special group'' of players this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys that get along,'' Elie said. ``We care about each other,
cheer each other on, share the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that can be attributed to a lack of pedigree. Most of
the Spurs emerged from relatively modest basketball backgrounds,
even Duncan and Robinson. Elliott is the only former McDonald's
All-American in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Elie played in smaller leagues around the world before gaining
entrance to the NBA at age 27. Johnson has been with five teams in
11 seasons. The Spurs let him go twice. Jaren Jackson bounced
around the NBA and minor leagues more than a game ball. When he
joined the Spurs last season, it was his eighth NBA team in as many
years.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has played only for the Spurs, but no one has been
slammed harder. Criticism is an occupational hazard for great
athletes who fail to win championships. Even Michael Jordan and
John Elway were targets during the years before they won. Robinson
has the added burden of his demeanor, said the Spurs' Will Perdue,
a former teammate of Jordan's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone questioned David's heart and desire because he's not
an emotional guy,'' Perdue said. ``I think that was wrong. When we
were in Chicago, Michael took some hits because people said he was
too much of an individual player. No one questioned his heart and
desire, but they said he'd never win a championship because he
wouldn't play team basketball. So it seems that no matter who you
are, they find something wrong with you.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Bulls lost, Jordan sometimes blamed his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``David never blamed anyone,'' Perdue said. ``Whether his
teammates were inadequate, or they weren't good enough to help him
win a championship, he never pointed a finger at anybody. He
pointed it at himself. That just increased the criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Robinson and the Spurs have a chance to celebrate their
first championship, although they expect another difficult game
with New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to see them popping champagne bottles on our
court,'' the Knicks' Kurt Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Nice guys that the Spurs are, they would probably clean up after
themselves.

 _ SF CHRON  
 East Bay Hospital Merger Nearing Federal Approval  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal antitrust regulators are leaning toward approval of a
hotly contested hospital merger in the East Bay, leaving it up to
state officials to decide whether to oppose the deal on the grounds
that it could diminish competition and raise hospital prices.
</P>
<P>
   Informed sources told The Chronicle that, after a three-month
investigation, the Federal Trade Commission seems poised to allow
Oakland's Summit Medical Center to merge with Berkeley's Alta Bates
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Summit is the East Bay's largest hospital. Alta Bates, which is
part of the Sacramento-based Sutter Health chain, is the
second-largest hospital in Alameda and Contra Costa counties.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would make Sutter the East Bay's most powerful
hospital chain. A Chronicle computer analysis shows that it would
control 28 percent of hospital patients in the two-county area, and
44 percent of patients in the triangle of East Bay cities from
Hercules to San Leandro to Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   If the FTC does approve the merger, it will put heat on state
Attorney General Bill Lockyer to block the deal under state law.
Lockyer is under pressure from East Bay elected officials, who fear
a Sutter stranglehold on hospital care if Sutter swallows Summit
and Kaiser follows through on its announced plan to close its
Oakland hospital and divert thousands of patients to Summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be concerned when you have an organization such as
Sutter controlling 50 percent of patient days in Alameda County, 60
percent in Oakland and 70 percent in Berkeley,'' said Supervisor
Keith Carson, whose district includes the heart of the Summit-Alta
Bates territory.
</P>
<P>
   An FTC spokeswoman said the agency never comments on
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But a source at Sutter Health said an announcement of the FTC
decision could come as early as today or sometime during the &LR;   &LR; next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter Executive Vice President Pat Fry and Summit Chief
Executive Irwin Hansen have been in Washington, D.C., this week,
trying to persuade FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky and his three
fellow commissioners to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really feel bringing together Summit and Alta Bates in the
Sutter Health system is the best decision for this community,''
said Summit spokeswoman Nancy Happel.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is still quite fluid and there remains a chance
the FTC could still raise some objection to the deal. ``After all
the effort they've put into this, it's not easy for regulators to
walk away,'' said Glenn Melnick, a health care finance professor at
the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust attorneys have been watching the Summit-Alta Bates
investigation for clues as to how the federal regulators feds &LR; 
 &LR; will assess future hospital mergers _ at a time when industry
critics say such consolidations will lead to spark  &LR; higher medical
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision will have national echoes,'' said Karen
Silverman Johnson, an antitrust attorney in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the federal government the feds have  &LR; has had
little luck stopping hospital mergers in the past. Although the
U.S. hospital industry has averaged 200 mergers a year for several
years running, government attorneys have taken only 11 deals to
federal court since 1984 _ and lost six of them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the government racked up this dismal record even
though its past challenges mainly involved mergers in rural areas _
where hospitals are few and far between, Johnson said. To challenge
a deal in the East Bay, where 22 hospitals dot the Alameda and
Contra Costa landscape, would force the government feds  &LR; _ which
hasn't who haven't  &LR; won many in the countryside _ to fight in a one
of the country's largest metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the key variable affecting antitrust decisions is
how government attorneys define the size of East Bay hospital
market. If they decide the market is the ``inner'' East Bay, the
merger would raise greater fears of a monopoly than if all of
Alameda and Contra Costa counties were considered a single hospital
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   A Chronicle computer analysis illustrates the tough calls
federal and state officials have had to make in determining whether
a Summit-Alta Bates merger would give Sutter the market power to
stifle competition, raise hospital prices or decrease services.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis reviewed a state database of all 210,499 patients
who were treated in the 22 acute care hospitals in Alameda and
Contra Costa counties in 1997, the most recent year for which data
are available.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's computations &UR;  &LR; grouped the 22 hospitals into four
chains, plus a fifth category made up of hospitals that are either
independent or have no other affiliates in the target area. An
assumption was made that the merger had gone through and that
Summit and Alta Bates were part of Sutter.
</P>
<P>
   But calculating patient totals for each chain isn't enough.
Antitrust regulators must decide the boundaries of the competitive
market. If, for instance, they decide to include all 22 hospitals
in the two-county area, Sutter would control 28 percent of hospital
patients, probably not enough to warrant a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But if regulators define the market as the string of cities from
Hercules to San Leandro, and east to the Lamorinda hills, Sutter's
market share would be 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Should regulators adopt this smaller market and add Kaiser's
13,042 Oakland patients to Summit's total, Chronicle research shows
Sutter's share would grow to 58 percent _ a more worrisome total
from antitrust regulator's view.
</P>
<P>
   The most dogged critic of the Summit-Alta Bates merger has been
the Oakland-based Service Employees International Union Local 250,
which represents 1,065 workers at the two hospitals. SEIU has waged
a labor war against Sutter throughout Northern California and fears
job cuts in the event of a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of threatening strikes, SEIU has attacked Sutter's
merger plan with spreadsheets. SEIU President Sal Rosselli and
research director John Marshall have spent the past few months
immersed in the arcane formulas government antitrust lawyers use to
determine market boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The SEIU analysis, which shows a slightly smaller market than
the Chronicle analysis, eliminates two non-Sutter hospitals in San
Leandro, thus increasing Sutter's market share to more than
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Oakland it's a particular threat because of the monopoly
they'll have created'' if Kaiser sends its patients to Summit,
Rosselli said. ``People won't have the ability to go to Sutter's
competitors because there aren't any.''
</P>
<P>
   But merger supporters ridicule such an analysis. Wanda Jones, an
industry analyst with New Century Health Care in San Francisco,
said the Bay Area is becoming one big hospital market, as East Bay
patients routinely travel to San Francisco or the Peninsula to see
specialists at UCSF Stanford Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is very fluid and can't be demarcated by some
artificial government boundary,'' Jones said. ``People moan and
groan about mergers, but they don't step back to see the larger
picture. There are still too many hospitals with too many empty
beds, and more than enough competition to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutter spokesman Bill Gleeson said that no matter how the
government calculates market share, ``numbers don't tell the whole
story.'' He said government attorneys will also look at the
financial state of Summit and Alta Bates. The two hospitals get 70
percent of their patients from Medicare and Medi-Cal. Their overall
revenues declined last year, partly because of in part &LR;  due to
 &LR; federally imposed budget cuts. Both lost money in 1998 and project
even larger losses in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Merging Summit and Alta Bates, and eliminating administrative
overlap, is the best way to ensure the survival of both hospitals,
Gleeson said. Sutter will also argue that the government has
allowed two other recent mergers _ the UCSF Stanford Health Care
complex and the John Muir-Mount Diablo combine in eastern Contra
Costa County.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCSF Stanford is pulling patients away from us, so is
Muir-Diablo,'' Gleeson said, adding that competition is
particularly fierce for lucrative operations, like heart surgery.
``Right now, Summit and Alta Bates are at a huge disadvantage
because their competitors were allowed to merge.''
</P>
<P>
   If the FTC has accepted Sutter's arguments in favor of the
merger, it doesn't mean the deal has the final green light. State
antitrust officials must also approve the merger, and California
has shown some willingness to amend the terms of mergers federal
regulators the feds  &LR; have approved.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Columbia/HCA sought to acquire the Alexian
Brothers Hospital in San Jose, the state stopped the deal, after
the federal government feds  &LR; gave their  &LR; its blessing, until
Columbia promised to invest millions in hospital upgrades and local
charity care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other reason people are watching this is to see what the
state does,'' said Johnson. ``Alexian was the state's first effort
to take a more active and public role in hospital mergers,'' and if
it tries to stop or alter the Summit-Alta Bates deal, it would
signal California's intent to subject mergers to greater scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Lockyer's office declined to comment. But one
antitrust expert said it would be tough for the state to go into
court alone in an attempt to block a merger that has won federal
approval.

FORBES SAYS BUSH BROKE `NO TAX INCREASE' PROMISE TO TEXANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes
challenged George W. Bush's anti-tax credentials Thursday, accusing
the Texas governor of proposing 75 tax increases during the 1997
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The tax increases that Forbes cited were part of a proposed $4
billion tax swap, which Bush supported, that also would have
sharply cut school property taxes in Texas. Forbes did not point
out the trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   Bush lobbied Republican legislators for the controversial plan,
drafted by a House committee, that expanded sales and business
taxes to dozens of new items. It was approved by the full House but
died in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning across the country in the last few weeks, Bush has
touted the nearly $2.9 billion in tax cuts approved by Texas
lawmakers while he has been governor. They include $1 billion in
school-tax relief, eventually approved in 1997, and $1.85 billion
in tax cuts enacted this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says they amount to the largest tax cuts in Texas history.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has promised that, if elected president, he would veto
any increase in federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes, a magazine publisher badly trailing front-runner
Bush in the polls for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination,
said the Texas governor broke an anti-tax promise he made during
his first gubernatorial campaign in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for people to know that in his 1994 campaign,
Mr. Bush took a pledge not to raise taxes. Then, in 1997, Gov. Bush
broke his pledge by proposing 75 tax increases,'' Forbes said in a
written statement issued in Indianapolis by his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 campaign, Bush signed a pledge offered by a group
called Taxpayers for Accountability promising to oppose the
creation of a personal income tax or an increase in the sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, after speaking to Hispanic community leaders in the
Mexican Town section of Detroit, dismissed Forbes' criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just trying to get in the news,'' Bush said. ``I've
signed the two largest tax cuts in the state's history, and, as you
know, I proposed a plan that would have reduced taxes by $6 billion
at a cost of $5 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   About 200 Hispanic community leaders filled a small park to hear
Bush speak Wednesday. They turned out, they said, at the request of
Michigan Gov. John Engler, who has targeted the Mexican Town area
for economic redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Engler's wife, Michelle, a native of San Antonio, introduced
Bush to the crowd in Spanish, and Bush opened his speech in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the crowd that he wants to make sure everyone in
America has access to a good education and economic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush later said he plans to court traditionally Democratic
Hispanic voters as a basic part of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won between 40 percent and 49 percent of the Hispanic vote
in Texas in his 1998 re-election campaign, a record for a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message has got to be the American dream is meant for
(Hispanics) as well,'' Bush said. ``My first stop in Michigan, an
important battleground state, is right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Varela, a local plant manager, said, ``I know he has
helped the Hispanic people who live in Texas. I don't see why he
won't help the Hispanic people in the rest of the United States,''
said Varela, who added that he usually votes Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 session, Bush made property-tax relief and a more
equitable tax system his key goals. He proposed a plan that would
have cut school property taxes by $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the cuts would have come through $1 billion in state
budgetary savings. But the governor also proposed a one-half cent
per dollar increase in the state sales tax and a new
business-activity tax to raise enough money to help make the school
tax cuts possible.
</P>
<P>
   His business-activity tax would have replaced the
corporate-franchise tax and would have applied to all forms of
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush argued that his proposal would have created a fairer state
tax system, but it was too controversial for the Legislature. So a
House committee drafted a substitute, which the governor supported.
</P>
<P>
   The House plan would have used $1 billion in budgetary savings,
plus state-tax increases of about $4 billion, to cut school
property taxes on Texans' homes by about $5 billion. Many
homeowners would have seen their school taxes cut almost in half.
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected the governor's proposals for a new
business-activity tax and an increase in the sales-tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the school-tax relief for homeowners, the House
plan would have expanded the corporate-franchise tax to
partnerships, would have added numerous untaxed items and services
to the sales tax, and would have imposed or increased a number of
other business-related taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the ``75 tax increases'' that Forbes accused Bush of
proposing. Legislative researchers could not immediately confirm
that all the individual taxes listed by Forbes were actually in the
House bill. At least one was not. But most were _ items as varied
as expansion of the corporate-franchise tax to partnerships, higher
cigarette and alcohol taxes, higher taxes on aviation fuel, and new
taxes on massages and solar-energy businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature then simply increased the homestead exemption
for school-property taxes by $10,000, which saved the average Texas
homeowner about $140 a year on school taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, that amounted to $1 billion for the 1998-99 budget
period, the amount that Bush now claims as property-tax relief from
the 1997 legislative session.

 _ SF CHRON  
 `Extreme' Athletes to Show S.F. Their Stuff  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
America's suits will rub shoulders with America's youth at the X
Games this weekend _ and the suits are shelling out millions of
dollars for the opportunity.
<P>
   The fifth annual summer X Games, which showcase unconventional
sports such as skysurfing, aggressive in-line skating and street
luge, begin today on San Francisco's Piers 30 and 32.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen sponsors, including AT&AMP;T and Mountain Dew, paid the
event's creator, cable sports network ESPN, $22 million for the
right to hang stadium signs, operate booths at the event, and show
commercials during television broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The package, for which six ``gold'' sponsors paid $2 million
each and 10 associate sponsors forked over $1 million, includes
related events such as the winter X Games and add-ons like links on
the ESPN Web site. Marketers pay extra to actually produce the ads
and freebies.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN will award close to $1 million to winning athletes during
the nine-day event, which ends July 3. But the real prize is an
estimated $100 billion spent by U.S. teens each year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Blue chip marketers invest in the X Games because they attract
an unusually concentrated youth audience and provide a coolness
factor that sponsors hope will rub off on their brands.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of game attendees, who totaled 233,000 at last year's
San Diego event, are 21 or younger, according to Performance
Research of Newport, R.I. Seventy percent of the crowd is male.
</P>
<P>
   The home audience for the event is also youth- and male-heavy.
For every 100 households watching the games in prime time, there
are 50 males ages 12 to 34, according to ESPN. That compares to 38
young males watching NFL football.
</P>
<P>
   Even though X Games viewership is small _ fewer than 1 percent
of cable-watching  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; c,14p10 lwrap  &LR;  households tune in _ the event is important to
marketers because young people are hard to reach. Despite their
slacker reputations, teenagers actually watch less television than
older people and children, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, youth marketing is laden with potential pitfalls.
Companies that wind up looking corporate instead of cool can easily
tarnish their brands among notoriously cynical young people.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers need to be actively involved in the event, rather than
simply hanging signs and running ads, ``so kids don't smell a rat
and say, `Oh, they're just trying to sell me something,''' advised
Sarah Haynes, chief executive of Onboard Entertainment in
Sausalito.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes warned marketers to avoid ``any campaign with a loud,
obnoxious, wacky vibe, which is kind of old.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the term ``extreme'' sports, ``which sounds crazy or
dangerous or stupid,'' is being replaced with the term ``action''
sports, she said. ``These athletes take these sports very
seriously. They look at them as core sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Brands such as Mountain Dew that have successfully aligned
themselves with youth and sports over the years seem to have a
natural advantage at the X Games.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 Performance Research survey, for example, 92 percent
of game attendees remembered that Mountain Dew was a sponsor and 80
percent named Nike, but only 62 percent mentioned AT&AMP;T and 55
percent recalled Chevy Trucks.
</P>
<P>
   (Nike dropped its sponsorship two years ago and Adidas is now
the sole footwear sponsor.)
</P>
<P>
   X Games sponsors have developed a variety of strategies to
appeal to youth without looking like exploitive capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR;  Visa, which is based in Foster City, is hawking credit
cards with X Games images on the front and giving away water
bottles to all college-age youths who apply for the card. Visa will
also promote its Rankit.com Web site, which provides financial
advice to young people, through a sweepstakes offering scooters as
prizes.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of XGAMES25 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``We're making a connection between the X Games and Rankit, and
that translates to brand loyalty,'' said Visa spokesman Lorne
Fisher. By being an X Games sponsor, ``You tie it in with this
cool, hip event, which is growing in popularity, and you get a
captive audience.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is using the X Games to promote its collect-call number,
800-CALL-ATT, which is used largely by young people. Market
research shows that AT&AMP;T's previous X Games sponsorships increased
awareness of the number _ and collect callers ``use the last number
they see,'' said Howard McNally, president of transaction services
for AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; uncx  &LR;  The primary benefit for AT&AMP;T, though, ``is to get our
brand in with the teenage crowd that will be (paying the phone
bills) when they grow up,'' said McNally.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T was forced to rethink its traditionally conservative
approach to advertising when it became an X Games sponsor three
years ago, McNally said. It now uses spokespeople like actor David
Arquette and features a rap jingle in a radio ad _ strategies that
would hardly be considered revolutionary for many marketers but
were a big change for AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing things now that we never would have done three
years ago, and that makes some people inside AT&AMP;T nervous,'' said
McNally.
</P>
<P>
   Adidas, another X Games sponsor, risks being seen as a
``poser,'' since it only recently began selling shoes for
extreme-sports athletes.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid appearing too commercial, the company is limiting its
signage to about half of what it is entitled to, said Aaron Leeb,
events project manager.
</P>
<P>
   In partnership with the X Games, Adidas hosts field trips for
low-income youth to talk with professional athletes and coaches,
Leeb said. Such activities are designed to demonstrate that the
company cares about athletes and isn't just out to make a buck.
</P>
<P>
   Even the stodgy U.S. Postal Service is getting into the act with
an X Games commemorative stamp. ``Stamp collecting has become the
focus mostly of older folks, especially white, older men,'' said
USPS spokesman Don Smeraldi. ``We're trying to attract kids and a
more general audience with more contemporary subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of XGAMES25 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  USPS benefits from stamp collectors because every stamp that is
not used is pure profit for the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN, which created the games back in 1995, also faces a
marketing challenge. MTV recently launched an annual music and
extreme games festival, and this fall, NBC will host a similar
event, the Gravity Games.
</P>
<P>
   To stay on the cutting edge, ESPN this year is emphasizing the
Internet, adding an hour's worth of live video footage each day
from its Web site and letting site visitors judge one of the
events. Chat room conversations will scroll live at the bottom of
some telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The sports network also is adding more live music at this year's
games, with bands such as Protein, Sprung Monkey and Let's Go
Bowling.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN risks losing both viewers and sponsors if NBC's event takes
off, since NBC's audience is much larger, said Haynes. However,
fans will probably remember that ``long before NBC ever cared about
these events, ESPN was airing it and probably losing some money.
There is a loyalty factor there.''

 PUC _ SF CHRON  
 PUC Says Net Calls Are Local  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Consumers got a break yesterday when state regulators voted to
continue treating phone calls to Internet service providers as
local, staving off a potential increase in the cost of surfing the
Web.
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  The state Public Utilities Commission also agreed to
temporarily suspend a new area code overlay plan _ that requires
11-digit dialing on every call _ in West Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of the overlay plan for the 424 area code has no
immediate affect on the Bay Area, but eventually could lead to a
cancellation of four overlays scheduled for this region.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling on Internet calls quells a frenzy that had erupted in
California over what consumers pay to get online.
</P>
<P>
   By law, local phone companies are obligated to pay one another
for completing each other's local calls. The term for this fee is
``reciprocal compensation.'' The fee does not apply to
long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's ruling stems from a dispute between Pacific Bell and
Pac-West Telecomm, a competing local phone company that provides
phone service to many Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a Pac Bell customer calls an ISP that uses Pac-West
as its phone company, Pac Bell has to pay Pac-West a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell had argued that it shouldn't have to pay Pac-West a
fee because calls made to the Internet are long-distance since they
could wind up anywhere on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC sided with Pac-West yesterday, concluding that Internet
calls are local. That means that phone companies who serve ISPs
will continue to get fees on every Internet call.
</P>
<P>
   If the PUC had decided to end reciprocal compensation, phone
companies said they might have had to raise rates to ISPs, and
those higher rates could have been passed on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Josiah Neeper was the only one of five commissioners who voted
against the decision. He had crafted an alternate proposal that
would have postponed a decision and opened a hearing on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Commission President Richard Bilas said yesterday's ruling ``may
have been one of the most difficult telecommunications decisions
I've had to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The PUC had been deluged with 3,000 to 4,000 letters and e-mails
from consumers and state legislators, many demanding that Internet
calls continue to be classified as local.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling has far-reaching implications because other competing
local phone companies can now demand that Pac Bell pay them for
handling Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell may appeal the ruling, which officials said is damaging
to their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where would Pac Bell or any other originating carrier come up
with the money to pay for this?'' said Bill Mashek, a spokesman for
Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Blase, vice president of regulatory &UR; cq  &LR; for Pac Bell, said
the company may have to pass the cost on to customers through
higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups and competing carriers hailed the PUC's
action, saying it will keep rates for Internet calls affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will allow us to provide economical service to millions
of Californians,'' said David Simpson, president of the California
Internet Service Provider Association.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is far from settled, however. The PUC is expected to
consider hearing an appeal of an earlier order on reciprocal
compensation and the Federal Communications Commission also plans
to explore the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Another contentious issue that promises to keep rearing its head
is the issue of area code changes.
</P>
<P>
   Moved by public discontent and a pending bill in the state
Legislature, the PUC voted 4 to 1 yesterday to temporarily halt the
state's first area code overlay in West Los Angeles while it
debates the merits of 11-digit dialing.
</P>
<P>
   Overlays are one way to deal with the growing shortage of area
codes. Instead of dividing a region geographically and giving all
the customers in one half a new area code, an overlay plan lets
existing customers keep their area code and assigns the new area
codes to new phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that customers in the same neighborhood or even
the same house can have different area codes, and everyone in the
overlay region has to dial 1 plus the area code plus the number on
every call _ even if they're calling someone in the same area code.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-digit dialing went into effect in the 310 region on April
17. After July 17, new phone customers in the 310 region were
scheduled to get 424 as their area code.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's vote will suspend implementation of the 424 area
code and prevent phone companies from giving out 424 phone numbers.
Eleven-digit dialing will continue during the temporary suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Henry Duque said the PUC should take another look
at the 310 overlay because there have been technical problems and
customer confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The delay gives the PUC more time to look at the overlay plan,
which has drawn the ire of consumers and state Assemblyman Wally
Knox.
</P>
<P>
   Knox has been pressuring the PUC to rescind the overlay, saying
there is no area code shortage. Knox said there are more than 145
million telephone numbers in the state that have been assigned to
phone companies but are not being used.
</P>
<P>
   He has a bill pending in the Assembly that would force phone
companies to disclose how many phone numbers they have and how many
are in use before consumers are inconvenienced with an overlay.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is important to the Bay Area, which is slated to
get overlays in the 408, 415, 510 and 650 regions during the next
two years. At public hearings on overlays, more people in the Bay
Area have complained than in the Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC also wants to change how numbers are assigned, something
that would help preserve existing area codes.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, phone numbers are assigned in blocks of 10,000,
regardless of how many customers a company has. Even if a phone
company only has 300 customers, it still must request 10,000
numbers. With more than 150 phone companies operating in
California, the supply of available numbers has quickly dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC has asked the Federal Communications Commission for the
right to assign numbers in blocks of 1,000 instead of 10,000. The
FCC recently opened a proceeding to look into how numbers are
assigned and could issue new rules within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates supported the PUC's ruling and said the
commission should vote to rescind all the state's overlays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need for overlays or splits in California,'' said
Regina Costa, telecommunications analyst with The Utility Reform
Network. ``Why are customers being put in a vice? The reality is we
don't have to be in that vice because the area code crunch is an
artificial problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell officials disagreed, saying the 310 region is running
out of numbers and is in need of immediate relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are running out of numbers down there and customers are
going to be harmed if we can't do an overlay,'' said John Britton,
a Pac Bell spokesman.

 Kitchenware Giant Rejects Takeover Bid  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR; Unlike its fancy blenders and armchairs, Williams-Sonoma Inc.
apparently is not for sale.
<P>
   The San Francisco kitchen and housewares merchant, which owns
the Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn stores and catalogs, spurned a
takeover offer in an emergency board meeting earlier this month,
according to sources close to the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Company Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHoward Lester
declined yesterday to discuss the situation, saying, ``Nothing is
going on now. From time to time, people have discussions, but we
don't comment on those.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma is considered a ripe takeover target. It is a
well-run company with a bright future on the Web and a relatively
low valuation, said industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   With its stock trading at about $29, the company's current
market capitalization is $1.62 billion. Bonnie Kramer Tonneson, an
analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, values it at closer to $3 billion,
or $41 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, several sources named Starbucks Corp., the Seattle
coffee giant, as the likely suitor. A Starbucks spokesman declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starbucks and Williams-Sonoma seem an odd match at
first blush, it makes sense when their Internet strategies are
factored in, said analysts and other observers.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Starbucks announced a partnership with Oxygen
Media to develop a lifestyle-oriented portal and cable television
business targeting upscale women. Williams-Sonoma, which has just
begun rolling out a series of cyber gift registries and online
stores, would be the perfect e-commerce addition, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Starbucks customer is 55 percent women, well educated,
over $75,000 median income, and over 70 percent of them use the
Net,'' said Tonneson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same people who shop at Williams-Sonoma and the ideal
demographic for patronizing cooking and epicureal type stuff on the
Web,'' Tonneson said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Williams-Sonoma's larger stores would be good
locales for small Starbucks coffee bars, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma is a particularly attractive Web partner because
of its strong stable of brand names, including Hold Everything and
Chambers; its decades of direct-to-consumer experience; and its
technological infrastructure, which includes a strong Web operation
and a large, sophisticated distribution center.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Williams-Sonoma's valuable customer database of 20
million names, addresses and buying histories will be an even more
powerful tool when the company is able to mesh the list with e-mail
addresses, said an industry analyst who declined to be identified
by name.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of WILLIAMS () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  So a lifestyle portal deal does make sense for Williams-Sonoma _
but the company decided to pursue just such an opportunity with a
different set of partners, not Starbucks and Oxygen, last week.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, just three days after the weekend board meeting
at which Williams-Sonoma's directors voted to remain independent,
the retailer announced that it is talking to CondeNet, an affiliate
of Conde Nast magazines, about joining a CondeNet-Time Warner cable
and Web business targeting high-income women. Williams-Sonoma has
already arranged to start selling kitchen wares over CondeNet's
Epicurious.com site.
</P>
<P>
   So it looks like Williams-Sonoma will go it alone for now,
although there is nothing to stop future bids. ``Something's going
to happen there,'' said one industry executive. ``Eventually,
somebody's going to have too much money to leave them alone.''

2 CHINESE VICTIMS IN U.S. RAID IN BELGRADE REPORTEDLY WERE SPIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The American bombs that struck the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, on May 7 destroyed the compound's
intelligence-gathering nerve center, and two of the three Chinese
killed were not journalists but intelligence officers, American
officials and a Western diplomat said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The highly sensitive nature of the parts of the embassy that
were bombed suggests why the Chinese, despite assurances from
President Clinton and other senior U.S. officials that the complex
was erroneously targeted, insist the bombing was no accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly why they don't buy our explanation,'' said one
exasperated Pentagon official familiar with the incident that also
wounded about 20 people.
</P>
<P>
   The officials interviewed said they learned of the location of
the intelligence operation only after the bombing. American
officials traveled to Beijing last week to explain that an outdated
map and a bureaucratic chain of errors failed to catch the
misidentification of the building.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing, which came at a critical time in the 11-week air
war, deeply embarrassed U.S. officials and dealt a serious setback
to relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, China and the United States were close to hammering out
a deal on China's entry to the World Trade Organization, but China
suspended negotiations after the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In the assessment immediately after three satellite-guided
2,000-pound bombs from an American B-2 ripped into the embassy,
military officials said the intended target had been the
headquarters of a Yugoslav arms agency that is actually about 200
yards south of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon Thursday, spokesman Kenneth Bacon sought to
clarify reports that a midlevel analyst at the Central Intelligence
Agency questioned whether military planners had picked the right
building shortly before the embassy was struck, but that his
concerns went unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst, who was not identified, was not involved in
selecting the target but knew about the arms agency headquarters.
When he examined CIA maps and spy satellite photographs of the
proposed target, he sensed something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not say, `You're about to hit an embassy,''' Bacon told
reporters. ``He said, `I believe you're going after an appropriate
target but maybe not the best target.'''
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, three days before the bombing, the analyst called a
midlevel officer at a NATO command in Naples, Italy, to express his
doubts. At the same time, the analyst tried to arrange a meeting
within the CIA to clarify his concerns. But he was unable to
schedule the meeting before he left on two days of training.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have a great sense of urgency about this because he
had no idea of when the building was to be targeted,'' Bacon told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   When the analyst returned on May 7, he again called Naples but
spoke to a different officer. The analyst learned that the B-2 was
en route to Belgrade from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri on
one of 50 missions that these warplanes flew during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military officer recalls asking the CIA analyst if there
was any reason to cancel the strike and being told there was no
reason to call off the attack,'' Bacon said in a statement put out
Thursday night, clarifying remarks he made earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The slightly conflicting accounts of the timing and specificity
of the warning and Bacon's clarification underscore the murky
nature of the whole incident.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Intelligence Agency's inspector general conducted
its own review, and found that the analyst's concerns went
unheeded. Now the Pentagon plans a review headed by a deputy
Defense secretary, John Hamre, and by Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, the
vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The two officials are
to present their findings in closed session before the House
Intelligence Committee on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some fog here, and I expect to be fully informed by
next Thursday,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., who heads the
intelligence panel.
</P>
<P>
   Goss, whose committee received a classified briefing on June 10
from George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, on the
embassy bombing, said he would hold a public hearing in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's explanation from the Pentagon did little to assuage
Chinese officials, many of whom suspect that NATO deliberately
bombed their embassy because of Beijing's sympathies toward
Yugoslavia. China's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Shen
Guofang, commented, ``So far the explanation from the U.S. side is
not convincing.''

 WORKWAYS/ILANA DEBARE  &HT;     Part-Time Help Is Out There 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: As district manager for a major pharmaceutical company, I'm
having a very hard time filling sales positions. These jobs _ which
involve talking to doctors, pharmacists, et al. about new products
_ would be ideal for someone who wants to work in a part-time,
flexible-hours or job-sharing arrangement. I know there are people
out there who want such schedules as a way to balance their
personal and professional lives. But I don't seem to be finding
them through our regular help-wanted ads or recruiters. Any
suggestions?
<P>
   A: You're right that there are many skilled professionals _
especially working moms _ who would like part-time jobs. And you're
smart to use flexible schedules as a selling point for your firm in
today's tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   But a part-time schedule alone isn't enough to attract top-notch
candidates. Make sure pay and benefits are competitive. And make
sure that the job is doable: Don't ask people to do 40 hours of
work in a 20-hour week.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, here are a few ideas for ways to recruit the
kind of people you want:
</P>
<P>
   _Check out Working Options, a San Francisco recruitment firm
that specializes in placing professionals who want part-time or
flexible schedules. It can be reached at (415) 835-9466.
</P>
<P>
   _Post your job listing with career counseling centers such as
Alumnae Resources and Jewish Vocational Services in San Francisco,
or the Career Action Center in Cupertino. These centers often have
workshops on finding professional part-time work: Their attendees
would be prime candidates for your openings.
</P>
<P>
   _Try advertising in local newspapers or magazines that are
geared to parents, such as Parents' Press in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   _Contact local organizations of saleswomen or businesswomen.
Part-time work is still more popular among women than men. These
groups might mention your openings in a newsletter; or you could
spread the word in person by attending some of their events.
</P>
<P>
   Do you want more information on how to manage or recruit
employees with flexible schedules? Contact New Ways to Work, a San
Francisco nonprofit that has been helping companies with
alternative work arrangements for years. You can find them at (415)
995-9860 or  &LR; www.nww.org &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Unfulfilled promises
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there any laws that would keep an employer from
repeatedly hiring temporary secretaries, promising them permanent
employment in numerous verbal and written ways, but having no
intention to really hire them permanently? I've seen this happen
and it's pretty cruel. The temp ends up working under false
expectations and loses out on other career opportunities while
waiting for a permanent job that never arrives.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's a word for what this employer seems to be doing _
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's classic fraud _ saying something you know to be a lie, in
order to get someone to do something,'' said San Francisco attorney
Mark Thierman, who has represented temporary and contract workers
in several high-profile lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean these secretaries could take the boss to
court, though.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawyers won't take a case unless the victim can show some
economic damages _ such as lost salary, out-of-pocket moving
expenses to take a new job, etc.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, what have the secretaries lost?
</P>
<P>
   Thierman says they haven't lost much, economically. That's
because they probably would have been at-will employees if they
were hired permanently. And like all at-will workers, they could
have been dismissed at any time for any reason _ even on their
second day of work.
</P>
<P>
   So it would be hard to make an argument in court that the
secretaries lost out on 10 years' worth _ or even two weeks' worth
_ of guaranteed paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're at-will, you're about as permanent as a temp,''
Thierman said.
</P>
<P>
   There is one legal argument these secretaries might be able to
pursue: If they've been working for this employer for more than
five or six months, they might argue that they should receive the
same benefits as permanent employees.
</P>
<P>
   That's an evolving area of law. Some courts have said that
long-term temps should receive the same benefits as permanent
employees, but other courts have disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the most effective strategy may be for a
respected permanent employee to ask the boss to deal honestly with
the company's temps. If he won't listen, perhaps some permanent
staffer should take the newly hired temps aside and advise them to
take the boss' promises with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>

MORE ON NANNY TAXES &QL; 
Several weeks ago, I wrote about how to fill out tax documents for
an in-home baby sitter. Reader Jo Ellen Kaiser called with a
suggestion for people who want to follow the law but can't stomach
the paperwork _ use a payroll/tax service.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser uses an Austin, Texas, firm called Breedlove &AMP; Associates
Ltd. that handles payroll and tax paperwork for household
employers. Breedlove charges a set-up fee of $75 and then a flat
fee of $350 a year to handle all your payroll taxes and filings.

   COURTROOM TESTIMONY ENDS IN MICROSOFT ANTITRUST CASE
</P>
<P>
   The heated accusations of monopoly, the lively e-mail flavored
with capitalist aggression and the spirited testimony alleging and
denying misconduct came to a close as the last witness stepped off
the stand in Microsoft's antitrust trial, eight months after
proceedings began.
</P>
<P>
   The government argues that it has more than proved its case, but
Microsoft, while conceding that the Justice Department put on an
impressive performance, says the facts do not add up to a violation
of antitrust rules. The legal reckoning that matters, however, will
be made by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will rule without a
jury.

   UNRAVELING MYSTERY IN FRAUD CASE

   The authorities are sorting through many questions concerning

companies of $335 million, wiring the money to foreign bank
accounts, incinerating documents and leaving behind notes that show
he was researching which foreign countries have no extradition

   RUMORS SWIRLING ON INTERNET DEALS

<P>
   A recent spate of rumored Internet combinations shows the
menagerie of potential products and deals that companies and
investors must face to find a few that might pay off someday.
Compaq Computer confirmed that it was interested in trading its
Alta Vista Internet service for stock in CMGI. The computer maker
Gateway declined to comment on speculation that it would buy
Earthlink, an Internet service. And those rumors forced Mindspring,
another Internet service, to publish a cryptic statement that it
was in talks about possible combinations. Market Place.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps the biggest winner in the shake-up of the
school system announced by Chancellor Rudy Crew on Wednesday was a
player whose role was largely behind the scenes: the teachers'
union.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the president of the United Federation of Teachers,
Randi Weingarten, proposed that the union assume responsibility for
a failing Bronx school and operate it under a set of new rules,
including a longer school day, incentive pay for teachers to work
that extended day, a reduction in class sizes and increased
training time for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the chancellor politely declined the offer, partly out
of unwillingness to relinquish substantial direction of the school
to the union.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan that the chancellor announced on Wednesday for
seizing direct control of 40 low-performing elementary and middle
schools was strikingly similar to what the union had proposed.
Aides to Crew said that his plan was not the union's alone, but an
amalgam of several ideas, from many sources.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the chancellor's plan includes a generous package
of benefits for teachers who choose to work in those low-performing
schools: a 15 percent raise, an annual $2,500 tuition reimbursement
for those pursuing master's degrees, a paring of class sizes to 20
students (from as high as 30) in the youngest grades, and daily
time set aside for teacher education.
</P>
<P>
   And while the chancellor stopped well short of turning the keys
of those schools over to the union, he enlisted it as an unusually
strong partner in making any number of decisions, ranging from
choosing the curriculums in each school to determining how teachers
will be retrained and who will be hired.
</P>
<P>
   By closely aligning itself with the chancellor's plan, the union
takes on some risks. The pay increase for teachers in
low-performing schools could not have been adopted without the
union's blessing, and unions seldom endorse paying some members
more than others. Moreover, if the schools continue to fail, the
union would bear some blame.
</P>
<P>
   Harold O. Levy, the chairman of the state aid committee of the
State Board of Regents, characterized Ms. Weingarten's
participation as ``extraordinarily brave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has demonstrated she's prepared to be flexible in the very
place where a union is most vulnerable: treating all its members
with pristine equality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential payoff for Ms. Weingarten seems worth the
risk: a little more than a year before its contract is set to
expire, the union has won recognition from the school system and
the city that the worst schools, at least, need to pay more to
attract good teachers.
</P>
<P>
   That rationale could eventually serve as the foundation for
across-the-board raises and, if the investment appears to be paying
off, could turn Mayor Rudolph Giuliani into an ally just as the
next contract is being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between the union and Crew, which the mayor's
aides approved in advance, would benefit more than 1,000 teachers
at 40 schools. (Three high schools taken over by the chancellor
were not part of the negotiations.)
</P>
<P>
   Given that the average teacher's salary in the city is $44,000,
the average raise would be $6,600. And the $2,500 in tuition money
represents, in effect, an additional 6 percent raise on top of
that.
</P>
<P>
   Under the chancellor's plan, which was swiftly approved by the
board of education on Wednesday, the teachers would collect the
additional benefits in exchange for transferring to these schools
and working an extra 40-minute period a day. The benefits would
expire in three years.
</P>
<P>
   While teachers who remain at the schools would also be entitled
to the new benefits, board officials hope to replace all of the
temporary, uncertified teachers on their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   While the union and the central board would decide together
which teachers should be hired at the schools this fall, the union
agreed to a concession: seniority would not be a driving factor in
ranking candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Weingarten has her eye on a bigger prize: using the
goodwill engendered by her participation in the chancellor's
experiment to raise all teacher salaries next year to within
striking distance of the city's nearest suburbs, which routinely
pay their educators tens of thousands of dollars more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that through all of the clack, we were able to
reach a meeting of the minds,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ``Hopefully,
this will open up an opportunity to talk about other things that
are educationally important.''

HOUSTON GROUP SUES POET FOR NOT APPEARING AT FUNCTION IN HER HONOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Houston group that honored noted African-American
poet and writer Maya Angelou with its ``Order of Kilimanjaro'' last
year has sued her for not showing up at the award ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``She (Angelou) refused to return our phone calls and letters
and generally snubbed us,'' said Clay Crawford, attorney for
African Overseas Union, the nonprofit group that presented the
award.
</P>
<P>
   He said the cash-strapped organization lost $50,000 to $75,000
to prepare for Angelou's scheduled ceremony Dec. 5, only to be told
the days before _ without explanation _ that Angelou would not make
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris County state district court suit, filed Wednesday,
wants Angelou to pay for the losses because she allegedly breached
a contract that stated she would attend.
</P>
<P>
   Angelou's representative in Winston-Salem, N.C., did not return
a phone call from the Houston Chronicle. Angelou, 71, a professor
at Wake Forest University, is perhaps best known for her 1969
autobiographical account ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' but
she also has dabbled in popular culture, helping write and produce
the movie, ``Sister, Sister'' and other films.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says Angelou sent a letter to the Houston organization
in July 1998 saying she would accept the award, and enclosed
biographical information and photographs to be used in a program
book. She asked that the ceremony be held in December because she
was already planning to be in Houston at that time, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preparations of the elaborate event began,'' the suit said.
``Angelou gave specific measurements in order that ceremonial
attire could be hand-tailored to her exact size and proportions.
Angelou was to be presented with a hand-carved staff of office from
Benin City, Nigeria. A traditional dance troupe from Nigeria was to
be flown to Houston for the event. Angelou gave specific
instructions as to the type of food not to be served in her
presence due to severe allergic reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the suit said, ``Angelou was informed that African
Overseas Union had arranged for His Royal Highness, the Alafin of
Oyo, Nigeria, to be in attendance as a guest of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit said that board members of the group suffered the
embarrassment of having to go to the site of the ceremony to tell
the public the event was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Angelou postponed a scheduled performance at Jones Hall in April
because of lingering effects from a recent bout with pneumonia, but
Crawford said he has no idea if Angelou was sick for the December
event because ``she's refused to talk to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Order of Kilimanjaro, named after Africa's highest
mountain &UR; ,  &LR; is bestowed to ``African-Americans who have
distinguished themselves by their contributions to the community,''
the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Previous recipients are noted artist Dr. John Biggers in 1995
and African writer Chinua Achebe in 1996. Crawford said there were
no past problems with honorees not showing up.

GEPHARDT SAYS FASTER CHECK COULD SHORTEN GUN-CONTROL TIME FRAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than a week after House Democrats voted
against a gun-control package rather than accept what they said
were soft terms in a measure to regulate gun shows, Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, seemed to open the
door at least a crack Thursday to some sort of compromise on that
point.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday morning, Gephardt suggested that
while he and many other Democrats had insisted on three business
days for gun-show vendors to complete background checks on
customers, a shorter time frame might be acceptable if the check
system worked faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's a way to find common ground there, where we're
increasing the ability to get the checks done and we don't need _
over time, maybe not right away _ but we can quicken the time when
the instant check can be done,'' Gephardt said. ``I'm willing to
look at that, as I think a lot of us are, to see if we can find our
way through this.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview late Thursday afternoon, Gephardt
sought to clarify his remarks, saying he did not intend to imply
that he or other Democratic proponents of gun control were willing
to cede ground on a matter they felt was critical.
</P>
<P>
   What he was proposing, the congressman said, was that supporters
and opponents of gun control work to make the background-check
system so fast that disagreements about time limits would become
moot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, it seems to me, is the place where you get consensus,''
Gephardt said. But until that day, he added, ``I think you've got
to have three business days.''

LEMIEUX CAN KEEP PENGUINS IN PITTSBURGH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ore.)   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge granted approval Thursday to Mario
Lemieux's plan to keep the Penguins from either leaving Pittsburgh
or having their players dispersed to other teams in a special
National Hockey League draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in it to make money, but I'm not in it to lose
money,'' Lemieux said after the 6 1/2 hour court hearing. ``We want
to make sure the Penguins stay here. They've been a big part of my
life and my success.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux's victory ended a tense financial drama that found his
former team, which owed him and other creditors more than $100
million, playing deep into the playoffs this season under the
shadow of a bankruptcy filing dating to last October.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge Bernard Markovitz in a Pittsburgh courtroom
made Lemieux the general partner of the team for which he scored
1,494 points in a 12-year career, with an ownership stake of at
least 20 percent. As part of his reorganization plan, Lemieux
converted $20 million of the $32.5 million he was owed in deferred
salary by the team into equity in the revived franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Although some former players have owned small team stakes _ such
as Magic Johnson's minority share of the Los Angeles Lakers _
Lemieux's controlling role is unique.
</P>
<P>
   The immensely popular Lemieux, 33, who led the Penguins to two
Stanley Cup championships before retiring as a player in 1997, is
expected to let existing management, including General Manager
Craig Patrick, run the team. The Penguins finished this season
37-30-14 and lost in the conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   William Daly, the NHL's senior vice president of legal affairs,
said: ``We're very happy; we're very gratified. We think it's
important to keep hockey in Pittsburgh.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux's group is committed to investing at least $60 million
in the team. Thursday morning, the group said it had $11 million in
escrow, with $30 million on the way, but by afternoon, the figure
was up to $38 million. ``That's pretty good, on short notice,''
Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   Daly said Team Lemieux has until mid-July to show it has
collected more of the $60 million investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great for our clients,'' said Joel Walker, the lawyer
for the Penguins' unsecured creditors.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle for Lemieux is the Penguins' lease situation at the
Civic Center. Lawyers for Lemieux and SMG, which has leased the
arena from a local agency and rented it to the team for $6 million
a year, could not agree on a new lease before Thursday's hearing.
Last week, Markovitz ruled that the existing lease was invalid
because it was really a loan to Howard Baldwin to help buy the team
in 1991. SMG is appealing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were up to Mario, he'd probably like a one-time buyout
and be rid of SMG,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   But SMG controls the building, and it may be best for Lemieux to
negotiate a favorable new lease while he has leverage, or risk not
having a place to play.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's hearing, an SMG lawyer threatened a lawsuit if
Markovitz lets the Penguins operate the arena themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still want to talk to them, but if not, we'll let the court
decide their fate,'' Lemieux said.
</P>
<P>
   SMG is also the Islanders' landlord at Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL had also filed a reorganization plan that would have
provided for the sale of the team to an out-of-town buyer _ one
such suitor, believed to be in Portland, Ore., had placed $85
million into an escrow account _ or for the players' dispersal.

SUSPECT IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS PROCLAIMS INNOCENCE IN LETTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (nk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Texas man accused of conspiring with Osama bin
Laden in terrorist attacks against Americans said in recent letters
to his family that he was innocent and accused American officials
of not acting quickly enough to prevent the bombings of U.S.
Embassies in Africa last August.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the letters from Wadih el-Hage marks the first
time any communications from the five defendants in the terrorism
case, who have been jailed under unusually restrictive conditions
in New York, have been made public. Each of the five is in solitary
confinement and is barred from communicating with almost all
outsiders, including the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for el-Hage, who has been charged with conspiring to
murder Americans overseas and with perjury, have said he is upset
at his inability to state his case publicly.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing on Tuesday, after a federal judge refused to read
aloud a letter the defendant wrote, he bolted from his seat and
charged at the judge. He was quickly tackled by a federal marshal.
The letter has not yet been released by the judge, who cited
government concerns that it might contain coded messages to other
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   The two letters that were made public were written by el-Hage to
relatives, and were given by a close family member to Oriana Zill,
a reporter who worked on a documentary about the case that was
jointly produced by the public television series ``Frontline'' and
The New York Times. She is also the author of a profile of el-Hage
for the Internet Web site of ``Frontline''.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter written on May 4, el-Hage sought to refute the
allegations against him, questioning the prosecutors' motives and
suggesting that their case was built around innocent associations
in his past with bin Laden, Haroun Fazil, another fugitive in the
case, and others.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage contended that he had had ``nothing to do with their
actions.'' Mocking the prosecutors, he wrote: ``They couldn't get
Bin Laden or Haroun, let's get el-Hage,'' and continued: ``We want
to win this big case. It doesn't matter if we ruin his or his
family's life, we want to win this case, fame, position,
promotions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Feb. 13, el-Hage wrote, ``I am confident, by
the will of Allah, that I will be acquitted, for I had nothing to
do with this whole issue of actions of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Herbert Hadad, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo
White, nor Sam A. Schmidt, el-Hage's lawyer, would comment Thursday
about the letters.
</P>
<P>
   The federal indictment says that el-Hage served as bin Laden's
personal secretary in Sudan, and that he tried to obtain chemical
weapons for his group. He is accused of carrying messages and money
between bin Laden and others in what prosecutors say is bin Laden's
worldwide terrorist conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. el-Hage has served as a front man for the bin Laden
organization for years,'' a prosecutor said in one court hearing,
adding that el-Hage was linked to ``both violence and violent
people.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In blaming the government for not acting quickly enough to
prevent the bombings, el-Hage refers to accounts that the
authorities, in a search of his house in Nairobi, Kenya, in August,
1997, found an incriminating letter on his computer. The government
seized the letter, which talked about bin Laden's `East Africa
network,'' during its investigation bin Laden before the bombings.
Prosecutors have said the letter was probably written by Fazil, who
they say was el-Hage's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage said the authorities had had the letter ``for one whole
year'' before the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were they waiting for a tragedy to start their
investigations?'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He also contended that from what he had read about the Nairobi
bombing, those who carried it out used stun grenades and shot
bullets into the air to warn and disperse people. ``I cannot
imagine a Muslim targeting innocent people,'' he wrote. ``They
maybe targeted the U.S. Embassy, but from what the indictment
explained, they couldn't be targeting other civilians in the
vicinity around.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage, who has pleaded not guilty, has taken the position
through his lawyers that he worked for bin Laden, but only in what
he believed were legitimate businesses. He has denied any role in
terrorism or other wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The relative, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said she
was making the letters public because of her frustration at
el-Hage's inability to communicate with the outside world. She said
she believed el-Hage had become ``psychologically impaired by being
kept away from any other human contact besides his jailers for nine
months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody would have snapped,'' the relative said, referring to
el-Hage's action in court this week. ``He is frustrated beyond
words.''

PROGRAM CUT? JUST CALL ACTIVIST RUSSELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Duke Russell was a baseball pitcher, he would
be a reliever like Jeff Shaw or Troy Percival. That's because when
Russell enters the game, it's under dire circumstances and he
usually gets the save.
</P>
<P>
   Area coaches have credited Russell with several saves over the
years. Need an activist to fight for your program? Russell is the
man, the savior who will work to keep programs alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to this nation ... We need (sports),'' the
73-year-old retired electrician said from his Hollywood home.
``It's part of the education of these kids. That's why they go to
school and get jobs. That's why I do what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell's record speaks to his desire: He has helped keep
baseball alive at Los Angeles and Pasadena city colleges and is
fighting to bring back programs at West L.A. and Mission.
</P>
<P>
   He also led the opposition against Cal State Northridge
administrators, especially then-President Blenda Wilson, when
baseball and three other men's sports were cut in 1997. He
regularly wrote letters to the editor and attended public hearings,
often bringing people with him to speak. His actions, as well as
that of state Sen. Cathie Wright, R-Simi Valley, helped the sports
get reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Russell also worked with Wright in drafting Senate Bill 338,
which calls for advance warning should any program be in danger of
being cut.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts have been noticed. Saturday in San Diego, he will be
honored by the California Coaches Association for his activism.
Wright will present him with the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a real crusader for amateur baseball,'' UCLA coach
Gary Adams said. ``He's our lobbyist. Coaches are so busy coaching
our teams. This guy can get down in the ditches and meet the
presidents. He gets things done. He'd be the first guy I'd call.''
</P>
<P>
   From his early days at Hollywood High (Class of 1944) and Los
Angeles City, Russell loved baseball. It was the game, he said,
that helped him focus on hib Manring, recalls that Russell made a
batting aid to help him swing level: a ball on a spring attached to
the garage door.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, a shortstop, was good enough to be signed by the
Dodgers in 1947 and assigned to their Class-C (today's equivalent
of Single-A) affiliate in Santa Barbara. He played one season
before quitting.
</P>
<P>
   His career as an activist began in 1986 when he read in the
newspaper that L.A. City was cutting baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He called the coach, Phil Pote, and asked what he could do to
help. Pote suggested he write letters to the college president and
to the president of the Los Angeles Community College District
board.
</P>
<P>
   Russell wrote letters and even spoke at the next board meeting.
Baseball was saved.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, it happened again, only Pote was too busy to
actively crusade, so Russell took over and helped save the program
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a strong sense of, if I may be trite, doing the right
thing,'' said Pote, now a Seattle Mariners scout. ``These are
causes he thinks are important. He has rechanneled his energies to
give the kids better opportunities. Unfortunately, a lot of people
don't have the same motivation. What he does is important. People
should help. There are Duke Russells out there who want to make the
world better.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the same situation happened in Pasadena. Russell found
it absurd that Dodgers great Jackie Robinson's alma mater would be
cutting baseball. He made about 50 calls to get people to attend
the next board meeting and protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is agonizing, to make calls to get people to attend,''
Russell said. ``People have families. They're working. They can't
go to meetings. The system isn't set up to help.''
</P>
<P>
   He also learned from his calls that Robinson's sister-in-law,
Delano, still lived in Pasadena. He convinced her to speak at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `I just had back surgery,' '' Russell said. ``She
came with a cane. When she talked, it made an impression on the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   When Wilson announced baseball, soccer, volleyball and swimming
were to be cut at CSUN, Russell mobilized again. He attended CSU
Board of Trustees meetings and organized as the Committee To Save
Four Olympic Men's Sports at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are more battles. West L.A. and Mission remain
without baseball programs (Mission's entire athletic program was
cut in 1997).
</P>
<P>
   As long as there are fights, Russell will fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have your crusaders,'' Wright said. ``He's been so
supportive of community athletics. People can look back and say,
`Without Duke Russell, we wouldn't be playing.' ''

DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS TALK OF WAYS TO EMERGE FROM POLITICAL
WILDERNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The years of Bill Clinton's presidency have been a
dark age for Democratic governors, as one statehouse after another
fell to the Republicans and big names like Mario Cuomo and Ann
Richards were ousted by voters.
</P>
<P>
   But statehouse survivors were talking a Clinton-like agenda of
technology, international trade, education and school safety as
keys to emerging from the political wilderness as the Democratic
Governors Association gathered here Thursday for its summer policy
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is cyclical. We're on our way back,'' said Gov. Howard
Dean of Vermont, who has watched Democrats dip from control of 30
statehouses to their current total of 17.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Frank O'Bannon of Indiana added: ``If we can focus on
(issues), the politics can take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The way back is not old-time Democratic populism, free spending,
or stemwinding speeches about solidarity with organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governors huddled Thursday with corporate chief
executive officers. A top adviser to California Gov. Gray Davis
talked excitedly of an upcoming summer meeting between his boss and
Microsoft CEO Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   O'Bannon, a Democratic governor of a Republican state, spoke of
states' needs to adopt ``a more businesslike approach to quality
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were in control of 30 statehouses at the dawn of the
1990s. Nowadays, Republicans hold 31 governorships. Two statehouses
are held by independents, Govs. Jesse Ventura in Minnesota and
Angus King in Maine.;
</P>
<P>
   The party's biggest losses came in 1994, two years into the
first term of Clinton, a former chairman of the Democratic
Governors Association. Democrats lost statehouses in such populous
states as New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   As the decade ends, there is only one Democratic governor _
California's Davis _ in the nation's 10 largest states. Five
moderate Democrats held Mountain States governorships at the start
of the 1990s. All five statehouses are now in Republican hands.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican governor, George W. Bush of Texas, is his party's
leading presidential contender. Another GOP chief executive, Tommy
Thompson in Wisconsin, has instituted the country's most
far-reaching welfare reform program.
</P>
<P>
   An economic boom, fueled by lowering of taxes, has kept the
governorship in Massachusetts _ arguably America's most Democratic
state _ in Republican hands. In the labor stronghold of Michigan,
GOP Gov. John Engler has won three terms by cutting taxes, backing
charter schools, and instituting welfare reform requiring work.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governors Thursday tried to claim credit for
successes of their Republican counterparts. ``The ones on the
cutting edge out there are following our policies,'' said O'Bannon.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats scored a few notably gubernatorial successes last
year. Davis ended 16 years of Republican control in California,
while Tom Vilsack became the first Democrat since 1968 to occupy
the Iowa governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   They also found an issue in the Deep South, the creation of
state lotteries to fund scholarships and education improvements.
Democrats ousted GOP governors in Alabama and South Carolina, and
held onto the Georgia governor's mansion. This year, they are an
even-money bet to end eight years of Republican control in
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us never thought in our lifetimes that we would see
Democrats back in Deep South statehouses,'' Dean said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But after the anti-government uprisings of the early 1990s,
which cost their party dearly, the new generation of Democratic
governors are charting their course with care. The deliberately
low-key Davis has concentrated on a cause to which all Californians
can rally _ restoring the state's run-down school system. Gov. Roy
Barnes of Georgia has set his sights on transportation and
unsnarling Atlanta's gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   The most populist governor elected last year, Iowa's Vilsack, on
Thursday talked the centrist's language of international trade and
economic developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy percent of Iowa's crops are grown and leave the state
with no value added,'' Vilsack said. ``Our farmers are getting
prices below cost. ... If we can turn that around it will have
tremendous impacts. We have to have a strong trade presence, and it
must have a strong international component.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' host, Washington Gov. Gary Locke, chimed in with
talk about ``the importance of public-private partnerships and
``how states can open up markets abroad.''

FUGITIVE'S TRAIL LEADS TO EL PASO, KENTUCKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Accused serial killer Rafael Resendez-Ramirez has been
seen recently in El Paso, Texas, and Louisville, Ky., officials
confirmed Thursday, but the hard part is determining where he will
turn up next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get the information that will lead us one step
ahead of where he's going,'' said Don K. Clark, special agent in
charge of the Houston FBI office.
</P>
<P>
   That will be difficult, said Texas Ranger Drew Carter, a member
of the Houston-based task force hunting Resendez-Ramirez, because
he stays on the move and easily travels the country by rail.
</P>
<P>
   At his press conference, Clark confirmed that Resendez-Ramirez
had been sighted in El Paso about three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Louisville FBI office confirmed that
Resendez-Ramirez had been seen in town June 16-18.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Louisville Police Department said officers
were checking homeless shelters and railroad yards but had no
homicides in which Resendez-Ramirez was a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   A profiler from the Houston FBI office was in Lexington, Ky.,
Thursday to brief law-enforcement agencies on Resendez-Ramirez's
methods.
</P>
<P>
   The task force of local, state and federal officers hunting
Resendez-Ramirez gathered information indicating that he told
someone on June 10 that he planned to go to Kentucky to obtain
migrant work. Clark declined Thursday to discuss whom
Resendez-Ramirez has contacted since the nationwide manhunt began.
</P>
<P>
   Carter acknowledged that family members of the fugitive in the
El Paso-Ciudad Juarez area had been interviewed Wednesday, but he
said there were ``no real surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were supportive of him and talked of him as you or I
would of a family member,'' Carter said. ``They gave no indication
of any dark side to this individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said Resendez-Ramirez's family was cooperative, but
added, ``I think they're somewhat in a state of denial'' about the
allegations against him.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez has been charged with murdering a father and
his daughter in Gorham, Ill., earlier this month, and University of
Kentucky student Christopher Maier in August 1997. He also is
charged with raping Maier's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez has been linked by physical evidence to five
homicides in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Hughes Springs, Texas, are still waiting to see
if a palm print left by the killer of an elderly woman matches that
of Resendez-Ramirez. Evidence in a Pontiac, Mich., murder also is
being examined for a possible connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some other law-enforcement agencies who have asked
to compare (information), and there are some comparisons going on
as we speak,'' Clark said. He declined to give the name of any
agencies or to say how many.
</P>
<P>
   Some cases are nothing more than deaths that have occurred near
railroad tracks, Clark said. He emphasized that no cases would be
closed by attributing them to Resendez-Ramirez, as was done in the
1980s when Henry Lee Lucas confessed to dozens of murders, then
recanted when evidence surfaced that he had been lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law-enforcement agencies are responsible,'' Clark said
Thursday. ``If there is a homicide near a railroad track, in all
likelihood, law-enforcement agencies are going to check it out and
see if there's a connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Rewards being offered for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of Resendez-Ramirez, who was placed on the FBI's Ten
Most Wanted Fugitives list Monday, are up to $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI announced a new toll-free telephone number for calls
regarding Resendez-Ramirez Thursday. Clark said 1-800-889-8161 will
be answered 24 hours a day.

U.N. TO SEND TEAM TO IRAQ THAT EXCLUDES INSPECTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United Nations has agreed to send a team to
dismantle a laboratory in Baghdad, but, in a victory for Iraq, the
team does not include technical experts from the special commission
charged with disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Prakash Shah, Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special envoy to
Iraq, said Thursday in Baghdad that Iraq had agreed to allow a team
of 10 or 11 ``totally independent and neutral'' experts to remove
small amounts of toxic substances left behind in a lab when
inspectors left the country last December. Shah said he expected
the team to arrive by the first week in July and spend about a week
removing the potentially dangerous substances.
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats here said they were troubled by the precedent
of permitting Iraq to choose U.N. inspectors, but a spokesman for
the secretary- general said that ``cleaning up this lab has nothing
to do with limiting the special commission's mandate.'' It was a
matter of safety, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Annan appears to have abandoned an earlier effort to
find a temporary chief who is not an American to head the embattled
special commission, which is known as UNSCOM. Richard Butler, the
commission's chairman, is scheduled to resign from his post on June
30th. At that time, Charles Duelfer, his American deputy, is to
become acting chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the secretary-general, who is in Russia Thursday
on an official visit, would not discuss who Annan had asked to
temporarily replace Butler. But U.N. officials said that several
weeks ago, Annan had asked Jayantha Dhanapala, the
undersecretary-general for disarmament affairs, to take the post
and that Dhanapala had declined.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Security Council had also objected to other
suggested candidates, including members of the commission that
oversees UNSCOM, diplomats said. Even Sergey Lavrov, Russia's
representative here and UNSCOM's harshest critic, preferred to see
an American temporarily in charge rather than someone new who might
give the impression that Russia had softened its hostility to
UNSCOM or its demand that it be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The developments come as the Security Council has been
attempting to close a deep rift over policy toward Iraq. Russia,
China and France have favored an immediate lifting of sanctions,
while the United States and Britain staunchly oppose that unless
and until Iraq answers outstanding questions about its weapons
programs and cooperates fully with inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Support in the Council has been slowly building for a compromise
resolution introduced earlier this week by Britain and the
Netherlands. The resolution could pave the way for suspending U.N.
economic sanctions against Iraq if Baghdad complies with its
disarmament commitments and cooperates with a new inspection
agency, a successor to UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Iraq has denounced the draft as unacceptable, but
Baghdad might be isolated if most Council members embrace the
proposal as a respectable compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq had also refused to permit UNSCOM inspectors to return to
Baghdad even to remove what it and Russia asserted were the
dangerous chemical substances left behind when UNSCOM inspectors
left Iraq shortly before American air strikes began in December.
UNSCOM officials say that slightly more than two pounds of mustard
gas and minute samples of sarin and other agents remain inside the
UNSCOM headquarters in Baghdad, and that the substances pose no
threat to the health or safety of Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Senior diplomats here said that the United States had asked
Annan's office to help resolve the problem over the toxic
substances in a way that satisfied Iraq and UNSCOM. One senior
diplomat said American officials were ``taken aback'' when they
learned that Annan's aides had asked the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, an independent organization that
monitors chemical-weapons agreements, to choose technical experts
for the mission who did not have UNSCOM experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``To allow the Iraqis to pick and choose who can enter their
facilities and who heads the inspectors does not bode well for the
current, or a future, United Nations inspection agency,'' said one
U.N. official and critic of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, several diplomats noted that the new team
would include at least one person on the special commission's
payroll _ Jaako Ylitalo, a Finnish citizen who worked for the
United Nations before joining UNSCOM. But Ylitalo is neither a
chemist nor technical expert; he is to accompany the team as an
administrator.

FOURTH-GRADERS HELP ARCHITECTS ENVISION THE OFFICE OF TOMORROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If you want to know what the workplace of the future
should look like, why not go to the experts: the workforce of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Callison Architecture Inc., a Seattle firm, did just that when
it recruited fourth-graders from Villa Academy to brainstorm the
way the office of the future will work.
</P>
<P>
   The kids came up with a host of intriguing, sometimes
insightful, and just plain fanciful suggestions for the office of
2015.
</P>
<P>
   One kid, for example, designed a hot tub with a built-in
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``About two years ago, when we started planning for Future at
Work, it occurred to us that those people (who will be working in
the future) are alive now,'' said Kim Jennings, co-principal with
the firm, who worked with Callison Principal Andrea Vanecko on the
Future at Work project. ``And they were the ones who didn't have
any preconceived notions about the way offices were supposed to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the same people employers will be recruiting in 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigwig in the corner office is an idea handed along and
has evolved through existing office culture,'' Jennings said.
Fourth-graders wouldn't be handicapped by history.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they have pretty vivid imaginations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks, 16 9- and 10-year-olds joined a team of Callison
architects to explore the nature of work and what people will need
to get their work done well.
</P>
<P>
   For kids, whose previous career ambitions mostly centered on
non-office work (firefighter, police officer, circus clown), the
notion of working in an office initially wasn't very appealing,
Jennings said. They described the office as a place ``no one wanted
to be in and everyone wanted to get out of.''
</P>
<P>
   But that described the office of today, Jennings said. When kids
were given a list of intriguing office jobs (travel agency for
space travel) and permission to recreate the office as we know it,
their perceptions changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found kids were definitely not perceiving work in the office
of the future as a negative thing,'' she said. ``They seemed to
have a lot of energy for accomplishment and collaboration. They
didn't bring negativity to the whole environment.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the kids' key findings was that businesses should help
people work together.
</P>
<P>
   Collaboration is critical to the economy of the future, but the
traditional office doesn't facilitate good teamwork, Jennings said.
The kids thought work would be like a team ``relay'' with
hand-offs. The spirit of group achievement permeated their thinking
with an emphasis on information sharing, rather than information
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish work in that fashion, they wanted more couches and
coffee tables, rather than desks.
</P>
<P>
   And they wanted soft, thick carpets ``so that when you want to
relax, it's comfortable to rest on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how social they were,'' Jennings said. ``They
wanted to have places where people could talk to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, they turned an existing concept _ the home office _ on
its ear, inventing instead an office-home that people wouldn't want
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the kids wanted to build in room for recreation and
leisure activities, such as virtual golf, she said. Also on their
wish lists were ``resting'' rooms, juice bars, and nature areas.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort was key. Light, warmth, food and nature were considered
essential office tools. Nature, in particular, was important ``to
look at because it calms you in case you get stressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Variety was another theme of the new office as envisioned by the
fourth-graders, perhaps not surprising given their quicksilver
attention spans.
</P>
<P>
   The kids wanted to to be able to change their media and their
environment easily. That meant taking today's open-plan design one
step further by creating a free-flowing ``compound'' of functional
areas. Such a compound would allow them to move around at will and
work in a variety of spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Closed offices should exist only for ``top secret'' work, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   For children of a high-tech world, the fourth-graders also
expressed a surprising interest in low-tech tools, such as markers
and whiteboards.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether they thought anything like what they imagined
existed in the workplace today, the children turned wistful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe (it did) in the '80s,'' said one, who wasn't even born
then. ``Because offices today (are) too high-tech.''

THE PREVIEW IN IOWA IS DRAWING A CROWD 
AS THE WORLD TURNS, THE FORDICES FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Iowa, Miss., Texas, Tenn.)  (nk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses are still seven months off,
but the frequency with which presidential candidates are showing up
in the state makes it seem as if the big event is nearly at hand.
And in a sense it is.
</P>
<P>
   With many states moving up the date of their Election 2000
caucuses and primaries in order to gain the kind of early influence
Iowa has traditionally had in the nominating process, next year's
campaign schedule is so front-loaded that a straw poll Iowa
Republicans have scheduled for Aug. 14 _ this Aug. 14 _ is
beginning to loom as the first real make-or-break test. The poll
could well take on the winnowing role of the caucuses and cut the
dozen-candidate field to three or four true contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week Texas Gov. George W. Bush began scouring the
state's cities and farm towns for organizers, apparently seeing the
August gathering as a chance to all but lock up the nomination, if
he wins big.
</P>
<P>
   Another hopeful, Pat Buchanan, asserted the other day that Bush
``clearly, basically, wants to end the race for the Republican
nomination on Aug. 14.'' Buchanan then began stepping up his own
Iowa appearances.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander,
still long on presidential hopes but lagging in the polls and as a
result beginning to run out of money, decided to concentrate almost
all his resources on Iowa. His campaign organizations elsewhere
were cut to the bone or all but shut down.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, former Vice President Dan Quayle, also squeezed
for money and lagging in the polls, announced that he was ``ramping
up'' his Iowa effort. He sent in a new chief of operations, hired a
consultant to help him latch on to the state's big Christian-right
vote, doubled the number of his field workers to 14 and committed
himself to five major campaign swings though the state between now
and the August straw vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a do-or-die event for some candidates,'' said Greg
Mueller, a consultant to another Republican contender, Steve
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   If Mueller has it right, even Forbes' huge personal fortune
might not be enough to keep him politically alive should he stumble
in Iowa in August.
</P>
<P>
   As the World Turns, The Fordices Fight
</P>
<P>
   In our last installment, Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice had just
returned from vacationing in France with a woman not his wife and
had demanded a divorce. His wife, Pat, had responded that she did
not want to dissolve a marriage of 44 years and intended to remain
ensconced in the Governor's Mansion. She said the other woman, Ann
Creson, an old flame of the governor, would just have to wait her
turn. Mrs. Fordice then offered ``apologies for being a partner in
a marriage that has become a source of embarrassment for
Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   The War of the Fordices has now escalated. On Tuesday, the
Republican governor summoned some members of the press corps and
tried to make a case for a speedy divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live separately in the Governor's Mansion,'' he argued,
``totally, with a closed door, no communication whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   The press cut to the Continental liaison, asking whether the
governor might be considered a hypocrite, given that a few months
back he criticized President Clinton for marital infidelity and
more recently signed on as a national co-chairman of the Quayle
presidential campaign, whose main pitch is family values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never lied before a grand jury,'' the governor replied,
``never lied to the people, wagging my finger on TV, never
conducted a scurrilous affair with a person half my age in the
White House in the middle of the day while talking on the telephone
to a senator. I'm not a womanizer of much renown.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he announced that he had just resigned his Quayle post,
telling the former vice president he wanted to do ``what's best for
you, Dan.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Fordice fired back, saying that contrary to
what the governor had said, she had maintained ``regular contact,
companionship and communication'' with him until the recent trip to
France. The governor, she said, is turning a marital tragedy into
``some sort of romantic comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   What, she asked, is she supposed to do with her life? Where is
she supposed to go?
</P>
<P>
   One answer, sort of, comes from Mississippi Pol Online, a
political tip sheet. It says there is some talk in the state's
political circles that Pat Fordice, perhaps inspired by the Hillary
Clinton model, ``may be looking'' to run for Congress. Possible
target: Rep. Ronnie Shows, a freshman Democrat from Mississippi's
4th Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.

   On April 28, with the sun setting outside their elegant Hilton
Hotel conference suite in downtown Jackson, Miss., the key figures
in what was, on paper, a vast philanthropic and insurance empire
gathered together for the first and last time.
</P>
<P>
   Those present included two Tennesseans who managed the Franklin
American Corp., operator of a dozen insurance companies in five
states. Also attending, after a long flight from Rome, were two
elderly Catholic priests representing the charitiable foundation
which owned the Franklin company.
</P>
<P>
   The guest of honor, and the man who controlled the empire, was a
pasty 44-year-old who variously introduced himself as a genius bond
trader, a multi-millionaire and an amateur student of Catholic
theology. They knew him by different names _ Eric Stevens and David
Rosse _ but his real name was Martin R. Frankel. That day, he
appeared in person for the first time to many people in the room.
</P>
<P>
   They have not seen him since. Frankel did not show up the next
day when the group met Mississippi regulators in an attempt to
convince them that the companies' books were in order.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, court records show, Frankel wired as much as $334.6
million in insurance company money from Franklin American to
foreign bank accounts, incinerated documents in his $3 million
Greenwich mansion and fled. He left behind notes that show he was
researching which foreign countries have no extradition treaties
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suspect that Frankel looted at least seven
insurance companies in several states of money they had given him
to invest. While no charges have been brought against Frankel, a
warrant has been issued for his arrest in what authorities is one
of the largest insurance frauds in history.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel also left behind a trail of questions that authorities
are still trying to answer. Why did so many people ignore what
appeared, in hindsight, to be clear signals of fraud? Were the
people who gathered at the Hilton unwitting dupes, as they or their
lawyers now maintain, or did they have some inkling of what was
going on? And, finally, where is Frankel?
</P>
<P>
   Those mysteries will not be solved soon. But what does emerge
from court documents and interviews with friends, business partners
and neighbors is a picture of Frankel as a brazen but wily con man,
a master puppeteer whose dealings spanned the globe, from Franklin,
Tenn., to the rarefied address of Lake Avenue in Greenwich, to the
British Virgin Islands to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Athough he was investigated once, in 1991, by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and agreed not to associate himself with the
securities business again, he promptly disregarded that ban. And as
he expanded his business reach, he added characters to the plot.
</P>
<P>
   His main and most recent target appeared to be the Vatican. Born
to a middle-class family in Toledo, Ohio, he at times portrayed
himself as a Jew interested in the Catholic religion. He flattered
Catholics on both sides of the Atlantic and promised millions for
Catholic charities to get into the good graces of the church
hierarchy. He courted prominent Catholics with private jet trips or
tickets on the supersonic Concorde, even though many of them did
not repay his attentions with much support.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most spectacularly, Frankel persuaded Monsignor Emilio
Colagiovanni, who edits a Rome-based journal on canon law, to sign
a sworn statement indicating that the Holy See funded and stood
four-square behind an organization Frankel headed. Colagiovanni
acknowledged in an interview in Rome that the statement was
``misleading,'' but denied he had engaged in any wrongdoing or knew
anything about the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the affidavit helped persuade the prominent law
firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld to continue representing
the foundation. The firm and its famous partner, Robert S. Strauss,
the former Democratic national chairman and former ambassador to
the Soviet Union, collected several hundred thousand dollars in
fees working on possible acquisitions of insurance companies, none
of which came to pass, according to a person who has reviewed the
billings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of people were conned by Marty Frankel, Eric Stevens,
David Rosse _ whatever his name was,'' said Aubrey Harwell, a
Nashville, Tenn., lawyer who represents the two Tennessee
businessmen who attended the April 28 meeting in a lawsuit against
Frankel. ``It's a classic ponzi scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   There were warning signs. Frankel mixed and matched his aliases
so boldly that guests at his dinner parties in Greenwich sometimes
addressed him by different names. His intermingling of charity and
commerce was befuddling to many who dealt with him. He bestowed
gifts on friends so lavishly that many said they considered him
reckless with his money, as if it did not belong to him.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel also led an eccentric, even dark, personal life. He
turned his luxury Greenwich estate into a fortress, traveled with
body guards when visiting his hometown, and trolled the Internet
for women to serve as clerical help, neighbors and associates said.
</P>
<P>
   He met and lived with several women he found through personal
ads, according to a statement he gave Greenwich police after a
woman was found hanging from a noose tied to the deck of one of his
Connecticut homes in 1997.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   EARLY LIFE IN TOLEDO
</P>
<P>
   Martin Richard Frankel was born on Nov. 21, 1954, into a
respectable middle-class family of lawyers and public servants. His
father, Leon, worked as a referee at a domestic relations court in
Toledo, and his mother, Tillie, was a clerk in the Toledo city
government.
</P>
<P>
   Marty, as he was known, was the third of four children. By all
accounts, he was a bright youngster, even brilliant, friends say.
Almost 6 feet tall, Frankel was thin, weighing 135 pounds, and,
friends say, awkward and introverted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have many friends when he was growing up,'' said
Bradford Dolgin, who attended Whitmer High School with Frankel.
``He was pretty eccentric.''
</P>
<P>
   In class, his political views were left-wing and unconventional,
one faculty member recalled.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Frankel's high intelligence, though, friends and
faculty members say he had trouble finishing what he started. He
seemed to have a phobia about taking exams, and rarely turned in
class papers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from high school in three years, near the top of
his class. He took courses at the University of Toledo in the late
1970s and early 1980s, but never earned a degree. His academic
record is under privacy seal, at his request, according to the
school's registrar.
</P>
<P>
   It was during his college years that Frankel fell in love with
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty was kind of a jack of all trades, master of none,'' said
George J. Windau, a college friend of Frankel. ``And then he became
a master of one: the stock market, commodities, currencies.''
</P>
<P>
   He became a day trader, rapidly buying and selling stocks, often
many times a day.
</P>
<P>
   He took his first professional crack at the securities business
at the Toledo branch of a New York brokerage firm, Dominick &AMP;
Dominick. Details are sketchy, but John Schulte, who headed the
branch, says that he fired Frankel in 1987 for failing ``to
produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Other tensions emerged between the two men. Schulte said his
marriage with his wife, Sonia, fell apart and she began a long
relationship with Frankel. According to police records, the three
at times tussled over allowing Schulte time to visit his two
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Those confrontations, friends say, caused Frankel to grow
increasingly fearful that Schulte would retaliate against him. It
was, some friends believe, one reason he left Toledo and turned to
aliases.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he left, friends and neighbors say he began to
install security equipment at home and hired a man named David
Rosse, who would eventually travel with him to Greenwich as his
security guard and whose name Frankel would appropriate for his own
use.
</P>
<P>
   When Frankel returned home last November for the funeral of his
father, who died at the age of 87, he came with a small army of
security guards.
</P>
<P>
   EARLY FAILURE
</P>
<P>
   By the late-1980s, Frankel had struck out on his own, setting up
a money management firm he called Frankel Fund, which he operated
from a room in his parents' home. He recruited local people and
retirees as investors.
</P>
<P>
   As the fund grew, he moved to West Palm Beach, Fla., seeking to
strengthen his business with retirees. Friends say that he moved at
the suggestion of Douglas I. Maxwell, a Tennessee man who formed a
partnership with Frankel called PDS Securities Inc. The partnership
raised at least $1 million for the Frankel Fund, according to
securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Creamer, the lawyer for two Ohio retirees who filed suit
against Frankel, said he boasted of living an extravagant life and
of having attracted a Romanian queen and the king of Yugoslavia as
investors. ``He was a kind of Woody Allen character, kind of
goofy,'' Creamer recalled. ``It's kind of disarming.''
</P>
<P>
   But the venture did not last long. At least one of Frankel's
clients raised questions, and soon Frankel was back in Toledo,
telling investors that his partner, Maxwell, had bungled their
investments.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission had another view. It
froze the accounts of the Frankel Fund. In a settlement, Frankel
agreed to stay away from the securities industry forever as
punishment for having lied about the fund's performance, his own
experience and even how the proceeds would be used.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   INSURANCE INTERESTS GROW
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the SEC was cracking down on the Frankel Fund,
Frankel was teaming up with John A. Hackney, a Tennessee bank
executive, to buy insurance companies. It is an industry that is
regulated by the states, not by federal agencies like the SEC.
Frankel appears to have targeted small, troubled insurance
companies that were vulnerable to embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel and Hackney did not actually meet until eight years
later, in the Mississippi hotel. But over the phone, Hackney became
fast friends with the man he came to know only as Eric Stevens, who
portrayed himself as an experienced bond trader eager to employ a
novel and lucrative trading strategy to improve the returns on
insurance company assets, according to Harwell, Hackney's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said that Hackney was paid a straight salary for
managing insurance companies that he bought on Frankel's behalf and
had no other interest in Frankel's dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Hackney did agree to steer the insurance companies' investment
business to Frankel's Liberty National Securities.
</P>
<P>
   To make their first acquisition, of Franklin American Corp., the
two partners set up Thunor Trust. Frankel's name was not associated
with the trust, but several of his acquaintances are identified in
state documents as investors who put up the $3.8 million in startup
funds.
</P>
<P>
   They were Sonia Schulte, the Toledo girlfriend, Edward Krauss, a
Frankel family friend who now lives in Columbus, Ohio, and Mark C.
Shuki, an acquaintance from Chicago. Krauss said in an interview he
had nothing to do with Thunor and did not willingly lend his name.
The others could not be reached for comment. It is unclear where
the seed capital actually came from.
</P>
<P>
   Thunor grew rapidly. In half a dozen transactions between 1993
and 1995, it acquired controlling stakes in eight insurance
companies, including some based in Mississippi, Oklahoma, Arkansas
and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   All of the companies sent their money to be invested by Frankel
through his company, Liberty National. The address sounded
impressive, 82 Wall St., Dept. 1105, but it was nothing more than a
mail drop. Harwell said Hackney was not aware of that fact.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's Liberty National appeared to be doing an outstanding
job managing Franklin's assets, according to financial statements
the securities firm sent to Hackney. When Franklin needed money
back for some reason, Liberty National readily provided it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was every appearance of legitimacy,'' Harwell said. They
thought Frankel ``was a guru,'' he said. The companies' statements
from Liberty National showed they were earning outsized returns on
simple-sounding investments in U.S. government bonds _ performance
that would have been astounding from Wall Street's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty National was operating from Frankel's mansion in
Greenwich. He moved to the wealthy New York suburb in 1991, around
the same time he plunged into the insurance business. According to
associates and neighbors, Frankel converted his home into a
full-fledged trading floor, with 80 computers, satellite dishes and
direct links to the New York Stock Exchange. He later bought two
other residences in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But the major splash Frankel made had little to do with his
reputed trading prowess.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in August 1997, Arnold Courier, an elderly
Greenwich resident, heard a woman's screams echo through Lake
Avenue. The commotion seemed to be coming from the home of a
reclusive neighbor that he knew as Martin King, another alias for
Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Courier said, he and other neighbors learned that
something horrible had happened at 881 Lake Ave.
</P>
<P>
   A woman had hanged herself. Police arrived on the scene to find
Frances Burge, a heavy-set 22-year-old, lying dead on the ground
outside the house.
</P>
<P>
   The death was ruled a suicide. Days later, when the Couriers
read about what had happened in the local newspaper, they asked
their lawyer, Gregory Saum, to contact the police to tell the story
of the chilling screams. Saum said he later contacted the Drug
Enforcement Administration, fearing that the death may have been
related narcotics activity. DEA agents came to the neighborhood and
asked questions. The agency's inquiry does not appear to have led
to any action. A spokeswoman for the agency said it does not
confirm or deny the existence of any non-public investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is among the many bizarre events that unfolded at
the Frankel houses on Lake Avenue throughout much of the 1990s, as
Frankel used the money that the government now says was stolen to
create a lavish lifestyle. Interviews with people who knew him and
visited his homes paint a vivid picture of a reclusive and paranoid
man, obsessed with his physical safety.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel turned his properties into armed camps, posting
gun-toting guards, and erecting a 6-foot metal fence complete with
cameras and flood-lights perched on top.
</P>
<P>
   But associates also described a man who had trouble meeting
women and who scoured the Internet and placed ads in the Village
Voice in search of dates. Some of the women who befriended him were
from far-flung locations, like Switzerland, Alaska and Russia, the
associates said. Several ended up living in Greenwich homes that
Frankel rented for them, for prices ranging from $4,000 to $10,000
a month, according to local real-estate experts.
</P>
<P>
   Pornography and sexual fetishes were prominent features of the
house. According to police reports, during a search of the house
following the death of Ms. Burge, authorities discovered a leather
riding crop, ropes and sadomasochistic literature and videos.
Similar items were found by police following Frankel's
disappearance, along with a number of pornographic videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   When police interviewed him about Ms. Burge's death, he spoke
openly about how he found women in personal ads, invited them to
his home and often paid them to live with him or nearby. ``The
girls do not get paid a salary, but I give them money as they need
it,'' he told the police.
</P>
<P>
   To some who knew him, Frankel seemed odd rather than dangerous.
These people described him as a compulsive talker, who flitted from
topic to topic. They said he was a compulsively fussy eater who had
two live-in chefs who worked around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   But some neighbors said they worried about what was going on at
Frankel's Lake Avenue residences. The driveway bristled with fleets
of BMWs and Mercedes Benzes, as people traipsed in and out of the
Lake Avenue homes 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions erupted. In one case, when Frankel's fence cut off a
public riding trail, the director of the Greenwich Riding and
Trails Association, Donna Nives, said that she rang the doorbell at
881 Lake Ave., only to hear an electronic recorded voice: ``Who are
you and what do you want?'' She fled.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   COURTING CATHOLICS
</P>
<P>
   Though he was raised Jewish and expressed fervently pro-Israel
political views to friends, Frankel aggressively courted the
Catholic Church and the Vatican religious hierarchy beginning last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of his involvement with Catholic priests and the
Vatican differ, but one thing seems certain: Frankel promised
lavish financial contributions to Catholic charities in return for
support from their leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel told the priests he met with that his interests were
purely charitable. But from the moment last August when the Saint
Francis of Assisi Foundation was founded in the British Virgin
Islands with the motto ``To Serve and Help the Poor and Alleviate
Suffering,'' he used it as a vehicle for business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear why. One explanation advanced by associates of
Frankel is that a foundation backed by the Vatican might lend him
credibility in buying additional insurance companies that would
keep his scheme alive. Others suspect that he may also have seen an
advantage to creating another layer between himself and the
companies he controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his motives, he pursued his quarry with ardor. He
stacked the shelves of the library in his Greenwich home with
Catholic literature, including histories of the saints and papal
encyclicals, visitors to his home said. He familiarized himself
with the life of St. Francis of Assisi, renowned for helping the
poor. He told people he had repeatedly watched the Franco
Zefferelli movie about St. Francis.
</P>
<P>
   The books and the knowledge of the saints helped Frankel win the
trust of Thomas A. Bolan, a New York lawyer and supporter of
Catholic causes who became a foundation trustee. Frankel told
Bolan, who was the law partner of the late Roy Cohn, that he
planned to give at least $50 million to Catholic charities
immediately, and wanted Bolan's help in arranging an audience with
senior Catholic clerics to discuss the gifts, said Bolan's lawyer,
Maurice R. Nessen.
</P>
<P>
   Bolan introduced Frankel to another well-connected American
Catholic, the Rev. Peter Jacobs, who would also become a trustee of
Frankel's foundation. Jacobs, despite having had run-ins with the
Catholic church hierarchy in America, had connections in Rome,
where he lives in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jacobs who introduced Frankel to his most important
religious contact, Colagiovanni, 80, who serves as president of the
Monitor Ecclesiasticus Foundation, an educational organization that
has ties to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Colagiovanni, now retired, had served as a judge on an important
church tribunal, the Roman Rota. As president of the Monitor
Ecclesiasticus, he served at the behest of the Vatican Curia, or
Senate. Vatican officials said there was no connection between the
Monitor organization and the Vatican but declined to answer further
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Colagionvanni recalls being impressed with Frankel's
determination to help the poor, as well as the securities trader's
knowledge of St. Francis of Assisi. ``If I cannot trust the
Catholic Church, who can I trust?'' Colagionvanni recalls Frankel
asking him.
</P>
<P>
   The Church officials say they were also dazzled by Frankel's
personal generosity. While negotiating with the Vatican, he bought
Bolan tickets on the Concorde, and flew Jacobs across the Atlantic
in first-class cabins after the priest said he declined offers to
fly on Frankel's private jet. When Frankel learned that Bolan's son
was dying of multiple sclerosis, he paid for a nurse to attend to
the son at home, Bolan's lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The courtship paid dividends. Jacobs and Colagiovanni arranged
for the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation to have access to an
account at the Instituto per le Opere di Religione, the Vatican
bank, which is jealously guarded and off-limits to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most helpful to Frankel were two affidavits, drafted
by Frankel's lawyers and signed by Colagiovanni, several people
directly involved in the process confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The first, issued last November, claimed that the St. Francis of
Assisi Foundation was an organization within the Holy See, meaning
that it carried the imprimatur of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   A second, issued three months later, backed off that assertion.
It said the Monitor Ecclesiasticus Foundation contributed $1
billion to the Saint Francis of Assisi Foundation, and further
claimed that the money emanated from ``various Roman Catholic
tribunals and Roman Catholic cultural institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Both statements are now widely doubted. Colagionvanni calls the
affidavits a ``mistake'' and ascribes his willingness to sign to
misplaced trust in Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   But though Frankel clearly expected the religious overlay he put
on his operation to help him expand his empire rapidly, the
purported link to the Vatican ties did not, apparently, do him much
good. They might even have contributed to his demise.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation bought control
of Thunor Trust and, by extension, Frankel's growing network of
insurance companies. Frankel, however, quickly discovered that
invoking the name of the Vatican raised red flags everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations for two new purchases of insurance companies, one
in Colorado and another in Washington State, fell through after
Frankel arranged for the St. Francis foundation to become the
purchaser instead of Thunor Trust. Foreign ownership, prohibited by
some state insurance regulators, was one stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Francis was telling us that they were ultimately
controlled by the Vatican. But if that was the case, then they
could not buy Capital Life,'' said Joseph L. Blattner, president of
the Capital Life Insurance Company of Denver, which negotiated with
Frankel's organization for nearly six months before the talks
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, by late 1998, regulators were beginning to catch up
with Frankel. Tennessee state examiners questioned why the Franklin
insurance companies that they oversaw had placed so much money in
one pot _ Frankel's Liberty _ and worried about rapid turnover of
the Liberty accounts. Liberty reported trading volume in 1998 of
about $14 billion, in exchange for earning a negligible $40,000 in
commissions. Frankel dodged a bullet when he transferred assets
back to Tennessee before a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   He had a harder time fending off Mississippi officials a few
months later. Regulators in that state questioned the same trading
patterns. But Franklin's answers made matters worse. They revealed
that the change in ownership from Thunor to St. Francis of Assisi
had not been reported, as required, to local authorities. That is
what prompted the late April gathering in Jackson, where many of
Frankel's colleagues saw him in person for the only time.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show that Frankel may have known the end was near.
Even before that meeting, Franklin subsidiaries began transferring
large sums to Liberty National or other accounts directly
controlled by Frankel, including $161 million from Mississippi
insurance companies and $117 million from affiliated companies in
Missouri. The court records suggests that most of that money was
transferred into foreign bank accounts by early May.
</P>
<P>
   On May 7, two days after firefighters responded to a fire caused
by burning documents in the Greenich mansion, Hackney, Jacobs,
Bolan, Colagiovanni, legal officers at Akin, Gump, regulators in
several states and many others were told that Frankel had
disappeared without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all seemed so good, like Brooke Astor,'' Jacobs said,
referring to the New York benefactress and reflecting on his ties
to Frankel. ``Only he turned out to be the devil.''

EX-CLAIMER BUDROYALE CLOSES IN ON $1 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ One evening last fall, as they toasted
Budroyale's California Cup Classic victory at Santa Anita, owner
Jeffrey Sengara offered trainer Ted West Jr. the sweetest deal this
side of Cal Worthington.
</P>
<P>
   West had pointed out that Budroyale was creeping up on $1
million in earnings, no mean feat for a vagabond claiming horse
with a severe Lasix dependency. West also had mentioned something
about needing to replace the beat-up truck he was driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get this horse to the $1 million mark, I'm going to
have to buy you a car,'' replied Sengara, remembering how his
Pacific Northwest neighbor Mike Pegram made a similar promise to
Bob Baffert regarding the sprinter Letthebighossroll.
</P>
<P>
   Now the only question seems to be... stick or automatic?
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale will go into Sunday's $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup
needing just $22,690 to reach seven figures. Seeing that there are
only four entrants in the race, and fourth place is worth $60,000,
all the 6-year-old gelding has to do is finish the 1\ miles and his
trainer will have all the horsepower he can handle.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, West and Sengara are hoping to do a lot better than
fourth. And since the illness of would-be favorite Old Trieste left
Budroyale and jockey Garrett Gomez the likely pacesetters, plenty
of objective analysts believe they can pull down the $600,000
winner's purse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if Old Trieste ran his race, we were all running for
second,'' West said this week, referring to Budroyale and his Gold
Cup opponents Real Quiet, Puerto Madero and Malek. ``Now, I think
we have a legitimate chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Hollywood Gold Cup is a classic race for older horses,
and its winners include Seabiscuit, Citation, Swaps, Round Table,
Native Diver, Ack Ack, Affirmed and Cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Could its 60th running be won by a son of Cee's Tizzy who has
run for claiming prices between $32,000 and $80,000 15 times, who
didn't win a stakes race until his 27th start, who has competed for
six trainers and raced under a dozen jockeys?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if ex-claimer Charismatic can win the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness, then Budroyale can win the Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sengara claimed him for $50,000 at Santa Anita in February
1998, the gelding has earned nearly $700,000, winning five stakes
in 12 tries including the Grade II Mervyn LeRoy in May and the
California-bred Super Diamond two weeks ago. This has to be the
most profitable claim of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Not many horses show improvement at the advanced ages of 5 and
6, but Budroyale has done it. Sengara credits Ted West, his trainer
of record until April, and Ted Jr., who's running the barn while
his father is suspended for a medication violation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Wests, Budroyale this year has been able to avoid the
bouts of pulmonary bleeding that held him back in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always had the fundamentals there. He's always had the
athletic ability and the heart,'' said Sengara, who first noticed
Budroyale when he beat 1996 Kentucky Derby winner Grindstone in an
allowance race that February, and didn't need to be talked into
claiming him when West suggested it two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a tremendous amount of credit has to be given to the
Wests for isolating the things that needed to be taken care of to
get him to this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale ran in the Gold Cup last year and finished fifth
behind Skip Away. He won't finish fifth this year _ and not only
because it's a four-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a much better horse this year,'' the younger West
said.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the biggest win in the careers of jockey Gomez,
27, trainer Ted Jr., 26, and owner Sengara, 29.
</P>
<P>
   The effervescent Sengara inherited his Vancouver lumber business
and his love of horse racing from his late father, who had horses
with the elder West. Now Sengara is passing his enthusiasm on to
his two children. Budroyale is helping.
</P>
<P>
   Sengara said his 2-year-old son Kevin shows no interest in
watching Barney, the purple dinosaur. He'd rather watch videotapes
of Budroyale, the bay horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of fathers have baseball or some other passion they
share,'' Sengara said. ``It looks like we have horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever a day that stands out in my life, other than
the day I married my wife and the days my two wonderful kids were
born, February 15 (1998) is the day that changed my life,'' Sengara
said. ``Bud has just put a lot of confidence into everyone that's
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   But can little Kevin afford his share of the car payments?
</P>
<P>
   Sengara laughs about his promise to West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much to my relief, he went out and bought a new car earlier
this year, so maybe I can get away with giving him a little rust
bucket,'' Sengara said. ``I didn't tell him what year the car would
be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's hedging,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. The last rust bucket Sengara bought turned into a
Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   That's Budroyale. &UR; !dlim! &LR; !end! &QL;

PEOPLE CLOSE TO MURDER SUSPECT FIND NEWS STORIES `INCREDIBLE'

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The suspected serial killer of at least eight
people in the United States is a dog lover who spent time with his
mother in northern Mexico as recently as three months ago, two
acquaintances said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. authorities know him as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the
people of Rodeo, a small farming town in Durango state, know him as
Angel Maturino Recendez. He owns a small plot of land and lives
with a woman who works as a health-care worker. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Police investigator Sergio Arturo Rocha said in a telephone
interview that he thought Resendez-Ramirez, 38, had taken the
surname of his stepfather, a retired military man.
</P>
<P>
   Court official Ramon Amaya said Resendez-Ramirez has no criminal
record in Rodeo. Amaya and another man who knows Resendez-Ramirez
said they saw nothing to make them think that they were dealing
with a sadistic killer, as he is being portrayed in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was quiet and quite serious,'' said Amaya. ``He never
bothered anyone. He rode around town on his bike, and there were
always two or three dogs trailing behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Amaya said Resendez-Ramirez has an angry streak. When someone
drove a truck over one of his dogs, Amaya said, Resendez-Ramirez
chased him and threw a car battery through the vehicle's window.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved his dogs,'' Amaya said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities say Resendez-Ramirez was born in the central
Mexican state of Puebla, probably about 1960, and has lived and
traveled throughout the United States for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Amaya said the suspect's mother and his stepfather, Luis
Maturino, a native of Durango state, moved their family, including
Resendez-Ramirez, to the remote desert town of Rodeo in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Resendez-Ramirez has been in and out of the
community. He most recently returned three months ago to visit his
mother, Virginia Recendez-Ramirez, Rocha said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocha said he sent police officers to talk to the family
Wednesday, but their house was empty. Julieta Dominguez, the woman
who lives with Resendez-Ramirez, did not show up for her job at a
government-run health clinic, Rocha said.
</P>
<P>
   They had heard about the news accounts linking Resendez-Ramirez
to at least eight slayings in the United States, and apparently
left town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fled,'' Rocha said, ``partly because of embarrassment and
partly because they knew we'd want to question them.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has placed Resendez-Ramirez on its Ten Most Wanted list
and has reportedly questioned people in Mexico about him.
</P>
<P>
   Amaya, who got to know Resendez-Ramirez while processing deeds
and other official documents for him, said the family included his
mother, a devout Jehovah's Witness; at least two sisters who now
live in Ciudad Juarez, near El Paso; and one or two brothers.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a half-sister and other relatives in New Mexico, and
cousins in Texas. The FBI says Resendez-Ramirez also has relatives
in Kentucky, where he is charged with murdering a college student
in 1997 and raping the man's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Rocha said Resendez-Ramirez met Dominguez in the early 1990s and
that they have lived as man and wife for about five years. There is
no record of a wedding ceremony, he said, adding that the couple is
childless.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the couple bought a house together under her name, said
Amaya, who helped them with the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   While most jobs in Rodeo are linked to the region's farm
economy, Dominguez is a laboratory assistant at the government
health clinic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocha said that after he saw Resendez-Ramirez's picture on a TV
news show Wednesday night, he recognized the suspect as a man who
had come into his office last spring to press charges against
someone he claimed was taking his land.
</P>
<P>
   The plot was small, ``only a few meters,'' said Rocha.
</P>
<P>
   But the charges were not filed, Rocha said, because
Resendez-Ramirez did not have proper identification. Rocha asked
him to get an ID card before he could process the accusation.
Resendez-Ramirez did not return, and the issue was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows him,'' said Rocha. ``Everyone in town thinks
this is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   That disbelief is echoed in the Dallas area, where a cousin of
Resendez-Ramirez said, ``He's always been real respectful and out
to help everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't believe all this about him,'' said the relative,
who asked not to be named. ``Most of the family's attitude is, `We
leave it in God's hands.' ''
</P>

 &HT;    Krummenacker eyes top-miler role
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ On any weekday afternoon, the track at Georgia
Tech resembles the warmup field at the Olympic Games. Gold medalist
Derrick Adkins and his quick understudy, Angelo Taylor, are honing
their stride pattern over the 400-meter hurdles, while gold
medalist Derek Mills is running repeat 400s. NCAA runner-up Andria
King works to improve her standing in the 100-meter hurdles, while
defending U.S. champ Tisha Waller is practicing the high jump.
</P>
<P>
   They all dream of Sydney, and competing in next summer's Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, does David Krummenacker, an unassuming, yet confident
young man. Only Krummenacker also aspires to fill the void _ if not
this year, then by the summer of 2000 _ as the next great American
miler.
</P>
<P>
   Krummenacker is a somewhat unexpected candidate for such a lofty
role, having fancied himself an 800-meter runner before graduating
from Tech last spring. His speed has held up nicely over the longer
distance, though. Last season, he was ranked No. 5 in the U.S. at
1500 meters and figures to contend for a title here at the USA
Outdooor Track and Field Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Even though bothered by a strained calf muscle the past week,
the 24-year-old advanced from the semifinal round Thursday night,
finishing fourth in his qualifying heat in 3 minutes, 45.85
seconds. His top competition in Saturday's final is likely to come
from Steve Holman _ generally regarded as the top American miler,
but a runner who has a mental block when it comes to the national
championships and Olympic trials _ and defending national champion
Seneca Lassiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. is really looking for an up-and-coming miler,'' said
Krummenacker, three-time ACC champ in both the 800 and 1500 meters.
``For a long time, people thought Steve Holman would be the guy. I
think I'm capable of being the guy. I'm well built (6-2, 170) for
the 1500. I have the proper speed to hang with all of the top
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The best part is he's grudgingly come to accept that his future
rests in the 1500, not the 800.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's been an on-going conversion. The 800 has always been
his signature race. That's what he ran at the 1996 Olympics Trials,
advancing to the semis. And it wasn't until he showed up here
Tuesday that it became official, he would give in to the preachings
of his coach, Alan Drosky, and bypass the 800 for the 1500.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely arrived on the national scene, and I'd say
he's very close on the international scene,'' Drosky said. ``I can
see him running world-class times this summer in Europe, in the
3:33 range (for the 1500). My guess is he's about a year away from
being truly on the world-class level. I think he can be ready for
the Olympics, I really do. What transpires this summer will factor
into his Sydney chances. Krummenacker needs the experience of
running in national and world championships at 1500 meters, along
with landing invitations to top European races this summer _ which
is why a strong showing here is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about experience,'' Krummenacker said. ``The 800 is
over so quick. You're down to 200 meters and everybody is gunning
(for the finish). The 1500 is a lot more tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   The 800 has evolved into almost an all-out sprint, led by world
record-holder Wilson Kipketer (1:41.11). Krummenacker has speed to
match the top American 800-meter athletes, but on the international
scene his best hope to make an impact is in the longer distance.

METS FOCUS ON MARLINS, NOT SCOREBOARD, AND EARN A SWEEP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Fla., Canada)   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mets agreed beforehand not to watch the scoreboard, not to
worry about what the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves
were up to in their afternoon game against Montreal. For most of
the afternoon Livan Hernandez and the Florida Marlins made sure the
Mets paid attention to what was unfolding Thursday on the dirt and
grass of Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Until the eighth inning, Hernandez, the Cuban right-hander,
looked a lot better than his numbers. He blew fastballs by Mets
hitters for four strikeouts, used nasty breaking stuff to pitch out
of jams and even led off the seventh inning with a double and
scored to tie the game at 2-2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But much to the delight of a sun-soaked crowd of 29,567, the
Mets once more came up with counterpunch hitting, this time from
the bats of John Olerud and Robin Ventura in the eighth, to hand
the Marlins their ninth consecutive loss, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Mets' 14th victory in 17 games. They have won six
consecutive series and are 10 games over .500 (41-31) for the first
time this season.
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves' 3-2 victory in 11 innings over Montreal, the
Mets remained three games behind the Braves in second place as they
headed to Atlanta for the first of six games tonight against the
Braves (44-28) in the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the team in front of us, and those games are very
important to win,'' Ventura, who was 3 for 4 with two runs batted
in, said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who has hit .358 in the last 20 games, drove in the
game-winning run _ it was his eighth r.b.i in the last 10 games _
after Olerud floated a one-out double down the left-field line
against Hernandez, who was tiring in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   While manager Bobby Valentine of the Mets replaced Olerud with
the pinch-runner Luis Lopez, Manager John Boles of the Marlins left
Hernandez in to face Ventura. It was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Ventura had singled down the right-field line to
drive in Edgardo Alfonzo and tie the score at 1-1. Brian McRae then
hit a sacrifice fly to left field to score Olerud, who had reached
first on an error by the third baseman Mike Lowell, and the Mets
led, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   But the Marlins tied the score in the seventh inning when the
Mets' starter, Orel Hershiser, was replaced by Greg McMichael. If
Hershiser was erratic _ he allowed six hits and one run with five
strikeouts and three walks _ then McMichael was plain ineffective.
He gave up two hits and a run in a third of an inning before being
replaced by the left-hander Dennis Cook.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the eighth, with Lopez on second, Ventura sliced a
fastball that Hernandez was trying keep away from him just beyond
the reach of the shortstop Alex Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking for something to put the barrel of the bat
on,'' said Ventura, who chased Hernandez from the game and dropped
his record to 3-7 despite allowing just two earned runs in seven
and a third innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' late-inning dramatics came as the Shea scoreboard
showed the Expos beating the Braves, 2-1, in the ninth inning.
Before the game, the Mets' ace, Al Leiter, said his teammates knew
it was too early to begin watching the scoreboard. He said it was
appropriate only after the second week of August.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think they know we're going to be there all year,'' he
said of the Braves. ``We were last year and we're a better team
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has a case, especially from the pitcher's mound. Cook
threw an inning and two-thirds, gave up one hit and struck out
three to improve his record to 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco took over the National League lead in saves, with
his 19th, by pitching a scoreless ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting the pitching and real clutch hitting,'' Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are peeking ahead at the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he had not heard much talk in the clubhouse about
their rivals and confessed to only glancing at the scoreboard at
the end of the game to discover the Braves had tied the Expos, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the clubhouse, however, the players were searching for
television sets and providing one other updates of the Atlanta
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chipper Jones knocked one with two outs,'' reported Turk
Wendell to a couple players shaking their heads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But beginning Friday night the Mets have a chance to alter the
standing themselves, even if, according to Leiter, it is too early
to matter. &QL;

WHY GIVE UP? KNICKS SHOOTING TO MAKE HISTORY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two months ago, the Knicks were a cautionary tale,
not characters for a storybook. They were caught in the political
Garden games between Ernie Grunfeld and coach Jeff Van Gundy, mired
in discord and performing selfishly on the floor. They were an
embarrassment, a collection of misfits assembled for a league-high
$68 million, a team of stars on the verge of a humiliating
collapse. They became an allegory on how money corrupts.
</P>
<P>
   But something as priceless as pride kicked in, and the Knicks
turned doom into destiny and paid back their debt. They won for the
ticket-holders who came to see them and for the fans who wanted to
love them. They filled the ownership coffers by stretching out a
profitable playoff run and gave the league a big-market draw for
the National Basketball Association finals.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly nothing to be embarrassed about, even though
the Knicks face elimination Friday night in Game 5 at Madison
Square Garden. No one has ever come back to win the finals after
being down, 3-1, so no honor would be lost in a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But after all the games the Knicks have played in pain, played
short-handed and played in defiance of logic, why give in now? Why
not live for one victory and give good karma a chance? That's all
Van Gundy asked of his players when he met them before practice
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them they're only bound by what they believe can still
be accomplished,'' Van Gundy said. ``If they believe that since no
one else has ever done this, that it can't be done, then that will
be reflected in our play. As I told them, no eighth seed has ever
made it here, either. So history doesn't have to hamper us. All we
have to do is win one home game. Can we win one home game? Then can
we go to San Antonio and get one road game? And then you're playing
the ultimate game. I just made that sound a heck of a lot easier
than it is, obviously. But that's the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as I said to them, you don't ever want this, but who's to
say that sometime soon we may not be the team that suffers an
injury that hurts you? It could happen. And the longer you play it
out, the more chances you give yourself to be the beneficiary of
good fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan and David Robinson had a healthy glow Thursday after
combining for 42 points, 35 rebounds and 7 blocked shots to give
the Spurs a 96-89 victory in Game 4 on Wednesday. The Knicks pulled
to within a point in the last six minutes but were too fatigued,
emotionally drained and undermanned. The Knicks could have lived
with the dominance of the Twin Towers, but not with what Avery
Johnson did. Every time he penetrated past Charlie Ward or a big
man on a mismatch, he broke down the Knicks' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pick-and-roll coverage was an abomination,'' Van Gundy
said. ``It was more communication and breakdowns rather than
getting picked apart on great plays. Avery Johnson was in the lane
all night off pick and rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't our offense. It was our defense and rebounding. You
can't get outrebounded by 15 and win.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the answer?
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have the right spirit, but their bodies are on the
last-call round at the bar. They are down to five players at full
strength. With one day of rest on his sprained right knee, Larry
Johnson may be helpless to slow Duncan or give much more than his
5-point, 6-rebound effort of Game 4. With a sprained left knee that
felt only moderately better Thursday, Chris Childs will be hard
pressed to run around with Avery Johnson when Ward gets tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very complementary to each other,'' Ward said of Childs,
who played just seven minutes in Game 4. ``It's like taking your
wife away. Sometimes, you feel a little loss. I fought through it
Wednesday night, but hopefully Chris will be able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   There is hope. But there has to be a plan, too. The Knicks will
have to show more discipline in their defensive rotations or watch
Robinson and Duncan out rebound them as a team again. Allan Houston
and Latrell Sprewell have to make better decisions when
double-teamed and have their teammates knock down their open shots.
Bad knee and all, Larry Johnson has to be one of those offensive
threats to complement the points Marcus Camby can give.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my Spurs got a little something on me with those 3s,''
said Larry Johnson who was 0 for 3 from 3-point range Wednesday
night. ``They're rotating on me. It's one thing for a 6-8 guy to be
rotating to you, it's another for a 7-footer to do it. They're
doing a heck of a job of bothering that shot, but I'm doing a heck
of a job of missing it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have been missing up close, as well. Layups have
never been so hard for the Knicks with the looming presence of
Robinson and Duncan in the paint. The Spurs, after being beaten by
Houston's midrange jumpers in Game 3, were able to funnel the
Knicks inside where Robinson and Duncan lurked in Game 4. The
repetition of blocked shots seemed to frustrate the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are averse to major change, if things get
desperate, the Knicks might try the big backcourt combination of
Houston and Sprewell, using a lineup that Van Gundy sarcastically
refers to as the ``panacea'' for their problems.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the only cure for their dire predicament is a
victory at the Garden. All the motivation they need is the fear of
the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see them jumping around and cutting down our
nets in the Garden,'' said Camby, whose 20-point, 13-rebound effort
made an impact in Game 4. ``Our fans don't want to see it, and we
definitely don't want to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks want to see San Antonio. To make that trip, the they
will have to scrape the residue from a bone-dry tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think fatigue is a factor,'' Van Gundy said. ``I can't sit
here and say we are not tired and not tired within the game and not
less than what we'd like to be health-wise. I think all of those
factors can hurt your mental state. And that's what I addressed
with our team, is that we owe it to ourselves to win tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   They have paid their debt to everyone else after a season that
even the Spurs had to admit seemed ripped from the pages of a
motivational manual.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about perseverance,'' Avery Johnson said.
``Those guys can persevere. They've been weathering storms all year
long. They need to write a book.''
</P>
<P>
   A storybook rather than a cautionary tale. &QL;

COKE BOTTLING SITE IN FRANCE GIVEN CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.) (Eds: See also COCA-COLA-EUROPE) 
(mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   DUNKIRK, France _ French authorities lifted a ban Thursday on
canned Coca-Cola soft drinks produced at a bottling plant here,
saying they had found no evidence of contamination to explain an
outbreak of nausea by people who drank them in Belgium early this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Coca-Cola Enterprises, the bottling company that is
about 40 percent owned by Coca-Cola Co., said the ensuing health
scare, and bans on Coke products in France and Belgium, would
reduce the bottling company's earnings by $60 million in the second
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The bottling company officials, saying they hoped the crisis was
now over, attributed the problems to a Dutch pallet supplier they
would not identify. They said it had supplied them with the wooden
pallets on which stacks of cans were shipped to Belgium. But
between February and April this year, they said, the Dutch company
treated 800 of the pallets with a type of disinfectant compound
banned in food production that could have rubbed off on some cans
and made them smell bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain customers in Belgium were made queasy by this bad
odor,'' said Dominique Reiniche, president of Coca-Cola Enterprises
SA, the company's French bottler.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Schimberg, president and chief executive of Coca-Cola
Enterprises Inc., the parent bottling company in Atlanta, said,
``All the affected pallets have been removed from the plant and
from the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances by the French health authorities and
government officials in Paris Thursday that all the cans they had
tested were free of impurities, outside or inside, and had caused
nobody in France to become sick, the chief prosecutor in Dunkirk,
Francois Muguet, was continuing an investigation into whether rat
poison on soft-drink cans could explain why some drinkers fell ill.
</P>
<P>
   Marylise Lebranchu, the French consumer minister, said earlier
Thursday that no traces of rat poison had been found on any cans
produced here. ``We have not been able to establish a correlation
between illnesses in France and the beverage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reiniche commented: ``There is no rat-poison problem. I
would say we'll let justice take its course.''
</P>
<P>
   The French government lifted its ban Thursday morning on sales
of Coke, Sprite and Fanta produced at the sprawling, squeaky-clean
plant on the outskirts of Dunkirk. On Wednesday, the Belgian
authorities ended a 10-day ban on the same beverages there.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the conveyor belts here were rattling with trains of
red cans that were about to be double-stacked, 16 feet high, on
wooden pallets that make it easier for forklifts to distribute
them.
</P>
<P>
   The French food safety agency certified Coca-Cola products as
safe Thursday morning, citing the transitory symptoms reported by
consumers in France and the few people affected.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, French officials said they were not impressed
with attempts by Coca-Cola to explain what might have gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A Dutch toxicologist hired by Coca-Cola reported earlier this
week that the pallets had been treated with a compound similar in
some respects to creosote, a wood preservative that can contain the
strong petroleum distillates phenol or cresol and is used to keep
fungi and insects from attacking railroad ties or fence posts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vincent Garry, director of environmental medicine and
pathology at the University of Minnesota, said that phenol- or
cresol-based preservative compounds could produce headaches or
nausea in people who came in contact with them, particularly in a
closed or hot space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the dose that makes the difference,'' he said, and large
doses or chronic exposure could produce nerve inflammation, skin
allergies or even cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The tightly guarded gray plant, behind barbed wire fences on the
southern edge of Dunkirk, has produced 11 billion cans of
carbonated soft drinks since it started operations in 1989, as many
as 8 million a day. Schimberg said Coca-Cola Enterprises had
invested more than $100 million in it and said it had 240 full-time
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them, like Eric van den Put, a Dutch truck driver who
was waiting Thursday to pick up a load of soft-drink cans to take
them to the Netherlands, were hoping that the trouble with the
company's products would just blow over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't found a thing wrong with Coke anywhere, have
they?'' van den Put said as he backed his trailer up to the
warehouse.

PROPOSED LEGISLATION AIMS TO IMPROVE RECREATION, RESTORE HABITAT
ALONG MISSOURI RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Let's restore the original, wild Big Muddy
-- at least a bit, says one U.S. senator. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dams, the levees, the channeling of the Missouri River have
all served a purpose, says U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska
Democrat. But wouldn't it be nice, Kerrey asked Thursday, to have a
river to fish in, to canoe in, to picnic by. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey on Thursday introduced a legislative package of river
reforms -- the Missouri River Valley Improvement Act -- that, if
approved, would allocate $320 million over the next 10 years to
improve recreation and restore fish and wildlife habitat along the
length of the Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Missouri River Valley Improvement Act of 1999 will help to
restore and improve our access and enjoyment of the river, and will
provide vital economic, recreational and educational opportunities
for everyone who lives along and visits this great river, the crown
jewel of the Midwest,'' Kerrey said Thursday on the Senate floor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation is also timed to prepare for, and take
advantage of, increased interest in the Missouri that is expected
to come with the 200th anniversary of Lewis and Clark's 1804
exploration of the river. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposed new programs: channel enhancements that would
create more habitat for fish and wildlife; a federal study of ways
to restore 25 percent of the lost flood plain habitat in Missouri,
Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska; promotion of riverfront developments;
and a study of replenishing the once-vast cottonwood stands along
the upper Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest-ticket item is $188.8 million for long-term
scientific monitoring of the river. That would be overseen by the
U.S. Geological Survey's center in Columbia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican, may be key to the proposed
legislation's fate. Last year, Bond proposed his own legislation to
improve fish and wildlife habitat on the lower Missouri. And Bond
is among the Republican leaders on environmental issues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bond's staff said Thursday that the senator had yet to review
the Kerrey bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such river issues are so controversial that Bond would prefer to
receive feedback from river interests before deciding whether to
support the proposed legislation, said Dan Hubbard, Bond's
spokesman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey's bill also would amend the Flood Control Act of 1944 to
give the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers new authority to protect,
enhance and restore fish and wildlife on the Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The construction of dams and levees may have aided flood control
and navigation, Kerrey said, but that work also has reduced habitat
and squandered opportunities for recreation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill also proposed the construction of Lewis and Clark
interpretive centers along the river, although Kerrey didn't
specify their locations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have railed for years about the way man has
changed the Missouri in the last half-century -- channeling,
cinching, dredging, shortening and damming it. As a result, they
contend, most of the river's natural life -- its fish, flora and
animals -- has been lost, not to mention an opportunity to attract
more tourists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American Rivers, a national environmental group that has long
advocated changes in the Missouri's operation to benefit fish and
wildlife, supports the Kerrey bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to put fish and wildlife on equal footing with other
river issues,'' said Chad Smith of American Rivers. ``This bill
helps strike a good balance.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the bill should have a good chance of success because
it doesn't tackle the most controversial issue on the Missouri --
the control of its flow. The flow issue pits downstream barge
interests, which want high flows for as long as possible, against
upstream states that want to hold the water in recreation lakes
during the summer, and environmental advocates that want the Corps
of Engineers' controls to mimic nature -- allowing the river to
rise in the spring and shrink in the summer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The corps in October is expected to issue its latest proposal
for controlling the river's flow. The corps has delayed issuing its
plan, hoping that the Missouri River Basin Association, which
includes representatives of the Indian tribes and states in the
Missouri River valley, will reach a consensus on the flow issue,
said Richard Opper, the association's executive director. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The association last year assembled its members and other
interested parties and reached consensus on a number of new
programs to improve fish and wildlife habitat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation includes a lot of things that the Missouri
River Basin Association has already agreed to,'' Opper said.
``There's a lot in it that we would support.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the proposed legislation may help the corps because
it will have a legal responsibility to take steps to recover
endangered species that remain in the Missouri, Opper said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a growing awareness of these issues,'' Opper said,
``and I think Congress will be supportive.'' &QL;

THE KNICKS' OPTIONS DWINDLE TO SPREWELL AND HOUSTON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Knicks have tweaked the lineup and shifted the
load with each bit of attrition. They needed more scoring, so
Latrell Sprewell became a starter again. The team's stamina
flagged, so Marcus Camby got his first start.
</P>
<P>
   They found new offensive patterns without Patrick Ewing and
unearthed a different vein of scoring with each new casualty.
</P>
<P>
   But now as they cradle desperation _ with Larry Johnson's knee
wearing down to a nub and Chris Childs the latest to be slowed by
injury _ just how much more can the Knicks hope to wring from their
exhausted offense Friday night in Game 5 of the National Basketball
Association finals?
</P>
<P>
   Even if Camby can match his effort in Game 4 on Wednesday night
_ when his 20 points made up for Johnson's lack of production _ and
even if coach Jeff Van Gundy decides to put Sprewell and Allan
Houston in the backcourt together, can the Knicks find enough
points to overcome the dominance of Tim Duncan and David Robinson?
Especially if the rest of the Spurs' starters perform as they did
in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spree and I are both prepared for it,'' Houston said of the
possibility of their being backcourt mates, with Sprewell playing
point guard, as the Knicks try to stay alive in a series they trail
three games to one. ``We're comfortable with it. We feel we can be
effective if called upon.''
</P>
<P>
   What has become obvious during the post-season is that even when
the Knicks get significant scoring from a third source _ as they
did from Johnson in Game 3 and Camby in Game 4 _ Sprewell and
Houston are the only reliable offensive options Van Gundy has.
</P>
<P>
   When the Knicks' defense failed in Game 4 _ as the Spurs plucked
every rebound off the rim like blooms from the vine _ the Knicks
had to go shot for shot with San Antonio. With double-teams on
Houston and Sprewell forcing the Knicks to penetrate, they played
into the Spurs' strength.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks drew fouls and shot 28 free throws, but they were
also hurt by the Spurs' 9 blocked shots. At the end of the Spurs'
96-89 victory, with Sprewell and Houston reluctant to drive to the
basket and settling for jumpers, there were simply not enough good
shots left in their weary bodies to snatch a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aggression going to the basket was good,'' Van Gundy said
Thursday. ``We went to the basket and I thought we went hard. We
got to the free throw line some. They got some blocks. That's just
part of it. If you're not going to go there, you're not going to
get to the free throw line and we need to get to the line. Duncan
and Robinson did a great job protecting the paint, but offense
wasn't really our problem last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense was. But the Knicks' offense could not make up for it.
Certainly, Sprewell and Houston, who played 46 minutes each, were
fatigued late in the fourth quarter when the Knicks trailed by only
a few points. In the last five minutes of the game, Sprewell and
Houston missed seven jumpers, one a 3-point attempt that Sprewell
rushed to take in anticipation of a double team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't attack them down the stretch,'' Sprewell said. ``We
have to mix it up. All of the shots weren't bad shots. We've got to
take some of those jump shots and take it to the basket. When
they're doubling us, somebody is open. We have to consistently find
that open guy. And it's up to that guy to make those shots. We have
to stop these guys. We're in low 40s and they're in high 40s. We
have to find a way to bring that down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell had 26 points on 9-of-22 shooting, 40.9 percent from
the field. That may sound low, but Sprewell shot 41.5 percent from
the field in the regular season. Houston had 20 points on 7-of-18
shooting, 38.9 percent, just below his 41.8 percent regular season
average.
</P>
<P>
   They can have breakout games, as Houston did in Game 3 with 34
points, but Sprewell and Houston are doing about all that can be
expected from them. With so many of their teammates withering, they
will have to do more of it if the Knicks hope to survive for
another game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are going to back off, I'm going to shoot the
jumper,'' Houston said. ``We have to be aggressive offensively. We
can get into the penalty early. Sometimes we can get our shot off
before the double-team comes. The key for us is to make the correct
pass out of the double-teams and get our guys good looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope to mine another lode of offensive production.

A COMPLETE ROBINSON LOOKING FOR VALIDATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everyone, besides the Knicks and their faithful fans,
seems to be gearing up for the validation of David Robinson. It is
as if all his individual achievements _ his placement in 1996 among
the 50 best players in National Basketball Association history, his
Most Valuable Player award in 1994-95 and his eight All-Star Game
appearances _ will finally be legitimized if the San Antonio Spurs
win the championship this season.
</P>
<P>
   The questions and correlations have begun to border on the
humorous. For instance, Robinson was asked Thursday if he had seen
the movie ``Jerry Maguire.'' After answering yes, he was asked if
the film's climactic moment, in which the sports agent portrayed by
Tom Cruise tells his wife: ``You complete me,'' summed up his
feelings about winning an NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not quite,'' Robinson responded with laughter. ``It feels
good, but it doesn't feel that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, one of the most respected and well-rounded players in
the league, said he already feels complete, thank you. An NBA title
will not change his opinion of himself, he said. But that does not
mean he lacks an intense desire to win it all.
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident Wednesday night, when he displayed a
seldom seen aggression on the offensive backboards, nearly
outrebounding the Knicks by himself in that category. Robinson's
nine offensive rebounds in Game 4, one fewer than the Knicks'
total, helped give the Spurs a 14-10 advantage on the offensive
glass and a 49-34 rebounding advantage over all.
</P>
<P>
   When the close final score (96-89), the Spurs' 17 turnovers and
the basic effectiveness of the Knicks' offense are taken into
account, it is obvious that the Spurs' dominance on the backboards
was the difference in the outcome. That is a credit to Robinson,
who had 17 rebounds, and Tim Duncan, who had 18. Despite San
Antonio's overwhelming height advantage, its sudden supremacy in
rebounding was a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs were outrebounded in each of the first two games and
tied the Knicks with 36 rebounds in Game 3. The Knicks' dominance
had been on the offensive end. They entered Game 4 with a 35-19
advantage on the offensive glass. Robinson had been incredibly
ineffective, grabbing just one offensive rebound through the first
three games.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, when the title the Spurs seemed to be taking for
granted was suddenly in jeopardy, Robinson, 33, went after missed
shots with a ferocity that many have said he does not possess.
</P>
<P>
   ``David was just a monster,'' Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich said.
``I'm so happy for him because he showed a lot of people what he
could do. A lot of people counted him out this year for reasons
that I'm still trying to figure out. But he was absolutely
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all good big men, including the Knicks' Patrick Ewing,
Robinson is judged by more than his statistics and moderate
post-season success. Though his place among the league's best
players is secure, in the eyes of many, he must win a title to join
the elite players.
</P>
<P>
   That criterion has dogged Robinson perhaps more than any of his
contemporaries because of the long-standing view that he is a soft
player, one who might have already won a championship if he had
played with more fire. That notion reached its peak when, after
winning the mvp award in 1995, Robinson was outplayed by Hakeem
Olajuwon when the Houston Rockets eliminated the Spurs in the
Western Conference finals. Robinson is not too proud to admit that
living with that perception has been painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would say something about me that I knew was not
true,'' he said. ``I mean, I'm one of the most competitive people I
know. When people question your desire to be out there on the
floor, that bothers you. It bothered me. So it just gave me a
little bit more fuel to kind of keep coming at it, keep working. So
now it's nice to kind of come to a point where people see that I
can have the personality that I have and still be a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's teammates understand that one more victory will go a
long way in lifting his stature.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Elie recalled a recent conversation with Robinson. ``I
said, `Hey, you can shut a lot of people up, big dog.' He was
excited. He knows he has one more game to win and he knows what's
at stake. This is the only thing that he hasn't accomplished in his
career, and this would be a nice final chapter to a terrific career
he's had.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson understands what a title would mean. ``It gives
justification to all the work, the time that you put in,'' said
Robinson, who has career averages of 25.1 points and 11.5 rebounds.
``You spend all those times in the summer doing your sprints,
running up and down the hill, trying to get your body together, and
it's kind of a closure in that sense. That's where it would really
be a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no. I'm pretty complete before the championship. I didn't
feel incomplete last year, and I don't think I would feel
incomplete without it. It just makes me feel like all that
individual working came to everything. Big deal if you won stuff _
scoring champ, defensive champ _ if it doesn't amount to anything.
Now it's amounting to something good.''
</P>
<P>
   That being, however unfairly, the validation of a great player. &QL;

JOHNSON RESPONDS TO WALTON 
TELEVISION RATINGS DOWN
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ The horn to signal the end of the interview session
sounded twice, but Larry Johnson kept talking even as his Knicks
teammates were stretching before Thursday's practice. What subjects
so engrossed him? Slaves and Bill Walton.
</P>
<P>
   One actually related to the other. On Sunday, Johnson picked up
a $25,000 fine for his obscene tirade after two National Basketball
Association officials asked him to take part in a mandatory
interview session. Two days later, Johnson compared his Knicks
teammates to ``rebellious slaves.'' In the aftermath of those
comments, Walton, the NBC analyst, called Johnson a disgrace to the
NBA and a sad human being.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was amused at Walton's insights, and delivered a
response as part of a lengthy interview in which he explained his
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that the same Bill Walton that was at UCLA and smoked
pot, a hippie?'' Johnson said. ``If that's the way Bill feels,
that's the way Bill feels. You know what? I respect that. That way
me and Bill know where each other stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like for as long as Bill has been killing me on TV from
what my family and everyone tells me.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson then did his Walton impersonation. He smiled wide while
tilting his head up and down to depict how disingenuous he thought
Walton was when they occasionally pass in the hallways. Then the
smile left his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't come at me like that,'' Johnson said. ``If I'm on fire,
don't spit on me. I won't spit on you. That's respect. You go your
way, and I'll go mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was asked to explain how he could compare himself to a
slave when he has an $84 million contract in his chosen profession.
At that moment, the horn blew and coach Jeff Van Gundy and the team
were waiting for him on the practice floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a minute, Jeffrey,'' Johnson said. ``I ain't getting
fined no more. I might get put out of the league. But let's say
this: No one man can rise above the masses or the condition of his
people. I am privileged and honored by the situation I'm in. No
question, I have an excellent opportunity. And this is a beautiful
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we've made beautiful strides, but what percentage of
black people has made that stride when I go back to my neighborhood
and see the same thing? I'm the only one who came out of my
neighborhood. All of them dead, on drugs, selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I supposed to be honored and happy just by my success? Yes,
I am. But I can't deny the fact of what's happened to us over years
and years, and we're still at the bottom of the totem pole. I can't
turn my head to that. That's my point.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson made his point. But some wonder if his controversial
ramblings this week are associated with his frustration over
playing with an injury and struggling to guard Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's guarding a guy who is a lot taller than him,'' Don
Chaney, the Knicks assistant coach, said. ``He's half hurt, and
he's not handling it very well. I think it's getting to him
mentally.''
</P>

   Television Ratings Down
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ratings for the National Basketball Association finals
continued to falter during Game 4 of the Knicks-Spurs series, which
produced a 12 Nielsen rating, down by 37 percent from the
comparable game last year, when Chicago played Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Through four games, the 11.3 average rating is down by 35
percent from 17.5 a year ago. The San Antonio market posted a 53.6
rating, New York a 22.6.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the last time the Knicks played in the finals,
against Houston in 1994, this year's rating is down 7 percent.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than a week after House Democrats voted
against a gun-control package rather than accept what they said
were soft terms in a measure to regulate gun shows, Rep. Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader, seemed to open the door
at least a crack Thursday to some sort of compromise on that point.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday morning, Gephardt suggested that
while he and many other Democrats had insisted on three business
days for gun-show vendors to complete background checks on
customers, a shorter time frame might be acceptable if the checks
were faster.
</P>

   In a telephone interview late Thursday afternoon, Gephardt said
he did not intend to imply that he or other Democratic proponents
of gun control were willing to cede ground on a matter they felt
was critical. What he was proposing, he said, was to make the
background-check system so fast that disagreements about time
limits would become moot.

   White House Seeks to Expand Drug Offender Programs
</P>
<P>
   In a fresh effort to break the cycle between drug abuse and
crime, the Clinton administration is pushing to expand the testing
and treatment of drug offenders whose addiction led them to collide
with the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's director of national drug control policy, Gen.
Barry McCaffrey, is scheduled to announce details of the
initiatives Friday at a forum on substance abuse and the criminal
justice system in the White House Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
   The main proposals include making more federal money available
for drug courts, which offer nonviolent lawbreakers treatment as an
alternative to prison; helping states and cities expand drug
testing and treatment of their inmates, and compelling offenders on
probation and parole to abstain from drugs.

AMES FINDS WESTCHESTER TO BE EASYGOING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ It has been a difficult year for Stephen Ames,
who has encountered more problems off the golf course than on it.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Canada and a native of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, Ames
missed almost five months of the PGA Tour season while waiting for
complications with his visa to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long story,'' said Ames, who spent the first 21 weeks
of the year at home in Calgary, Alberta, his golf career on hold.
``I couldn't get into the states. I thought all the hiccups had
been resolved, but another hiccup occurred at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even watch golf. Knowing what I was capable of
doing, I couldn't watch. It was eating me up inside. I didn't look
at the papers at all. It was frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Ames made up for lost time Thursday. Playing with confidence in
his debut at Westchester Country Club, he shot a six-under-par 65
in the first round of the Buick Classic and led by one stroke over
Frank Nobilo and by two strokes over Jim Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Byrum, Greg Chalmers, Jay Haas and Steve Pate were in a
four-way tie for fourth place at 68. But they were all chasing
Ames, who has returned to golf with the ease of a fish returning to
water.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in only his third tournament this year, Ames had seven
birdies and one bogey, using accurate driving and strong iron play
to leave himself consistently close to the hole. The longest birdie
putt that Ames made was a 12-footer. He saved par on his final two
holes by getting up and down from bunkers, making a 15-foot putt at
No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   At age 35, Ames wants to make a name for himself in the United
States after spending five successful years on the European Tour.
Winning the Buick Classic would be an excellent way to start, and
he believes that Westchester suits his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great golf course; I enjoyed it very much,'' Ames said. ``I
very much like the old style kind of golf course, the fact you can
play a variety of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his visa problems, Ames did not make his 1999 debut
until last month in the Kemper Open, where he finished tied for
44th. Considering how he felt on the first tee that week, Ames was
pleased to finish that high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heart palpitations,'' he said. ``I had forgotten what
that felt like. I started off bogey, bogey, double bogey. I
completely forgot how to play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ames regrouped quickly, and now his No. 1 goal is to retain
his tour card for next year, either by winning a tournament or by
finishing among the top 125 on this year's money list.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, Ames will remember 1999 not only for the
hassles, but also for the high points. His wife, Jodi, gave birth
to the couple's second child, Ryan, last month, and both Jodi and
Ryan were waiting for Ames when he finished Thursday's round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with my performance, but there's a lot of golf to
go,'' Ames said. ``I'd like to keep the same thoughts I had today,
the same feelings in my golf swing. If I can retain that, I'll be
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nobilo, Thursday's round was further evidence that he is
coming back from numerous health problems. Nobilo was diagnosed
with a form of arthritis in his wrists two years ago, and the
medication to treat that condition weakened his tendons and
ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   Nobilo fell from 23rd on the tour money list in 1997 to 108th
last year. In addition, an errant tee shot at a golf course in
Florida last summer struck Nobilo above the left eye and he
required 30 stitches.
</P>
<P>
   But Nobilo's luck and his golf game have changed for the better
recently. He has stopped taking medication for his wrists, and they
have been free of pain for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Nobilo looked like his old self Thursday, making 30-foot putts
for birdies at No. 10 and No. 16 and a 20-footer for birdie at No.
15. After his recent struggles, Nobilo was thrilled to see his name
on the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the hardest thing in my life,'' Nobilo, a native of
New Zealand, said of his health problems. ``I made a lot of
sacrifices to come over here and play. I wasn't a great player but
I was a good player, contesting in all the majors. My attitude
suffered. As positive as I tried to be, I couldn't be. I wanted to
do well, but for a period of time, I wasn't competitive. For
awhile, I thought it was the end of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Carter, he turned 38 Thursday and celebrated by shooting
one of his best rounds of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot it was my birthday until my college golf coach
reminded me,'' said Carter, whose best 1999 finish is a tie for
11th at the MasterCard Colonial. ``Not too bad of a birthday
present.''

SOME LOSE, SOME GAIN AS ACCOUNTS SHIFT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Mo., Ill., Kan.)   (nk)

<P>
   Even with hundreds of Madison Avenue executives away in Cannes,
France, for the 46th International Advertising Festival, accounts
have been moving around at a hectic pace.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines eliminated the New York office of Foote, Cone
&AMP; Belding Worldwide, from its agency roster after seven years by
moving its international account, with billings estimated at $40
million, to Ogilvy &AMP; Mather New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy New York, part of the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of
WPP Group PLC, will handle advertising and direct marketing for the
important Northwest Asian-Pacific routes, creating campaigns to run
both domestically and in Asian-Pacific markets like Hong Kong,
Korea, Japan and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Dow, vice president for marketing programs and worldwide
advertising at Northwest in St. Paul, Minn., attributed the
selection of Ogilvy New York to factors including the agency's
``extensive travel expertise.'' Current and former travel clients
include American Express, Eastern Airlines and Trans World
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest roster includes agencies like Carmichael Lynch in
Minneapolis, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, and Hunt
Adkins in Minneapolis. As it happens, Hunt Adkins is one of seven
small shops that joined with Ogilvy Worldwide in February to form
the Syndicate, a creative consortium.
</P>
<P>
   At Foote, Cone, a unit of True North Communications, Vonda
LePage, a spokeswoman, said: ``We of course regret losing the
Northwest business. But we have been on a good new-business streak
this year.'' Gains include assignments from Clairol, Sunbeam and
Vlasic.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago office of DDB Worldwide Communications Group, a unit
of Omnicom Group in New York, figured in three account shifts.
</P>
<P>
   The Ameritrade Holding Corporation in Omaha named DDB Chicago as
the first agency to handle the account of Onmoney.com, a
financial-planning Web site to be introduced next month. Billings
were estimated at $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a three-month review that Kim Shepherd,
a spokeswoman for Ameritrade, said had been narrowed to DDB Chicago
and two other finalists: Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New York, part of
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC, and Ogilvy One in Chicago, part of Ogilvy
Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   DDB Chicago is also losing an account, the Salon Selectives line
of hair care products sold by a unit of Unilever Home and Personal
Care U.S.A. in New York. Salon Selectives is being shifted to
another Unilever agency, J. Walter Thompson New York, part of the
J. Walter Thompson Co. unit of WPP. Billings were estimated at $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Andress, a spokeswoman for Unilever, confirmed reports
about the shift, which came without a review, in the trade
publication Advertising Age and the Frohlinger's Marketing Report
newsletter. A sibling brand, Thermasilk, is handled by Thompson
Chicago; DDB Chicago continues to handle two others, Finesse and
Degree.
</P>
<P>
   And Webstreet Securities, an online stockbroker, awarded its
account, with billings estimated at $50 million, to TBWA/Chiat/Day
in New York, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom. Webstreet
parted ways with DDB Chicago in June 1998; advertising had been
handled in-house in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   Avi Fox, co-chairman at Webstreet in Deerfield, Ill., confirmed
a report in the trade publication Adweek about the decision, which
came, he said, after an eight-month review narrowed to
TBWA/Chiat/Day and Lord Group in New York, a joint venture of
Dentsu Inc. and Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, a client formalized a relationship with an
agency. Monster.com in Maynard, Mass., a career management Web site
owned by TMP Worldwide, formally named Mullen Advertising in
Wenham, Mass., as the first agency to handle its account. Billings
were estimated at $15 million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic, had
previously handled Monster.com on a project basis, most notably the
creation of a popular commercial that ran during Super Bowl XXXIII
in January.
</P>
<P>
   Two other units of Lowe based in New York _ Lowe Fox Pavlika and
Lowe Interactive _ were named to handle assignments for Beenz.com
in New York, a company introducing a currency called ``beenz'' that
consumers can spend on electronic commerce. Billings were estimated
at more than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowe units will work on tasks that include direct marketing,
interactive marketing and a fall campaign for Beenz.com aimed at
consumers. The units will collaborate with Twelve Stars
Communications in London, a brand strategy consultant that
developed the Beenz brand.
</P>
<P>
   In another change, J.Crew Group placed its account in review
after the resignation of Angotti, Thomas, Hedge in New York, which
had been agency of record for only two months. Billings were
estimated at $10 million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Terrie M. Paladino, chief operating officer at Angotti, Thomas,
a unit of Interpublic, confirmed an Adweek report about the
resignation. Because ``the scope of the assignment changed
dramatically,'' she said, ``we did not want to continue to work
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Karina Sokolovsky, a spokeswoman for J.Crew in New York,
confirmed the review but would provide no further information.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Yellow Freight in Overland Park, Kan., the
transportation company owned by the Yellow Corporation, began a
review for a national branding account, with billings estimated at
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Bension, managing partner at Select Resources
International in Los Angeles, which is managing the review, said
the Yellow Freight agency of 12 years, NKH&AMP;W in Kansas City, Mo.,
had resigned in tandem with the decision to review. The review will
be narrowed to six or seven agencies, she said, with a decision
expected by mid-August.

RISING COSTS PUSHING FILM PRODUCTION ABROAD, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., N.Y., Wash., Texas, Ill., N.C.)   (af)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ About 27 percent of American movies and television
series made last year were filmed outside the United States to save
money, costing the nation the equivalent of 23,500 full-time jobs
and more than $10 billion, according to a study being released on
Friday by two Hollywood unions.
</P>
<P>
   The report, commissioned by the Directors Guild of America and
the Screen Actors Guild, is apparently the first to try to quantify
the extent of ``runaway production,'' the movement of film making
to lower-cost countries that many film industry workers say has
cost them their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Both unions have hired Washington lobbyists and are expected to
use the study's results to push for federal tax breaks to keep film
production in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that 34 percent of television productions last
year were made outside the United States for cost reasons, as
opposed to script requirements, up from 14 percent in 1990. Most of
that increase came from movies made for television.
</P>
<P>
   About 139 films, or 45 percent of television films, were made
outside the United States in 1998, virtually all of them in Canada.
The number of television series and miniseries _ each of which was
counted as one production _made abroad for cost reasons was 46 in
1998, or about 35 percent of the total number of series.
</P>
<P>
   About 19 percent of theatrical films last year were made abroad
for cost reasons, mostly low-budget movies. Still, that was up from
14 percent in 1990. And 24 movies with budgets of more than $25
million were made outside the United States in 1998, compared with
none in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to witness an accelerating trend here,'' said
Mark Lubkeman, the project leader at the Monitor Co. in Cambridge,
Mass., which conducted the study. ``We're starting to see some
larger productions start to run away.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic effect, however, is considerably smaller than the
percentage of productions would suggest because television movies
have lower budgets than series or feature films. About $2.8 billion
was spent abroad on such productions in 1998 out of a total
production budget of $17.6 billion for the films and television
series surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Including indirect effects of the lost spending, the study
estimated a loss to the nation's economy of $10.3 billion out of a
total economic impact of $74.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that producing in Canada was about 25 percent
less expensive than in the United States because of tax incentives
and the weak Canadian dollar. Some studio executives say that union
contracts are partly responsible for the high costs in the United
States, but Lubkeman said that even if wages were cut significantly
it would not erase the cost gap with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Getting tax breaks in Washington could be difficult because of
the controversy over violent movies. Moreover, the report itself
notes that movie and television production has continued to grow in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To gain support in Washington, the unions are trying to show
that runaway production is a problem for the whole nation. The
report said that Los Angeles and New York had experienced growth in
film making over the last few years while North Carolina,
Washington, Texas and Illinois, which rely on low-budget
productions, had seen significant cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, which represents the large studios, said Thursday that he
had not seen the report. But he said that some productions had
always gone abroad and that the movement to Canada could reverse if
the Canadian dollar strengthened. Also, some of the job pressures
being felt by film workers came from cutbacks in the number of
films being made.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti said he would favor investment tax credits for
production in the United States but cautioned that Hollywood could
not be too nationalistic because 42 percent of its revenue now
comes from foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say, `We want to enter your market but we won't let
our people produce in your country,''' he said.

TWA MECHANICS EXPRESS DISPLEASURE WITH TENTATIVE AGREEMENT,
NEGOTIATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Area mechanics of Trans World Airlines
vented their anger and frustration Thursday as they gathered to
vote on a tentative agreement with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Machinists Local 1650, after a morning meeting
downtown, made it clear they weren't happy with the 18-month
contract proposal, which has the union leadership's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going down,'' said one man as he walked away from the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 16,000 TWA employees in three separate work groups have
the chance to vote on the proposal, including about 2,300 mechanics
who work at TWA's overhaul base at Kansas City International
Airport. The results of the voting by all three groups are not
expected to be released until July 10.
</P>
<P>
   As they usually do when voting on a contract proposal, union
members are also taking a strike authorization vote.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Nelson, president of Machinists Local 1650, said the union
members' frustration did not necessarily mean the proposal would be
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're angry about it and expressing their complaints about
different parts of it,'' he said. ``It doesn't mean they'll reject
the entire contract. You just can't tell until the voting is
completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Several TWA mechanics at the meeting Thursday expressed similar
complaints about the proposal: wages that remain below the industry
standard and an inadequate pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't happy with it,'' said John Partridge, a mechanic
who has worked at TWA for 25 years. ``We'll still be at the bottom
of the pay scale for any of the major airlines. We have families to
take care of, and the older guys are way short on their retirement
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Heilig, a 33-year TWA veteran, said past concessionary
contracts and employee sacrifices had not amounted to a financially
stronger airline. Meanwhile, Heilig said, the company has made
payments to departing TWA chief executive officers through the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much contingency and too much `blue sky' in this
thing,'' said Heilig, also a mechanic. ``The company has reneged on
their word before, so why won't they do it again? TWA has to
convince me they want to run an airline and not run with the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   About 400 people attended the meeting Thursday, Nelson said.
Those who work the early shift at the overhaul base were scheduled
to meet Thursday evening to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Speer, another longtime TWA employee, said the anger among
TWA's Kansas City work force was significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have some very unhappy campers going to vote,'' Speer said
before attending the evening meeting. ``I think they feel they have
been sold out by the union and the company. You've got people here
ready for retirement, and this contract does not help them one
iota.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he expected many union members to express their
frustration at the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we didn't get everything we wanted with this
tentative agreement,'' he said. ``It's not easy to take the hit our
members have taken through the years. But our chief negotiators
felt they got everything there is to get. We represent so many
different work groups that it's hard to resolve all of their
problems at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Several TWA mechanics Thursday expressed their distrust of both
the company and union leaders as a result of the tentative
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said, ``It's unfortunate they feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the mechanics should be upset if union negotiators
``fail to extract money from the company if it's there to get. But
there's simply nothing else left to get.''
</P>
<P>
   The tentative contract for mechanics and related workers would
raise senior mechanics' top hourly pay to $20.04 by August 2000
from the current $17.93. Ramp workers' top hourly pay would
increase to $16.59 in August 2000 from the current $14.85.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has agreed to pay $10 million to settle various
grievances and issue 3 million shares of common stock over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The contract also calls for TWA to begin contributing to the
Machinists' national pension fund in March 2000. TWA stopped
contributing in 1992, when the airline filed its first bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Another complaint about the contract is that pay raises are not
retroactive. Under federal labor law, TWA's contract with the
Machinists union remained in effect even though it was supposed to
expire in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics and related groups have most of their employees in
St. Louis and Kansas City, with smaller numbers in New York and Los
Angeles. Ramp workers at various TWA destinations also are voting.
Voting in St. Louis took place Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the mechanics, the Machinists represent the
flight attendants and passenger-service workers. If any of the
three groups votes down the tentative agreement, the contract is
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty to 40 area passenger-service employees will have a chance
to vote on their contract proposal at Local 1650's union hall in
Riverside today. The flight attendants, who are voting by mail,
will have presentations on their proposal Saturday and Sunday at
Local 1650.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Jim Martin, TWA's senior vice
president of human resources, resigned Thursday. Martin, who was
hired in October 1997, was vilified by union leaders and employees
during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders had contended that Martin's previous record,
including a stint with the Coors Brewing Co., showed a hostility
toward unions.
</P>
<P>
   TWA declined to comment on the circumstances of Martin's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brown, a TWA spokesman, said the company was determining
whether to fill Martin's position. In the meantime, Martin's duties
of employee relations, labor relations and corporate security will
be handled by Kate Soled, senior vice president and general
counsel.

COURT RULING ON DISABLED TEACHER   IS ANNULLED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court followed up its new, restrictive views
limiting protections for disabled Americans Thursday by setting
aside a lower court ruling in New York that said state officials
had discriminated against a law school graduate with a reading
disorder who failed the state's bar examination five times.
</P>
<P>
   The high court, without ruling on the merits of the case, told a
federal appeals court in Manhattan to restudy its ruling last year
in the light of the justices' decisions on Tuesday sharply limiting
the definition of who should be considered disabled under the
Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibited
discrimination against the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court held in three cases that people with physical
impairments are not protected by the law if they can function
normally by wearing glasses, taking medication or otherwise
compensating for their disabilities. The rulings were applauded by
employers, but denounced by advocates for the disabled who
contended that millions would be deprived of needed protections.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York case, Marilyn Bartlett, a Vermont Law School
graduate who is a college instructor, had argued in a 1993 lawsuit
that she was entitled, because of a reading and learning
disability, to extra time in taking the bar exams, along with the
opportunity to circle multiple-choice answers in a test booklet
rather than a computerized test sheet and other accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   The accommodations had been refused by bar examiners after an
expert said Bartlett's reading test scores did not confirm a
disorder. Many licensing organizations charged with maintaining
professional standards contend that some claims of disability are
made as a cover for academic shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal trial judge, Sonia Sotomayor, and the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals in New York agreed with Bartlett, 50, who
earned a doctoral degree from New York University and even worked
in medical malpractice law for two years before being forced to
leave her firm because of her repeated bar exam failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Bartlett, who has fought an uphill battle with a reading
disorder throughout her education, is among those for whom Congress
provided protection under the Americans With Disabilities Act,'' a
three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Bartlett's cognitive impairment _ her difficulties in
automatically decoding and processing the printed word _ limits her
major life activities of learning and reading to a substantial
degree,'' the court added. It said the accommodations would let her
compete fairly ``so that it will be her mastery of legal skills
that the exam is designed to test _ and not her disability _ that
determines whether or not she achieves a passing score.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge had ordered the state board of examiners to pay
Bartlett $12,500 in damages for four tests she was forced to take
without the extra time _ she failed the fifth despite being given
the accommodations _ but the appeals court ordered a recalculation
that would award her no more than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The New York attorney general's office argued in an appeal to
the Supreme Court that, even if Ms. Bartlett was suffering from a
reading impairment, she had ``developed self-accommodating
techniques which allow her to read at a speed and in a manner
comparable to that of an average person'' and should thus not be
covered by the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at her homelast night, Bartlett said she was
disappointed by the high court's decision to set aside the ruling
in her suit, one of about half a dozen cases the justices sent back
for lower-court review in light of this week's rulings. But she
voiced confidence that the circuit court judges would reaffirm
their decision. ``They have recognized that I do have a
disability,'' she said. ``A learning disability is not a
correctable impairment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's lawyer, Joanne Simon, said there were ``light years
of difference'' between her client's disorder and the disabilities
the Supreme Court said were correctable and excludable from the
law's protections. She said the court had taken a ``seductively
simplistic path'' in saying, for example, that a disability could
be corrected with eyeglasses. ``It's too easy,'' she said. ``You
can't analyze most disability issues the way you analyze myopia.''
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dopp, a spokesman for the New York attorney general,
Eliot L. Spitzer, said he could not comment on the ruling until
officials had a chance to study it. But he said it appeared to be
``the first demonstration of just how far-reaching the court's
Americans With Disabilities Act decisions will be.''

HAMM DELIVERS AS U.S. RUNS OVER NIGERIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., North Korea, Nigeria)  By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Sixteen minutes into Thursday night's jittery
beginning against Nigeria, Mia Hamm had been knocked down at least
three times. When a Nigerian player tried to help her up, Hamm
turned her back, clearly furious with the hard tackling. Soccer's
greatest female player was about to begin a little hammering of her
own.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, Hamm played a free kick hard and low to the
right foot of a charging Michelle Akers for a game-tying goal.
Seconds after that, she blasted a shot into the upper right corner
of the net. Before the half was over, Hamm had played another
perfect free kick for a goal by Kristine Lilly. What had been a
dangerous beginning quickly became a 7-1 rout for the United States
before 65,080 fans at Soldier Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans tied a Women's World Cup record with six goals in
the first half, collecting their second victory of the first round
and all but guaranteeing advancement to the quarterfinals on July
1. Akers finished with two goals (one of which was being reviewed),
and so did Tiffeny Milbrett. Hamm had a goal and two assists as
Nigeria's early assertiveness was sabotaged by a disorganized and
indifferent defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had counted on the belief that Nigeria would send
so many players forward, relying on speed and athleticism, that its
defense would lose its shape, and perhaps, its will. That is
exactly what happened as the first half unfurled. It was sometimes
difficult to tell whether this was Soldier Field or Coors Field,
the way the score kept rolling up. Some cattle drives don't require
as much open space as the Nigerian defense left for the relentless
American attack.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a few minutes, a match that had opened in
Nigeria's favor turned completely against the Super Falcons. But it
was the Americans who appeared fidgety and confused in the first
few minutes, and it took Nigeria all of 62 seconds to score.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Foudy tried to clear a pass from the penalty area, but
headed the ball dangerously toward the middle instead. (Marvelous)
Mercy Akide pounced on the loose ball for Nigeria and played it to
Mkiru Okosieme, whose sliding punch put the Super Falcons ahead by
1-0 on the stunned Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, Brandi Chastain and Carla Overbeck collided in
front of the American goal. As goalkeeper Briana Scurry strayed
from her line, a retreating Chastain had to stick out her leg near
the left post to deflect a threatening shot.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the American defense settled down. Kate Sobrero, who
sprained an ankle on Wednesday and was an uncertain starter
Thursday night, had recovered enough to make a beautiful
backpedaling maneuver, changing directions several times, to
smother a Nigerian foray. After missing four scoring chances, the
Americans finally connected in the 19th minute as Hamm, soccer's
career-leading scorer in international matches, channeled her anger
into points.
</P>
<P>
   Akers charged to her left across the goal mouth, took a perfect
corner kick from Hamm and appeared to flick the ball back to her
right, tying the game at 1-1. Officials later said that they would
review the goal, leaving open the possibility that the ball had
actually scored inadvertently off the foot of Nigeria's 16-year-old
defender, Ifeanyichukwu Chiejene.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum switched quickly and inexorably into the Americans'
favor. Hamm took a through pass from Lilly and blasted the ball
past the flat-footed Nigerian goalie, Anne Chiejine. Milbrett then
slammed a shot off Chiejine's right hand into the net. Nigeria was
so deficient in the rudiments of defense that it stood around
without marking the Americans on set pieces. In the 32d minute,
Hamm lasered another free kick to Lilly, who headed the ball for a
4-1 American lead.
</P>
<P>
   Foudy redeemed herself with a cross from the right flank that
Akers headed in for a 5-1 lead. In the 42d minute, Chastain headed
a pass to Cindy Parlow, who also punched the ball with her head and
punched out the lights for Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The six American goals in the first half tied a record that
Sweden set in an 8-0 victory over Japan in the 1991 Women's World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Sobrero and Akers, who suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome,
were substituted for in the second half, and, as the game
degenerated into cheap fouls, Hamm soon followed after being kicked
in the stomach. By then, she had delivered many more blows than she
had received.

PEARSON WILL SELL ITS STAKES IN 3 HOUSES OF LAZARD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The British media company Pearson PLC said Thursday that it was
selling its holdings in three Lazard investment houses in a deal
that analysts said would enable both Pearson and Lazard to become
more competitive by focusing more closely on their primary
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson has agreed to sell to the French investment group Gaz et
Eaux SA its 50 percent stake in Lazard Brothers &AMP; Co. in London, a
7.6 percent interest in Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. in New York and an 8
percent share of Lazard Freres &AMP; Compagnie in Paris. Gaz et Eaux,
which has close ties to Lazard, said it would pay $649 million for
the three related firms. Pearson intends to use the proceeds of the
sale to repay debt.
</P>
<P>
   The company _ which owns The Financial Times newspaper, 60
percent of The Economist, the Penguin book-publishing company and
television programming like ``Baywatch'' _ has been seeking to shed
assets that are not directly related to its core publishing and
media businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``From their perspective, this means they will become a pure
media group,'' said Jonathan Helliwell, an analyst with Goldman,
Sachs. ``Historically, when they are in a lot of different areas,
their overall valuation has suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will help Lazard, an investment banking partnership,
reach its goal of unifying its European and American operations.
Though profitable, the closely held firm has struggled to keep up
with other global powerhouses in the lucrative business of advising
top executives on financial and merger strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Lazard is now trying to create a more cohesive corporate
structure to compete with the fluid global networks of rivals like
the Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Earlier
this month, Lazard announced that it would integrate its London,
Paris and New York operations and reshuffle its executive ranks in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The deal requires the approval of Pearson's shareholders, as
well as the approval of the directors of the three Lazard houses.
It is also contingent upon the completion of Lazard's planned
integration of the divisions into a single global partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lazard just wants to tidy everything up and make sure they
have total control of the combined company so they can then decide
how they want to go into the 21st century,'' said Tom Burnett,
director of Merger Insight, an institutional-research firm in New
York. ``Right now, their ownership is fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Michel David-Weill, chairman of Lazard Freres &AMP; Co.,
characterized the Pearson deal only in terms of the publisher's
desire to tidy up its own house. Despite Lazard's 80-year
association with Pearson, he said, ``We fully understand their
desire to refocus their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pearson has been looking for the right opportunity to
shed its peripheral role in investment banking since 1997, when
Marjorie M. Scardino, its American chief executive, stepped in with
a mandate to refocus the conglomerate's far-flung businesses into a
sharper media operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``By consolidating, she is really telling Wall Street and her
stockholders that they are making a major commitment to the media
and entertainment world, both in North America and elsewhere,''
said Albert Greco, an associate professor of business at Fordham
University, who studies media management.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scardino said that the sale of Pearson's Lazard holdings
``allows us to invest all our resources in the businesses we manage
and that are forming the future of Pearson.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bruno Roger, chairman of Gaz et Eaux, said, ``We are very
pleased at the prospect of becoming a significant partner in the
Lazard Group.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Pearson announced that it would strengthen its
alliance with Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications company.
The companies already have a joint interest in Recoletos, a Spanish
media business. With the new arrangement, in which Telefonica will
acquire 5 percent of Pearson, the companies will jointly develop
Internet and multi-media services in Spanish- and
Portuguese-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Villalonga, chairman of Telefonica, said that the deal
would link Pearson with a partner with the ability to ``use our
infrastructure to extend the range of media services we provide in
Spanish and Latin American markets we know well.''

OFFICER CONVICTED IN TORTURE OF LOUIMA SEEKS NEW TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to win a new trial for Charles Schwarz, one
of the police officers convicted in the Abner Louima case, defense
lawyers asserted Thursday that prosecutors failed to turn over
evidence the defense said showed that Schwarz had played no role in
the torture.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz was convicted earlier this month of violating Louima's
civil rights following testimony that he was the officer who had
restrained Louima in the bathroom of a Brooklyn precinct house as
another officer, Justin Volpe, had thrust a broomstick into
Louima's rectum.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, however, has said through his attorney that another
officer, not Schwarz, was present during the attack _ a claim that
two jurors now say would have caused them to acquit Schwarz had
they known about it during deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Schwarz's lawyer, Stephen Worth, submitted sworn
statements from the two jurors _ who identified themselves only as
No. 2 and No. 6 _ as part of a request to Judge Eugene Nickerson of
U.S. District Court in Brooklyn to grant a new trial. In their
statements, first reported Thursday by The Daily News, the jurors
said Volpe's new claims about the assault ``would have created a
reasonable doubt'' about the guilt of Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   According to Worth, prosecutors learned during the trial that
Volpe was prepared to take the witness stand and clear Schwarz.
``The fact that Volpe was prepared to waive his Fifth Amendment
right and exonerate Schwarz was unknown to the defense and was not
disclosed by the prosecution,'' Worth said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors declined to comment Thursday, but in a letter to
Worth they denied any impropriety and they suggested that Worth,
despite his claims of having been in the dark, had been well
informed of Volpe's offer.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, dated June 17, Alan Vinegrad, an assistant U.S.
attorney, acknowledged that Marvyn Kornberg, Volpe's lawyer, had
``informed the government that, if called as a witness, his client,
Justin Volpe, would testify in substance that an individual other
than Charles Schwarz was the `other officer' who was present in the
bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinegrad said Kornberg shared this information on May 20, five
days before Volpe dropped his claims of innocence and made a
dramatic courtroom confession that he had tortured Louima after
arresting him in August 1997. Vinegrad disputed Worth's contention
that court rules obligated prosecutors to share their new knowledge
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Vinegrad wrote to Worth, ``this information was
either known by you or could easily have been ascertained by you.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Kornberg said he ``fully informed''
Worth of Volpe's willingness to exonerate Schwarz, and he
criticized Worth for failing to call Volpe as a defense witness.
Worth has said that Volpe would have been worthless as a witness
because jurors would have rejected any version of events offered by
``an admitted sex torturer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that Steve Worth made a colossal blunder,''
Kornberg said, ``in not calling Justin Volpe to the stand to
exculpate his client when he knew at the time what Volpe's
testimony would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth said Kornberg told him during the trial that Volpe's
account of the bathroom assault exonerated Schwarz. But Worth said
he did not trust Kornberg to tell him the truth and that mistrust
played into his decision not to call Volpe as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Had the government told me, `This is what Volpe
intends to say,' that would be one thing. But a fellow defense
counsel representing his own client's interests has no obligation
to tell me the truth.''

EARP, HOLLIDAY CLEARED OF CHARGES IN O.K. GUNFIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For three hours Thursday the jurors listened to dramatic
testimony about an eruption of deadly vio lence, watched men fling
around old nickel-plated pistols, then sat to gether to ponder the
gunfight at the O.K. Corral.
</P>
<P>
   When they were done, about 10 seconds later, the eight-person
panel concluded that this famous tale ended the way the folklore of
the Wild West always told us it did.
</P>
<P>
   The guys we've always been told were good really were.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least, the other guys were worse.
</P>
<P>
   More than a century after the gun smoke disappeared into the af
ternoon sky in Tombstone, a jury vindicated Wyatt Earp and Doc
Holliday.
</P>
<P>
   During a mock trial at the Phoenician Resort, a group of
prominent Arizona attorneys dis sected the 27-second gunbattle and
with it, a story that in many ways defines Arizona and the West.
</P>
<P>
   The story, nine men shooting it out on a mining town back
street, still intrigues people so much that theories about who did
what and why remain topics of hot debate. Earlier this year, a man
paid $220,000 for Holliday's shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's production was part history lesson and part entertain
ment. It used real transcripts from an official inquest after the
shoot ing, for example, and featured a law school dean in a billowy
prairie dress displaying a remarkable ability to cry on cue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's thrilling to bring it to life,'' said Wyatt Earp, the
great grand nephew of his namesake, who portrayed his famous
ancestor in the trial. ``It's another frontier effort, and I hope
folks will have more of a concern of what happened there that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Earp and Holliday were cleared in the 1881 gunbattle,
the trial depicted a fictional civil suit filed by the mother of
Tom McLaury, one of the three men killed in the battle in that
rowdy southern Arizona mining town. The other two men killed were
Billy Clanton and Tom's brother, Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Johns played one of
the plaintiff's attorneys, while Michael Daly Hawkins, a 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals judge, oversaw the case.
</P>
<P>
   Former Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard pasted on a fake mustache to
portray Ike Clanton, a friend of the McLaury brothers who ran away
as the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, part of the State Bar of Arizona's annual convention,
tried to challenge commonly held good-guy, bad-guy myths of the
story, passed down to generations and retold in books and movies.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McLaury's attorneys tried to portray Earp as a man so
politically ambitious that he would kill to become sheriff. They
portrayed Hol liday as a gambler and drunk, saying the two men had
pistol-whipped the McLaury and Clanton brothers before the shooting
and had fired the first shots.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Patricia White, dean of Arizona State
University's College of Law, played the grieving mother of Tom
McLaury.
</P>
<P>
   And she didn't hold back. At times White mocked &UR; the judicial
process, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief and throwing in a
``they murdered him'' at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Boze Bell, local writer, actor and radio-show host, got the
most laughs with his ad-libbed humor, playing the sheriff who was a
friend of the Clantons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to remind me what I said, it's been 118
years,'' he joked, when asked to tell what he first said about the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   While attorneys are often infa mous for delaying trials, this
one unfolded in less than 3{ hours. And when lunch approached and
clos ings weren't in view, the judge called counsel to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume the defense rests,'' the judge said following a brief
confer ence and without hearing from Holliday, one of the
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   In closings, Flagstaff attorney Deborah Fine said Earp and Holli
day didn't act in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizonans won't tolerate the killing of innocent men in our
street,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ed Hendricks, defending Holliday and Earp, told the jury his
clients were deputized and acting as lawmen when they tried to get
McLaury and the Clanton brothers to put away their guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should put yourself back in time to 1881 and walk in their
boots . . . in a town out of control,'' he said. ``They were called
upon to make a split second decision.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury _ not quite of Holliday and Earp's peers as it included
mostly lawyers and the wife of their defense attorney _ issued a
unani mous not-guilty verdict. The delib eration was so quick that
when the judge asked who the foreman was, jury members looked at
each other until one man shot up, naming himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that day, if guns start flying, that's what any law officer
would do,'' juror Liz Sexson said. ``So, we cleared them.''
</P>
<P>
   Earp, in his string tie and black Western suit with velvet
collar, smiled as the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never crossed my mind it would go any other way,'' he said.
``I think it helped clarify the reality of the time, which was
chaotic.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience, about 450 attor neys and a few history lovers,
also voted with electronic keypads; 66 percent favored Wyatt and
Holliday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some who came to see the show Thursday wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hushion, an Old West his tory buff who says he is the
world's leading expert on the O.K. Corral, drove from Santa
Barbara, Calif., for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was entertaining,'' said Hu shion, a lawyer who said he
spent more than 1,000 hours examing forensic evidence from the
gunbat tle. ``But I'd like to see a full-blown trial, done without
the fiction. Because for 120 years, no one can agree on what
happened.'' &QL;

NEW YORK _ The Larry O'Brien Trophy will be nearby, shined, ready.
Champagne will be on ice. Plastic sheeting will be in place to
protect the contents in the visitors' locker room.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the San Antonio Spurs insist their success has been built on
their humble concentration and an appreciation of a day's work for
its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we have to do,'' Spurs forward Tim Duncan said.
``We know we're not going to come in and be too happy about
anything or be too secure about anything. We want to get this done.
We don't want to give them any life. We're really focused on what
we have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he said, noticing a garish cap in a crowd of hundreds
of reporters, ``that's a horrible hat.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for focus. A reporter's cap would seem easier to ignore
than the championship trophy the Spurs will try to secure in Game 5
of the NBA Finals tonight at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs will try to forget what they believe awaits them
should they beat the New York Knicks tonight. This is not yet the
time, they have told themselves, to indulge in thoughts of the
trials that had brought them here, the criticisms along the way or
the celebration that could be just ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   And they will fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm what-iffing,'' Spurs forward Malik Rose said. ``I
know I'll be ready for Game 5. But you can't help but to think
about it. You're going to get a ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who have been there said the Spurs cannot think about
rewards they cannot get out of their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ignore it,'' said Spurs guard Steve Kerr, a winner
of three championships with the Bulls. ``As soon as you think about
celebrating and what happens if you win, then you take your mind
off the task at hand. It's going to be important to not think about
champagne and cigars.''
</P>
<P>
   But with that, Kerr could not keep up the front. Ignoring the
chance to finally break through and win a title is not realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally unrealistic,'' he said. ``But you have to know
that going in and settle into the game. A lot of times, you fall
behind quickly and that jolts you back into reality and you start
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs might be far from the Alamodome, but they remain in
familiar territory. They clinched each of their previous three
series on the road. With the Knicks needing to win three
consecutive games, the Spurs have not lost even two straight since
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're road warriors,'' guard Mario Elie said. ``Our focus is
real high. I don't remember the last time we lost two games in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have somebody down, we have to finish them off. Our
guys are focused. We're feeling good about ourselves. When they
bring that trophy in, guys will look at it and want to hold it.
We'll have one more 48-minute game to get it done. But this is the
most difficult game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have reacted to their 3-1 deficit by leaning on all
the doubts that have faced them before. The Knicks said their
troubles even reaching the playoffs, their rise from an eighth seed
and ability to overcome the loss of center and captain Patrick
Ewing prove that even their current situation is not too great to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks pledged that they would not go down easily. More than
that, they were offended at the implication that there are more
preferable ways to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean, `make it tough on them'?'' Knicks guard
Chris Childs said. ``We're going to win tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But Childs offered few reasons to expect such a thing, other
than pointing out what the Knicks have been unable to do, as if
relying on probability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to come out and play our best ballgame,'' said Childs,
who will have trouble playing at all because of a sprained right
knee. ``We haven't played a great ballgame yet. We haven't played a
complete game. Sometimes we defend. Sometimes we score.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Spurs try to fight thoughts of postgame cigars and
champagne, the Knicks have welcomed the vision, hoping to use it to
drive them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want those guys celebrating on our floor,'' Knicks
guard Latrell Sprewell said. ``You just can't have that. We have
too much pride for that as a team. We want to take this thing back
to San Antonio. If we can start with that, then we can worry about
Game 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Knicks almost seemed to be trying to talk themselves
into logic to restore their faith.
</P>
<P>
   They did not offer solutions to the problem of the dominance
inside by Duncan and David Robinson. They could not come up with
ways to be more efficient offensively. They instead pointed out
what they have not done well enough, seeming to want as much burden
as possible to create the sort of against-all-odds success that has
marked their season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the character of this team, which is strong,'' Knicks
forward Larry Johnson said. ``Jeff (Van Gundy, the Knicks' coach)
made an excellent point to the team. Never in the Finals has a team
down 3-1 come back (to win the championship). Never (before New
York) has an eighth seed been to a Finals. Let's throw all that
history junk out. All we need to do is win tomorrow night and go
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has stressed that his team think only of tonight's
game to keep from being overwhelmed by the 3-1 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them they're only bound by what they believe can still
be accomplished,'' Van Gundy said. ``If they believe that since no
one else has ever done this that it can't be done, then that will
be reflected in our play (tonight). History doesn't have to hamper
us. All we have to do is win one home game. That's the question:
Can we win one home game? Then can we go down there and get one
road game? And then you're playing the ultimate game. I just made
that sound a heck of a lot easier than it is, obviously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you win one home game? And the bigger question is, Do we
really in our heart of hearts want to go back to San Antonio?''
</P>

LOUIS DIAMOND, A PEDIATRICS LEGEND, DIES AT 97  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif., Pa., The Ukraine)   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Louis K. Diamond, who developed a revolutionary transfusion
method to save newborn babies with Rh disease, died on June 14 at
his home in Los Angeles. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond was a longtime professor at Harvard Medical School and
associate chief of staff at Children's Hospital Medical Center in
Boston. In the late 1940s, he also directed the American Red Cross
National Blood Program and established the Blood Grouping
Laboratory in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   His pioneering work in the field has led his colleagues and many
students to call him the father of pediatric hematology, the branch
dealing with blood and blood diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond is known worldwide for his work in the 1930s and 1940s
with Rh disease and the treatment called exchange transfusion. In
1932, he and Dr. Kenneth Blackfan discovered that four diseases of
infants were manifestations of a sole syndrome, erythroblastosis
fetalis, also called Rh disease, a condition that at that time
affected about 1 in 200 babies, killing or irreversibly harming
half of them.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the early 1940s, other researchers discovered that Rh
disease occurred when a pregnant mother with Rh-negative blood
carried an Rh-positive fetus, the result of having an Rh-positive
father. The mother, exposed to the Rh-positive blood during
delivery or during pregnancy, produces antibodies against her
infant's blood. Then, in later pregnancies, the mother's
antibodies, traveling through the placenta, damage the red blood
cells of Rh-positive fetuses, causing severe anemia, heart failure
and brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Saving these newborns almost always required replacing virtually
their entire blood supply, usually shortly after birth, to get rid
of the mother's antibodies and the damaged red blood cells. The
exchange had to be done in small amounts at a time, over many days,
because a newborn's blood vessels are tiny, making transfusion
difficult, and likely to produce clots with the steel needles and
rubber catheters available at the time.
</P>
<P>
   So, in 1946, Diamond and Dr. Fred Allen started doing the
transfusions through the newborn's large umbilical vein, which
remains open for days after birth, using an experimental piece of
newly developed plastic tubing.
</P>
<P>
   Mortality from Rh disease then dropped to a tenth of what it had
been. With later improvements and a vaccine, the death rate is now
negligible. The exchange transfusion procedure was also later
applied to newborns with other blood diseases and is credited with
saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of babies.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond was born in the Ukraine on May 11, 1902. Brought to the
United States by his parents at the age of 2, he grew up in
Manhattan before moving to Boston to attend Harvard College, from
which he graduated in 1923, and Harvard Medical School, where he
received his medical degree in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   He remained at Harvard for most of the next 41 years as a
professor of pediatrics and associate chief of staff at Children's
Hospital Medical Center. He took a leave from 1948 to 1950 to serve
as medical director of the American Red Cross' new National Blood
Program.
</P>
<P>
   Upon retiring from Harvard in 1968, Diamond moved to the
University of California at San Francisco as adjunct professor of
pediatrics. The Louis J. Diamond chair of hematology there is named
in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   He retired again in 1987 but moved to the University of
California at Los Angeles, where he remained professionally active
into his 90s.
</P>
<P>
   He served as president of the American Pediatric Society.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Flora, died last year. He is survived by a son, Dr.
Jared Diamond of Los Angeles, a daughter, Susan Diamond of Los
Angeles, a sister, Sally Taft of Hershey, Pa., and four
grandchildren.

YANKEES SWEEP PAST TAMPA BAY AND ON TO BALTIMORE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The Arizona Diamondbacks had the great
fortune of being placed in the same division as the dysfunctional
Los Angeles Dodgers. But the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, the other
expansion team of 1998, were trapped into sharing the American
League East with the Yankees. There is no escape, for now.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees continued their stranglehold of the Devil Rays
Thursday night, winning by 7-3. At game's end, most seats in
Tropicana Field had been captured by Yankees' fans chanting,
``Sweep!''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who have improved their record to 42-28, move on to
a three-game weekend series in Baltimore, where the Orioles have
been mounting a charge.
</P>
<P>
   The victory Thursday night was well-timed, with the principal
owner, George Steinbrenner, watching from a private box above the
third base line. Some members of the organization maintain that
Steinbrenner, who resides in this area, is more adamant about the
Yankees' beating the Devil Rays than any other team. The Yankees
have dominated the rivalry, winning 14 of their 15 meetings,
outscoring Tampa Bay in those games, 85-29.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer, who blasted a home run Tuesday and hit the ball
hard in all five at-bats Wednesday, ripped a double and single
Thursday night, and for a few moments, anyway, there is a sense of
order in left field for the Yankees. Probably not for long,
however, since Ricky Ledee was recalled from Class AAA Columbus
Thursday for what might be the determining test of his future with
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, nine years removed from the day he was drafted by the
Yankees, has a month to show he can produce in left field, and if
neither he nor Spencer establishes a lock on the position, the
Yankees will pursue another established outfielder. Thus far, the
Yankees' left fielders have generated the worst numbers of any
position for any team in the major leagues _ worse even than some
National League pitching staffs. As play began Thursday night,
their left fielders were batting .184, with 6 home runs and 19 runs
batted in.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have asked Kansas City about Johnny Damon, and they
could pursue Detroit's Bobby Higginson. But they will try Spencer
and Ledee for a final monthlong audition before reconsidering their
options.
</P>
<P>
   When Spencer led off the seventh inning with the Yankees down,
3-2, his teammates were engaged in full battle with Joe Brinkman,
the home-plate umpire. Andy Pettitte had thrown first-pitch strikes
to 21 of the first 24 batters he faced, through five innings, but
in the sixth, he couldn't throw strikes _ or rather, in the
Yankees' view, Brinkman wasn't calling any strikes. Twenty of the
28 pitches Pettitte threw were called balls, but at least some of
them appeared to be strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi, the Yankees' normally mild-mannered catcher, began
jawing with Brinkman; Pettitte glared in. At one point, Girardi
went so far as to look at the Yankees' bench and motion with a hand
at Brinkman: What's up with this guy?
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Manager Joe Torre had moved forward from the dugout to
yell at the umpire, his cap tipped back and his face dark and
serious, with bench coach Don Zimmer chiming in. The nastiness
continued between innings, with Torre yelling at Brinkman, and
after Spencer took a strike to start the seventh, he and Brinkman
exchanged words.
</P>
<P>
   But Spencer settled in and laced a single to center. Tampa Bay
anticipated a bunt from Scott Brosius, but Brosius slammed a line
drive over shortstop, the ball skipping and rolling on the
artificial surface, all the way to the wall in left-center field.
Spencer scored, Brosius had a double, and after Brosius advanced to
third on a bunt, he scored on Chuck Knoblauch's sacrifice fly. The
Yankees led, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, 15-for-26 since moving from cleanup to the No.
2 spot in the batting order, had the first of his two singles in
the first inning, and he scored on a two-out single from Paul
O'Neill. Chili Davis accounted for the Yankees' second run,
pounding his 11th home run in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees gave away two of the three runs Pettitte allowed in
his six and two-thirds innings. Derek Jeter made an error at
shortstop to set up one run, which Pettitte sent home with a balk,
and the second scored after Brosius threw a ball away and Jeter
flubbed a relay homeward. &QL;

DEAD OR ALIVE, RATTLERS CAN STRIKE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if bites from live snakes weren't bad enough, sink your teeth
into this:
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's proof dead snakes bite, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bites from dead snakes are more common than you might think,
said Dr. Jeffrey R. Suchard, a medical toxicolo gist at Good
Samaritan Regional Medi cal Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 15 percent, five of 34 snake bite victims admitted to
Good Samaritan from June 1997 to April 1998, were bitten by dead
snakes, Suchard and his colleague, Dr. Frank LoVecchio, also a
toxicologist at Good Samaritan, wrote in a letter published
recently in the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study turned up several sur prises,'' Suchard said. ``We
were sur prised the percentage was that high. We were also
surprised most people didn't know dead snakes still bite.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Cluff isn't surprised. The 21-year-old Queen Creek man
could have died after picking up the decapi tated head of a Mojave
rattler a friend had shot with a .22-caliber rifle.
</P>
<P>
   The snake head rallied and sank a fang into Cluff's knuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been around snakes so much I felt comfortable with
them,'' Cluff said. ``I guess I loosened up on my grip. That's when
it bit me. The pain was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Cluff ended up losing part of his right index finger.
</P>
<P>
   Suchard said he and LoVec chio began to take a closer look at
the dead snakebite phe nomenon after admitting a pa tient a couple
years ago who had been bitten while gardening.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man used a shovel to cut off the head of the rattle
snake,'' Suchard said. ``When he bent down to pick up the snake's
head, it bit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Suchard said documented cases of dead snakes delivering fatal
bites can be traced back several hundred years to Spanish
explorers. In 1972, rattlesnake researcher L.M. Klauber published a
study showing that rattlesnake heads are dangerous for 20 minutes
to an hour after decapi tation.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sloan of the Arizona Herpe tological Association said that
al though he doesn't know anyone who has ever been bitten by a dead
rattlesnake, he understands how it might happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you go down the evolution ary scale, the functions of the
brain and functions of the body become a little more separated,''
Sloan said. ``There's a reflex action involved when you touch a
snake's mouth. The fang is like a hypodermic needle. It's going to
continue to work if you put your hand near it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Taylor said he knows of people who have even been pricked
and poisoned by discarded fangs. Taylor, like Sloan, is a member of
the Arizona Herpetological Associ ation, which is dedicated to the
conservation, study and understand ing of reptiles and amphibians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snakes shed fangs as well as their skins,'' Taylor said. ``The
dried venom on the fangs can also cause a bad reaction if you prick
yourself with an old fang.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said this happened to him while cleaning out an aquarium
where he kept blacktail rattlesnakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shedded fangs are little and transparent,'' Taylor said.
``Five minutes after pricking myself with one, my finger began
throbbing and I had to sit down for an hour or two before the pain
dissipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's two poison control cen ters _ Samaritan Poison Center
and the Arizona Poison and Drug Infor mation Center in Tucson _
receive 200 to 300 snakebite calls a year. It's not known how many
of those calls involve bites delivered by dead snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Suchard said Good Samaritan's toxicology referral center
averages 35 to 60 snakebite admissions a year.
</P>
<P>
   An average 10 to 12 people die of snakebites in the United
States each year. Arizona recorded its last snakebite fatality
earlier this year when a Phoenix rattlesnake hobbiest was bitten by
his own snake. It was the first state snakebite fatality since
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Stocker, spokesman for Ru ral/Metro Fire Department, said
snakes are most active during the hottest months. He said
Rural/Metro currently receives 10 to 30 calls a day from people who
ask the company to remove snakes, usually from their properties. He
said in the eight years he's been with Ru ral/Metro, he is not
aware of anyone being bitten by a dead snake.
</P>
<P>
   Stocker recommends calling for a free retrieval service rather
than handling snake situations by your self. The Arizona
Herpetological Association and Rural/Metro Fire Department perform
this service. He said he'd also like the public, especially
newcomers to the state, to be more sensitive to the intricate
interactions of a desert ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've moved into the snake's habitat; they're not moving into
ours,'' Stocker said. ``We get calls from people with cell phones
who are horseback riding or on a hiking trail. They come across
snakes and want us to come out and remove them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, Stocker said, is people think all large snakes
are dangerous, so they're often killed indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some snakes, like king snakes, are natural enemies of
rattlesnakes and not dangerous to humans,'' Stocker said. ``People
should also understand that snakes do a lot of good. If we didn't
have them, we'd be overrun by rodents.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan agrees and recommends just leaving wildlife alone whether
it's alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically,'' Sloan said, ``we've found that the average
snakebite victim is a White male between 15 and 35 with lots of
alcohol in him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Good Samaritan's study, all patients were 20 to 48 years old.
Only one, however, was intoxicated when bitten. &QL;
