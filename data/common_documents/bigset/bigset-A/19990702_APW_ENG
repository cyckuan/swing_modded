<HEADLINE> 2 Girls Charged In Road Rage Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALE CITY, Va. (AP) -- A 25-year-old woman who authorities say  
had her head smashed repeatedly into the street during a traffic 
argument with two teen-age girls has died from her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Natalie Davis died Thursday, two days after police say she was  
attacked while driving to a church service with her children, ages 
2 and 4, and four other relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Paul Ebert said Teresa Dixon, 18, and a 16-year-old  
girl will now face murder charges. Both suspects were held without 
bond and a preliminary hearing was set for Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dixon had been charged with aggravated malicious wounding.  
Information about the 16-year-old was withheld due to her age, but 
Ebert said he will seek to try her as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Ms. Davis and her family encountered a car blocking  
the entrance to the cul-de-sac where they lived Tuesday night. 
Several girls had gathered around the car to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Davis asked the teens to move the car, but the driver of her  
car managed to maneuver around it. Two teens followed the family in 
another car, police Sgt. Kim Chinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Words were exchanged, and after a short distance, Ms. Davis and  
the 16-year-old girl left their cars to argue, Ms. Chinn said. The 
teen eventually grabbed Ms. Davis by her hair and pounded her head 
into the pavement, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon allegedly joined in, stomping on Ms. Davis' head, police  
said. One of Ms. Davis' relatives flagged down a police officer.

<HEADLINE> Apple Sues Rival Over iMac Design </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. accused a  
competitor Thursday of stealing the design of its iMac personal 
computers to make low-cost PCs unveiled at a computer show last 
week, complete with a curvy translucent look and five gemstone 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's complaint, filed in San Jose District Court, alleges  
Future Power Technologies, an 8-month-old Silicon Valley company, 
and Korea's Daewoo Telecom illegally copied iMac's unique features 
to make their E-Power PC. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a universe of original designs that Future Power and  
Daewoo could have created for their computers, but instead they 
chose to copy Apple's designs,'' said Steve Jobs, Apple's interim 
CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've invested a lot of money and effort to create and market  
our award-winning designs, and we intend to vigorously protect them 
under the law,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo denies that it copied the iMac design. ``Our product is  
based on a totally different concept from that of iMac,'' the 
company said in a statement, noting that, unlike iMac, Daewoo's 
E-Power runs on Intel chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo acknowledged that its E-Power PC has a shape resembling  
iMac, but said Apple cannot sue just because of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot understand the lawsuit,'' the statement said.  
</P>
<P>
	Apple, which declined to comment beyond the wording of its  
complaint, wants an injunction preventing the companies from 
distributing the E-Power computers. It's also seeking actual and 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Future Power created a sensation at the PC Expo in New York City  
last week with the E-power, which has a shape resembling the iMac, 
and comes in five translucent colors: amethyst, ruby, topaz, 
emerald and sapphire. 
</P>
<P>
	Also like iMac, which Apple sells in strawberry, blueberry,  
grape, tangerine and lime -- the E-power has an all-in-one design 
and a single power cord. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the iMac, the E-power runs on Microsoft's Windows  
operating system and has a floppy disk drive. Also, it is priced to 
sell at two-thirds the cost of Apple's model. 
</P>
<P>
	Wired magazine reported from the PC Expo that Future Power  
didn't deny that iMac was its source of inspiration for E-Power -- 
the startup even held talks with Apple's lawyers before launching 
the new product, presumably in hopes of heading off a legal 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Future Power said the company would not  
comment until it received a copy of the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Scattered Body Parts Found in Mich. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCIO TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Body parts were discovered several  
miles apart off Interstate 94 and are believed to belong to the 
same woman, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first discovery -- a pair of severed human feet -- was made by  
a McDonald's employee Thursday morning inside a restaurant garbage 
bin in this town about 30 miles west of Detroit, said Washtenaw 
County Sheriff's Lt. Brenda Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
	More body parts were found four hours later at a rest stop a  
mile east of the restaurant, authorities said. Then, Thursday 
evening, the head of a woman was found at a landfill in Northfield 
Township, about eight miles northeast of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sutton said the body parts appear to be from a white woman,  
but she declined to specify details, including the possible age of 
the victim. She said investigators know of no missing person who 
matches the description of the victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives say they believe the remains are those of someone  
killed not more than two days earlier, and say the parts are of the 
same body. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a jigsaw puzzle right now, and we're looking for the  
rest of the pieces,'' Ms. Sutton said. ``Clearly, the intent was 
for us not to find the body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities planned to check other landfills today, Ms. Sutton  
said.

<HEADLINE> Lift of Bathhouse Ban Sought in SF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Before AIDS ravaged America's gay capital,  
John Maybauer used to cruise the bathhouses, where men wearing 
nothing but towels made friends and paired off behind locked doors 
for sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to go all the time,'' said Maybauer, who wants the  
bathhouses back. ``It was very much like a salon. It's a very 
civilized experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the bathhouses were banned by the city's health officials 15  
years ago during the AIDS epidemic, and a recent petition drive to 
bring them back failed to get enough signatures to qualify for the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Even talking about reopening the bathhouses has prompted strong  
editorials condemning the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who wants to take a chance on reenergizing the AIDS  
epidemic?'' read a San Francisco Examiner editorial last month. The 
San Francisco Chronicle called the movement ``an absurd proposal 
that defies reason in a city that has witnessed the city's gay 
community decimated by AIDS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movement is being led by Michael Petrelis, who says the ban  
stemmed from public health concerns that don't exist any more. He 
says that with AIDS deaths declining and people becoming more 
educated about safe sex, there's no good reason for the bathhouse 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a gay man with AIDS who has buried many friends and I  
don't want a return to unsafe sex,'' Petrelis said. ``I want that 
kind of bathhouse facility with condoms, safe sex information, 
showers and locked cubicles -- and safe sex in that cubicle too, 
don't get me wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bathhouses are still open in New York City, Los Angeles and  
elsewhere. Near San Francisco, there are bathhouses in San Jose and 
Berkeley, and San Franciscans make up about half of the clientele 
at Berkeley's Steamworks. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition drive exasperated some AIDS experts. They say it  
could reduce support for AIDS prevention and encourage gays, 
especially younger ones, to become complacent about the deadly 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young gay men are not that different from young straight men  
in believing they're invincible. They don't have that horrible 
history in their memories,'' said Mervyn Silverman, the public 
health director who ordered the bathhouses closed in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Although new drugs are keeping people with AIDS alive longer,  
about 500 San Franciscans test HIV-positive every year, two-thirds 
of them gay and bisexual men. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that people need to talk to persons with HIV who are  
often taking 60 pills a day and ask them if they think having HIV 
is becoming a minor issue in their lives,'' said Dr. Mitch Katz, 
the director of the city Department of Public Health who has been 
accused of trampling on the rights of gay men. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite only gathering 4,000 of the 10,500 signatures needed by  
Monday to put a measure on the November ballot, supporters say they 
will continue the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I disappointed? Yeah, but like I said, 15 years of  
prohibition is what I'm trying to overcome,'' said Petrelis, who is 
planning to gather signatures to put the measure on the March 2000 
ballot. ``I'm in this for the long haul.''

<HEADLINE> Rudd's Ride Back in Sync </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Critics say the business side of  
stock car racing is sapping all the fun out of the sport. Anyone 
who agrees probably can't help but pull for Ricky Rudd in the Pepsi 
400 on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered a dinosaur in NASCAR circles because he owns a  
one-car team in an era of multicar conglomerates, Rudd suffered a 
difficult blow to his business this week. His sponsor for most of 
the decade, Procter &AMP; Gamble, decided to pull its Tide label off 
the 24-year Winston Cup veteran's car at year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	He responded with one of his best qualifying laps of the year,  
making the front row outside of Joe Nemechek. And for that effort, 
every racing fan who has ever started his own company -- or simply 
bought a box of Tide, for that matter -- has a reason to cheer for 
Rudd this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really the first time I've ever experienced anything  
like this,'' Rudd said. ``I guess racing is growing and it's 
changing and, hopefully, it's all for the better. But I think, 
unfortunately, a lot of the guys who paid their dues and helped 
create the sport are tending to get run over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd's detractors will be quick to point out that he has created  
many of his own problems. When he split with Rick Hendrick and 
created his own team in 1994, Rudd kept the sponsorship deal with 
Tide going. And even five years ago, he must have been able to see 
that one-car owners were quickly becoming outnumbered in the 
garage, on the test track and, most importantly, on the earnings 
ledger. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there's no denying Rudd has reason for hard feelings.  
</P>
<P>
	Proctor &AMP; Gamble is likely to move its sponsorship to Precision  
Preparation Inc., a company best known for its CART team, one that 
won't put a car on a NASCAR track until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever drives that car will take the logo that belonged to  
Rudd, who has one of the most impressive records in the sport. He 
has won at least one race for 16 seasons straight, from 1983-98. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Rudd is mired in 38th place in the points standings  
without a top-10 finish. He says sales and promotion had been the 
last thing on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably guilty of working way too many hours and worrying  
way too much about this race team, instead of going up with a fancy 
briefcase and a nice powerpoint presentation,'' Rudd said. 
</P>
<P>
	PPI owner Cal Wells said he didn't mean to stir up bad feelings  
with Rudd, who has been very critical of Wells, or with other 
NASCAR drivers who might feel like he is barging in on their turf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry Ricky feels the way he does,'' Wells said. ``We're  
not here to kick him or anyone else off. We're here to build a 
strong foundation in this sport and in this industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside Rudd in Saturday's race will be Nemechek, another underdog  
who nonetheless has the manpower of Felix Sabates' Sabco racing 
team at his disposal. 
</P>
<P>
	A few rows back are Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon and Dale  
Jarrett, who, in different ways, symbolize where the sport has gone 
over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to do a lot outside of what you do on the racetrack  
to keep everyone happy and sometimes even that isn't enough,'' 
Jarrett said. ``Everybody wants to be on the side of a winning car 
and as we know, that's not really possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Rudd is clearly out of the Winston Cup points chase,  
Jarrett, Gordon and Earnhardt are in the thick of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who will start 12th, holds the lead by 157 points over  
Bobby Labonte heading into the second half of the season. Gordon 
has four victories, more than anyone in the field, but stands 314 
points behind Jarrett in the quest for a third straight title. 
Gordon will start 11th. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt is in seventh place. He ran second at Daytona in  
February and earned his lone victory this year at Talladega, 
proving his restrictor-plate program has as much potential as 
anybody's. 
</P>
<P>
	But a disappointing qualifying effort stuck him at 10th on the  
starting grid, and left his car in need of work before the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little rougher ride, a little tougher to drive it than  
it was here in February,'' Earnhardt said. ``We should have tuned 
on the bumpers or the rubbers or the springs or something a little 
more. It sure wasn't a good ride.''

<HEADLINE> Execs Guilty of Insurance Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Two executives with Columbia/HCA Healthcare  
Corp., the nation's largest health care chain, were found guilty 
Friday of defrauding Medicare and other government insurance 
programs of nearly $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury acquitted another executive and could not reach a  
verdict on a fourth defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resulted from a six-state investigation of  
Nashville-based Columbia/HCA facilities over their billing 
practices for Medicare, Medicaid and CHAMPUS, tax-supported health 
programs for the disabled, elderly, poor and military. 
</P>
<P>
	After the investigation began in 1997, Columbia/HCA ousted its  
top executives, stopped an aggressive hospital acquisition program 
and began a major downsizing, trimming from a high of 345 to its 
current level of 236. The company, which has operations in 31 
states, England and Sweden, has been negotiating a settlement with 
federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Jarrell and Robert Whiteside were found guilty of conspiring  
to defraud and defrauding the tax-supported health-insurance 
programs. Michael Neeb was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury could not reach a verdict on Carl Lynn Dick.  
Prosecutors said they would decide next week whether they would 
seek another trial for Dick. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell and Whiteside were found guilty of six of seven counts.  
They were each found not guilty on one count of trying to obstruct 
a Medicare auditor. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men face maximum sentences of 30 years in prison and  
$1.5 million in fines each. They are scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 
15. 
</P>
<P>
	After the verdict, Neeb said he couldn't explain why he was  
acquitted and could not say whether he would remain with 
Columbia/HCA. 
</P>
<P>
	``(I will) spend some time with my family,'' he said. ``I've  
been away from my kids for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors, who listened to seven weeks of testimony,  
deliberated four days. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of eight men and four women, which wasn't sequestered,  
had to decide whether the executives improperly categorized 
interest payments on reimbursement requests for Fawcett Memorial 
Hospital in Port Charlotte, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the requests were not supported by the  
hospital's books and records, and resulted in $2.97 million in 
overpayments. The executives allegedly knew Medicare auditors who 
approved the capital categorization were mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendants found (the mistakes), recognized them and  
exploited them ... to the tune of $3 million belonging to the 
United States of America,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert 
Mosakowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants testified that they believed the payment requests  
were accurate, and their attorneys categorized the dispute as a 
difference in opinion about complicated Medicare regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``These rules are not black and white. That's why this is not a  
criminal case. Reasonable people can disagree,'' said Jarrell's 
attorney, Peter George. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's key witnesses were alleged co-conspirators  
testifying under immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them was John Schilling, a former reimbursements  
supervisor who also stands to gain millions from a whisteblower 
lawsuit against Columbia/HCA. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified Jarrell suggested offering a Medicare auditor a job  
with Columbia/HCA to keep her from discovering the overpayments. 
</P>
<P>
	William Steve Dudley, a former accountant for a company  
eventually acquired by the Nashville, Tenn.-based Columbia/HCA, 
testified Neeb, Jarrell and Whiteside encouraged him to bilk 
Medicare after he told them their actions were illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley acknowledged on the stand that he filed false  
reimbursement requests to the government, forged a document and 
lied before a grand jury. He admitted that he falsely told a grand 
jury Dick had instructed him to forge the form.

<HEADLINE> Erving Says He Fathered Tennis Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Julius Erving said today he is the father of  
tennis phenom Alexandra Stevenson, whose run to the Wimbledon 
semifinals has been shadowed by reports she is the basketball 
great's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I acknowledge a relationship with her mother in 1980,'' Erving  
told The Associated Press. ``My wife, who has known from the 
beginning, and children are aware of this situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``All matters concerning Alexandra since her birth have been  
handled privately through counsel. I am pleased to see Alexandra, 
at 18, doing so well and I applaud her mother's efforts and 
courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erving said he has met Alexandra Stevenson only once and that it  
was ``her call'' about whether they would renew their relationship. 
He said he has been supporting her financially. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't talked to her,'' Erving said. ``I only met her once,  
and she was 3 years old. She was brought to me at a basketball 
clinic at a public school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erving, a vice president of the Orlando Magic, and wife  
Turquoise have been married since 1972 and have four children. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra's mother, Samantha Stevenson, was reached at the  
entrance of the players' lounge at Wimbledon after her daughter's 
semifinal victory today. 
</P>
<P>
	She was asked four times about Erving's statement, and each time  
she replied, ``No comment.'' Her daughter also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of Erving being Stevenson's father became public  
this week when The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel published a copy of 
her birth certificate. The Basketball Hall of Famer initially 
denied being her father. 
</P>
<P>
	Erving said in his statement by telephone from Orlando, Fla., he  
would not make any other remarks about Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, who lives in California, became the first qualifier  
in Wimbledon history to reach the women's semifinals. She beat 
another qualifier, 16-year-old Jelena Dokic, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand they are being besieged because she won her match  
today,'' Erving said. ``Getting this statement out will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson graduated from high school in May and is playing her  
first tournament as a pro. She skipped and hopped to net after 
Dokic hit a forehand long on match point. 
</P>
<P>
	An aspiring stage performer and ballet dancer, Stevenson  
curtsied theatrically to all corners of the Court 1 stadium as her 
mother hugged her coach, Craig Kardon. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother has stirred Wimbledon since the start of the  
tournament, with accusations of racism and lesbianism on the 
women's tour and a dispute over prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just focus on my tennis and let everyone else deal with all  
that,'' the daughter said before Erving made his statement. ``I'm 
quite oblivious to most of it. I haven't been reading any 
newspapers, just playing tennis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson's mother is a free-lance journalist who worked as a  
sports writer in Philadelphia when Erving starred there for the 
76ers. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the mother has refused to discuss the father of her  
6-foot-1 daughter.

<HEADLINE> A's Mathews Goes on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Oakland Athletics placed pitcher T.J.  
Mathews on the 15-day disabled list Friday with right shoulder 
inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	To take Mathews' spot in the roster, the A's recalled outfielder  
Jason McDonald from Vancouver of the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathews is 1-3 with a 6.50 ERA over his last 18 outings. He  
began the season with a 5-0 mark and an ERA of 1.08 in his first 14 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to get him back to throwing the way he was in the  
first few weeks of the season,'' A's manager Art Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald was on the A's opening-day roster, but was optioned to  
Vancouver on May 22 with a .210 batting average. He hit .326 in 32 
games for Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a little thin in the outfield and we haven't had anybody  
pinch running,'' Howe said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Suicide Rate Surges in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Amid a stubborn recession and rising layoffs, more  
Japanese killed themselves in 1998 than in any other year on 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of middle-aged people taking their lives surged, as a  
wave of corporate restructuring forced employees on once secure 
career tracks suddenly out of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of suicides in 1998 hit 32,863, a 34.7 percent  
increase over the previous year and the highest since the 
government started tracking it in 1947, the National Policy Agency 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan also recorded its highest suicide rate: 26.0 suicides per  
100,000 population, just below the country with the world's 
steepest rate -- Finland with 27.0 suicides per 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The spread of suicide comes at a time of growing unease in  
Japanese society in general. Crime, divorce and dissatisfaction 
with public systems such as education are all on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The startling numbers were top news in Japan, despite a deeply  
ingrained tradition that has long regarded suicide as an honorable 
way to atone for failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the announcement Friday, the spread of suicides  
linked to overwork or painful corporate restructuring because of 
the recession had been causing mounting concern. The Health and 
Welfare Ministry made a similar report earlier this year, with 
somewhat smaller numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case last year, three businessmen rented out rooms at the  
same hotel, shared a final drink and hanged themselves. Earlier 
this year, a tire company worker who felt pressured into early 
retirement stabbed himself to death in the company president's 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all suicides in 1998, those committed clearly because of  
economic difficulties accounted for 6,058, an increase of 70.4 
percent. Illness was believed to be the reason for 11,499 suicides, 
up 26.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Men overall were hit especially hard: 23,013 males and 9,850  
females committed suicide in 1998. Suicides were most prevalent 
among by those in their 50s, numbering 7,898 in 1998, up 45.7 
percent from a year earlier, while a total of 5,359 people in their 
40s killed themselves, up 27.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also showed major increases of between 30 percent and  
45 percent in suicides by the unemployed, the self-employed and 
corporate managers. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend has also brought on a spate of lawsuits. In March, a  
Japanese court ruled for the first time that a company employee was 
driven to suicide by overwork and ordered the government to 
compensate his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Middle-aged salarymen just can't cope with the current  
situation,'' Hiroshi Kawahito, a lawyer who works on such cases, 
was quoted as saying by Nihon Keizai newspaper Friday. ``A social 
framework to support them is urgently needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young people were not spared.  
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen elementary school kids killed themselves in 1998, up  
from 12 the previous year, while junior high school student 
suicides increased by 40 to 102. At high schools, 220 students took 
their own lives in 1998, an increase of 51.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's main stock exchange climbed to a 20-month  
high Friday as foreign investors continued to spearhead a two-day 
rally. The dollar edged higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 71.72 points,  
or 0.40 percent, closing the week at 17,932.47 points. It was the 
index's highest closing since Sept. 29, 1997, when it finished at 
17,987.21. On Thursday, the average closed up 331.01 points, or 
1.89 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.08 yen by late afternoon, up 0.32 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
120.78 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurred by continued brisk buying from overseas institutional  
investors, the Nikkei average briefly passed the 18,000 point mark 
for the first time since September 1997, rising as high as 
18,066.28 in the morning before falling back on profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	An overnight rise on the New York Stock Exchange and hope for an  
economic recovery in Japan combined to boost Tokyo share prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confidence in our country's economy is being reflected in  
stocks, and I am happy about it,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu 
Nonaka told a regular news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was fairly heavy, with about 705 million shares changing  
hands on the exchange's first section, up from Thursday's 626 
million. Advancers outnumbered retreaters 665 to 531, with 133 
issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists expect the confidence index for major manufacturers  
in the quarterly ``tankan'' survey by Japan's central bank of 
business sentiment, due out Monday, to show an improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average should test the 18,000 mark again next week,  
providing the tankan reflects the expected improvement, said 
Masaaki Higashida, deputy general manager at Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section rose 12.75 points, or 0.88 percent, to 
1,460.16. The TOPIX posted a 31.21-point gain, or 2.20 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar stayed in a narrow range as  
investors held back ahead of Monday's release of the tankan survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market has already factored in an improvement  
in the tankan's main numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar is at this level after factoring in the tankan,''  
said Hideaki Inoue, foreign exchange manager at Mitsubishi Trust 
and Banking. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged from 120.73 yen to 121.14 yen in Friday's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.86 yen, down  
from 125.04 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government bond fell to  
1.6850 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.7400 percent, driving 
its price up to 100.99 yen from 100.51 yen.

<HEADLINE> Controversial Director Dies at 90 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Edward Dmytryk worked with some of  
Hollywood's biggest stars to create an array of memorable movies. 
</P>
<P>
	But long before his death Thursday at the age of 90, the  
director knew his film legacy would be overshadowed by his decision 
to name the names of communist comrades during the Red Scare in the 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I die, I know the obits will first read `one of  
Hollywood's Unfriendly 10,' not `director of `The Caine Mutiny,' 
`The Young Lions,' `Raintree County' and other films,''' he said a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Dmytryk had been ill for a year and succumbed to heart and  
kidney failure, said his wife, Jean Porter. He died in his Encino 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Dmytryk was a rising young director at RKO Pictures in 1945 when  
he joined the Communist Party. He said he stayed ``only a few 
months,'' but two years later the House Committee on Un-American 
Activities called him and nine other Hollywood figures to a 
Washington hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	All refused to answer questions about party membership. They  
were convicted of contempt and sentenced to a year in federal 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dmytryk finished his sentence, he admitted that he had been  
a party member. He hadn't done it before, he remarked in 1988, 
``because they would call me a coward; they'd say I was doing it 
simply to stay out of jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1951, Dmytryk returned to the House committee and identified  
26 people as communists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel guilty about talking,'' he said later. ``I knew  
(the accused) would call me a rat. But I did what I wanted to do. I 
have never regretted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Elia Kazan, the recent recipient of a controversial  
honorary Oscar, Dmytryk was never forgiven for naming names by 
others who had been blacklisted. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, the Barcelona Film Festival organized a symposium about  
Hollywood's blacklist, inviting Dmytryk and three others who had 
been blacklisted but never recanted. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio would not share the same platform with Dmytryk and he  
was forced to sit in the audience. His onetime comrades excoriated 
him as ``scum,'' ``Judas'' and ``informer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dmytryk replied: ``I didn't give any names that weren't known by  
the FBI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dmytryk was born Sept. 4, 1908, to Ukrainian immigrant parents.  
After his mother died, his father remarried and moved to San 
Francisco, where the boy sold newspapers to help support the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	At 15, he found work as a messenger at Paramount Studios in  
Hollywood and rose through the ranks to become a film editor. 
</P>
<P>
	He began directing low-budget movies at neighboring RKO and drew  
notice for ``Murder My Sweet,'' which started the hardboiled 
private eye cycle and rescued Dick Powell from musicals, and 
``Crossfire,'' an indictment of anti-Semitism, long a taboo subject 
in films. 
</P>
<P>
	After his jail term, Dmytryk directed three films in England,  
then returned to Washington to recant and name names. Only then did 
he find work in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	After making a string of well-crafted, low-budget films for  
Stanley Kramer, the producer assigned him to the 1954 World War II 
drama, ``The Caine Mutiny,'' starring Humphrey Bogart. The film's 
success made Dmytryk an in-demand director. 
</P>
<P>
	Small, tough and muscular, the director became noted for being  
able to deal with stars in dramas, Westerns or war movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his films were ``The Broken Lance'' (Spencer Tracy),  
``Soldier of Fortune'' (Clark Gable), ``The Left Hand of God'' 
(Bogart, Gene Tierney), ``Raintree County'' (Elizabeth Taylor, 
Montgomery Clift) and ``The Young Lions'' (Marlon Brando, Clift, 
Dean Martin). 
</P>
<P>
	Others included ``A Walk on the Wild Side'' (Jane Fonda, Barbara  
Stanwyck), ``The Carpetbaggers'' (George Peppard, Alan Ladd), 
``Where Love Has Gone'' (Bette Davis, Susan Hayward), ``Mirage'' 
(Gregory Peck) and ``Anzio'' (Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan). 
</P>
<P>
	Dmytryk later taught film at the University of Southern  
California, wrote manuals on filmmaking and two autobiographies, 
``It's a Hell of a Life but Not a Bad Living'' and ``Odd Man Out, A 
Memoir of the Hollywood Ten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife, survivors include a son by a first  
marriage, Michael, two daughters, Rebecca and Victoria, and three 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Move Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices moved higher  
early today on the Chicago Board of Trade in advance of the long 
holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters have offered different views about the severity of  
hot, dry weather over the next few days in Midwestern growing 
regions, although many predict a return to normal temperatures by 
midweek. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn crops in Illinois and Iowa face the biggest threat of heat  
stress, which could reduce yields. The young plants are entering 
the pollination stage in which kernels form. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices also were supported by a flurry of new export  
business that came as foreign buyers rushed to take advantage of 
sharply lower prices on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading, wheat for September delivery rose 1/4 cent to  
$2.59 a bushel; December corn rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.19 1/2 a bushel; 
December oats were unchanged at $1.15 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans 
rose 1 1/4 cents to $4.54 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures edged higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .45 cent to 62.82 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .42 cent to 76.40 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose .40 cent to 45 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose 
.55 cent to 36.90 cents a pound.

<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Lindsay Davenport pulled out of the  
mixed doubles at Wimbledon on Friday to concentrate on her 
semifinal against qualifier Alexandra Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeded No. 3 in the singles, Davenport has her first shot at  
Wimbledon's final. She was partnered with Australian doubles ace 
Todd Woodbridge in the mixed event and they were seeded second. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport and Woodbridge were due to play ninth seeds John  
McEnroe and Steffi Graf in the third round, but with the Wimbledon 
schedule in disarray because of numerous rain delays, Davenport 
decided to pull out of mixed doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport remained in the women's doubles with fellow American  
Corina Morariu. They advanced to the semifinals Friday by beating 
Nicole Arendt and Manon Bollegraf 6-4, 7-6 (7-1).

<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets pushed ahead Friday, with  
blue chips in Tokyo and Hong Kong hitting levels unseen since the 
early months of the region's economic crisis and Singapore shares 
climbing to another record finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets were filled with optimism that any interest rate worries  
are out of the way for now, after the U.S. Federal Reserve nudged 
its rates higher on Wednesday but suggested no more monetary 
tightening is likely to be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 652.44 points, or 4.8 percent,  
to close at 14,184.58, its highest point gain of the year and the 
best finish since Oct. 9, 1997, when the Asian financial crisis was 
starting to be felt in the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. is now less inclined to raise rates, which is helping  
Hong Kong stocks,'' said Patrick Yiu, an analyst at Kingsway SW 
Securities Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's session was Hong Kong's first chance to respond to the  
U.S. interest rate news, after a public holiday on Thursday, so the 
gains were somewhat exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian markets gained further encouragement from Wall Street,  
where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 95.62 points to 
11,066.42 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, Asia's biggest market, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei  
Stock Average rose 71.72 points, or 0.40 percent, closing at 
17,932.47 points. It was the index's highest closing since Sept. 
29, 1997, when it finished at 17,987.21. On Thursday, the Nikkei 
had closed up 331.01 points, or 1.89 percent.

late afternoon, up 0.32 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also 
above its late New York level of 120.78 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore shares inched up to their second record in as many  
days, pushed higher by small investors buying up small-company 
shares. The benchmark Straits Times Index closed at 2,222.45 
points, up 7.70 points, or 0.3 percent.

half of their early huge gains. The SET index rose 11.56 points to

	SATSOP, Wash. (AP) -- The second sharp earthquake in two days  
jolted an area from Oregon to British Columbia Friday night, 
toppling chimneys and rupturing gas and water mains. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake, which hit at 6:43 p.m., was estimated at magnitude  
5.5 by the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. The Pacific 
Northwest Sesimograph Network at the University of Washington 
seismology lab in Seattle estimated it at 5.1. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Steele, UW seismology lab coordinator, said the Colorado  
lab was looking at one facet of the quake and the UW lab was 
looking at the duration of shaking. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake was centered near Satsop, about 68 miles southwest of  
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stuff was flying off the shelves,'' said Trudy Donnor, who was  
getting ready to start cleaning the four-story state Insurance 
Building in Olympia when the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first one I've ever felt in my life, and I didn't  
think it was funny at all. I didn't know a concrete building could 
sway like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roof of a furniture store collapsed in Aberdeen, about 20  
miles west of the epicenter. A hospital reported four people with 
quake-related injuries that were not serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas leaks, toppled chimneys and power outages were reported  
throughout the area of Grays Harbor County, said Rob Harper of 
Washington State Emergency Management. 
</P>
<P>
	A quake Thursday night jolted the south Puget Sound area and had  
a 3.0 magnitude. It was centered near Maury Island north of Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, a magnitude 5.7 quake rumbled under the Pacific  
Ocean off Vancouver Island, about 115 miles southwest of Port 
Hardy, British Columbia. The quake early Friday was not felt 
because of its distance from land.

<HEADLINE> Plumber Loses Fight for Mansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- In a story with shades of a Dickens novel,  
a young plumber who allegedly found his way into the heart of a 
77-year-old widow has lost his bid to evict her son from the family 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The literary parallel is not a stretch. Take it from Superior  
Court Judge Frank Williams, who evicted Kevin Tinney from Belcourt 
Castle on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the `Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club' by Charles  
Dickens ... there is a place called Dingley Dell,'' said the judge. 
``The inhabitants ... represent all of humankind: good and evil, 
sophisticated and ignorant, beneficent, and avaricious. 
</P>
<P>
	``Belcourt is today's Dingley Dell.''  
</P>
<P>
	Williams invalidated a deed that gave Tinney partial ownership  
of the building and ordered him to be out of the 60-room mansion by 
July 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Tinney, the adopted son of the mansion's deceased owner Ruth  
Tinney, had accused fellow co-owners Donald Tinney and his wife, 
Harle, of running the mansion into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	He sued to have the $3.2 million mansion sold and the proceeds  
divided among the owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Tinney, Ruth Tinney's son, and his wife countered that  
Kevin Tinney used undue influence to get his name onto the deed and 
sought to have it invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-room, French-chateau style mansion was purchased by the  
Tinney family in 1956 for $25,000. The family rented it out for 
weddings and other functions. Today, visitors can tour the mansion 
for $8. 
</P>
<P>
	In the winter of 1974, Kevin Tinney -- then named Kevin Koellisch  
-- charged the Tinneys $600 to fix the heat, when other plumbers 
wanted $10,000 up front. The Tinneys were so grateful they began 
inviting him to dinner almost every night. 
</P>
<P>
	Before long, Kevin Tinney's home became the castle.  
</P>
<P>
	His detractors testified that Kevin Tinney, who was in his 30s,  
began paying special attention to the 77-year-old family matriarch 
after her husband, Harold, died in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The two appeared very affectionate in public and Ruth Tinney  
once said ``Kevin wants to marry me,'' Harle Tinney testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Tinney, who said he is gay, denied that he proposed to  
Ruth, and said his kisses were like those of any son. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth Tinney adopted Kevin Koellisch in 1990 and he changed his  
last name. Although his natural mother was living at the time, 
Tinney said their relationship had been strained for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Tinney said recently that Ruth Tinney wanted him to  
inherit part of Belcourt and adopted him to reduce his inheritance 
taxes. Six months after the adoption, Ruth Tinney deeded part of 
Belcourt to Kevin Tinney. 
</P>
<P>
	After that happened, witnesses testified, he began to pay less  
attention to Ruth Tinney. One testified that, late in life, she 
said she regretted adopting him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth Tinney died in 1995 at 89. Within two years, the family  
feud erupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Tinney accused Harle Tinney of pilfering money from  
catering events and parties held at the mansion. She accused him of 
embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
	At trial, Kevin Tinney, who has lived in the mansion with his  
companion for the last 15 years, claimed he wanted a chance to buy 
a sole interest in the place and fix it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald and Harle Tinney offered him $500,000 to drop the case,  
but he refused, asking for more than $1 million, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony in the case ended in April, but the judge had hoped  
the two sides could reach an agreement before issuing his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is not over. When they pass each other in the mansion,  
cold quick glares go back and forth. More significantly, Kevin 
Tinney said Thursday that his lawyer will appeal.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Engineer Ignored Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- An Amtrak engineer ignored a  
dispatcher's warning and ran a red light before his southbound 
train slammed into one going north, injuring eight people, a 
federal investigator said today. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was seriously hurt in the crash in downtown Jacksonville  
early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The southbound train was moving at 55 mph and narrowly missed  
hitting the other train either head-on or engine-to-engine. 
</P>
<P>
	The southbound engineer barreled through the red light, which  
could be seen from two miles away, and then was warned by a 
dispatcher to stop, said Russ Gober of the National Transportation 
Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The two engines of the northbound train, which was moving at 14  
mph, were just moving off onto a side track when the southbound hit 
them, knocking the trains' engines on their sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Gober said the engineer radioed: ``I made a bad mistake. I used  
bad judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trains, both called the Silver Palm, were carrying a  
combined 300 passengers between Miami and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Four locomotives and seven cars derailed, said Jane Covington, a  
spokeswoman for CSX Transportation, which owns the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said the accident jolted them out of their seats.  
Eight people were treated for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was asleep and then I heard my wife. I jumped up and held up  
the top bunk where my kids were sleeping,'' said Modesto Romero of 
Newark, N.J. ``They were a little scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The railroad's main line was expected to be open today.

<HEADLINE> Carnegie Heroes Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A 17-year-old camp counselor who rescued a  
6-year-old from the jaws of a mountain lion was among 24 people 
honored for acts of heroism by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just attacked the lion,'' said Aaron Hall, a high school  
junior from Missoula, Mont. ``I was screaming, yelling, kicked it a 
lot of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lion wandered off. Paramedics said Dante Swallow -- who  
survived two neck gashes in the July 1998 attack -- likely would 
have died if not for Hall's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The recipients of the Carnegie Medal for heroism, which also  
includes a $3,000 award, were honored Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission was founded in 1904 by steel magnate Andrew  
Carnegie after he was inspired by rescue tales following a mine 
disaster. It has honored 8,299 people since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Also honored were:  
</P>
<P>
	--John A. Lewis, of Nova Scotia. He saved a man and his  
7-year-old son from a fiery auto accident in August 1997.

a knife assailant who attacked the co-owner of a Portsmouth, N.H., 
coffee bar in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kelly McConnell, 13, of Paris, Texas. He tried to rescue his  
mother from a bear attack by hitting the animal. Although he 
escaped when the bear turned on him, his mother died in the August 
1997 attack in British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raymond C. Kitchen, 56, of British Columbia. He saw the bear  
attacking the McConnells and hit it with a stick when it turned on 
the boy. He died from injuries suffered in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ingrid S. Bailey, 33, of Felton, Calif; Frank S. Hedingham, 71,  
and Gary Richmond, 46, both of British Columbia. They chased away 
the bear that attacked the McConnells and Kitchen. Hedingham has 
since died. 
</P>
<P>
	--Robert C. Swartz, 25, of Syracuse, N.Y.; Michael J. Ravesi, 24,  
of Oswego, N.Y.; and Carl Assini, 35, of Webster, N.Y. They saved a 
woman from electrocution when a 300-ton crane at a construction 
site overturned and pulled electrical wires onto her car. 
</P>

11-year-old girls from an apartment fire in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	--Timothy L. Hays, 31, of Rochester, Ind., and Bruce M. Baker,  
52, Kewanna, Ind. They rescued a state trooper from his burning 
cruiser after a crash in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ulutunu Faumuina, 52, of Honolulu. He died trying to save his  
family from a fire that engulfed their house in October 1997. His 
wife and daughter survived, but six other family members died. 
</P>
<P>
	--Robert E. Mohr, 48, of Denver, Ind. He was conductor of a train  
driving through Lafayette, Ind., in May 1998 when he saw 1-year-old

<HEADLINE> Biffle Wins Pole For Diehard 200 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST ALLIS, Wis. (AP) -- Greg Biffle, a winner twice in the last  
seven NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series events, will start his Ford 
from the pole Saturday in the DieHard 200 at The Milwaukee Mile. 
</P>
<P>
	Biffle's record speed of 121.102 mph Friday locked up the  
sophomore driver's third pole of the year. His lap was 
four-thousandths of a second quicker than that of Randy Tolsma, who 
went 121.086 in a Dodge. 
</P>
<P>
	Both drivers broke Jack Sprague's year-old qualifying record of  
120.530. Sprague, who qualified his Chevrolet third, also was under 
the previous standard. He went 121.049. Stacy Compton's Dodge was 
next at 120.826, followed by the Chevy of Jay Sauter at 120.518. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixth through 10th in were Joe Ruttman, Scott Hansen, Rick  
Crawford, Dennis Setzer and Ron Hornaday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Hansen, however, was involved in an accident with Jeff  
Andretti in the post-qualifying practice session. His team rolled 
out a backup Chevy, which will require Hansen to drop to the tail 
end of the 34-truck field for the start of the 200-mile race. 
Andretti's crew will attempt to repair its only Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
	Biffle, who's bidding to complete a single-season sweep of  
victories on short tracks, road courses and superspeedways, has 
finished in the top-10 in seven of his past eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
	He won at Memphis Motorsports Park in May and at Portland  
International Raceway in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team is clicking right. Everybody is doing a good job,''  
said Biffle, fifth in the points race. ``The driver is getting more 
familiar with the truck ... we're just getting things figured 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biffle will have to beat three former winners -- Sprague,  
Hornaday and Mike Bliss -- who qualified 14th. Also in the field is 
Mike Wallace, a former NASCAR Busch Series winner at The Milwaukee 
Mile, who has two truck series victories this year.

<HEADLINE> F-16 Pilot Dies in Fla. Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKEECHOBEE, Fla. (AP) -- The pilot of an Air Force F-16 Falcon  
was killed when he crashed during a low-level training mission in a 
remote section of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The single-seat jet went down shortly before noon Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The F-16, part of the 93rd Fighter Squadron, was one of four  
planes on a training mission from Homestead Air Reserve Base, 30 
miles southwest of Miami. The crash happened in northern Okeechobee 
County, about 150 miles north of Miami, and rescuers had difficulty 
reaching the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead pilot was identified as Air Force Reserve Maj. Samuel  
D'Angelo III, an American Airlines pilot and a 19-year military 
veteran who had recently flown a mission over northern Iraq's 
``no-fly'' zone. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Angelo, a resident of Key Largo, was a flight commander  
assigned to the 93rd Fighter Squadron. 
</P>
<P>
	The training mission had the pilots simulating a bombing run.  
D'Angelo had been performing maneuvers that required the plane to 
dip so low it was almost touching the ground, said Richard 
Cordones, spokesman for the Homestead reserve unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordones said he didn't know whether D'Angelo tried to eject  
before the plane crashed.

<HEADLINE> Carter Bikes in on Students in Ga. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLAINS, Ga. (AP) -- To the surprise of students working on a new  
national historic site at Jimmy Carter's boyhood farm, the former 
president arrived unannounced on a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no idea we were going to meet him,'' said Michelle  
Greenleaf, 17, of Rock Stream, N.Y. ``And I'm very surprised he 
rode his bike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter answered students' questions Thursday about everything  
from segregation in the South during his childhood to the gnats 
that plague them as they work. The site is being developed by the 
Interior Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter recalled that his best friend growing up was a black boy  
whose family lived on his father's farm. He said they couldn't sit 
together at the movies because the theater was segregated, but 
``we'd meet outside afterwards and come back home.''

	U.S. Job Growth Surging  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy is still roaring ahead, creating  
more than a quarter-million new jobs in June everywhere from 
amusement parks to banks. Though the overall unemployment rate 
crept up to 4.3 percent, all industries except manufacturing and 
mining posted solid gains. Orders to U.S. factories were up 1.1 
percent, the Commerce Department said. Indeed, some economists 
suggested the strong job growth could prolong concern at the 
Federal Reserve that the economy might be growing too fast for its 
own good. American businesses added 268,000 new jobs, a big 
turnaround from May when they cut payrolls by 5,000, the Labor 
Department said today. Meanwhile, Average hourly earnings -- a key 
gauge of inflation -- were up by 3.7 percent over the previous June, 
to $13.23.

	Execs Guilty of Insurance Fraud

	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Two executives with Columbia/HCA Healthcare  
Corp. were found guilty today of defrauding Medicare and other 
government insurance programs of nearly $3 million. The jury 
acquitted another executive and could not reach a verdict on a 
fourth defendant. Jay Jarrell and Robert Whiteside, both executives 
of the nation's largest hospital chain, were found guilty of 
conspiring to defraud and defrauding the tax-supported 
health-insurance programs. Michael Neeb was acquitted. The jury 
could not reach a verdict on Carl Lynn Dick, who was accused of 
conspiring to defraud Medicare, Medicaid and CHAMPUS, which is 
medical insurance for the military.

	U.S. Auto Industry May Set Record  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor's U.S. sales increased 4 percent in  
June, compared with a strong performance a year ago, as the auto 
industry continued its steady growth toward a record sales year. 
Bob Rewey, Ford's sales and marketing chief, says the question is 
not so much whether 1999 will be a record sales year for the U.S. 
auto industry, but by how much it will break the records. General 
Motors planned to report its June sales later today. Ford's overall 
car sales increased 10 percent, excluding its Jaguar Cars and Volvo 
AB units. Ford said the increase was due to retail demand, as 
less-profitable sales to government and business fleets were down 
from a year ago. But like DaimlerChrysler AG, which reported 
Thursday that its Chrysler unit's sales were down 5 percent last 
month, Ford saw demand for its light trucks level off.

	Deutsche Bank: N.Y., London Layoffs  
</P>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The 5,500 layoffs resulting from  
Deutsche Bank's takeover of Bankers Trust will come mainly in New 
York and London -- places where the two banks had overlapping 
trading operations, Deutsche Bank said today. The layoffs will be 
split ``about 50-50'' between the two cities, bank spokesman Dierk 
Hartwig said. None of the layoffs will be in Germany because 
Bankers Trust ``had no presence in Germany'' before the merger, 
hence there is no overlapping, he added. In a radio interview, 
chairman Rolf Breuer said both Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust 
employees will be affected.

the retailer of English country fashions and furnishings still has 
to overcome years of losses and management turmoil. Laura Ashley

	Calif. Investigating Silicon Workers  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The government will investigate a  
newspaper's report that Silicon Valley high-tech companies pay 
Asian immigrants low wages to assemble electronic parts at home, 
possibly violating a number of labor, tax and safety laws. State 
Labor Commissioner Marcy Saunders told the San Jose Mercury News 
that officials plan to meet next week to begin forming a task force 
of state and federal labor officials. In stories published Sunday 
and Monday, the Mercury News reported that the use of immigrants to

	Coke: Another Recall in Poland  
</P>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Coca-Cola recalled a new batch of mineral  
water in Poland, this time due to bacteria contamination. The 
recall was the second this week in Poland and came even as the 
world's largest soft-drink company was restocking Belgian 
supermarket shelves with Coke as it attempts to recover from a 
four-week health scare. Although no illnesses have been reported in 
Poland, a Health Ministry expert said sampling at the plant 
discovered E. coli. The bacteria can cause illness and death, but 
the experts said the amount found at the Coca-Cola plant in 
southwest Poland was so small that it posed no health risk. 
Coca-Cola shares were at 64 13/16 down 1/16.

	Russia Approves IMF Requirements  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government approved key economic  
reforms, apparently inspired by the improved prospects of a badly 
needed foreign loan. The Central Bank announced it was lifting a 
major currency-trading restriction, while the upper house of 
parliament approved several economic bills -- all conditions for 
getting a $4.5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. 
An IMF team that visited Moscow this week praised Russia's economic 
performance and indicated that lending could soon be resumed.

	Russia's Stock Market Rebounding

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Less than a year after the Russian economy  
crashed, the stock market is making a strong comeback, although 
business is modest, with investors torn between cheap prices and 
fears of getting burned twice. Fueled by expectations of a new $4.5 
billion loan from the International Monetary Fund and higher world 
oil prices, the Russian Trading System index rose 1.6 percent today 
to close at 133.67 points. The index is up 110 percent since last 
year's crash.

<HEADLINE> US, 21 Others To End 642 Drug Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has joined 21 other major  
nations in eliminating border taxes on 642 pharmaceutical products, 
including drugs used for treating breast cancer, AIDS, diabetes, 
asthma and Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Friday the  
end to the tariffs will benefit U.S. consumers and boost exports by 
American drug companies, who will no longer have to pay tariffs on 
their products shipped to other nations party to the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The elimination of tariffs on these products will further  
expand U.S. overseas market access opportunities in Europe and 
Asia,'' Barshefsky said in a statement. ``Consumers in the United 
States and around the world will benefit from lower pharmaceutical 
prices and potentially wider product choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 21 other nations participating in the tariff elimination  
include Japan and the 15 member countries of the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Elimination of the tariffs was effective July 1. The agreement  
was forged under the Uruguay Round of global trade talks in which 
nations committed to eliminating tariffs on an initial package of 
over 6,000 pharmaceuticals and chemical products.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Settles Discrimination Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak has agreed to settle a race  
discrimination lawsuit filed by black management employees and 
applicants for management positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, announced Thursday, would create an $8 million  
fund to provide economic relief for the employees who sued. The 
national railroad also agreed to changes in its human resources and 
equal opportunity procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the settlement, Amtrak did not admit to any  
wrongdoing, but agreed to extensive changes in corporate practices 
designed to prevent race discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must still be approved by a federal court.  
</P>
<P>
	``Amtrak is committed to treating all employees fairly,'' Amtrak  
President George Warrington said in a statement. ``Valuing 
diversity is the right thing to do, and it makes good business 
sense for us, our employees and our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Lieder, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said that the  
new practices ``will help employees of all races survive and thrive 
at Amtrak well into the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Substantial changes would be made in the entire hiring process,  
including the way that positions are posted. In addition, Amtrak 
has created a new position, vice president of business diversity 
and strategic initiatives, and filled the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed last August in the U.S. District Court for  
the District of Columbia, contended Amtrak discriminated against 
blacks in filling management jobs and handling pay, promotion and 
disciplinary issues. It also alleged Amtrak maintained a racially 
hostile work environment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Tattoo Spurns Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRETNA, La. (AP) -- Jeremy Van Camp wants his old back back.  
</P>
<P>
	A tattoo artist commissioned to inscribe Van Camp's first name  
in Chinese on his back instead inked six Chinese characters whose 
meaning isn't even close, Van Camp says in a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	```Kung Po karate, martial arts expert, and Shaolin fifth.'  
That's what it says on my back,'' said Van Camp, 23. Shaolin is a 
form of kung fu. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the lawsuit filed this week, Van Camp saw a poster  
at Brad's Westbank Tattoo labeled as the Chinese alphabet. So he 
decided to have his name tattooed, and a tattoo artist inscribed 
the characters listed as ``J,'' ``E,'' ``R,'' and so on, on the 
poster. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble is, the English and Chinese languages are vastly  
different -- and letters in English have no direct counterparts in 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Camp is demanding the tattoo company pay for laser surgery  
to remove the tattoo and to compensate him for his embarrassment 
and for the pain and suffering of tattoo removal. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Fox, owner of Brad's Westbank Tattoo, did not return calls.  
An employee there said the character sheet was sold by a tattoo 
supply company in Voorheesville, N.Y., which referred calls to J.D. 
Crowe of Ancient Art Tattoo Studio of Yorktown, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowe said he couldn't recall if the design in question was his.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends at Record High 11,139.24 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose to new records in a quiet session  
Friday as a strong employment report fed investors' enthusiasm and 
capped a week of extraordinary strength on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 72.82 to close at  
11,139.24, easily topping its previous record close of 11,107.19, 
set May 13. For the week, the Dow rose 5.56 percent or 586.68 
points, the biggest weekly point gain in its 103-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators extended a string of records. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 10.26 to close at 1,391.22, and the 
Nasdaq composite index rose 34.84 to 2,741.02. Both indexes set new 
closing highs Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks marched higher Friday as the Labor Department said  
American businesses created a total of 268,000 new jobs in June, 
with all industries except manufacturing and mining posting solid 
gains. The increase in jobs was slightly stronger than economists 
expected, and average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation 
pressures, increased by 3.7 percent in June compared to a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In a less buoyant market, the report might have punctured  
investors' zest for stocks. Higher wages can drag earnings down 
because labor costs account for most of consumer prices. They also 
raise the specter of another increase in interest rates following 
this week's modest hike by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bond market, which often sets the tone for stocks, was  
unmoved by the jump in wages. The yield on the benchmark 30-year 
Treasury bond remained steady at 6.0 percent, setting the stage for 
a sixth consecutive gain in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The markets blew right past it,'' said Ricky Harrington,  
technical analyst with Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington said market indexes were holding on to an influx of  
money from mutual fund managers, who settled their portfolios 
earlier this week as the second quarter drew to a close Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this kind of market, money managers don't want to be caught  
with cash on hand,'' he said. ``They want to show their clients 
that they're fully invested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, meanwhile, continue to welcome strong economic news,  
discounting the fact that it could translate into inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage, we've got strong momentum and a real mania for  
stocks,'' Harrington said. ``It would take awfully bad news to 
change investor psychology and turn them away from this market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller &AMP; Washington, a  
Washington, D.C.-based financial consulting firm, said he believes 
the market gained enough support from the Fed's moderate interest 
rate increase to rise still higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has endured several bouts of fear,'' he said.  
``Each one has tested the resolve of the bull market. But every one 
has been for emotional reasons, not for rational ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, cyclical stocks, which perform best during times of  
economic expansion, rose broadly. International Paper rose 1 1/4 to 51 
and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing rose 1 11/16 to 88 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks continued to gained strength from the interest  
rate environment. American Express, up 4 5/8 to 137 3/4, was the 
strongest Dow component. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading technology stocks contributed to gains on the Nasdaq,  
with Cisco Systems gaining 2 11/16 to 67 1/16 and Sun Microsystems 
rising 1 7/8 to 70 1/16. Internet companies were almost uniformly 
higher, with search engine company Infoseek risine 5 1/2 to 55 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-8 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the three-day Independence Day weekend, many Wall  
Street players missed the fireworks. U.S. markets will be closed 
Monday in observance of the holiday, and many traders took Friday 
off as well. NYSE composite volume totaled a weak 753.20 million 
shares, compared with 1.02 billion in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 3.79 to 655.12, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 7.47 to 802.42. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.09 to 456.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.4 percent. In  
Europe, Germany's DAX index rose 0.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 
rose 0.05 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.3 percent.

</P>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Dennis Brown, a former child star who  
became known as the Crown Prince of Reggae, died Thursday. He was 
42. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports suggested Brown died of complications caused by  
respiratory problems, but his cause of death had not yet been 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown rose to prominence amid a 1970s wave of reggae singers  
that included Bob Marley, who introduced the music to listeners 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown released a string of hit songs beginning with ``No Man is  
an Island,'' which he recorded in 1969 at the age of 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer's most fruitful period came later, when he produced  
hits including ``Westbound Train,'' ``How Could I Leave,'' and 
``Ghetto Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He earned a Grammy nomination in 1995 for his album ``Light My  
Fire.''

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Film director Edward Dmytryk, a member of the  
Hollywood Ten who served prison time during the Red Scare-era witch 
hunts of the 1940s and was blacklisted until he named names of his 
communist comrades, died Thursday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Dmytryk had been ill for a year and succumbed to heart and  
kidney failure, said his wife, Jean Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dmytryk was a rising young director at RKO Pictures in 1945 when  
he joined the Communist Party. He said he stayed ``only a few 
months,'' but two years later the House Committee on Un-American 
Activities called him and nine other Hollywood figures to a 
Washington hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	All refused to answer questions about party membership. They  
were convicted of contempt and sentenced to a year in federal 
prison. When Dmytryk finished his sentence, he admitted that he had 
been a party member. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1951, Dmytryk returned to the House committee and identified  
26 people as communists. Only then did he find work in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	After making a string of low-budget films for Stanley Kramer,  
the producer assigned him to the 1954 World War II drama, ``The 
Caine Mutiny,'' starring Humphrey Bogart. The film's success made 
Dmytryk an in-demand director. 
</P>
<P>
	Dmytryk also directed ``Raintree County,'' ``The Young Lions,''  
``The Carpetbaggers'' and other films starring some of Hollywood's 
most famous names.

	SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) -- Shig Kariya, a Japanese American  
businessman who was interned during World War II and later founded 
Mikasa Inc. tableware company, died June 25 of pneumonia. He was 
84. 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya was born in Japan to parents who had immigrated to  
California in 1913, yet traveled to Japan frequently on business. 
Along with his parents, he was placed in a relocation camp during 
the war years because of his ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
	After his release, Kariya and seven others teamed up in 1948 to  
create American Commercial Inc. to import tableware from Japan. The 
company soon changed its name to Mikasa, which continues to market 
china, crystal and flatware. 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya earned Japan's Emperor's Award in 1988 for his work in  
promoting relations between his native and adopted countries.

the mid-1970s was simultaneously commander in chief of the U.S. 
Atlantic Fleet and NATO's supreme allied commander in the Atlantic, 
died Sunday at age 79. He had battled cancer for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd began his Navy career in 1942 after graduating from the  
U.S. Naval Academy. When he retired in 1978, he had 23 years of sea 
duty, including commands of destroyers, destroyer divisions and 
squadrons, a flotilla and three U.S. fleets in the Atlantic, 
Pacific and Mediterranean.

Beirut University College who was held hostage in the Middle East

complications from throat cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	A resident of Arlington, Va., Polhill was 65.  
</P>
<P>
	Polhill was working as an assistant professor of business  
studies when he and three fellow faculty members were seized in 
January of 1987 by gunmen posing as police officers on the 
college's campus. 
</P>
<P>
	During most of his time in isolation, Polhill was chained in  
windowless rooms, receiving only occasional visits from doctors to 
treat his diabetes. He was released in 1990, as part of an effort 
to improve relations between Iran and the United States.

died Tuesday. She was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Shacklock made her debut at the Royal Opera in 1946 in  
``The Fairy Queen'' by Henry Purcell. But she made her reputation 
as one of the outstanding performers of Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her triumphs was singing Brangaene in ``Tristan und  
Isolde'' opposite Kirsten Flagstad. She sang that role in her first 
appearance outside Britain, at the State Opera House in East Berlin 
in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	She made more than 500 appearances at Covent Garden, and for a  
decade was the featured singer at the ``Last Night of the Proms'' 
at the Royal Albert Hall.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sylvia Sidney, the waiflike star of the 1930s  
who got an Oscar nomination in 1973 for a comeback role in ``Summer 
Wishes, Winter Dreams,'' died Thursday. She was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sidney made her professional theater debut at 16 and was  
still acting 70 years later, with a brief appearance in the 1988 
hit ``Beetlejuice'' and a small role in ``Mars Attacks'' in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the directors she worked with were Josef von Sternberg, in  
``An American Tragedy,'' 1931; Alfred Hitchcock in ``Sabotage'' 
(also called ``A Woman Alone''), 1936; William Wyler, in ``Dead 
End,'' 1937; and Fritz Lang in ``Fury,'' 1936, ``You Only Live 
Once,'' 1937, and ``You and Me,'' 1938. 
</P>
<P>
	Her return to the screen was in the 1973 drama ``Summer Wishes,  
Winter Dreams,'' in which she played Joanne Woodward's doomed 
mother. She was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting 
actress.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lord Whitelaw, one of the most prominent  
Conservative politicians of the postwar years and a principal ally 
of former British premier Margaret Thatcher, died Thursday. He was 
81. 
</P>
<P>
	William Whitelaw served as Northern Ireland secretary and leader  
of the House of Commons under former Prime Minister Edward Heath in 
the 1970s, and as home secretary and leader of the House of Lords 
during Mrs. Thatcher's governments in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the Lords until 1988, and after Mrs. Thatcher's  
resignation in 1990 continued as deputy leader of the Conservative 
Party for nine more months. He stepped down in August 1991 after 16 
years in the post and 35 years' service to the party.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid To Pay $1.1M in Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The nation's third-largest drugstore  
chain will pay $1.1 million in fines to settle a lawsuit that 
claimed its stores sold expired infant formula, condoms and other 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid Corp. also agreed to post notices at its 640 California  
stores telling customers who purchased expired goods that they 
could be reimbursed or given replacements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to do our utmost to ensure the integrity of  
our products,'' the Camp Hill, Pa.-based company said Friday. 
``Selling expired merchandise is not something that Rite Aid, or 
any retailer, would knowingly allow to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors from three California counties and one city filed  
the suit last month, after investigators found more than 200 
outdated products in about 50 of the chain's stores in California. 
Some condoms were four years past their expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had no reports of infants falling ill from outdated  
products, but they cautioned that formulas lose their nutritional 
value over time, and that condoms and spermicides lose their 
effectiveness after their expiration dates pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid said its policy had always been to pull items off  
shelves 30 days before they expire; after the investigators' 
disclosure, that was changed to 60 days.

<HEADLINE> Shandling, Ex-Manager Settle Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Garry Shandling has settled a $100 million  
lawsuit against his former manager, ending a dispute that brought 
attention to the potential conflicts of interest created when 
managers double as TV producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms of the settlement between the comedian and Brad Grey  
were not disclosed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased we could achieve it without the necessity  
of a trial,'' said Shandling's attorney, David Boies. 
</P>
<P>
	Shandling's lawsuit alleged that Grey's role as his manager and  
executive producer of the now-ended ``The Larry Sanders Show'' 
represented a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit alleged that Grey was able to ``triple-dip,'' taking  
excess commissions and fees out of the HBO series. It also claimed 
Grey used Shandling's name to make $200 million-plus in other 
show-business deals and owed him a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Grey resigned as Shandling's manager in 1997. Shandling sued the  
following year. 
</P>
<P>
	While Grey's success as a producer is unusual, managers are  
increasingly serving as producers on sitcoms starring their 
clients. Networks and production companies have complained these 
executives don't always earn their producer title or money. 
</P>
<P>
	Grey's lawyer, Charles Shephard, said the case was not  
indicative of an industry-wide problem.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Stock Market Rebounding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's stock market is making a strong comeback  
less than a year after the economy crashed, but fears of getting 
burned twice have tempered investors' urge to snap up low-priced 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueled by expectations of a new $4.5 billion loan from the  
International Monetary Fund and higher world oil prices, the 
Russian Trading System index rose 1.6 percent Friday to close at 
133.67 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The index is up 110 percent since last year's crash, a  
remarkable turnaround after the troubles set off by Asia's 
financial crash in the summer of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly bankrupt, Russia was forced to default on its sovereign  
debt last August and devalue the ruble, sending the market into a 
tailspin. Spooked by rumors of everything from government 
nationalization to the return of communism, investors fled. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russia limped through the crisis and its market has bounced  
back in spite of political turmoil that saw three prime ministers 
and new Cabinets with each one. 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, trading volumes on Russia's market these days are  
modest. On Friday, the volume reached $27 million, far below 
pre-crisis levels but still up from recent volumes of about $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebound is largely attributed to new IMF optimism and talk  
of more credits. Also, the government has made some headway in 
persuading creditors to reschedule its Soviet-era debts, which 
account for about two-thirds of its $150 billion foreign debt 
burden. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fact that prices are so low are certainly not a  
deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
	``People started buying Russian shares again mostly because the  
price is so low,'' Boris Fyodorov, former tax minister, wrote this 
week in Segodnya daily.

<HEADLINE> Primary Calendar Concerns GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Republican National  
Committee said today he will appoint an advisory panel to recommend 
ways to reverse a trend among states to hold presidential primaries 
earlier and earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing a tentative primary schedule for next year, RNC  
Chairman Jim Nicholson said he was ``concerned about the trend 
toward front-loading the calendar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa caucuses, one of the first major events in 2000, could  
come as early as Jan. 31, he said. And by the end of February, 
about 40 percent more delegates will have been chosen than by the 
same time in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is so compressed and it goes off like a string of  
firecrackers once it starts,'' he said. ``A person who might have 
gotten a bounce because of a surprisingly good showing in an early 
primary ... (won't have) time to really maximize that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previous incentives, like giving states more delegates if they  
push back their primary, have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our major concern is that not enough people get involved in  
this process of choosing who the nominees will be for the most 
important job on Earth,'' Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I think if you would ask the candidates, they would  
agree,'' he said. ``They would like to have more time to be out in 
more states and learning their issues and learning more about those 
regions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson said he will appoint senior Republican officials to  
his advisory panel, which probably will be chaired by a former RNC 
leader since many former chairmen ``have run for and been elected 
president of the United States. ... They've been through the mill 
in this process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will issue findings by the end of the year so that the  
suggestions can be considered during the RNC winter meeting next 
January in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will instruct them to examine all possible options,  
including the plan recently put forth by the National Association 
of Secretaries of State, which is a regional rotating primary,'' he 
said. ``I'm going to ask them to look at other possibilities, 
including a stronger incentive-based program, perhaps, a national 
delegate selection day, and others that have been put on the table 
around the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson said the RNC rules committee also is studying the  
issue.

<HEADLINE>  Charismatic Improves After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charismatic continues to improve from surgery  
for leg fractures sustained in the Belmont Stakes that could have 
proved fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of severity, and on a scale of one to 10, it was a  
'nine','' said Dr. Celeste Kunz, whose quick reaction help saved 
the life the Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fracture (a condylar fracture of the left front cannon  
bone with an additional fracture to the seasmoid) was dangerously 
displaced,'' she said Friday at news conference at Belmont Park. 
``If it had broken through the skin, the prognosis would have been 
lowered significantly. I fitted the leg with a compression boot 
suitable to the horse's weight and size in order to immobilize 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis and trained by D.  
Wayne Lukas, was retired and will go to stud 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when in the running of the Belmont Stakes June 9 he  
thought the injury occurred, Dr. Stephen Selway, who operated on 
the colt the following day, said his best guess was that it 
happened between the quarter and eighth poles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he carried his head changed and, although his momentum  
carried him on, he seemed to lose his fluidity of motion,'' Selway 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic finished third behind Lemon Drop Kid and Vision and  
Verse in his bid to become the 12th Triple Crown champion and first 
since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Selway credited quick action to ``stabilize Charismatic's  
physiological condition following the injury'' as being of critical 
importance in the horse's survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Chris Antley also helped by dismounting shortly after the  
finish and lifting the injured leg to relieve the weight on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic has responded well to surgery and to continuing  
treatment. He is expected to remain in his stall for another two to 
three months. Complete healing of the fracture is expected to take 
four to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Although horses with somewhat similar injuries have resumed in  
competition, Charismatic's retirement was considered the most 
prudent course to pursue, Selway said, ``to preserve an invaluable 
gene pool.''

<HEADLINE> Summers Confirmed for Treasury Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By an overwhelming margin, the Senate has  
confirmed Lawrence Summers to succeed Robert Rubin as treasury 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers, 44, will assume the top job today following a  
swearing-in ceremony, Treasury Department spokeswoman Michelle 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined Treasury in 1993 as undersecretary for international  
affairs and has served in the agency's No. 2 job since 1995, when 
Rubin became secretary. Rubin announced his resignation on May 12, 
and Clinton immediately named Summers to be his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators approved Summers in a 97-2 vote Thursday. Only Sens.  
Wayne Allard, R-Colo., and Bob Smith, R-N.H., voted against him, 
while Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, a millionaire Wall Street investment banker before  
joining the administration, has not said what he will do next. He 
led the Treasury Department during a time of historic levels of 
economic growth, debt reduction, job growth and low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said that Summers had a close working relationship with  
Clinton and that the handling of economic matters would be in good 
hands with Summers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is extraordinarily bright, extraordinarily insightful about  
the economy,'' Rubin told NBC News. ``It is very interesting to 
watch him talk with the president because when he starts to say 
something, the president just hones in on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate PBS interview, Rubin stressed that Summers had  
also developed a close working relationship with Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan. Rubin said he and Summers had met weekly 
for the past several years with Greenspan over breakfast or lunch 
and exchanged views on a wide range of economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``That relationship has been enormously useful when we have had  
to deal with crises and with serious issues,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin called ``totally untrue'' the suggestion in the PBS  
interview that he had considered resigning from the administration 
because of his unhappiness with Clinton after the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal erupted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president made terrible mistakes. He acknowledged he made  
terrible mistakes,'' Rubin said. But he said he still had ``a great 
deal of respect'' for the way Clinton kept focused on issues such 
as the Asian financial crisis and other duties during the 
impeachment ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers has said he sees no need to change any of Rubin's  
policies on issues facing Treasury, including Social Security and 
Medicare reform, the health of the U.S. steel industry, Japan's 
worrisome economy and the dismal U.S. savings rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers is a native of New Haven, Conn., and was a Harvard  
economics professor and the World Bank's chief economist before 
joining Treasury. He was also a domestic policy economist on 
President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisors from 1982 to 1983.

<HEADLINE> Brazil TV Stars Sell Phone Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Open almost any newspaper these  
days and you'll see soap opera star Luana Piovani, advising that 
her number is 15. On television, her sultry rival Ana Paula Arosio 
invites viewers to ``make a 21.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two actresses are pitching rival phone companies, a concept  
that was unthinkable until last July, when Brazil sold its mammoth 
government-owned telecoms monopoly Telebras for $19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Saturday, private competition will begin in earnest.  
The government predicts consumers will receive unprecedented 
benefits and options in price, service and quality. 
</P>
<P>
	It also could cause unprecedented confusion, at least at first.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's great that the phone companies are using nice-looking  
girls in ads,'' said taxi driver Flavio Nunes, eyeing a phone 
company billboard. ``But they haven't told me how much my calls 
will be. I'm still not sure which company to use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new system, users can choose the carrier they want for  
long-distance and international calls. It's a novelty for 
Brazilians, and means a whole new menu of phone numbers for any 
non-local call. 
</P>
<P>
	The old way, people made a long-distance call by punching a  
``0'' followed by a two-digit area code and the number. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, between the ``0'' and the area code comes another two-digit  
number corresponding to a local private carrier. Seven phone 
companies exist, and two more are scheduled to start up by year's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest company is Embratel, represented by Ms. Arosio and  
her ``21.'' Now owned by MCI WorldCom Inc. of Jackson, Miss., it is 
the only company that serves all of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Piovani's ``15'' stands for Spanish-owned Telefonica. The  
company will battle Embratel for the market in Sao Paulo, South 
America's biggest city, accounting for half of Brazil's $4 billion 
a year phone business. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's National Telecommunications Agency, Anatel,  
expects a price war among services, as happened when cellular phone 
operators were privatized. And because users pick a company on 
every call, the battle should be permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	In an opening salvo last week, Embratel announced discounts of  
up to 20 percent discounts for corporate rates. Telefonica 
responded by cutting its rates up to 15 percent and promised 
further discounts for households. 
</P>
<P>
	Price cuts are not the only methods the telecom companies will  
use to woo callers. Among the attractions expected to be offered 
soon are discounts and ``frequent dialer'' bonuses for good 
customers and special rates for Internet users.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Climb Out of Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic National Committee, which was  
$16 million in debt two years ago, has raised enough money to pay 
what it owes. 
</P>
<P>
	National Chairman Joe Andrew said Thursday that the DNC, which  
raised $21 million during the first six months of 1999, now has 
more than enough money to pay its bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the committees that help Senate Democrats and House  
Republicans reported raising record amounts of campaign 
contributions during the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $26  
million between Jan. 1 and June 30, while the Democratic Senatorial 
Campaign Committee took in $12 million during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures include money raised under federal contribution  
limits that can be used to directly aid congressional candidates, 
as well as the unregulated contributions from corporations, labor 
unions and individuals, which is known as soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other party committees, the Republican National Committee,  
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the National 
Republican Senatorial Committee, declined to release their mid-year 
fund-raising totals Thursday. They do not have to file with the 
Federal Election Commission until later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The party committees reported their hauls a day after Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush smashed fund-raising records for presidential 
campaigns, taking in more than $36 million in the first half of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, a critic of the ways in which campaigns are  
financed bemoaned the record hauls. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no elections; there are only auctions,'' said Ellen  
Miller, executive director of the advocacy group, Public Campaign. 
``The entire fund-raising system has been turned into a chase for 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRCC had raised $16 million during the first six months of  
1997, meaning that its fund raising is up 63 percent this year. The 
committee also paid off its $3.6 million debt incurred last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRCC has invited several industry representatives to pay  
$10,000 apiece to discuss issues with key GOP lawmakers. 
Representatives of the technology industry on Thursday had 
breakfast with NRCC Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia, House Commerce 
Committee chairman Thomas Bliley of Virginia, and Rep. Billy Tauzin 
of Louisiana, chairman of Commerce's telecommunications 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our continued success would not have been possible without the  
hard work of our members,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, House Republicans helped raise money for the annual  
Senate-House GOP dinner, which took in almost $9 million, a record 
for a non-election year. The donors included corporations and 
lobbyists with bills pending before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The DSCC had raised more than $8 million during the first six  
months of 1997, and surpassed that total by almost 50 percent this 
year, taking in $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our supporters recognize that this is perhaps the most  
important election cycle in a generation,'' said DSCC Chairman 
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.

<HEADLINE> Benes Faces First Batter in 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Alan Benes, on a  
long comeback trail from two shoulder operations, faced batters 
Friday for the first time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours before the Cardinals played the Diamondbacks, the  
right-hander threw 25 pitches off the mound, 15 to David Howard and 
10 to Placido Polanco. 
</P>
<P>
	He's going to test the arm again on Monday, then throw in a  
simulated game. A rehabilitation stint would follow if there are no 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect to come back right away with the stuff I had  
two years ago,'' Benes said. ``I just want to be able to go out 
there and not worry about the shoulder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benes, 27, said he could be working out of the bullpen within  
three weeks, and expects to be back in the major leagues by August. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had my heart set on coming back all season, at some  
point,'' he said. ``I did great. I feel great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before he was sidelined by a partially torn rotator cuff in July  
1997, Benes was the dominant pitcher on the staff. He was 9-9 with 
a 2.89 ERA and 160 strikeouts in 161 2-3 innings that year and had 
surgery that September and again in September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, the Cardinals optioned left-hander Mike Mohler  
to Triple-A Memphis and recalled right-hander Mike Busby. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohler was 1-0 with a 5.34 ERA and one save in 27 games. Busby  
was 1-0 with a 6.12 ERA in 17 games at Memphis with 26 strikeouts 
in 25 innings. He was 0-1 with a 7.50 in 12 games with the 
Cardinals earlier in the season before his May 10 demotion.

<HEADLINE> Sting Trades Mapp to Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Charlotte Sting on Friday traded  
Rhonda Mapp to Houston for Kara Wolters, who is out with a knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sting made the deal to strengthen their size and strength  
underneath the backboards, according to coach Marynell Meadors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2 Mapp, a former North Carolina State star, was  
Charlotte's starting center for the first five games this season, 
before sitting out the sixth game with the flu. She played just 
seven minutes in the Sting's 68-63 loss to Washington on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-7 Wolters, a star at Connecticut, has been out since June  
21 with a right knee injury. She was expected to miss four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolters was Houston's third-round pick in the 1999 WNBA Draft  
after she played two seasons in the now-defunct ABL. In 57 career 
games in the ABL, she averaged 10.1 points and 5.2 rebounds while 
shooting 54.7 percent from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mapp averaged 11.6 points and 5.5 rebounds during the inaugural  
WNBA season and 10.1 points and 4.3 rebounds last season. She was 
averaging just 5.9 points and 3.7 rebounds per game this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rhonda has been a big part of our success over the past three  
seasons,'' Meadors said. ``But the makeup of the league has changed 
in terms of the size and height of players in the post. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rebounding has been an Achilles' heel of sorts for us this  
season and having Kara as a presence in the middle will help us 
shore up that aspect of our game. Kara is also an active 
shot-blocker and a fine offensive player in the low post.''

<HEADLINE> Another Indian March Planned in Neb. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITECLAY, Neb. (AP) -- The possibility of violence during the  
Fourth of July weekend hung over this town, where Sioux from the 
Pine Ridge Reservation went on a rampage a week ago during a 
protest over alleged treaty violations, two unsolved murders and 
the sale of alcohol to Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian activists planned another protest for Saturday, saying  
they would march two miles from the reservation in South Dakota 
over the state line into this village of 22 residents. They planned 
to set up tepees and occupy Whiteclay until state officials 
addressed their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Saturday, about 350 Indians walked the same route before  
setting fires, looting a Whiteclay grocery store and tearing down a 
``Welcome to Nebraska'' sign at the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal leaders said they do not want Saturday's march to turn  
ugly because it could scare President Clinton away from his visit 
to the reservation on Tuesday. Clinton plans to discuss economic 
development in Indian communities and tour tornado-damaged parts of 
Oglala, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns said state troopers will be on  
hand. He said he considered calling in the National Guard to 
monitor the march, but ruled it out. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns said he hoped to meet with tribal officials ``to ask for  
peaceful demonstrations over the weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Hotz, owner of the Jack and Jill grocery store in Whiteclay,  
said that businesses in town would be closed Saturday because of 
the protest. The Fourth of July holiday is usually one of the 
busiest weekends of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	American Indian Movement leaders and members of the Oglala Sioux  
tribe allege the U.S. government has violated an 1868 treaty that 
reserved parts of North and South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana and 
Nebraska for the Sioux. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribe members are also upset that a few stores in Whiteclay sell  
more than $3 million worth of beer each year, mostly to Indians 
with drinking problems. The rate of alcoholism is high among 
Indians, and alcohol is banned on the Pine Ridge Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If them bars weren't there, a lot of our people, including my  
cousin and younger brother, would be alive today,'' said Tom Poor 
Bear, who organized last weekend's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, tribe members say local police have not done enough to  
investigate the deaths of Wilson Black Elk Jr., 40, and Ronald Hard 
Heart, 39, whose bodies were found June 8 in a culvert near the 
Nebraska line. Poor Bear is Black Elk's older half-brother and Hard 
Heart's cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns said the state could not offer much help with the  
investigation because the bodies were found in South Dakota. 
Federal and tribal police have announced a $15,000 reward for 
information on the slayings.

<HEADLINE> Millions Set To Jam Highways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's highways are about to be jammed  
with millions of Americans looking for fun and fireworks during the 
4th of July weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	AAA estimates more than 37 million people will travel 100 miles  
or more from home over the holiday weekend. That would be the most 
for a July 4th since 1986 when 38 million people hit the road. 
</P>
<P>
	AAA says most people, nearly 32.5 million, will be in cars,  
trucks or RVs. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists will find prices at the pump a little higher. The  
average price of self-serve regular unleaded gasoline is about 
$1.14 a gallon, up about three and a half cents from 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Police agencies throughout the country are urging drivers to be  
alert, observe the speed limit, buckle up and keep their cool.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Beer Rivals Join Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Brahma and Antarctica, bitter rivals  
for Brazil's beer and soft-drink business, are merging to in an 
attempt to become a global power in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would be the world's third-largest brewery,  
after Anheuser-Busch Cos. and Heineken NV, in terms of volume of 
beer production and the world's fifth-largest beverage company by 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan announced Friday, the new company would be known  
as Companhia de Bebidas das Americas, or AmBev. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of association is inevitable. We are the first (in  
Brazil) but I think we will start seeing Brazilian giant companies 
in some sectors moving to consolidation to compete in the global 
market,'' Marcel Telles, Brahma's president said explaining that 
AmBev plans to use its Brazilian base of operations as a 
springboard for expansion across Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Brahma and Antarctica sold a total of 16.4 billion  
gallons of beer and 6.5 billion gallons of soft drinks. They have 
combined assets of $4.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Brahma has a 50 percent share of Brazil's beer market, while  
Antarctica retains about 25 percent. Jointly, the two company's 
have 39 percent of Brazil's beverage market, including beer, soft 
drinks, mineral water, health drinks and tea. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the market concentration, especially in the area of  
beer, analysts have said that the deal is almost certain to run 
afoul of antitrust authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensitive to antitrust concerns, the presidents of Brahma and  
Antarctica met with Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
before announcing the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the two companies were also careful to  
characterize the deal as an ``association'' under which they would 
remain wholly-owned subsidiaries of a merged entity. 
</P>
<P>
	Under this arrangement, AmBev would maintain separate  
distribution networks and marketing operations for its different 
brand names, but would join production lines to increase 
efficiency, said Victorio de Marchi, Antarctica's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials intend to argue that this separation should  
guarantee competition in the domestic market, when they make their 
case before Brazil's Economic Defense Council, which handles 
antitrust matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Brahma's Telles and Antarctica's Marchi would be co-chairmen of  
AmBev. Brahma executive Magim Rodriguez will be president, 
overseeing day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The creation of AmBev also means the end of the Brahma's  
partnership with Miller Brewing Co., a unit of Philip Morris Cos. 
Inc., and Antarctica's partnership with Anheuser-Busch. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch said it will pull out from an equity purchase  
agreement with Antarctica, which would have increased its stock in 
the company from the current 5 percent to 30 percent by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Brahma's Telles said his company was notifying Miller  
of the AmBev deal.

<HEADLINE> Semis: Sampras-Henman, Rafter-Agassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- The winner of the Wimbledon men's  
title is guaranteed a little bit of tennis history. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Sampras, aiming for his sixth title, hopes to tie Roy  
Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slams, while semifinal opponent Tim 
Henman bids to become the first British player to win the men's 
championship since Fred Perry in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi seeks to emulate Bjorn Borg, the last player to win  
the French Open and Wimbledon titles in the same year. Borg last 
did it in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	And his semifinal foe, Pat Rafter, seeks to beat Agassi to  
become the first Australian to hold the No. 1 ranking since John 
Newcombe in 1974. He then can become the first Australian to hold 
both the U.S. Open and Wimbledon titles at the same time since Rod 
Laver in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sampras-Henman semifinal is a repeat of last year's matchup,  
when the American triumphed 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 on the way to his 
fifth Wimbledon title. 
</P>
<P>
	They are friends, and frequently play golf together when they  
meet on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know his game very well, he knows my game very well and  
we've practiced together quite a bit over the past couple of 
years,'' said Sampras, 5-0 against Brit with three of those 
victories coming on grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played a tight match at Queen's and a tight match here last  
year,'' Sampras said. ``The crowd's going to be behind him, which 
won't be easy but I've been in this situation before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of time before he breaks through and wins  
here. Hopefully it won't happen this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henman, who ousted Jim Courier in a 4 1/2-hour fourth-round match,  
will have a huge and noisy crowd roaring him on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm through to the semis for the second year, so my confidence  
is very high,'' said the 24-year-old Brit. ``I don't feel like I've 
got anything to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he knows that Sampras, whose titles have come in the past  
six years, isn't used to losing at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at Pete's record, he's played 45 matches here in  
the last six or seven years and he's won 44 of them,'' Henman said. 
``I think his record is self-explanatory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras didn't lose a set until he met Mark Philippoussis in the  
quarterfinals, and went through after the big-serving Australian 
injured a knee early in the second set and withdrew while leading 
6-4, 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-seeded Agassi, 5-3 against Rafter, is still on a roll  
following a depressing slump in 1997. He dropped to 141 in the 
world that year, and played in lower- ranked Challenger 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Climbing rapidly back up the rankings, Agassi came up with a  
stunning French Open triumph from two sets down to Andrei Medvedev 
in the final. Agassi now has won 12 matches in a row, all in Grand 
Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to be in the semis these days and not feel good  
about your game, it really is,'' said Agassi, who crushed former 
French Open champ Gustavo Kuerten in straight sets in the 
quarterfinal. ``But I think everybody is playing better, not only 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter, the two-time US Open champion who overpowered  
eighth-seeded Todd Martin to make the semifinal, had never been 
past the fourth round at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty big milestone for me and I want to keep going,''  
the Australian said after his 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-3) 
victory over Martin put him in the final four. Andre's obviously 
hitting the ball very well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was the best I've volleyed since I've been here, and I'm  
pretty confident I'll be able to break Andre's serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter said the chance of being No. 1 wasn't on his mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so happy to be here at the moment, the semifinals,''  
he said. ``The finals of Wimbledon definitely overshadows the No. 1 
positions in my book.''

<HEADLINE> Boldon Wins Men's 100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Ato Boldon won the men's 100-meter  
showdown Friday night at the Athletissima track and field meet, 
beating world record-holder and training partner Maurice Greene. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon burst down the lightning-quick Pontaise track in 9.86  
seconds, tying the season's second-best time. Boldon also run 9.86 
at Athens last month, but finished second to Greene, who smashed 
the world record in 9.79. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Boldon, of Trindad &AMP; Tobago, finished .07 seconds  
ahead of Greene. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Jason Gardener broke the 10-second barrier for the  
first time in his career, placing third in 9.98. Olympic silver 
medalist Frank Fredericks of Namibia was fourth in 10.00. 
</P>
<P>
	Making up for a disappointing seventh-place finish at the USA  
Championships last week, Larry Wade posted the season's fastest 
time in the 110-meter hurdles of 13.01. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be the best at what I do,'' Wade said. ``I don't  
have a time or a championship to aspire to. I just want to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade led an American sweep of the top three places. Mark Crear  
finished second in 13.04 and Allen Johnson was third in 13.13. 
</P>
<P>
	Norberto Tellez of Cuba won the men's 800 in 1:44.05, with  
Kenya's Kennedy Kimwetich second in 1:44.13 and Olympic silver

Lorraine Graham of Jamaican. American Suziann Reid, runner-up at 
the U.S. championships, finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	American Melissa Morrison made up for a bad stumble at the U.S.  
championships, winning the women's 100 hurdles in 12.74, .01

<HEADLINE> Martin Offers Sampras His Team Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Todd Martin is ready to step aside and  
let Pete Sampras play singles when the United States meets 
Australia in the Davis Cup quarterfinals July 16-18 at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, inspired by the Americans' dramatic win over Britain in  
April, wants to return to the team. In order not to upset the team 
by stealing a singles spot, he offered only to play doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Pete should be playing singles,'' said Martin after  
losing to Pat Rafter in the Wimbledon quarterfinals Friday. ``I 
don't know if Pete thinks that, I don't know if Gully (team captain 
Tom Gullikson) thinks that, and I don't know if Jim (Courier) 
thinks that, but I want our best team on court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courier and Martin played both singles and doubles when the  
United States beat Britain 3-2. Sampras declined to play, saying 
his priority was on winning Grand Slam titles not the Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Philippoussis sustained a knee injury Friday during his  
quarterfinal match against Sampras, and retired early in the second 
set. He is doubtful for the Davis Cup.

<HEADLINE> Former NHL Star Meets Donor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUARTE, Calif. (AP) -- Milos Holan smiled as his toddler son  
splashed gleefully in a fountain in the City of Hope's rose garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need anything else. I'm the happiest man on Earth,  
just to be here with my family and be healthy,'' Holan said softly. 
</P>
<P>
	Wife Irena kept an eye on 3-year-old Milos Jr. and 7-year-old  
Veronica, and said, ``It's magical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, the former NHL defenseman was in agony in a  
City of Hope hospital room, undergoing radiation and chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day I was so sick that I felt the next day would be my  
last,'' Holan remembered. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday in the rose garden, the strapping hockey player from the  
Czech Republic finally met the slightly paunchy nuclear engineer 
from Jessup, Md., who donated the marrow that keeps him alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Holan and Robert Stransky Jr. shook hands, then bear-hugged.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just met the man who saved my life,'' Holan said. ``If it  
weren't for him, I could not be here today, would not be in this 
life. It's amazing how the compassionate act of a complete stranger 
saved my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stransky, sporting a pony tail and a couple of earrings, grinned  
and said, ``It's no big deal. I just gave him some spare parts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Holan, looking as robust as when he skated in a  
combined 49 games for the Philadelphia Flyers and Anaheim Mighty 
Ducks in 1994-96, is playing hockey again in the Czech Republic and 
hopes to make it back to the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he felt no symptoms when he was diagnosed with the  
disease after a routine physical with the Mighty Ducks in 1995, 
Holan needed a transplant to live. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was scared of the word leukemia. I didn't know what it  
meant,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He continued to play for the Mighty Ducks, and four months  
later, a marrow match -- not perfect but close enough to try -- was 
found. Donating blood, Stransky had decided to have his blood typed 
as a possible marrow donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Stransky, now 34, got a call that a match had been found and  
immediately went in for the simple donation procedure. The marrow 
was quickly flown to the West Coast and, within hours, Holan 
received the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like buying a lottery ticket; a million-to-one  
sometimes to find a match,'' Stransky said. ``I guess I won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stephen Forman, who performed the operation on Holan in  
February 1996, said the transplant was high-risk because the marrow 
wasn't a perfect match. The majority of marrow transplants come 
from relatives, but there were no matches for Holan in his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were six months of complications, and it tested  
everything we could do,'' Forman said. While there are no 
guarantees, Forman said Holan isn't expected to have any more 
problems with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally patients who don't get a perfect match don't ever  
recover fully, but his recovery has been amazing. Hockey players 
are tough guys,'' Forman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor said that, when he began his career 25 years ago,  
``Nearly all leukemia patients died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marrow transplants began in the late 1960s and became relatively  
common in the last decade. Doctors at City of Hope performed 560 
transplants in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Milos Jr. was born while his father was in the hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was so weak I couldn't even hold him,'' Holan said. ``I was  
determined that I would get stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he was being treated at City of Hope in 1996, Holan  
befriended a cheerful young woman, Michelle Carew, who also had 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a nationwide effort by her father, baseball Hall of  
Famer Rod Carew, a donor match could not be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was very brave. I was in the hospital about two months  
when I was told that she had died,'' Holan said, speaking softly 
again. ``In my home in the Czech Republic, I have a picture of me 
with Michelle and her family.''

	'Godfather' Author Dies at 78

the fictional Corleone mob family and winner of two Oscars for his 
screen adaptations of his book ``The Godfather,'' died today at age 
78. Puzo died, apparently of heart failure, at his Long Island 
home, said Neil Olson, his literary agent. Puzo had just finished 
work on his latest book, ``Omerta.'' The book is due out in July 
2000. Puzo wrote seven other novels in addition to ``The

the support of key local politicians. Under the plan announced 
after week-long negotiations, Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie

	Job Growth Shows Strong Rebound  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The unemployment rate edged up slightly to 4.3  
percent in June even though job growth showed a strong rebound 
during the month as amusement parks, restaurants and construction 
firms gobbled up workers, the Labor Department reported today. 
Manufacturing, however, continued to miss out, with job losses in 
that sector now totaling nearly a half-million workers since the 
Asian crisis hit. The jobless rate for more than a year has been at 
levels not seen in nearly three decades. Unemployment in May had 
dipped to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent. ``The fundamentals of this 
economy remain strong,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.

	Aversion to Movie Violence Drops

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Associated Press poll suggests that  
Americans don't seem to be as upset by violent movies as they used 
to be. The poll found that 40 percent of adults said they would be 
less likely to see a movie if they knew it contained violence -- 20 
points lower than the percentage who answered the same way a decade 
ago. In the poll, conducted by ICR of Media, Pa., only one-third of 
respondents said violence is the biggest problem with current 
movies, about the same percentage who said tickets cost too much. 
An additional 17 percent said movies aren't as good as they used to 
be, and 13 percent said there is too much sex on the big screen.

charges he dodged the draft, a close associate said today. In an 
intensified crackdown against opponents, President Slobodan 
Milosevic's government ordered criminal proceedings against 
Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic for draft evasion during 
NATO's 78-day air campaign. ``The criminal proceedings will not 
prevent Djindjic from returning home,'' the party's deputy leader, 
Zoran Zivkovic said. ``We expect him here next week.'' Djindjic's 
lawyers maintain that he never received the draft call.

now be removed from the endangered species list, President Clinton 
said today. Celebrating a three-decade struggle to protect the bald 
eagle against pesticides and encroachments on its habitat, Clinton 
announced a process that is expected to remove the majestic bird 
from the list by July 2000. ``It's hard to think of a better way to 
celebrate the birth of a nation than to celebrate the rebirth of 
our national symbol,'' the president said on the eve of the

<HEADLINE> Fired Producer Sues CNN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A television producer fired by the Cable News  
Network after it retracted a story alleging U.S. forces used nerve 
gas on American defectors is suing CNN, seeking $106 million in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit filed Thursday by April Oliver in state court also  
names CNN's parent company, Time Warner Inc. The suit is similar to 
one Ms. Oliver filed in May in the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Neeli Ben-David, said her employment agreement  
specified that any suit be filed in Atlanta, where CNN is based. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit claims Ms. Oliver was wrongly dismissed and alleges  
defamation, intentional interference with contract, intentional 
infliction of emotional distress, fraud and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit requests $6 million in actual damages and $100 million  
in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about Ms. Oliver's allegations, CNN has said it does  
not comment on pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The June 7, 1998, report accused the military of using sarin gas  
in Laos during the Vietnam War. Two U.S. defectors were supposedly 
killed in the attack. CNN retracted the story after its 
investigation concluded that the network could not support the 
report's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN also fired another producer, while a third producer  
resigned. Peter Arnett, the story's lead reporter, was reprimanded 
and ultimately left the network because of the report.

<HEADLINE> No Freebies For VIPs in 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Kings, queens and assorted VIPs will get  
no free tickets, transportation or parking during the 2002 Winter 
Olympic Games, a policy committee of the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee decided Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, headed by Nolan Karras -- Gov. Mike Leavitt's Olympic  
representative -- drafted an ethics and conflict-of-interest code 
and policies intended to open records and meetings to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ad Hoc Policy Committee was given its charge Feb. 11 when  
SLOC was reorganized following allegations that Salt Lake bidders 
lavished gifts, favors, cash payments, medical care and jobs on 
International Olympic Committee members and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Karras said SLOC will just say `no' when American or foreign  
dignitaries ask for complimentary tickets or other favors during 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to get lots of requests from all kinds of  
government officials -- kings, queens and heads of countries,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even SLOC's own 54 volunteer trustees may have to purchase  
tickets to Olympic competitions, though that issue is undecided, 
Karras said. The no-freebie policy applies to virtually everyone 
other than IOC members, who by contract will get credentials and 
special seating at every Olympic ceremony and event. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's sweeping policies on ethics, internal records and  
board and committee meetings will go to the full board of trustees 
Thursday for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel polished the rules after four hours of negotiation  
with lawyers for newspapers and TV and radio stations in Salt Lake 
City. Many of the practices already have been adopted by SLOC, a 
private corporation using millions of dollars in taxpayer money it 
is supposed to repay after the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Exceptions govern many disclosure rules, and one of the most  
contentious debates Friday came over SLOC's 50-volume budget, which 
has never publicly been disclosed. SLOC has released only a 
sketchy, four-page summary of the $1.45 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC president Mitt Romney also argued for strictly limiting  
disclosure of SLOC salaries, saying nothing good could come of it. 
SLOC will release the salaries only of officers and the five 
highest-paid employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Any greater disclosure ``will cost us more money'' as employees  
discover that others in equivalent positions are getting paid more, 
Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, the ad hoc panel tightened a conflict-of-interest  
rule that already tossed three trustees from the SLOC board. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules says key employees, officers and board trustees  
must resign if they or their spouses or children own 5 percent or 
more of a company receiving $500,000 or more from SLOC. The 
previous threshold was $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Those with smaller conflicts could do business with SLOC if  
conflicts are disclosed and approved. SLOC is hiring an ethics 
officer to review potential conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Seize U.S. Fishing Vessel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Canadian authorities have seized a 41-foot  
Alaska fishing boat, boarding the vessel with one person aboard and 
taking it into Canadian waters, the U.S. Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lesley Ann was seized Thursday by the Canadian Department of  
Fisheries and Oceans and was believed to have been escorted to 
Prince Rupert, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The vessel was fishing legally but was in a disputed zone where  
the United States and Canada have an agreement for so-called ``flag 
state enforcement,'' Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Ray Massey said late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vessels that are U.S.-registered we have jurisdiction over,  
and those that are Canadian registered, they do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Bosworth of Petersburg was fishing for black cod about 50  
miles south of Ketchikan. He radioed the Coast Guard for help 
Thursday afternoon, saying he had been boarded by Canadian 
authorities from the enforcement ship Kitimat II and that the 
Canadians were taking his vessel to Prince Rupert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard cutter Anacapa went to the area, protested the  
seizure and shadowed the Lesley Ann and the Canadian vessel until 
they reached Canadian waters, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian fisheries officials in Prince Rupert could not be  
reached by telephone late Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Web Site Lands Agnew FBI Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Newly released documents from Spiro Agnew's FBI  
file show that both the former vice president and government 
lawyers investigating him were preoccupied with leaks to the press 
during the months before he resigned in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Their concerns are detailed in correspondence obtained by an  
online news service using the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Agnew resigned on Oct. 10, 1973, after pleading no contest to  
evading $13,500 in his 1967 taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Agnew also admitted accepting thousands of  
dollars in kickbacks from contractors as Baltimore County executive 
and governor of Maryland in the 1960s, and later as President 
Nixon's hand-picked vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 219 pages of internal Justice Department memos and other  
items relating to the Agnew affair were posted Thursday by APB 
Online, a Web site opened last year and devoted to crime and 
justice issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is part of our continuing commitment to identifying and  
making public material from all government agencies ... in a way 
that not only tells the story but gives the user an opportunity to 
see history in its unexpurgated form,'' said APB marketing director 
Dick Lavinthal. 
</P>
<P>
	The file does not include the one-paragraph letter in which  
Agnew formally notified then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger of 
his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the notes made public said Nixon ``expressed his deep  
sense of personal loss'' over the resignation and commended Agnew 
for his ``decision to put the national interest above personal 
considerations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon himself resigned the following August as a result of the  
Watergate affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The file obtained by APB Online contains numerous memos showing  
the FBI constantly pressing to get into the case, but being 
rebuffed by prosecutors who insisted it was ``only a tax matter'' 
for the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	When the FBI was finally called in to conduct polygraph tests on  
witnesses, the results started showing up in newspaper stories -- 
triggering a spate of memos about leaks and an internal inquiry in 
which nine FBI employees denied that they were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter dated Aug. 23, 1973, then-Attorney General Elliot  
Richardson assured an angry Agnew that he was also concerned by 
unauthorized disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be no fully effective means to stop the  
cynical, speculative chain reaction of rumor and hypothesis that 
has been all too evident in recent weeks,'' Richardson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In a court statement at the plea bargain, Richardson said the  
government could have charged Agnew with bribery and extortion, but 
any such case ``would have consumed not simply months, but years -- 
with potentially disastrous consequences to the vital interests of 
the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also urged no jail time in view of Agnew's years of  
public service and his willingness to avoid putting the country 
through the ``prolonged agony'' of a trial.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices End Little Changed / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices finished little changed Friday as  
traders shrugged off the government's report that the unemployment 
rate edged up in June despite unexpectedly strong job growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond finished  
unchanged from Thursday's close with its yield holding at 6.00 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was light, however, and dealings wound down about 3 1/2  
hours earlier than normal as many market participants got a head 
start on the three-day Independence Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported Friday that the unemployment rate  
edged up to 4.3 percent in June from a 29-year low of 4.2 percent 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate rise occurred even though 268,000 jobs were created in  
June, beating the consensus expectation for 200,000 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott Platt, a top economist for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,  
said bond traders also ``were not terribly shaken'' by a 3.7 
percent rise in average hourly earnings, an acceleration from the 
3.5 percent rise in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``People seemed pretty well prepared for that,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Platt noted that the market's muted reaction was due in part to  
the Federal Reserve's suggestion Wednesday as it boosted the rate 
on overnight loans between banks by a quarter percentage point that 
a single rate hike may be all that is needed to curb inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities also ended unchanged  
while intermediate-term issues were up 1/32 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.66 percent as the  
discount rose 0.02 percentage point to 4.54 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.97 percent, as the discount lost 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.78 percent. One-year yields were steady at 5.05 percent 
as the discount held at 4.80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.87 1/2 percent from 6.00 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/8 point to 118 27/32. The average yield 
to maturity held at 5.54 percent, the same as late Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Mentally Disabled Man Killed in Va. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALE CITY, Va. (AP) -- A mentally disabled man was beaten and  
robbed before his attackers bound him and set him on fire, police 
said. His body was spotted by a passing motorist. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Joseph S. Williams, 32, was found burning in a  
wooded area early Thursday. An autopsy will be conducted to 
determine the exact cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
	Danita Corbin, 28, who lives near the scene in northern  
Virginia, and a 17-year-old boy have been charged with murder, 
robbery and abduction, said Prince William County police spokesman 
Kim Chinn. They were being held without bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was not identified because of his age. A preliminary  
hearing was scheduled for Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Williams was acquainted with Ms. Corbin, whose house  
is about three miles from where he lived with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jack Keep of the Evangel Baptist Church said Williams  
recently had asked members of the church to pray for a woman named 
Danita. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had been very concerned about this woman's situation and  
requested prayer for her to the church members,'' Keep said. ``He 
was trying to help her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams's neighbors described him as a gentle person who was  
mildly disabled as a result of injuries suffered in a car accident 
when he was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	``He cared about people. He was interested in people's  
salvation, where they were destined to go when they died,'' said 
neighbor Peggy Kennedy.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Financial Privacy Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to consumers' fears about  
commercial abuse of their privacy, the House voted overwhelmingly 
to give people the right to block banks and other financial 
companies from sharing their personal data with outside firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on the measure, proposed by House Republican leaders,  
was 427-1. It was attached to sweeping legislation that would allow 
banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge. The 
overall bill, which would overturn Depression-era prohibitions on 
the banking industry, was passed late Thursday with a veto-proof 
vote, 343-86, just before the House began its Fourth of July 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are strong new protections for consumer privacy,'' said  
Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, who sponsored the amendment with Rep. 
Deborah Pryce, also an Ohio Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure still would allow banks and other financial  
companies that are affiliated with each other to share customer 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking Committee,  
told reporters that privacy was ``an issue that Congress is going 
to have to continue to examine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lone vote against the privacy measure came from Rep. Ron  
Paul, R-Texas, a physician who once ran for president as the 
Libertarian Party's nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Disgruntled Democrats, who had pushed a stricter privacy  
provision, tried earlier to scuttle the vote on the financial 
overhaul legislation but failed on a party-line, 227-203 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats also objected to a provision in the bill that  
would allow health insurance companies to share medical data with 
life insurers when people apply for life insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed a substantially different version of the  
overhaul legislation in May. The two bills must be blended into one 
by House and Senate negotiators before legislation can be sent to 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We face some very high hurdles, and negotiations will require  
a tremendous effort,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chairman of 
the Senate Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill must benefit consumers by making the broadest array  
of financial services available at the lowest possible price,'' 
Gramm said. ``If it doesn't do that, then it's not worth having.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House supports in principle allowing banks, brokerages  
and insurers to combine, and while it objects to parts of the House 
bill, it has not threatened a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, however, has drawn a Clinton veto threat over  
several issues, including provisions that Democrats view as an 
attack on the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy protection emerged as a key element of the landmark  
legislation to restructure the financial service industry, which 
has come closer to enactment this year than in 20 previous years of 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton recently urged Congress to bolster consumers' rights  
when banks and other financial companies seek to share information 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer activists, including Ralph Nader, have maintained that  
the financial overhaul legislation would create serious privacy 
risks for Americans as banks, brokerages and insurers compiled 
profiles of customers' buying habits, hobbies and health 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	But proponents of the legislation, led by Wall Street and the  
banking and insurance industries, maintain it is needed to keep the 
U.S. financial industry competitive in global markets and that it 
would save consumers millions by providing one-stop financial 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats, led by Reps. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and John  
Dingell, D-Mich., had pushed a provision that would enable 
consumers to stop banks, securities firms and other financial 
companies from sharing their personal data with either affiliated 
or outside companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Commerce Committee, in a surprise move, recently  
adopted the provision. But it was removed from consideration 
Wednesday by the House Republican leadership, which controls the 
rules of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP-backed alternative, preferred by the financial  
industries, would let consumers block companies from selling their 
data to outside firms, such as telemarketers, but not from sharing 
it with affiliated companies under the same corporate parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharing of customer information, such as addresses, phone  
numbers, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and checking and 
credit card account information, is a major reason why financial 
companies want to merge. The data sharing opens numerous 
opportunities for the companies to market their services. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill also would require banks and other financial  
companies to disclose to customers their policies for collecting 
and protecting confidential data. The measure also would make it a 
federal crime for anyone to misrepresent themselves to obtain 
someone's private financial information.

<HEADLINE> HMOs Ax 200,000 Medicare Recipients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 200,000 elderly and disabled Americans  
losing their health care coverage when some HMOs cut off Medicare 
beneficiaries next year need to choose an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	But Medicare officials stress that those affected can stay in  
their health plans until the end of this year and shouldn't rush to 
make a change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would caution them not to act too quickly, to really  
consider their options,'' said Carol Cronin, Medicare's director of 
beneficiary services. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO pullouts from Medicare are expected to affect at least  
200,000 people nationwide next year, according to estimates from 
the American Association of Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs must notify affected beneficiaries individually by mail no  
later than Oct. 1. But many will hear from their health plans 
within the next few weeks, AAHP President Karen Ignagni said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plans are going to do their level best to get them a letter  
very soon,'' Ignagni said. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs faced a July 1 deadline to let Medicare know their  
intentions for 2000, and the government is expected soon to 
complete an official tally of pending closings. Some large health 
plans have announced pullouts from selected markets already, 
including Cigna HealthCare, Pacificare Health Systems, United 
HealthCare and Humana. 
</P>
<P>
	For those looking for another HMO, industry experts recommend  
waiting until fall to shop around. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing HMOs will have to provide service through Dec. 31. More  
importantly, those staying in business have until mid-September to 
notify beneficiaries of changes in their fees or benefit packages 
for 2000. The same financial pressures that have prompted some 
plans to close are expected to lead many others to make such 
changes this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would encourage people not to move too quickly because they  
really need to wait to have a sense of what their alternatives are 
going to be,'' said Howard Drescher, spokesman for Cigna 
HealthCare. 
</P>
<P>
	Those wanting to return to traditional Medicare coverage are  
even more strongly cautioned to stay with their HMOs until Dec. 31. 
That's because special protections allowing them guaranteed access 
to certain Medigap policies -- regardless of pre-existing medical 
conditions -- apply only after the HMO terminates coverage, not if a 
person leaves voluntarily. Medigap policies are for private 
indemnity insurance and are designed to supplement Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	One exception is for those who joined an HMO for the first time  
within the last 12 months: If they quit before the end of the first 
year of HMO enrollment, they are guaranteed re-enrollment in any 
Medigap policy held immediately prior to joining the HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	The anticipated closings in 2000 will mark the second  
consecutive year of upheaval among some of the more than 6 million 
elderly and disabled Americans who, instead of submitting each 
medical bill directly to the government, choose to get their 
Medicare coverage through private managed care health plans that 
receive flat federal payments. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, about 400,000 Medicare beneficiaries in more than 30  
states were affected when about 100 HMOs opted against renewing 
1999 Medicare contracts after lawmakers cut the growth in payments 
to the plans as part of their 1997 agreement to balance the federal 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Retirees and disabled Americans who lose their HMOs are still  
covered by Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever decisions HMOs make about doing business with  
Medicare, Medicare will always be there for every beneficiary,'' 
said Medicare Administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle. 
</P>
<P>
	This fall, Medicare will conduct an education campaign to help  
people understand their choices, including mailing them basic 
information about HMOs still available in each zip code and 
offering more details on the Internet and through a toll-free 
telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
	Those beneficiaries who take no action to change their coverage  
will automatically be re-enrolled in traditional Medicare -- in 
which the government directly handles each medical bill -- on Jan. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many of those affected by health plan closings have  
become accustomed to more comprehensive coverage offered by many 
HMOs. HMO perks often include lower out-of-pocket fees and benefits 
Medicare does not normally cover, such as prescription drugs, 
hearing aids and eye examinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Options to fill these voids include joining another HMO -- in  
most places there will be plans left to choose from -- or buying a 
Medigap policy.

<HEADLINE> Study Reveals Campus Gun Possession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Nearly half a million of the nation's college  
students own guns and those with alcohol problems are twice as 
likely as others to have them, according to a Harvard University 
study released today. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3.5 percent of college students surveyed said they have a  
gun at school, said Dr. Matthew Miller, a researcher at Harvard's 
Injury Research and Control Center. Some 14 million students attend 
two- and four-year colleges in the United States, so that 
percentage would translate to roughly 450,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun possession is significantly more likely among students who  
binge drink and drive, or who damage property after drinking, the 
report said. Binge drinking was defined as having five or more 
drinks at a sitting. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is based on a sample of some 15,000 students at 130  
four-year colleges, and did not account for hunting weapons. The 
results appear in the July issue of The Journal of American College 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The connection is worrisome, said Henry Wechsler, principal  
investigator at Harvard's School of Public Health College Alcohol 
Study. But he cautioned: ``I don't want to give the impression that 
there are thousands of drunk college students shooting people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on a 1997 questionnaire filled out  
anonymously by students. The questionnaire primarily focused on 
alcohol use, but also asked students if they had a working firearm 
at school. 
</P>
<P>
	The results found that 6.4 percent of men students said yes, as  
did 1.5 percent of women students. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun ownership increased to 7 percent among those who said they  
were likely to drink heavily, drive while intoxicated or damage 
property after drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	The study had a margin of error of 1 percentage point.  
</P>
<P>
	Although it's possible some students may have been lying or  
exaggerating, Miller said he takes their answers seriously because 
the forms were anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found gun possession at college was more common  
among whites than among minority groups, and more prevalent among 
students who belonged to fraternities or sororities. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of gun ownership differed by region. Six percent of  
students attending colleges in the South said they had guns, 
compared with 4 percent in the West and 1 percent in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found that two-thirds of the student gun owners  
live off-campus. Although most colleges prohibit guns on campus, 
researchers estimate students keep at least 100,000 guns in the 
nation's dormitories.

<HEADLINE>  Charismatic Improves After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charismatic continues to improve from surgery  
for leg fractures sustained in the Belmont Stakes that could have 
proved fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of severity, and on a scale of one to 10, it was a  
'nine','' said Dr. Celeste Kunz, whose quick reaction help saved 
the life the Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fracture (a condylar fracture of the left front cannon  
bone with an additional fracture to the seasmoid) was dangerously 
displaced,'' she said Friday at news conference at Belmont Park. 
``If it had broken through the skin, the prognosis would have been 
lowered significantly. I fitted the leg with a compression boot 
suitable to the horse's weight and size in order to immobilize 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis and trained by D.  
Wayne Lukas, was retired and will go to stud 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when in the running of the Belmont Stakes June 9 he  
thought the injury occurred, Dr. Stephen Selway, who operated on 
the colt the following day, said his best guess was that it 
happened between the quarter and eighth poles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he carried his head changed and, although his momentum  
carried him on, he seemed to lose his fluidity of motion,'' Selway 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic finished third behind Lemon Drop Kid and Vision and  
Verse in his bid to become the 12th Triple Crown champion and first 
since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Selway credited quick action to ``stabilize Charismatic's  
physiological condition following the injury'' as being of critical 
importance in the horse's survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Chris Antley also helped by dismounting shortly after the  
finish and lifting the injured leg to relieve the weight on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic has responded well to surgery and to continuing  
treatment. He is expected to remain in his stall for another two to 
three months. Complete healing of the fracture is expected to take 
four to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Although horses with somewhat similar injuries have resumed in  
competition, Charismatic's retirement was considered the most 
prudent course to pursue, Selway said, ``to preserve an invaluable 
gene pool.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-NYC Mayor Has Mild Heart Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A moderate heart attack was behind the chest  
pains that sent former New York Mayor Ed Koch to the hospital this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch, 74, was taken to the hospital Thursday. Doctors found he  
had a blocked artery, and performed angioplasty to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch is expected to remain in the hospital for about six more  
days and will restrict his diet, said George Arzt, former press 
secretary to Koch and a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors said the heart attack would not mean any major changes  
in his lifestyle,'' Arzt said Friday. ``He plans to be back in the 
gym in four weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three-term mayor was briefly hospitalized for low blood  
pressure in March. That was the first heart problem he suffered 
since having a pacemaker inserted in 1991. In 1987, he suffered a 
minor stroke.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Lithuania To Go To Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Russia beat Germany 74-70 and Lithuania crushed  
Turkey 80-56 at the European Championships today and both winners 
qualified for next year's Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The top five teams will join Yugoslavia in Sydney. Sixth place  
is enough to qualify because Yugoslavia, which is assured to 
finishing among the top four, had already clinched a trip to 
Australia by winning the world title last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy, Spain and France also qualified by reaching the  
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and Lithuania will play for fifth place, while Germany  
play Turkey for seventh place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians' victory today over Germany was led by Igor  
Koudeline, who scored 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Yevgeny Kissourine came through with a 3-point play and Zakhar  
Pashutin, a guard who had only one point in the first half, made a 
couple of key baskets in the closing minutes to assure the Russian 
victory. The game matched two losing quarterfinalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Two American-based players led Germany. Forward Dirk Nowitzki of  
the Dallas Mavericks had 15 points and forward Ademola Okujala of 
North Carolina had 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Lithuania quickly pulled away against a Turkish team hobbled by  
several injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Arvydas Sabonis, the Portland Trail Blazers center, the  
Lithuanians dominated under the boards and were shooting over 60 
percent as they built up a 32-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabonis had 13 points in 19 minutes. Forward Virginijus  
Praskevicius, who plays league basketball in Turkey, had a 
game-high 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Lithuania was considered a gold-medal contender, but was upset  
by Spain in the quarterfinals.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Eases Restrictions on Marinol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government decision to ease restrictions on  
Marinol, a byproduct of marijuana used to counter symptoms of AIDS 
and side effects of chemotherapy, has unlikely allies: the nation's 
drug czar and proponents of medical marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House Office of National  
Drug Control Policy, said the capsule form of Marinol is the ``safe 
and proper way'' to make components of marijuana available to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	``This action will make Marinol, which is scientifically proven  
to be safe and effective for medical use, more widely available,'' 
McCaffrey said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey's stance was hailed by one marijuana advocate -- albeit  
for different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoff Sugerman, a medical marijuana advocate in Oregon, said  
``Here is more proof that the properties in marijuana really do 
work as medicine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon recently approved the use of marijuana with a doctor's  
consent, an action McCaffrey has opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drug Enforcement Administration reclassified Marinol from a  
``Schedule 2'' drug to the less restrictive ``Schedule 3'' 
category. This essentially means that instead of being classified 
with drugs like morphine, Marinol is now classified with more 
widely used drugs like Codeine. 
</P>
<P>
	Marijuana is classified as a ``Schedule 1'' drug, and thus  
cannot be prescribed by doctors. Activists like Sugerman have 
sought to change that classification. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it (the reclassification) as negating the need to  
reschedule marijuana so doctors can prescribe it to their 
patients,'' Sugerman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of medical marijuana say patients who use it are able  
to get the benefits of dozens of other agents in marijuana that are 
not in Marinol. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey, who has remained staunchly opposed to those efforts,  
said Friday's change by the DEA was the result of ``pure science. 
There's no politics involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marinol is the only agent, or cannabinoid, in marijuana that has  
undergone research and been developed into a prescription drug. 
First brought onto the market in 1985, Marinol has been used to 
treat anorexia and weight loss associated with AIDS and nausea and 
vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	With the change in classification, Marinol can now be prescribed  
by doctors with the possibility of five prescription refills in six 
months. The change also lessens recordkeeping requirements and 
eases distribution restrictions on the drug.

<HEADLINE> Iowa UAW Endorsement Discounted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the United Auto Workers discounted  
an early endorsement of Vice President Al Gore for president by the 
union's Iowa affiliate, saying they didn't speak for the parent 
union ``and nobody should think that they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual rebuke of the Iowa council representing 18,000  
active members by union president Stephen P. Yokich reflected top 
UAW officials' displeasure with the unilateral action as well as 
lingering reticence in labor about the Clinton administration's 
record on trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said the vice president  
was ``working to show the working men and women of the 
international UAW that Al Gore is their candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa UAW endorsed Gore on Sunday, the second show of support  
from organized labor in the key presidential caucus state. The UAW 
event, coming on the heels of an endorsement from Council 61 of the 
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, 
offered Gore important political muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite occasional differences, union leaders have maintained  
friendly relations with the Clinton administration. But former Sen. 
Bill Bradley, Gore's only Democratic challenger, has made inroads 
with many unions, speaking recently to a Teamsters meeting in 
Orlando, Fla., and Service Employees International Union members in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts saw the Iowa endorsements as a sign that labor was  
ready to put aside its differences with the administration, but 
Yokich's statement and the debate among the leaders of other 
national unions showed that differences remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the International Executive Board that is empowered to  
make endorsements for candidates for national office following a 
union-wide process of evaluation,'' Yokich said. ``That process is 
anything but finished at this point in time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich added that the Iowa council members were ``entitled to  
their opinions,'' but ``a group of less than twenty members in Iowa 
does not speak for the International Executive Board of the union 
and no one should think that they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a push by some AFL-CIO union leaders to move ahead  
with an early endorsement of Gore has run into resistance from 
several large unions, according to a half-dozen union officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO executive council was considering whether it should  
make a recommendation on an endorsement when it meets in August. If 
it does, the recommendation would be acted upon by the biennial 
convention in October. 
</P>
<P>
	But several unions, including the UAW, the Teamsters and several  
building trades unions, are angry about Clinton administration 
policies on trade and are reticent to play such a big political 
chit so early. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too soon to say. There's a lot of discussion going on  
right now,'' said AFL-CIO spokeswoman Denise Mitchell, adding that 
August was considered the earliest possible date for action, not a 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said the federation would poll union members over the  
next month to gauge their estimations of the candidates and key 
legislative issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really need to know what members are thinking,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Olympian Boxers Lack Admiration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two things Fernando Vargas and Raul Marquez have  
in common are fights with Yory Boy Campas and Olympic appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Appreciation for each other's abilities is noticeably lacking.  
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps it will increase when they fight July 17 at Caesars  
Tahoe in Stateline, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vargas is taking me lightly; he says `it's the easiest fight  
of my life,''' said the 27-year-old Marquez, a 1992 Olympian, who 
lost the IBF junior middleweight title when he was stopped on cuts 
by Yory Boy Campas in the eighth round Dec. 6, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't take no fighter lightly,'' said the 21-year-old  
Vargas, a 1996 Olympian, who won the IBF 154-pound title when he 
stopped Campas in the seventh round Dec. 12, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But Vargas also said of Marquez, ``He's not an intelligent  
southpaw. Southpaws are usually crafty and hard to hit. He's not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marquez countered by saying, ``The longer it goes, the better  
for me. He doesn't know how to relax. He has average speed and 
decent power. He's got a lot of knockouts but some of those fights 
were stopped kind of early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the Campas who Vargas beat ``wasn't the same guy  
who fought me. The hunger wasn't in him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters are training at Big Bear, Calif., it was from  
there that they were interviewed by telephone Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas (16-0, 16 knockouts), of Oxnard Calif., will be making  
his second defense of the 154-pound title. He has talked a lot 
about fighting WBC welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya, but on 
Friday he said, ``My goal is to unify the junior middleweight 
division, that's all. If he moves up to my division, fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marquez (30-1, 20 knockouts), of Houston, won the title in 1997,  
and he defended it twice before losing to Campas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Campas fight was one I should never taken,'' said Marquez,  
who said he received 70-stitches worth of cuts in his eyebrows 
while outpointing Keith Mullings in a defense Sept. 13, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't trained (for Campas),'' Marquez said. ``In the second  
round my eyes swelled up bad because the cuts hadn't healed well. I 
tried to go for a knockout, but by the eighth round my face was 
messed up, and they stopped the fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he took the Campas fight, Marquez said he got his  
biggest purse because the match was part of a pay-per-view 
doubleheader on which WBC welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya 
outpointed Hector Camacho. 
</P>
<P>
	But there also was the matter of ego.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got a lot of heat from the Mullings fight,'' Marquez said.  
``A lot of people thought I lost.''

<HEADLINE> Conservative Endorses Forbes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative leader Paul Weyrich endorsed  
presidential candidate Steve Forbes on Friday, giving the 
Republican hopeful a boost in his bid to court voters from the 
party's right wing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other candidates appear to be more closely aligned with the  
social issues positions I have taken, but in the end what matters 
is who can deliver on these issues if elected,'' Weyrich said in a 
statement given to The Associated Press. ``I have concluded that 
Forbes is in a better position to deliver than even the most 
ardently committed social conservative candidates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich runs the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative  
Washington think tank. His endorsement gives Forbes' conservative 
campaign a measure of credibility, though it does not come with a 
grass-roots political operation that could translate the backing to 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP candidates --including Gary Bauer, Pat Buchanan and  
New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith -- are competing against Forbes for 
support of social conservatives. Those voters viewed Forbes 
skeptically during his failed 1996 campaign, but he spent the next 
two years shoring up his conservative credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economic and social conservatives are clearly rallying behind  
Forbes to take on the establishment candidate, George W. Bush,'' 
said Forbes spokesman Greg Mueller. The Texas governor is far ahead 
of his GOP rivals in money, endorsements and the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich, who coined the phrase ``moral majority,'' helped make  
social conservatives a force in the Republican Party. He had a hand 
in creating the Heritage Foundation think tank and the Christian 
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich shocked the conservative community in February by  
writing an open letter in which he announced ``politics has 
failed'' and that ``we probably have lost the cultural war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His endorsement of Forbes comes at a time when the conservative  
candidates are vying to emerge as an alternative to the more 
moderate Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it is important that voters in the primary have a  
choice other than George Bush and I believe that Steve Forbes is in 
a position to offer that choice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Forbes loses the nomination and Smith carries out a threat to  
bolt the GOP, Weyrich said he would join ranks with the senator. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm committed to Steve Forbes for the distance, but if the  
Republicans give us the same sort of ticket that we've had over the 
last several elections and if Steve Forbes does not get the 
nomination and if Bob Smith runs as an independent, I will end up 
supporting Bob Smith,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> GTE Sues Five Insurers Over Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- GTE Corp. has sued five insurance companies  
to recover $400 million it says it has to spend to repair and test 
its computers for the transition to the year 2000, in a case that 
tests whether insurers may be held responsible for such expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The telecommunications company sued under three policies it has  
with the Allendale Mutual Insurance Co. of Johnston, R.I., from 
1996 to 2000. The primary policy covered ``destruction, distortion 
or corruption of any computer data, coding, program or software,'' 
and obligates GTE to ``sue, labor and travel'' if necessary to 
protect its property. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract also said Allendale would contribute to expenses  
GTE incurred for those efforts, according to the lawsuit filed June 
18 in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The four other insurers that negotiated contracts with identical  
language are Affiliated FM Insurance, the Allianz Insurance Co., 
the Federal Insurance Co. and Industrial Risk Insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurers have until July 18 to file their initial response.  
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits like GTE's are not addressed in the year 2000 liability  
legislation agreed upon Thursday by Congress, which focuses on 
limiting lawsuits against vendors over defective products and on 
potential lawsuits against computer owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Consultants told The New York Times in Friday's editions that  
insurers have paid some claims for year 2000 repairs to avoid 
lawsuits like GTE's. Estimates of the insurance industry's 
potential liability for Y2K problems have varied widely. A recent 
study estimated the costs could run from $15 billion to $35 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Lamar Alexander Promotes Tax Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEREDITH, N.H. (AP) -- Lamar Alexander said Friday that his  
Republican presidential rivals may have raised more money than he 
has, but he is doing what really matters -- talking to voters on a 
personal level about issues important to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander met with small-business owners to promote the tax  
reforms that are central to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, he took aim at the Republican front-runner,  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, lagging in the polls and in fund raising, said  
there's no evidence Bush, ``a one-time governor,'' is ready to be 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was elected last year to his second term as governor of  
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, a former two-term governor of Tennessee and a  
one-time U.S. secretary of education, said the Texas governorship 
``is largely a ceremonial position. It's the weakest governorship 
in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to be president,'' he said. ``He's completely  
untested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In California this week, Bush defended himself against criticism  
about his qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in positions where I've made decisions in my life,''  
he said. ``I know how to decide things, and I also know how to 
bring people together. I don't know how I know how to do it, I just 
know how to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander spoke two days after Bush disclosed raising a record  
$36.25 million in the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the $2 million that Alexander reported raising was  
about $500,000 short of what aides said last month they expected 
and less than half of what they had hoped to raise by now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush and Mr. (Steve) Forbes have won the money  
primary. I'm going to try to win the New Hampshire primary,'' 
Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Bush) has got his chartered jet named Great Expectations,  
I've got a borrowed bus named Exceeding Expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander was in Meredith to listen to the concerns of the  
business owners, principally about heavy taxes and burdensome 
regulations. He wants to triple tax deductions for dependent 
children to $8,000, abolish inheritance taxes and reduce capital 
gains and income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said government regulations on business should expire  
periodically so lawmakers would be forced to determine whether they 
were justified. Now, regulations just pile up on each other, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Alexander's comments resonated with his audience.  
Several took campaign bumper stickers and the group surprised him 
with an early birthday cake. Alexander turns 59 on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Rig Count Soars By 17 / Oil and Gas Rig Count  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of oil and gas rigs operating  
nationwide rose by 17 to 580 this week, Baker Hughes Inc. said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rigs running nationwide this week, 112 were exploring for  
oil, 467 for gas and one was listed as miscellaneous. During the 
same week last year, 812 rigs were operating in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally  
peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil 
boom. It has set several record lows this year, bottoming out at 
498 on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	However, soaring oil prices this year have touched off a new  
surge in activity. The rig count has increased eight times in the 
past 11 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, the Texas count rose  
by 13, New Mexico gained four, Wyoming's tally rose by three and 
California added one. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska, Louisiana and Oklahoma lost one rig each.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid To Pay $1.1M in Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp., the nation's  
third-largest drugstore chain, will pay $1.1 million in fines to 
settle a lawsuit that claimed its stores sold expired condoms, 
infant formula and other products. 
</P>
<P>
	The chain also agreed to post notices at its 640 California  
stores telling customers who had purchased expired goods that they 
could be reimbursed or given replacements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to do our utmost to ensure the integrity of  
our products,'' the Camp Hill, Pa.-based company said Friday in a 
statement. ``Selling expired merchandise is not something that Rite 
Aid, or any retailer, would knowingly allow to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	District attorneys from three California counties and one city  
filed the suit last month, after investigators found more than 200 
outdated products in about 50 of the chain's stores in California. 
Some of the condoms were four years past their expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had no reports of infants falling ill from outdated  
products, but they cautioned that formulas lose their nutritional 
value over time, and that condoms and spermicides lose their 
effectiveness after their expiration dates pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid said its policy had always been to pull items off  
shelves 30 days before they expire; after the investigators' 
disclosure, that was changed to 60 days.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record High 11,139.24 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose to new records today as a strong  
employment report fed investors' enthusiasm and capped a week of 
extraordinary strength on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading, the Dow was up 72.82 at 11,139.24,  
easily topping its previous record close of 11,107.19, set May 13. 
The Dow rose 586.68 points for the week, a gain of more than 5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also moved higher.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose as the Labor Department said American businesses  
created a total of 268,000 new jobs in June, with all industries 
except manufacturing and mining posting solid gains. The increase 
in jobs was slightly stronger than economists expected, and average 
hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, increased by 
3.7 percent in June compared to a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In a less buoyant market, the report could have punctured  
investors' enthusiasm. Higher wages can drag earnings down because 
labor costs account for most of consumer prices. They also raise 
the specter of another increase in interest rates following this 
week's modest hike by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bond market, which often sets the tone for stocks, was  
unmoved by the jump in wages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The markets blew right past it,'' said Ricky Harrington,  
technical analyst with Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. The 
yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond remained steady at 6.0 
percent, setting the stage for a sixth consecutive gain in the 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington said investors continue to welcome strong economic  
news, discounting the fact that it could translate into inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage, we've got strong momentum and a real mania for  
stocks,'' he said. ``It would take awfully bad news to change 
investor psychology and turn them away from this market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclical stocks, which perform best during times of economic  
expansion, led the Dow today. International Paper and Minnesota 
Mining and Manufacturing rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks contributed to gains on the Nasdaq, with  
industry leaders Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems up strongly. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller &AMP; Washington, a  
Washington, D.C.-based financial consulting firm, said he believes 
the market gained enough support from the Fed's moderate 
interest-rate increase to rise still higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has endured several bouts of fear,'' he said.  
``Each one has tested the resolve of the bull market. But every one 
has been for emotional reasons, not for rational ones.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Moves Above Record High Close / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
		   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks pushed higher today, lifting the Dow  
Jones industrial average and other market barometers into record 
territory as investors responded to a strong government jobs 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow was up 44.32 at 11,110.74, just  
above its May 13 record close of 11,107.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also moved higher.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 5.72 to 1,386.68, and the  
Nasdaq composite index rose 20.82 to 2,727.08. Both indexes set 
closing highs on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose as a government jobs report showed a healthy labor  
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that employment at American  
businesses accelerated sharply last month with a total of 268,000 
new jobs created with all industries except manufacturing and 
mining posting solid gains. The increase in jobs was slightly 
stronger than economists expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,  
increased by 3.7 percent in June, compared to a year ago. Higher 
wages can drag earnings down because labor costs account for most 
of consumer prices. They also raise the specter of another increase 
in interest rates following this week's modest hike by the Federal 
Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bond market, which often sets the tone for stocks, was  
unmoved by the jump in wages, as the yield on the benchmark 30-year 
Treasury bond remained steady at 6.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobs report also found unemployment rates remained near  
their historic lows during June. The jobless rate edged up 0.1 
percent to 4.3 percent as U.S. factories continued to shed jobs. It 
still remains near the lowest levels in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	International Paper, up 1 3/4 at 51 1/2 and Minnesota Mining and  
Manufacturing, 1 3/8 at 88 9/16, led the Dow higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks fed gains on the Nasdaq, with Cisco Systems up  
1 3/4 at 66 1/8 and Sun Microsystems up 2 3/16 at 70 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 290.44 million 
shares, down from Thursday's pace. Volume was light ahead of the 
three-day Independence Day weekend. U.S. Markets will be closed 
Monday in observance of the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.84 at 653.17, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 7.57 at 802.52.

<HEADLINE> Boardwalks No Longer All Wood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRING LAKE, N.J. (AP) -- For a growing number of shore towns,  
the boardwalk is no longer made of boards. Synthetic materials, 
asphalt or decorative paving stones are slowly replacing wood. 
</P>
<P>
	Shore towns say the alternative materials last longer and are  
safer. But they also cost more, and not everyone likes 1990s 
technology on walkways that have been around since the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got some adverse comments from purists who felt it was the  
equivalent of a plastic Christmas tree,'' said Belmar Mayor Kenneth 
Pringle, whose borough has replaced about a third of a mile of its 
boardwalk with planks made of a polymer called Trex. 
</P>
<P>
	Spring Lake, Belmar's neighbor to the south, also replaced much  
of its wooden boardwalk with Trex. 
</P>
<P>
	``I prefer the wood,'' said Patrick Martin, a regular walker on  
the Spring Lake boardwalk. ``Wood looks better. It just looks like 
a boardwalk. This looks, well, plastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very hot to walk on in bare feet,'' said jogger Monica  
Giunco. ``But it does have more give to it, and you don't get 
splinters if you're barefoot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maureen Murray, a spokeswoman for the Winchester, Va.-based Trex  
Co., said the synthetic boards are designed to withstand the 
corrosive effects of rain and salt air and provide a safe walk or 
jog. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's extremely weather-resistant, and it's perfect for the  
oceanside,'' she said. ``It has millions of tourists walking on it, 
so it has to be durable. And mayors in these shore towns have 
liability issues with people getting injured on splinters and nails 
popping up. This takes care of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the technology has been around for years, alternative  
boardwalk materials started catching on at the Jersey shore after a 
December 1992 storm ripped up boardwalks up and down the coast.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Face Brazil in Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Brazil vs. the United States. Fourth of  
July. Stanford, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Again.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the two nations met at Stanford Stadium in the men's  
World Cup. Brazil won 1-0 and went on to win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, the same countries, the same venue and the  
same red-white-and-blue date are the setting for Sunday's semifinal 
in the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Only this time, the United States will be the favorite.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every game is a different story. Sometimes the same story  
repeats,'' Brazilian coach Wilson de Oliveira said. ``We hope this 
story repeats. We have a dream. If we can emulate what happened in 
this stadium five years ago, our dream will come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams advanced with one-goal victories Thursday night. With  
President Clinton and his family among the 54,642 fans at Jack Kent 
Cooke Stadium, defenders Brandi Chastain and Joy Fawcett scored off 
corner kicks to rally the U.S. team from a 2-1 halftime deficit in 
a 3-2 victory over Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we'll have to play better against Brazil,'' said coach  
Tony DiCicco, whose team overcame its first real test after winning 
its three first-round games by a combined scored of 13-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil blew a 3-0 halftime lead against Nigeria before Sissi  
scored the first sudden-death overtime goal in Women's World Cup 
history. The midfielder's 22-yard free kick, her tournament-high 
seventh goal, won the game 4-3 in the 104th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the game I turned into an old man,'' de Oliveira said.  
``But after the game I became a young man again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results mean all four teams have qualified for the 2000  
Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The doubleheader was evidence of the unexpected surge in  
popularity of the biggest all-women's sports event ever. Extra 
seats were made available to meet demand, and the crowd was late 
arriving because of a 20-mile backup to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, also arriving late, watched the second half of the  
U.S.-Germany match from a luxury box with wife Hillary, daughter 
Chelsea, two of Chelsea's friends and Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
	After the match, the presidential party met the U.S. team in the  
locker room. The players chanted ``Clinton'' as he posed for a 
group picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us what an inspiration the team was, coming from  
behind,'' midfielder Julie Foudy said. ``I told him thanks for 
coming, it makes a ton of difference for this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Down 2-1, the Americans tied the score in the 49th minute when  
Chastain volleyed in Mia Hamm's corner kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Fawcett, who almost never joins the attack -- she had 18 goals in  
140 international games heading into the World Cup -- scored the 
game-winner in the 66th when she was positioned perfectly for a 
side header past the outstretched arm of goalkeeper Silke 
Rottenberg. The corner kick came from Shannon MacMillan, who had 
entered the game seconds earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	As it has the whole tournament, the U.S. team came out sloppy.  
Chastain, who later would sustain a mile ankle sprain, played a 
loose ball back to goalkeeper Briana Scurry. Scurry wasn't 
expecting it, and the result was an own goal for Germany in the 
fifth minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffeny Milbrett's low shot tied the game in the 16th minute,  
but Germany regained the lead in injury time when Bettina Wiegmann 
made a move around Cindy Parlow and sent a 22-yard rocket into the 
top left corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	That prompted an urgent halftime talk from U.S. captain Carla  
Overbeck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carla said that everything we done in this lifetime comes down  
to these 45 minutes,'' Foudy said. ``We had 45 minutes to make a 
difference. That's it and we had to leave everything on the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second game, Sissi played a part in all four Brazilian  
goals. Her free kick started a sequence that led to Cidinha's score 
in the fourth minute, and her chip from the corner of the penalty 
box was headed home by Cidinha at the far post in the 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
	Sissi then played the ball to Nene for a 40-yard chip that  
sailed over goalkeeper Ann Chiejine's head from the right flank in 
the 35th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria rallied with goals from Prisca Emeafu, Nkiru Okosieme  
and Nkechi Egbe before Sissi's ``Golden Goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, Sissi is the queen of soccer,'' de Oliveira said.

<HEADLINE> Shipbuilder Hit With More Citations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Navy shipbuilder Avondale Industries Inc. was  
hit Friday with federal citations and $180,000 in proposed 
penalties for improperly maintaining worker illness and injury 
records at its shipyard 
</P>
<P>
	The citations were the second set of alleged safety violations  
issued by Occupational Safety and Health Administration as part of 
its eight-month investigation of Avondale stemming from union 
complaints that the yard is peppered with safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Metal Trades Council has been involved in a years-long fight  
to represent Avondale workers. 
</P>
<P>
	OSHA said the citations were for three willful violations:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The agency said it found more than 700 cases of improper  
recording of injuries and illnesses when it reviewed a random 
sample of almost 3,500 employee medical files. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Avondale did not provide required supplementary records for  
injuries and illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The company did not provide OSHA access to employee medical  
records. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not merely a 'paperwork' violation,'' said U.S. Labor  
Secretary Alexis M. Herman. ``Accurate records of injuries and 
illnesses are necessary to pinpoint hazards causing injuries and 
illnesses and to correct them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in a statement, Avondale said it believes the inspection  
demonstrated that its record-keeping system is ``99 percent'' 
accurate and blamed the dispute with OSHA over a difference of 
interpreting federal guidelines over record-keeping. The company 
earlier said the disputed medical records involved contract workers 
and are private documents maintained by contract workers' 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, OSHA issued 60 safety citations and proposed $537,000  
in fines against the company for alleged violations including 
faulty scaffolding, unsafe guard rails, open holes and other 
dangerous conditions. Avondale has appealed those citations, saying 
inspectors conducted a biased investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale has agreed to be acquired by Litton Industries Inc. for  
$529 million. Avondale stockholders are now voting on the deal and 
the results are expected to be announced on July 29.

<HEADLINE> Special Olympian Dies in His Sleep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARY, N.C. (AP) -- A 14-year-old Special Olympian from Egypt died  
in his sleep, probably from an epileptic seizure, said officials of 
the Special Olympics World Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohamed Abdul Baset Barin, a volleyball player, was pronounced  
dead Thursday after his coach called paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is tragic, it is saddening, but it was also, sadly,  
unavoidable,'' said Tim Shriver, president of Special Olympics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy performed Thursday by the state medical examiner's  
office suggested Barin's death was related to epilepsy. But since 
he died in his sleep, examiners were not certain, said Dr. Tim 
Taft, chairman of a medical advisory committee for the games. Taft 
said Barin was taking medication for his disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know he had an underlying seizure disorder,'' Taft said.  
``That is the most likely explanation for what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Freddoso, chief executive of the Games Organizing Committee,  
said Barin watched volleyball competition Wednesday night before 
returning to his room on the University of North Carolina campus in 
Chapel Hill. He could not be awakened. 
</P>
<P>
	The death is the second at the 10th Special Olympics World  
Summer Games, which opened last Saturday and will end Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A volunteer died of a heart attack after completing his shift at  
the opening ceremonies. And four athletes -- two each from the 
Dominican Republic and Morocco -- were missing after leaving their 
delegations. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the two from Morocco was found in good condition Thursday  
night in Washington, D.C. Authorities don't suspect foul play with 
the missing athletes, who are described as highly functional 
mentally retarded men. 
</P>
<P>
	About 7,000 athletes from more than 150 countries are  
participating in the games.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees claimed infielder Jeff  
Manto off waivers Friday and added him to their 40-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Manto, 34, appeared in 12 games for the Cleveland Indians this  
season and was 5-for-25 with one homer and two RBIs. In 48 games at 
Triple-A Buffalo, Manto batted .322 with 16 homers and 34 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	In parts of eight major league seasons, Manto has a .227 average  
with 30 homers and 92 RBIs. He has played with Cleveland, 
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Manto originally was selected by the Yankees in the 35th round  
of the 1982 draft but did not sign. He was drafted by the Angels in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Manto, who will be added to the 25-man active roster when he  
reports, is expected to arrive before Saturday's game against 
Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> NATO Arrests Yugoslav Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- American peacekeeping forces  
arrested five Yugoslav army soldiers and Dutch peacekeepers took 
six suspected members of the Serbian Interior Ministry police into 
custody inside Kosovo in violation of a troop-pullout agreement, 
NATO said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The five soldiers, all in uniform and carrying Kalashnikov  
assault rifles, were caught Thursday by U.S. troops in the sector 
assigned to Americans in southeastern Kosovo, said Maj. Jan 
Joosten, a spokesman for the NATO mission in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the soldiers, who were detained near Kosovo's provincial  
boundary with the rest of Serbia, claimed to be part of a border 
security force. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement between Yugoslavia and NATO that ended the  
78-day allied air war, all Yugoslav soldiers and police are 
supposed to be outside a 3-mile-wide buffer zone along Kosovo's 
provincial border. 
</P>
<P>
	Joosten said NATO commanders in Kosovo had requested an  
explanation from the Yugoslav federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate incident, Joosten said NATO troops detained six  
suspected Serbian special police found with weapons, computers and 
radio equipment in a building in Urosevac, 20 miles south of 
Pristina, the provincial capital. 
</P>
<P>
	He said peacekeepers went to the building after receiving  
information that radio signals were being sent from the location. 
The suspects were not wearing police uniforms, Joosten said. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidents were disclosed a day after the commander of U.S.  
peacekeepers in Kosovo warned that soldiers still face a threat 
from Serb paramilitaries who remain in the province in violation of 
the peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dangerous environment out there,'' U.S. Brig. Gen. John  
Craddock said. ``This is not going to be a quick fix. There are 
still too many acts of violence. There are still too many homes 
burning at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American troops came under sniper fire twice last week but  
suffered no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO supreme commander, also  
has expressed concern about paramilitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a number of locations, it is clear that Serb  
paramilitaries, some with connections with intelligence 
organizations, and others have remained behind,'' Clark said, 
adding they might form ``the seeds for future conflict, to contest 
control of the province.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, meanwhile, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic  
won conditional support Thursday from a key opposition group, but 
others were stepping up the pressure with an anti-government rally 
planned tonight in Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with calls for his resignation and a deepening economic  
and social crisis, the hard-line president has been trying to 
placate various political groups in an effort to outmaneuver his 
opponents, stay in power and avoid war crimes prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	A major pro-democracy party, the Serbian Renewal Movement,  
indicated it was interested in joining the government if it was 
broadened to include Milosevic opponents in Montenegro, the smaller 
of the two Yugoslav republics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montenegro groups, however, have indicated that they have no  
intention of joining Milosevic's government. 
</P>
<P>
	The influential leader of the extremist Serbian Radical Party,  
Vojislav Seselj, said a coalition government is ``necessary in 
order to prevent U.S. intentions to further break up Yugoslavia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ivica Dacic, spokesman for Milosevic's Socialist party, called  
Thursday for a new government to include all parliamentary parties 
-- except the Alliance for Change. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, about 10,000 Alliance supporters rallied to demand  
Milosevic's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	The League of Vojvodina's Social Democrats and Reformist  
Democratic Party scheduled an anti-government rally later today in 
Novi Sad. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent Beta news agency said police detained four  
people Thursday for distributing anti-government leaflets in Novi 
Sad. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic and four top lieutenants have been indicted by the  
U.N. war crimes tribunal for atrocities committed against the 
ethnic Albanian majority in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province. Some 
860,000 ethnic Albanians fled Kosovo beginning in March; about half 
have since returned. 
</P>
<P>
	A military court, meanwhile, began a criminal investigation  
against one of the Alliance leaders, Zoran Djindjic, for failing to 
respond to a draft notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The criminal proceedings will not prevent Djindjic from  
returning home. We expect him here next week,'' the party's deputy 
leader, Zoran Zivkovic, told reporters today in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the military investigation, a civil court also has  
launched a legal proceeding against Djindjic on charges of failing 
to inform authorities about a change of residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Djindjic fled to Montenegro, Serbia's smaller partner in the  
Yugoslav federation, at the beginning of the NATO airstrikes. 
Military authorities in Belgrade then tried to serve him with a 
draft notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a political process constructed on lies,'' Djindjic's  
lawyer Strahinja Kastratovic said, adding that the defense has not 
been allowed access to the court documents in the case.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Lithuania To Go To Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Russia beat Germany 74-70 and Lithuania crushed  
Turkey 80-56 at the European Championships today and both winners 
qualified for next year's Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The top five teams will join Yugoslavia in Sydney. Sixth place  
is enough to qualify because Yugoslavia, which is assured to 
finishing among the top four, had already clinched a trip to 
Australia by winning the world title last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy, Spain and France also qualified by reaching the  
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and Lithuania will play for fifth place, while Germany  
play Turkey for seventh place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians' victory today over Germany was led by Igor  
Koudeline, who scored 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Yevgeny Kissourine came through with a 3-point play and Zakhar  
Pashutin, a guard who had only one point in the first half, made a 
couple of key baskets in the closing minutes to assure the Russian 
victory. The game matched two losing quarterfinalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Two American-based players led Germany. Forward Dirk Nowitzki of  
the Dallas Mavericks had 15 points and forward Ademola Okujala of 
North Carolina had 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Lithuania quickly pulled away against a Turkish team hobbled by  
several injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Arvydas Sabonis, the Portland Trail Blazers center, the  
Lithuanians dominated under the boards and were shooting over 60 
percent as they built up a 32-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabonis had 13 points in 19 minutes. Forward Virginijus  
Praskevicius, who plays league basketball in Turkey, had a 
game-high 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Lithuania was considered a gold-medal contender, but was upset  
by Spain in the quarterfinals.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Vs. U.S. in Women's Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Here we go again, sort of.  
</P>
<P>
	Brazil vs. the United States. The Fourth of July. Stanford  
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the most anticipated soccer game in America since,  
well, Brazil vs. the United States on the Fourth of July at 
Stanford Stadium in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	That, of course, was in the men's World Cup, where Brazil was a  
heavy favorite to beat the hosts and go on to win its fourth title. 
That's just what the Brazilians did, taking the Americans 1-0 in 
the quarterfinals on their way to the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the American team that carries the burden of being  
the strong favorite, and the game is a semifinal in the Women's 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans survived their toughest test so far, beating  
Germany 3-2 on Thursday. Then Brazil endured a collapse, blowing a 
3-0 lead before winning 4-3 in overtime against Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to play better against Brazil than we did against  
Germany,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said. ``We'll have to be very 
good to get into the final. Brazil is not an easy team. It will be 
a hard game, with hard tackles, but it will be a game of skill and 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Brazilians are very resilient, as they showed against  
Nigeria. We are stepping up to a higher level now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, maybe Brazil should feel that way. The Brazilians were  
dragging in the second half against Nigeria and advanced only 
because their star, Sissi, was accurate on a free kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware of the significance of the date,'' Sissi said after  
scoring her tournament-leading seventh goal. ``I only hope we can 
achieve the same results as the men did. We're going to shoot for 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers hope for a sellout in the Independence Day game.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere we go we have a great following, and this has been  
so spectacular,'' co-captain Julie Foudy said. ``We come out into 
the stadium and it's just, like, our game. It's a women's event. 
It's just our event. I think that is so encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American women also should be encouraged by their response  
to their first true adversity of the tournament. After an 
embarrassing mistake by Brandi Chastain handed Germany a goal in 
the first five minutes, the U.S. team rallied. Then the Germans 
scored in extra time of the first half, but the Americans came back 
with two goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just kind of nervous,'' said Tiffeny Milbrett,  
probably the best U.S. performer in the quarterfinals. ``If you go 
down a goal against a world-class team like Germany, you don't know 
if you can come back up. We just had to make sure not to 
hyperventilate, not to stress out after that goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All four teams in the quarterfinals at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium  
qualified for the 2000 Olympics. So did China and Norway, which 
meet in Sunday's other semifinal, at Foxboro, Mass., and Sweden, 
beaten by Norway in the quarters. The eighth qualifier for Sydney 
will be host Australia, which bumps quarterfinal loser Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	While the United States is favored over Brazil -- how strange  
does that sound in soccer? -- Norway vs. China is a tossup. Both 
looked good in the first round and even better in the second. 
Norway is the defending champion and China has had a better 1999 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're 100 percent sure we'll advance to the final,'' China's  
Pu Wei said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have great confidence in our abilities,'' added Norway  
coach Per-Mathias Hogmo. 
</P>
<P>
	The semifinal winners meet July 10 at the Rose Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank: N.Y., London Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The 5,500 layoffs resulting from  
Deutsche Bank's takeover of Bankers Trust will come mainly in New 
York and London -- places where the two banks had overlapping 
trading operations, Deutsche Bank said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs will be split ``about 50-50'' between the two  
cities, bank spokesman Dierk Hartwig said. None of the layoffs will 
be in Germany because Bankers Trust ``had no presence in Germany'' 
before the merger, hence there is no overlapping, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	In a radio interview Friday, chairman Rolf Breuer said both  
Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust employees will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5,500 job cuts, which have already begun, represent almost 6  
percent of the current workforce of 96,000 employees in the merged 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger of Germany's biggest bank and Bankers Trust, the  
eighth largest bank in the United States, was completed last month. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Aversion to Movie Violence Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Movie violence has been intensely debated  
since the school shootings in Colorado this spring, and a murder 
that the killers told police was inspired by the movie ``Scream'' 
is likely to heat things up even more. 
</P>
<P>
	But in general, Americans don't seem to be as upset by violent  
movies as they were a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	An Associated Press poll, taken in the midst of a debate over  
the impact of violent movies and television programs on young 
people, found that 40 percent of adults said they would be less 
likely to see a movie if they knew it contained violence. That's 20 
points lower than the percentage who answered the same question the 
same way a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In the poll, conducted by ICR of Media, Pa., only one-third of  
respondents said violence is the biggest problem with current 
movies, about the same percentage who said tickets cost too much. 
An additional 17 percent said movies aren't as good as they used to 
be, and 13 percent said there is too much sex on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``People these days don't see too much wrong with the violence  
in movies,'' said Joan Hogue, a recent retiree from Denver. ``They 
are getting desensitized to all that stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stacy Cortez, a 22-year-old student from Las Vegas, said movie  
violence doesn't bother her ``because it's all fake.'' But she said 
young people should be kept away from movies with sex ``because 
they see how to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Movie violence became a hot issue after the school shootings in  
Littleton, Colo., in April in which two teen-agers killed 13 
people, then themselves. Several measures designed to curb movie 
violence were introduced in Congress but have not been adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	Theater owners pledged this month to check IDs to prevent  
youngsters from seeing R-rated movies. In the poll, 52 percent said 
the inspections would be fairly effective or very effective, while 
45 percent said they would be not very effective or not effective 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who doubt that the restrictions will help shield young  
people from violent movies point to the easy access to videos, the 
use of fake IDs and the ability to switch movies after they enter a 
complex showing several films. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Hansen, a teacher in Champaign, Ill., for emotionally  
disturbed children, said she hears children as young as 5 years old 
talk about seeing violent films. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't seen `Bambi,' but they've seen `Scream,' `Scream  
II' and `Chuckie' (the film ``Child's Play,'' about a violent 
doll),'' she said. ``These kids don't go to the movies. They watch 
the movies on video at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a case certain to interject more heated debate on movie  
violence, two teen cousins were convicted this week in Los Angeles 
for the stabbing of one's mother in an attack the boys said was 
inspired by the ``Scream'' movies. Those movies are about a killer 
in a Grim Reaper costume who kills teens with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the poll, women and older Americans were less  
likely to see a movie if they knew it contained violence. Almost 
half of the women surveyed fell into the category, compared to 30 
percent of the men. Two-thirds of those over 65 said violence would 
probably keep them from seeing a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also found:  
</P>
<P>
	--Whites, 42 percent, were more likely than blacks, 28 percent,  
to say violent content might keep them away from a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	--Women were twice as likely as men to say hearing about nude  
scenes might keep them from seeing a particular movie. People over 
65 were three times as likely as those under 35 to stay away 
because of nudity. 
</P>
<P>
	--People who have gone to only a couple of movies this year were  
three times as likely to be troubled by movie violence as those who 
have seen more than 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 1,005 adults was taken Friday through  
Tuesday. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Fired Producer Sues CNN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A television producer fired by the Cable News  
Network after it retracted a story alleging U.S. forces used nerve 
gas on American defectors is suing CNN, seeking $106 million in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit filed Thursday by April Oliver in state court also  
names CNN's parent company, Time Warner Inc. The suit is similar to 
one Ms. Oliver filed in May in the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Neeli Ben-David, said her employment agreement  
specified that any suit be filed in Atlanta, where CNN is based. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit claims Ms. Oliver was wrongly dismissed and alleges  
defamation, intentional interference with contract, intentional 
infliction of emotional distress, fraud and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit requests $6 million in actual damages and $100 million  
in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about Ms. Oliver's allegations, CNN has said it does  
not comment on pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The June 7, 1998, report accused the military of using sarin gas  
in Laos during the Vietnam War. Two U.S. defectors were supposedly 
killed in the attack. CNN retracted the story after its 
investigation concluded that the network could not support the 
report's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN also fired another producer, while a third producer  
resigned. Peter Arnett, the story's lead reporter, was reprimanded 
and ultimately left the network because of the report.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Killing Sick Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEBRON, Neb. (AP) -- A man who believed his wife was terminally  
ill with cancer and shot her to death to relieve her pain was 
sentenced Friday to at least two years in prison. An autopsy, 
however, revealed she died cancer-free. 
</P>
<P>
	Vernal ``Bob'' Ohlrich, 77, had pleaded no contest to  
manslaughter and was sentenced to between two years and three and 
one-third years. He will be eligible for parole in a year. He could 
have been sentenced to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohlrich told the judge that he killed his wife of 57 years in  
October because a doctor had diagnosed her with colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had pain, pain, pain,'' he wept. ``She wanted to die.''  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors did not dispute that Mrs. Ohlrich was in a lot of  
pain, but they argued that it may have been from a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy of 74-year-old Phyllis Ohlrich's body found she did  
not have cancer when she was killed. Ohlrich's attorney disputed 
the autopsy results during the sentencing hearing, but showed no 
medical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Timothy Sullivan, who treated Mrs. Ohlrich before her death,  
said all of his examinations showed the woman was suffering from 
colon cancer. However, he said he could not disagree with an 
autopsy that found no evidence of disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Matthias Okoye, the pathologist who performed Mrs. Ohlrich's  
autopsy, said he even asked for a second opinion about not 
detecting cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt in my mind there was no cancer in her body at  
that time,'' said Okoye. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Merrkatz, a nurse who was on duty the day Mrs. Ohlrich  
was killed, testified that Mrs. Ohlrich was in pain -- but it was 
not constant. Ms. Merrkatz said Mrs. Ohlrich never told her she 
wanted to die. 
</P>
<P>
	After shooting his wife, Ohlrich laid the gun on a nurses'  
counter and told one of them to check on Mrs. Ohlrich. He said he 
had put the gun to his own temple after shooting his wife, but it 
jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's only daughter, Annette, said she thought her father  
performed an unselfish act and ``is not a criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's stronger than I am,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Bald Eagle Soon Off Endangered List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Once near extinction, the American bald eagle  
is ``now back from the brink, thriving in virtually every state of 
the union,'' President Clinton declared today at a White House 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced a proposal to remove the majestic bird from  
the endangered species list after a three decade effort to protect 
it. A final decision is expected in July 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to think of a better way to celebrate the birth of a  
nation than to celebrate the rebirth of our national symbol,'' the 
president said on the eve of the Independence Day weekend. ``The 
return of the bald eagle is a fitting cap to a century of 
environmental stewardship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On stage with Clinton was ``Challenger,'' a 10-year-old male  
bald eagle cared for by the National Foundation to Protect 
America's Eagles. ``Challenger'' was blown from a wild nest as a 
baby and experienced too much human contact at a young age to be 
able to survive in the wild. The bird screeched during the 
president's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe it or not,'' Clinton said, ``Ben Franklin wanted our  
national symbol to be a turkey. The press would be having a field 
day with that to the present day, wouldn't they?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even when removed from the endangered species list, the bald  
eagle will be protected by two laws: the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 
which prohibits the taking, killing, possession, transportation and 
importation of migratory birds, and the Bald and Golden Eagle 
Protection Act, which bans the taking, possession, transportation, 
export and import of a bald or golden eagle, alive or dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The bald eagle, named America's national bird by the Continental  
Congress in 1782, once thrived, with as many as a half million 
eagles soaring the skies of North America. But by 1963, only 417 
breeding pairs remained in the lower 48 states as a result of 
hunting, loss of prey and habitat and the widespread use of the 
pesticide DDT. 
</P>
<P>
	With the banning of DDT in 1972 and the passage of the  
Endangered Species Act a year later, the bald eagle began making a 
dramatic recovery. Today, there are 5,800 breeding pairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used today's ceremony to call on Congress to approve his  
Lands Legacy initiative, which would provide permanent funding of 
at least $1 billion a year to protect wildlife habitat, farms, 
urban parks and natural treasures across America. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, with recovery well under way, the eagle was  
upgraded from endangered to threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, I am pleased to announce that the U.S. Fish and  
Wildlife Service is taking the first step to remove the American 
bald eagle from the endangered species list,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing that the eagle  
be declared fully recovered, with final action due in one year to 
remove it from federal protection under the Endangered Species Act.

<HEADLINE> Study: Fewer People Getting Married </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Marriage has weakened as an institution in  
the United States, with fewer people saying ``I do'' than at any 
time in the nation's history, according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, fewer people who tie the knot report being ``very  
happy'' in their marriages, according to the study released 
yesterday by the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, ``The State of Our Unions: The Social Health of  
Marriage in America,'' found that the national marriage rate has 
dropped 43 percent over the past four decades to its lowest point 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The study reviewed statistics on marriage and divorce from the  
last four decades to find out how many people were getting married, 
at what age and how many of those marriages lasted. It also based 
some conclusions on interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers blamed the declining trend on more couples opting  
for alternatives such as living together outside of marriage or 
putting off the vows until later in life. 
</P>
<P>
	David Popenoe, a Rutgers sociologist who was co-author of the  
study, is concerned that the downward trend will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm worried most because of the teen-agers,'' Popenoe said.  
``With the breakdown of the family, peer culture, which includes 
pop culture, has gotten stronger. Nothing could be more 
anti-marriage than much of popular culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before declining slightly in recent years, the nationwide  
divorce rate had grown since 1970. Today, nearly half of married 
couples in the United States eventually split up. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, only 30 percent of girls and 40 percent  
of boys responded that married people are happier than those who 
stay single or live with a mate out of wedlock. In the late 1970s, 
about 39 percent of girls and 38 percent of boys agreed with that 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen girls especially seem to have lost some faith in the idea  
of finding a lifetime mate. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1976 to 1980, 68 percent of teen girls surveyed thought it  
was likely they would stay married to the same person for a 
lifetime. In 1995, it was 64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the percentage of boys who thought they would have only  
one mate has edged up, from 57 percent during the 1976-1980 period 
to 59 percent in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also showed that most teen-agers surveyed thought a  
good marriage and family life was important. Of boys, 72 percent 
thought a good marriage was important, as did 83 percent of girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers have increased from the mid-1970s, when 69 percent  
of boys and 80 percent of girls thought a good marriage was 
important. 
</P>
<P>
	Popenoe said teens seemed to believe in marriage, but were  
negative when it came to themselves. He said so many teens have 
seen or lived through divorces and don't have good examples of 
marriage to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teens don't even know anyone who's happily married,'' Popenoe  
said. ``They become scared and pessimistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nonpartisan National Marriage Project is funded by Rutgers  
in conjunction with several private foundations. It tracks social 
indicators related to marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The group relied on statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau and  
other government agencies for most of the study. Its findings on 
teens came from a study by the Institute for Social Research at the 
University of Michigan that compiled responses from about 50,000 
high school seniors nationwide over 19 years.

<HEADLINE> Boy George Celebrates Pub Reopening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Boy George joined a crowd celebrating the  
reopening of the gay pub where a nail-bomb blast killed three 
people in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred people gathered outside the Admiral Duncan pub  
in central London as it opened its doors Friday, nine weeks after 
the explosion that also injured 70 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is about remembrance, but it's also about moving on,''  
said George, dressed in a black suit and leopard skin top hat. 
``The reopening of the Admiral Duncan pub after just nine weeks 
sends a powerful message to the small but dangerous minority who 
want to terrorize the lesbian and gay and ethnic minority 
communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 22-year-old man has been charged with planting the bomb and  
with two earlier blasts in the London area. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a celebration and we are going to have a  
party,'' said pub manager Mark Taylor. ``We have got to move 
forward. There is no going back.''

<HEADLINE> Tips for Mixing Money and Marriage / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The bride is a saver; the groom is a spender.  
She prefers bonds and CDs; he likes stocks and options. 
</P>
<P>
	Balanced checkbook. Overdrawn.  
</P>
<P>
	On-time payments. Late fees.  
</P>
<P>
	Should they call the whole thing off? Hardly.  
</P>
<P>
	But investment advisers accustomed to seeing client couples with  
widely varying views on finances say it's crucial for those tying 
the knot to discuss those differences and how to deal with them 
early on -- as unromantic as it might seem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Failure to plan is probably the biggest reason why people get  
themselves into financial trouble,'' says Larry Elkin, a money 
manager and accountant from Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best advice I can give people just starting out today is  
to talk. You've got to consciously arrive at a set of goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Money is a means for arriving at one's goals, like starting a  
family, running a business, buying a home or traveling. 
</P>
<P>
	And to that end, financial experts offer a few basic  
suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Discuss your financial status. Although most couples don't  
like talking about money, it's important both parties disclose as 
much as they can about themselves financially -- current earnings, 
potential inheritance and debts. 
</P>
<P>
	One spouse isn't responsible for another's past debts, but his  
or her liabilities and spending habits could crimp future financial 
plans. Remember, you're marrying your finances, too. 
</P>
<P>
	And while you're at it, those money ``personalities'' should be  
discussed since a clash of attitudes and opinions can often put 
more of a strain on a marriage than lack of money. You may need to 
plan around your differences or similarities. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Create a budget. That determines how much money flows in and  
out of your household. Besides living expenses, it should include 
something for savings and investments as well as an emergency cash 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Ideally, two-income couples should try to build a budget so that  
one salary can handle all current expenses, says Elkin. The second 
can be saved or invested for important things like a down payment 
on a house or continuing education for a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can learn to live on less than you're making right from  
the beginning, the chances are you'll establish a pattern of saving 
and investing that bodes very well for financial success down the 
line,'' Elkin says. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Work out money management. Determining how you're going to  
combine financial resources can be touchy, especially with older, 
more established couples who are used to living on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute of Certified Financial Planners suggests couples  
have individual accounts for personal use as well as a joint 
account for household expenses, and that one spouse be in charge of 
paying the monthly bills so nothing falls through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Keep debt at bay. If you had to borrow for your wedding or  
honeymoon, pay off those debts as soon as possible. You'll save a 
bundle on interest charges in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	In the future, each spouse should try to avoid overspending by  
sticking to the planned budget. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Review insurance, title assets. New life insurance, or a  
larger policy, may be in order since marriage typically creates 
financial dependency. 
</P>
<P>
	You'll need to draft or update a will to reflect a change in  
marital status. Also, you'll need to change the beneficiaries of 
your insurance policies and retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
	How you title property should be given careful thought. Most  
couples routinely put everything in both names, which works well 
for those with limited assets by allowing quick transfer of 
property to a surviving partner. But as couples accumulate wealth, 
it may not make sense, especially for those in second marriages 
with children from a prior marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Seek outside help. Financial professionals can help couples  
create a stable foundation on which to build a marriage. There are 
advisers who can help with everything from investing for the future 
to passing your estate on to your heirs. 
</P>
<P>
	If you can't afford one, there's a variety of free information  
available over the Internet, and book stores are crammed with 
personal finance publications to check out once you've settled into 
a new life together. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no need to read them on your honeymoon. There are  
better things to do,'' says Elkin.

<HEADLINE> Analysts: Brazil Not Healthy Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The long roller-coaster ride touched  
off by the 1997 Asian crisis seems to have subsided on Brazilian 
stock markets, but analysts warn the country is still not out of 
the woods. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last four months, the Bovespa index of the Sao Paulo  
Stock Exchange -- Latin America's largest -- has averaged a healthy 
11,300 points but investors still remain cautious, worried about 
the government's fiscal health. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the Asian crisis erupted in July of 1997, no one believed  
it could threaten other economies,'' recalled Odair Abate, the 
chief economist at Lloyds Bank in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis took a while to reach Brazil and when it did, ``it  
hit us with a vengeance,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bovespa index reached a high of about 14,000 points in  
August 1997 and was still around 12,000 points when it finally 
succumbed to pressures overseas in October, finally hitting 7,800 
on Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Panic struck, and investors pulled their money from Brazil. The  
Central Bank spent $10 billion to shore up the real and interest 
rates skyrocketed to 43 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A fiscal austerity package announced by the government in late  
1997 breathed life back into Brazilian stocks, pushing the Bovespa 
back up to the 12,000 range. But the euphoria was short-lived. 
After Russia defaulted on some of its debt in August 1998, the 
market was back below 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of a $41.5 billion rescue package, stitched  
together by the International Monetary Fund, and a currency 
devaluation that made share prices cheaper in dollar terms, the 
markets have slowly inched back up. The Bovespa closed Friday at 
11,835. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent market movement hasn't convinced Abate that all is  
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``While in nominal terms share prices have made a significant  
recovery, in dollar terms they are still some 20 percent below 
their pre-Asian crisis levels, '' he said. ``The recovery needs 
more consistency and until then, the market can still fall prey to 
an interest rate hike in the United States or to economic 
uncertainties in Argentina or some other South American country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are still worried about ongoing budget and trade  
deficits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In May the primary budget deficit came to $454 million instead  
of an expected surplus of $284 million. In the first half of the 
year, Brazil's trade deficit totaled $623 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also are casting a wary eye on interest rates, ``which  
have been substantially reduced, but which are still far too high, 
straightjacketing the economy,'' said Thomas Taterka, head trader 
of Sao Paulo's Banco Cidade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, inflation is under control and shouldn't be more than 10  
percent this year,'' he said. ``But this is being accomplished by a 
sharp drop in economic activity and unemployment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Official figures show the nation's unemployment rate at close to  
8 percent. But in Sao Paulo, Latin America's largest city, labor 
unions say the jobless rate is 20 percent of the work force -- more 
than 1.7 million people.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Off on Weather News / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Prices of grain and soybean futures contracts  
finished sharply lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade as 
speculation grew that the fall harvest would bring in bumper crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Although temperatures are expected to soar into the upper 90s in  
Midwest growing regions over the next few days, traders did not 
expect the heat wave would result in significant damage to the 
young crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have seesawed over the past few sessions as market  
participants tried to evaluate the effect the hot, dry weather will 
have. But some forecasters are calling for a return of normal 
temperatures later next week and say there is ample soil moisture 
to protect roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also were pressured by speculation that production  
could soar above 10 billion bushels if the crop makes it through 
the crucial pollination period without significant damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans begin their flowering period next month, and there  
currently appears no threat to reducing what is expected to be 
bumper production. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by expectations for active  
harvesting of the winter wheat crop over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for September delivery fell 7 cents to $2.51 3/4 a bushel;  
September corn fell 6 cents to $2.02 1/4 a bushel; September oats fell 
3 cents to $1.08 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 12 1/2 cents to 
$4.34 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and lean hog futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while feeder cattle and pork bellies advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose 0.13 cent to 62.50 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose 0.35 cent to 76.32 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell 0.03 cent to 44.57 cents a pound; August pork bellies 
rose 0.50 cent to 37.05 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Canada Releases Alaskan Fisherman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Canadian authorities have released an  
Alaska fisherman after the U.S. State Department protested the 
seizure of his boat in waters involved in years of border disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was the first seizure in a decades-long dispute  
over a portion of Dixon Entrance, an expanse of water between the 
southern end of Alaska and British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Bosworth, 63, was fishing for black cod in waters claimed  
by both the United States and Canada when Canadian authorities 
seized the 41-foot longliner Lesley Ann and detained him Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States issued a protest and the vessel was released  
Friday, said Melinda Kimble, acting assistant secretary for the 
State Department's bureau of oceans and international environmental 
and scientific affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, Canada and the United States operate under an  
agreement that lets each country police its own fishermen in the 
disputed area, said Lt. Cmdr. Ray Massey, a spokesman for the Coast 
Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was good to go in all aspects as far as the U.S. government  
was concerned,'' Massey said. 
</P>
<P>
	He ran into trouble because Canada does not acknowledge black  
cod as a traditional target of U.S. fishermen in the area. Only 
salmon and halibut are deemed traditional catches, said Athana 
Mentzelopoulos, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the details of the case it was determined that a  
warning to the captain was the most appropriate action,'' 
Mentzelopoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles called the seizure an ``illegal and  
outrageous international violation'' and said releasing Bosworth 
with a warning was ``an inadequate diplomatic fig leaf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska officials dismissed the notion that black cod, also known  
as sablefish, is not a traditional target for Alaska fishermen. 
Alaskan fisherman hauled 95 metric tons of sablefish out of Dixon 
Entrance last year, according to state figures.

<HEADLINE> Orioles claim Jim Corsi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles signed right-hander Jim  
Corsi to a minor league contract Friday in the latest attempt to 
bolster their struggling bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Corsi, designated for assignment by the Boston Red Sox on June  
15, will report to Triple-A Rochester on Monday. Corsi went 1-2 
with a 5.25 ERA in 23 games with the Red Sox this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's see if he can throw the ball over the plate and get some  
people out,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller said. ``That's what you 
want to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles also announced that they were put right-hander Ricky  
Bones on the 15-day disabled list with fatigue in his right arm and 
called up Gabe Molina from Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles announced last week that they were recalling Molina  
and sending down Rocky Coppinger. But after Molina arrived in 
Baltimore, the Orioles rescinded the move because Coppinger would 
have had to pass through waivers to be demoted. 
</P>
<P>
	Corsi will likely get a shot soon to contribute to the Orioles'  
bullpen. Baltimore relievers have a 10.50 ERA in 21 innings over 
the last seven games. They lead the majors with 18 blown saves and 
have a major league-worst 5.96 ERA entering Friday's game against 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of seeing defensive pitching,'' Miller said. ``We  
have too many guys who are trying to miss bats instead of going 
after hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's frustrations boiled over Thursday in Toronto, after his  
relievers lost all three games to the Blue Jays. There were reports 
that a major shakeup would happen with the team this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	All that has gone on so far was a team meeting before Friday's  
game. The Orioles have lost eight straight following a stretch in 
which they won 11 of 12 and are in last place in the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message will be to go after guys,'' Miller said. ``Let's  
be aggressive and if a guy gets a hit, he gets a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mindset. When you're pitching good you don't care who  
the batter is. You just throw strike one and adjust from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said he expects to use Rocky Coppinger this weekend in  
New York. Coppinger, who has an 8.31 ERA in 17 1-3 innings, did not 
appear against the Blue Jays.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Gives Clinton No Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When President Bush prevailed in Iraq, his  
popularity rating soared to 91 percent. By contrast, President 
Clinton got no such bounce in the polls from the Kosovo campaign, 
even though his goals were achieved without a single U.S. combat 
casualty. 
</P>
<P>
	The American people paid much more attention to the Gulf War and  
seemed to give scant applause to the outcome of the Clinton-led 
campaign against Serbian forces clearing Kosovo of its ethnic 
Albanian population. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks after he led the 78-day NATO bombing campaign in  
Yugoslavia to a successful conclusion, Clinton still is waiting for 
some type of general acknowledgment that he achieved what he set 
out to achieve, and did it without committing American ground 
troops, the skeptics notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronomical leap in public opinion that his predecessor  
enjoyed at the end of the 1991 Gulf War simply is not Clinton's 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's approval numbers hover near the 50 percent mark. This  
situation has so puzzled the White House that it has given up 
trying to spin the success in Clinton's favor and decided to act as 
if the lack of recognition is no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought of some answers and you know what? None of them are  
meaningful,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``He saw it 
through and he's satisfied we did the right thing. I will leave it 
to others why that was so hard for many people in this town to 
accept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to an ABC News poll conducted after the bombings 56  
percent of surveyed Americans approved of the way Clinton handled 
the conflict in Kosovo, and 40 percent disapproved. A bipartisan 
Battleground Poll released last week showed 49 percent approved of 
Clinton's Kosovo leadership and 43 percent disapproved. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's approval rating dipped into the 50 percent range  
during the Kosovo bombing, lower than it stood during his 
impeachment ordeal. His rating remains in the 50s in most polls, 
although in early June it climbed back to 60 percent in one poll. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, President Reagan's approval rating was 46 percent  
in October 1983, when he sent U.S. forces into Grenada to retrieve 
650 American medical students following the assassination of 
leftist Prime Minister Maurice Bishop. It climbed to 53 percent a 
month later and a point higher the next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton says he does not think there is a message inherent in  
his lowered poll standings. He identified himself with Abraham 
Lincoln, who once said during the Civil War that 10,000 angels 
swearing he was right would not make any difference if he had been 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have tried to do what I think is right for my country  
here,'' Clinton said. ``The public and the members of the other 
party and others ... can react however they like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, one aide who worked closely with Clinton on Kosovo  
said the sentiment in the White House is that Americans feel good 
about ``our moral stand'' and that bodes well for Clinton's legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Several factors pushed the Kosovo conflict to the edge of  
Americans' minds. It produced no identifiable leaders, as the Gulf 
War produced Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf and gave new prominence to 
Gen. Colin Powell. Americans were ambivalent about the reasons the 
United States got involved. And the nation's attention was suddenly 
pulled away with the high school shootings in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The war made less difference on Main Street,'' said Stephen  
Hess, presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution. 
``Americans generally lost interest in it, which sort of was a plus 
for the president. It gave him some wiggle room as the air war was 
going on, but the down side was there wasn't much to take credit 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess said Clinton also was hurt some by his success in resisting  
pressure for ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``All it cost us was money,'' he said. ``With a ground war, an  
awful lot more people would have been committed and a lot more 
attention would have been paid. There were a lot of people in this 
war, in a sense, who never left home. The stealth bomber groups 
left from home and returned for dinner.''

<HEADLINE> Not All Boardwalks Made of Boards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRING LAKE, N.J. (AP) -- The Drifters probably weren't thinking  
of anything like this Jersey shore community's plastic walkway when 
they wrote their classic song ``Under the Boardwalk,'' about 
falling in love beneath the weathered planks. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet for a growing number of shore towns, the boardwalk is no  
longer made of boards. Synthetic materials, asphalt or decorative 
paving stones are slowly replacing wood. 
</P>
<P>
	Shore towns say the alternative materials last longer and are  
safer. But they also cost more, and not everyone likes 1990s 
technology on walkways that have been around since the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got some adverse comments from purists who felt it was the  
equivalent of a plastic Christmas tree,'' said Belmar Mayor Kenneth 
Pringle, whose borough has replaced about a third of a mile of its 
boardwalk with planks made of a polymer called Trex. 
</P>
<P>
	Spring Lake, Belmar's neighbor to the south, also replaced much  
of its wooden boardwalk with Trex, to mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``I prefer the wood,'' said Patrick Martin, a regular walker on  
the Spring Lake boardwalk. ``Wood looks better. It just looks like 
a boardwalk. This looks, well, plastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very hot to walk on in bare feet,'' said jogger Monica  
Giunco. ``But it does have more give to it, and you don't get 
splinters if you're barefoot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Brooks also prefers the synthetic boards at Spring Lake.  
</P>
<P>
	``It gives more when you run,'' he said. ``It's better on your  
knees. And it doesn't split like wood does, so the planks are nice 
and even.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maureen Murray, a spokeswoman for the Winchester, Va.-based Trex  
Co., said the synthetic boards are designed to withstand the 
corrosive effects of rain and salt air and provide a safe walk or 
jog. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's extremely weather-resistant, and it's perfect for the  
oceanside,'' she said. ``It has millions of tourists walking on it, 
so it has to be durable. And mayors in these shore towns have 
liability issues with people getting injured on splinters and nails 
popping up. This takes care of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pringle said Belmar had experienced problems with people getting  
stuck by splinters or cut by nails that worked their way loose and 
popped up from the boardwalk. He said the $80,000 cost of the Trex 
boards is about twice what it would have cost to use wood, but said 
the borough expects it to last twice as long. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the technology has been around for years, alternative  
boardwalk materials started catching on at the Jersey shore after a 
December 1992 nor'easter that ripped up boardwalks up and down the 
coast. Spring Lake made the switch after that storm, and Belmar 
followed suit shortly afterward. Sea Girt also added a block-long 
synthetic stretch to its boardwalk this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Manasquan has had an asphalt beach walk for about 20 years.  
After the 1992 storm picked it up and smashed it to pieces, the 
borough considered switching back to wood, but decided against it.

	Leaders Try To Form N. Ireland Gov't

<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- British and Irish prime  
ministers announced a bold plan today to form Northern Ireland's 
government. But Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of Ireland 
failed to gain the support of key local politicians. Under the 
plan, Blair and Ahern said they were hoping to see Northern 
Ireland's legislative Assembly elect the new administration on July 
15. The plan was offered after the major political parties failed 
to reach an agreement to create a new Protestant-Catholic 
government. The talks had stalled over Protestant demands for the 
disarmament of the Irish Republican Army.

amusement parks to banks. Though the overall unemployment rate 
crept up to 4.3 percent, all industries except manufacturing and 
mining posted solid gains. Indeed, some economists suggested the 
strong job growth could prolong concern at the Federal Reserve that 
the economy might be growing too fast for its own good. American

they cut payrolls by 5,000, the Labor Department said today.

<HEADLINE> Dr. J: Tennis Phenom Is My Daughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Alexandra Stevenson plays tennis with a  
vengeance and plenty of flair. More than overpowering serves and 
mammoth ground strokes, her game exudes a natural-born talent for 
playing to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Much like her father, Dr. J.  
</P>
<P>
	Julius Erving, the Basketball Hall of Famer who redefined the  
game with high-flying dunks and charisma, said Friday he is the 
father of the 18-year-old tennis phenom. His statement by telephone 
to The Associated Press came shortly after Stevenson made history 
on another continent, becoming the first female qualifier to 
advance to the Wimbledon semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a momentous day for the young, captivating player from  
California and for Erving, the former Philadelphia 76ers star who 
is now a vice president with the NBA's Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I acknowledge a relationship with her mother in 1980,'' Erving  
said from his office in Florida. ``My wife, who has known from the 
beginning, and children are aware of this situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``All matters concerning Alexandra since her birth have been  
handled privately through counsel. I am pleased to see Alexandra, 
at 18, doing so well and I applaud her mother's efforts and 
courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility that Erving was Stevenson's father was raised  
this week when The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel published a copy of 
her birth certificate. Though it listed her father as Julius 
Winfield Erving II, Erving's legal name, the basketball great 
initially denied being her father. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson has taken Wimbledon by storm with her game and  
presence and also by the controversy that has shadowed her run to 
the semis. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother, Samantha Stevenson, is a free-lance journalist who  
covered the 76ers while Erving starred on the team. She stirred 
Wimbledon with accusations of racism and lesbianism on the WTA Tour 
and with a dispute over prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	Mother and daughter declined comment Friday when asked several  
times about Erving's statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson advanced to the semifinals against Lindsay Davenport  
by beating another qualifier, 16-year-old Jelena Dokic, 6-3, 1-6, 
6-3. She hopped and skipped to the net after the final point, 
clapping with one hand on her racquet strings and curtsying four 
times to the crowd on Court 1. 
</P>
<P>
	An ocean away, Dr. J said: ``I haven't talked to her. I only met  
her once, and she was 3 years old. She was brought to me at a 
basketball clinic at a public school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erving soared higher, hung in the air longer and slam-dunked  
with more style that any player before him. He was Michael Jordan 
before Jordan came along, revolutionizing the game during a 16-year 
career in the ABA and with the Sixers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also the epitome of class off the court -- patient,  
considerate and always gracious to his fans. 
</P>
<P>
	If he was watching his daughter on television, there's no way he  
could have missed her crushing serves at speeds up to 113 mph and 
the way she peppered the court with mighty, one-handed backhands 
that are rare in women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	But while millions of other kids who grew up in the '80s  
idolized Dr. J, his own daughter had different ideas. Her idol is 
Pete Sampras, and she learned that devastating backhand from his 
old coach, Pete Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
	Erving said he would make no further comments about Stevenson.  
Asked if he wanted to meet her again, Erving said, ``I think it's 
probably her call. I've discussed this with my wife and children. 
Of course, I'd be open to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erving and wife Turquoise have been married since 1972 and have  
four children. He said he has been supporting Alexandra Stevenson 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
	News of his statement swept Philadelphia, where he is still  
respected and beloved. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a recent tabloid headline screamed, ``Dr. Dad,'' and  
Erving's story led newscasts on radio and television. Many radio 
callers expressed disappointment that Erving's only contact with 
his daughter had been through lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49-year-old Erving has been successful in business since  
leaving the NBA in 1987. Long gone is the big Afro from his playing 
days; his executive demeanor is accented by prim eyeglasses, 
pinstriped suits and closely cropped, slicked-back hair that is 
streaked with gray. 
</P>
<P>
	He is co-owner of Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co., and had a  
stake in Garden State Cable, which has a business relationship with 
Comcast, another cable company. He also worked for NBC as an NBA 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Erving said he hoped coming forward would ease the distractions  
that have shadowed Stevenson's run at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand they are being besieged because she won her match  
today,'' Erving said. ``Getting this statement out will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erving won two championships and two MVP awards in the ABA  
before moving to the NBA. He played 11 seasons for the Sixers, 
winning MVP honors in 1981 and leading Philadelphia to its last 
professional sports championship, in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phones Invade Wilderness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- High above the trees and surrounded by  
sky, the Adirondack peaks can seem far removed from the everyday 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless, of course, the guy next to you is jabbering on his cell  
phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a surreal scene played out on Mount Marcy's summit in front  
of state forester Jim Papero. He remembers it well: ``It was cold 
and windy. Beautiful. You could hear the wind whistling and 
everything, then this ... he was talking to his stockbroker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cell-phone chatter, already common at restaurants and shopping  
malls, is heard more and more often in the wilderness. Hikers and 
campers are tapping into personal directories to ask directions and 
apologize for dinner delays, to bum rides and call in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not amusing to many campers, hunters or others who  
appreciate nature's quiet. The problem has prodded New York 
environmental officials, who also worry about hikers using cell 
phones as lifelines, to promote phone etiquette in the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be walking down a trail or expend the effort it takes to  
climb one of the high peaks, and to see someone on the telephone 
... it's disconcerting,'' says Stu Buchanan, regional director of 
the state Department of Environmental Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no backwoods cell-phone epidemic just yet. But calls  
from the wild have become noticeable recently, now that wireless 
phones reach an estimated 74 million users nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	What can be a mere irritant in civilization can be a lifesaver  
in the wild. Rescues have been launched after timely calls for help 
from remote areas. Even many ``Ridge Runners,'' whose job is to 
help hikers on the Appalachian Trail, now carry cell phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Problem is, cell phones aren't reliable in the wild because cell  
towers tend to be far apart. Then there's the problem of getting a 
phone to work in gorges, gullies and other pockets amid peaks. It's 
a Catch-22 because efforts to build cell towers in remote areas are 
often opposed by locals and conservationists concerned about rural 
eyesores. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when phones can hail a signal in the backwoods, rescuers  
complain about trivial ``emergencies.'' Rangers in New York report 
picking up the phone to hear hikers asking directions or 
complaining about sprained wrists. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Donovan, owner of an outdoor gear store in the Berkshire  
hills at Great Barrington, Mass., has received cell-phone queries 
about how to light the camp stove. Or worse: ``They're calling my 
store and asking me for a ride. What happened to the days of 
walking down the mountain?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baxter State Park in Maine has banned the use of cell phones on  
park grounds, as it had earlier excluded radios and cassette 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Park naturalist Jean Hoekwater says the ban in part targets  
nuisance calls the likes of, ``Honey? Guess what I'm in front of 
right now. A big moose!'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York has no bans yet, but the state-sponsored effort to  
discourage frequent and non-emergency use of cell phones is to 
begin this summer with brochures, videos and trailhead postings. 
</P>
<P>
	Can education work? Michele Morris, senior editor of Backpacker  
magazine, calls it the key. She's hoping for new attitudes of 
self-reliance and consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Jacobs, an associate professor of information technology  
at the Rochester Institute of Technology, predicts the problem will 
``auto correct'' over time as more people consider it rude to ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect cell phones to disappear from the woods any time  
soon though. A survey by Backpacker magazine last year found cell 
phones a popular item on readers' ``to buy'' lists. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some high-end cell phones can pull in signals from  
satellites, eliminating the need for towers. With the right 
equipment, even the deepest, most remote gulch can be just a phone 
call away.

	COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- The long putts were right on target, but  
several of the short ones traveled as if they had a mind of their 
own. And when he expected a birdie, Hubert Green misfired. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Green still managed to shoot a 5-under-par 67 Friday, good  
for a second-place tie with five players after the opening round of 
the State Farm Senior Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Green had a bogey-free round in which he missed just one  
fairway, but he wasn't nearly as consistent on the greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made some long putts that I didn't expect to make and missed  
some I should have made,'' said Green, who ranks 40th on the money 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Green nailed a 35-footer for par on No. 12 but failed to  
capitalize on the four par-5s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't make a birdie on a par-5, which for me is horrible,''  
he said. ``I'm surprised I'm this close to the lead, to tell you 
the truth.'' 
</P>

                             	------

<P>
	 *GOLF'S HIS RACKET:* Many years ago, Frank Conner made a bold  
career move. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still paying off, in a big way.  
</P>
<P>
	Conner was a three-time All-American tennis player for Trinity  
(Texas) University in the 1960s when he abruptly abandoned the game 
in favor of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Conner has never won a PGA tournament, and there's no guarantee  
his opening 4-under-par 68 Friday will translate to victory in the 
State Farm Senior Classic. But he's collected more than $2.6 
million as a professional golfer, which is a whole lot more than he 
would have garnered playing tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got married after my junior year, and there really wasn't  
any money in tennis,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Things worked out very nicely for Conner, who is one of only two  
men to have played in the U.S. Open in both tennis and golf 
(Ellsworth Vines is the other). 
</P>
<P>
	He played a fine round of golf Friday, sinking four birdies on  
the back nine after closing the front nine with two straight 
bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always nice to get off to a good start, especially in a  
54-hole tournament,'' he said. ``I played the back side pretty 
consistently.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OUTTA HERE:* Calvin Peete withdrew from the tournament Friday  
after shooting a 1-over 37 on the front nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Peete, who ranks No. 95 on the money list, cited a sore shoulder  
as the reason for his withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Sigel also withdrew from the tournament, leaving before the  
outset of his round to be with his wife, who is undergoing surgery 
on a herniated disk.

	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A teen-ager accused of using a hidden  
video camera to tape girls undressing has been arraigned on felony 
eavesdropping charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Charles Mickam, 18, of Farmington Hills, was charged  
Thursday with three counts of eavesdropping and installing a 
device. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Mickam secretly videotaped three high school

	Without such evidence, the charges should be dismissed, said

<HEADLINE> Oldsmobile Cutlass Ends 38-Year Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Oldsmobile Cutlass, the long-running  
nameplate that graced some of General Motors Corp.'s most popular 
cars in the 1970s and 1980s, was retired Friday as the last of the 
slow-selling 1999 sedans rolled off the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
	Like GM itself, the Cutlass' glory days were long behind it.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, the Cutlass was the top-selling car in the nation and  
made Oldsmobile one of the hottest car lines. Back in those days, 
Olds sold more than 1 million cars a year, half of which were 
Cutlasses. Last year, the division sold just 330,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The last '99 Cutlass that rolled off the assembly line in  
Oklahoma City was a compact midsize sedan that lacked the style and 
power of its '60s and '70s predecessors. Introduced in 1997, the 
car was barely indistinguishable from the Chevrolet Malibu and 
lacked the advertising support of its better-selling twin. 
</P>
<P>
	``What GM is doing is looking to differentiate their various  
brands,'' said analyst Ron Pinelli of Autodata Corp. ``One way to 
do that is to remove the Cutlass, since it's so similar to Chevy's 
offering. It was just another one of GM's cars that did nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olds also has a new offering, the Alero, which is similarly  
sized and has many of the styling cues of larger models in the 
Oldsmobile lineup that the Cutlass lacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinelli said the move to kill the Cutlass made sense. ``I don't  
see what Cutlass added to the showroom. ... GM has so much product 
out there, it just gets confusing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oklahoma City plant will increase production of the Malibu.  
GM's other Malibu plant, in Wilmington, Del., was recently 
converted to produce Saturn's new L-series midsize sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	Oldsmobile spokesman Vince Muniga said the last Cutlass, black  
with leather interior, would be shipped to the Oldsmobile Museum in 
Lansing, Mich., for permanent display. The underside of the hood 
and trunk lid were signed by about 5,000 plant employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Muniga said there were no plans to revive the Cutlass name on a  
later model, but ``you never say never in the automobile 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its 38-year run, Oldsmobile sold more than 11.9 million  
Cutlasses. The name was used on sedans, coupes, convertibles and 
station wagons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cutlass was introduced in 1961 as a compact coupe version of  
the F-85 and featured a 185-horsepower, 215-cubic-inch aluminum V8 
engine. A muscle-car version in the mid-1960s was known as the 
``442.'' In 1968, it was available with a scorching 455-cubic-inch 
V8 that produced 360 horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s and '80s, the Cutlass was most responsible for  
Olds' explosive sales growth as other GM divisions withered under 
the onslaught of Japanese imports. Various versions of the Cutlass 
were produced in that era, including the Cutlass Supreme, Cutlass 
Calais and front-wheel-drive Cutlass Ciera. 
</P>
<P>
	One trade magazine editor at the time summed up the secret of  
Olds' success: ``Whatever it is, call it a Cutlass and it will 
sell.''

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Improves After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charismatic continues to improve from surgery  
for leg fractures sustained in the Belmont Stakes that could have 
proved fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of severity, and on a scale of one to 10, it was a  
'nine','' said Dr. Celeste Kunz, whose quick reaction help saved 
the life the Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fracture (a condylar fracture of the left front cannon  
bone with an additional fracture to the seasmoid) was dangerously 
displaced,'' she said Friday at news conference at Belmont Park. 
``If it had broken through the skin, the prognosis would have been 
lowered significantly. I fitted the leg with a compression boot 
suitable to the horse's weight and size in order to immobilize 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis and trained by D.  
Wayne Lukas, was retired and will go to stud 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when in the running of the Belmont Stakes June 9 he  
thought the injury occurred, Dr. Stephen Selway, who operated on 
the colt the following day, said his best guess was that it 
happened between the quarter and eighth poles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he carried his head changed and, although his momentum  
carried him on, he seemed to lose his fluidity of motion,'' Selway 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic finished third behind Lemon Drop Kid and Vision and  
Verse in his bid to become the 12th Triple Crown champion and first 
since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Selway credited quick action to ``stabilize Charismatic's  
physiological condition following the injury'' as being of critical 
importance in the horse's survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Chris Antley also helped by dismounting shortly after the  
finish and lifting the injured leg to relieve the weight on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic has responded well to surgery and to continuing  
treatment. He is expected to remain in his stall for another two to 
three months. Complete healing of the fracture is expected to take 
four to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Although horses with somewhat similar injuries have resumed in  
competition, Charismatic's retirement was considered the most 
prudent course to pursue, Selway said, ``to preserve an invaluable 
gene pool.''

<HEADLINE>  McGwire Hits 24th, 25th Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his 24th and 25th home runs  
Friday night, a pair of two-run shots for St. Louis off Brian 
Anderson of the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's first homer landed in the bullpen beyond the  
left-field wall, a drive measured at 392 feet. He topped that with 
a 432-footer in the fifth, a ball that bounced off the Stadium Club 
glass just below Big Mac Land and the upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his third multi-homer game this season and the 56th of  
his career, putting him one ahead of Jimmie Foxx for fourth on the 
career list. Babe Ruth is No. 1 on the list with 72, followed by 
Willie Mays with 63 and Hank Aaron with 62. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire had 10 multi-homer games in his record 70-homer season  
last year, including a three-homer game against Arizona on April 
14. He has seven homers and 15 RBIs in 35 career at-bats against 
the Diamondbacks, and his last three this season have come against 
them, including a homer June 24 at Arizona off Omar Daal. 
</P>
<P>
	This was his first multi-homer game this season at Busch  
Stadium, where he has 62 homers in 142 career games. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of the homers came with J.D. Drew aboard. Drew doubled with  
one out in the first and singled with one out in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire remained well off his record pace. At this point last  
season, he had 37 homers.

<HEADLINE> Mars Candy Patriarch Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	McLEAN, Va. (AP) -- Forrest Mars Sr., who created M&AMP;Ms candies  
and built one of the biggest fortunes in America as head of the 
Mars candy empire, has died. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	The reclusive billionaire, one of the richest men in America,  
died of natural causes Thursday night in Miami, said Sharon 
Heffelfinger, a spokeswoman for McLean-based Mars Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	She said no further information would be released.  
</P>
<P>
	The candy giant began in 1911 with Frank C. Mars' small business  
in Tacoma, Wash. In 1940, his son, Forrest, devised a candy modeled 
after a British confection: a circle of chocolate covered with a 
crunchy coating. 
</P>
<P>
	M&AMP;Ms -- promoted, as every Baby Boomer knows, as the candy that  
melts in your mouth, not in your hand -- were created as much out of 
meteorological necessity as anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``In those days, the stores didn't have air conditioning, the  
cars didn't have air conditioning, the homes didn't have air 
conditioning,'' then-Mars spokesman Hans Fiuczynski said as the 
candy turned 50 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The candy, originally sold in paper tubes, came in brown,  
yellow, orange, red, green and violet, later replaced by tan. 
Beginning in 1950, the candies were stamped with the trademark 
``M'' to assure customers they were getting the real thing. Peanut 
M&AMP;Ms came out in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	The company now has 30,000 employees. Besides M&AMP;Ms, its candy  
brands include Skittles, Milky Way, Dove, Snickers and Three 
Musketeers. Other brands owned by the Mars companies include Uncle 
Ben's Rice, the Kal Kan and Pedigree pet food labels, and Combos, 
Kudos and Twix snack foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Mars' sons, Forrest Jr. and John, are now co-presidents of the  
privately held company. In its rankings of richest Americans last 
fall, Forbes listed Forrest Jr. as 29th richest, Forrest Sr. as 
30th richest, John as 31st richest and Jacqueline Mars Vogel, John 
and Forrest Jr.'s sister, at 33rd, with fortunes estimated at 
around $4 billion each. The family matriarch, Forrest Sr.'s wife 
Audrey, died in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The family became known for its reticence as well as its riches.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mars's assets are often underestimated because the company is  
as loose with information as its McLean, Va., neighbor, the CIA,'' 
Fortune magazine said in 1988 when it dubbed the family the richest 
in America at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	M&AMP;M's were packed in World War II GI rations, served at the 1984  
Olympics in Los Angeles and launched with 31 shuttle flights as of 
1990. The rock band Van Halen's contract called for a backstage 
stash of three pounds of M&AMP;M's -- with all the brown and tan ones 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had discontinued red M&AMP;Ms in 1976 because of the  
cancer scare over Red Dye No. 2, although the candy never contained 
the substance. Red M&AMP;M's reappeared in 1987.

	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- The unreliable English weather looks  
like it may cooperate for Saturday's four semifinals and Sunday's

</P>
<P>
	Sunday is also expected to be mostly dry with a chance of brief  
showers during the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	With one entire day this week washed out by rain, and two others  
virtually washed out, organizers have been forced to schedule all 
four semifinals on Saturday, a day usually reserved for the women's

<HEADLINE> Chinese Tattoo Spurs Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRETNA, La. (AP) -- Jeremy Van Camp prefers to keep his back  
against the wall these days. 
</P>
<P>
	A tattoo artist commissioned to inscribe Van Camp's first name  
in Chinese on his back instead inked six Chinese characters whose 
meaning isn't even close, Van Camp says in a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	```Kung Po karate, martial arts expert, and Shaolin fifth.'  
That's what it says on my back,'' said Van Camp, 23. Shaolin is a 
form of kung fu. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the lawsuit filed this week, Van Camp saw a poster  
at Brad's Westbank Tattoo labeled as the Chinese alphabet. So he 
decided to have his name tattooed, and a tattoo artist inscribed 
the characters listed as ``J,'' ``E,'' ``R,'' and so on, on the 
poster. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble is, the English and Chinese languages are vastly  
different -- and letters in English have no direct counterparts in 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Camp is demanding the tattoo company pay for laser surgery  
to remove the tattoo and to compensate him for his embarrassment 
and for the pain and suffering of tattoo removal. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Fox, owner of Brad's Westbank Tattoo, did not return calls.  
An employee there said the character sheet was sold by a tattoo 
supply company in Voorheesville, N.Y., which referred calls to J.D. 
Crowe of Ancient Art Tattoo Studio of Yorktown, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowe said he couldn't recall if the design in question was his.

<HEADLINE> Tariffs Recommended For Steel Wire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A decision on imposing tariffs on foreign  
shipments of steel wire rods now rests with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent  
fact-finding agency, recommended Friday that 15 percent tariffs be 
ordered on wire rods, the type of steel used to make fencing, coat 
hangers and other wire products. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the recommendations are not binding, the action forces  
Clinton to confront the issue. In recent months, he has grappled to 
balance the needs of a struggling U.S. steel industry with his 
desire to keep international markets open. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases were filed by U.S. steel producers and their  
steelworkers' unions to combat low-priced imports, which they blame 
for thousands of layoffs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports reached record highs last year because of the Asian  
economic crisis, in which lowered demand abroad forced foreign 
producers to send products to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three voting commissioners recommended 15 percent  
tariffs on wire rod for the first year, with the tariff level going 
down each year to 9 percent in the fourth and final year. They did 
not recommend quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	The third commissioner did not detail her minority  
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	The tariffs would cover wire rod shipments from all countries  
except Canada, Mexico, Israel, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru. 
Also exempted would be certain specialty grades of wire rod, 
including those used to make tire cords and valve springs. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the trade commission reached a split decision on whether  
foreign steel wire rod is hurting U.S. producers. Three 
commissioners who found injury were the ones who voted Friday on a 
relief recommendation.

	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Martin knows the difference  
between a fluke and the real thing. He thinks the car he'll drive 
in the Pepsi 400 on Saturday is much better than the one that took 
him to his last restrictor-plate victory, at Talladega 
Superspeedway in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was not a fast car at Talladega,'' Martin said. ``It was  
something we did to change the setup'' of the chassis. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, the crew lowered the chassis by a fraction to  
improve aerodynamics. It resulted in a 188.354 mph average and a 
victory in a rare accident-free race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, we took a 25th-place car to first,'' Martin said.  
``We caught everyone else looking the other way and you don't do 
that too often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after that race, Martin's aerodynamic advantage wore away  
and he again depended on his team to find an edge for his 
restrictor-plate package. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, Martin feels the mission has been accomplished.  
He says the car he will take to the starting line Saturday has more 
horsepower than any he's driven with a restrictor plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``These races with restrictor plates are more a function of  
mechanics and the team,'' Martin said. ``Drivers do have something 
to do with it, but not as much as at Michigan or Charlotte.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MORE QUALIFYING:* Jeff Burton, fourth in the Winston Cup driver  
standings, elected to use a provisional starting slot after engine 
trouble aborted his qualifying effort. 
</P>
<P>
	After stopping in the middle of his qualifying lap Thursday,  
Burton and his crew started working on a race setup Friday and did 
not choose to run in the second day of qualifying. Burton's car was 
on the track during practice Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Craven and Brett Bodine were the big winners in the second  
day of qualifying. Both elected to try to improve their times and 
both finished among the top 36 drivers who get in based on their 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Craven circled the 2.5-mile trioval at Daytona International  
Speedway at 190.945 mph. Bodine made it in 190.658. 
</P>
<P>
	Dropped from the starting grid was Hut Stricklin, who elected  
not to run again after qualifying 36th on Thursday. He fell back 
two spots. Derrike Cope ran again, but couldn't improve his 
standing of 37th. 
</P>
<P>
	Others using provisionals include Terry Labonte and Kyle Petty.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JARRETT UPDATE:* What grade would points leader Dale Jarrett  
give himself for the first half of the season? An `A,' of course. 
But with room for improvement, especially in qualifying and at the 
beginning of races. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we get better? Yeah,'' Jarrett said. ``We can be an  
`A-plus' team because we can run better. We can finish fourth and 
fifth without having to come from 25th to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett has started from the outside pole three times this year,  
but his average starting position is 14th. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he has finished out of the top 10 only twice this year.  
The first came in the Daytona 500 when he was involved in a 
multicar accident. The other came in Las Vegas, when he ran out of 
gas toward the end of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been other days where we've struggled but made  
something of it,'' Jarrett said. ``We've known we had a team 
capable of putting together these kinds of races, these kinds of 
streaks and we hope they continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking his first points title, Jarrett stands 157 points ahead  
of Bobby Labonte. Martin is another nine points back, followed by 
Jeff Burton and two-time defending champion Jeff Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *VIRTUAL VISION:* Thousands of race fans bring radio scanners to  
the track to listen in on conversations between drivers and their 
crews. Sony and the owners of Daytona International Speedway are 
testing a product that could help them take the experience a step 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	They will debut the Sony Glasstron head-mounted video display in  
selected suites at the track Saturday. Viewers will slip on a pair 
of virtual-reality goggles and be able to select in-car views of 
eight drivers. CBS, which is televising the race, will provide the 
in-car camera feeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The service is already available on some satellite systems, but  
never before has it been brought directly to the track via the 
goggles. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailing for about $900, the goggles have been on the market  
for about a year. But they were mainly geared toward travelers, who 
could attach a portable disc player and watch movies. 
</P>
<P>
	If the new program gets good reviews this weekend, International  
Speedway Corporation and Sony will consider renting the goggles to 
fans much the way vendors rent the scanners. 
</P>
<P>
	``The magic of it here is that you actually get a better  
perspective on the race than the driver does,'' said ISC marketing 
vice president Greg Sullivan. ``Because you can see both the big 
picture, what's going on at the track, and what the driver is 
actually experiencing.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PIT STOPS:* On the 50th anniversary of the creation of Petty  
Enterprises, Pontiac is coming out with a Grand Prix to commemorate 
each of Richard Petty's record 200 career victories. The 
metallic-blue car will sell for about $50,000. A total of 1,000 -- 
five for each victory -- will be made. ... Buckshot Jones qualified 
for the Pepsi 400, leaving him with a busy weekend. He will depart 
Daytona after the race Saturday for Milwaukee, where he will drive 
in the Busch series DieHard 250 on Sunday. ... StockCar Stocks 
Index Fund announced the launch of a new NASCAR-related mutual 
fund. Shares will be offered on the company's web site, 
www.stockcars.com, at $15 each. Another class of similar stock went 
on sale last October and sells for $19.15 per share after starting 
at $15. ... The track encountered no weather delays Friday. The 
forecast Saturday calls for a 50-percent chance of rain.

<HEADLINE> 3 Advance to Delvin Miller Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Rum Boogie, longshot Bit O Candy  
and Oolong each won $20,000 eliminations Friday night at the 
Meadowlands to advance to the $400,000 Delvin Miller Memorial Final 
on July 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Rum Boogie, last year's 2-year-old trotting filly of the year,  
turned in the fastest of the three miles in the sixth race, with a 
1:55.2 lifetime best, trotting by Lovelytobehold for a 
three-quarter length victory. Dream Valley OM finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I qualified her, she wasn't that great,'' driver Mike  
Lachance said of Rum Boogie. ``Last week, I was really careful with 
her, and she didn't finish her mile as strong as she should. She 
was strong tonight. She's on her way back. She was better tonight, 
still not herself but much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first division, the third race, George Brennan guided Bit  
O Candy to a head victory over Justgotafeeling in 1:56.3. It was a 
half-length back to Poster Princess in third. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was good tonight,'' said driver George Brennan, of Bit O  
Candy's first win. ``I expected her to be good last week, but she 
tied up and ran in the turn on me. I thought there would be a lot 
more speed in the race but as it was, I followed good cover. 
Gurfein's crew did a great job getting her right from last week. 
All we have to hope for now is the post.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oolong, the New Jersey Sire Stakes Final winner, edged Canland  
Hall by a head in the fifth race division, trotting the mile in 
1:56.3. Bloodstock's Chat finished a head back in third. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was real sharp tonight,'' said Oolong's trainer and part  
owner Per Henriksen. ``She warmed up super. We scratched her last 
week because she had a little temperature. We probably could have 
raced her but we have a lot in stakes coming up. We didn't want to 
take any chances.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Investigating Silicon Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The government will investigate a  
newspaper's report that Silicon Valley high-tech companies pay 
Asian immigrants low wages to assemble electronic parts at home, 
possibly violating a number of labor, tax and safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
	State Labor Commissioner Marcy Saunders told the San Jose  
Mercury News that officials plan to meet next week to begin forming 
a task force of state and federal labor officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about possible overtime violations, child labor  
violations and certainly record-keeping violations and violations 
of other laws as well -- tax laws and OSHA and others,'' said George 
Friday, regional administrator at the federal Department of Labor's 
Wage and Hour Division. 
</P>
<P>
	In stories published Sunday and Monday, the Mercury News  
reported that the use of immigrants to make electronic parts at 
home has been widespread in Silicon Valley since the early 1980s. 
At least a dozen local contract manufacturers, ranging from small 
companies to multibillion-dollar giants, have been involved in 
piecework arrangements within the past year, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract companies are often hired by major computer  
companies to produce parts for larger components. 
</P>
<P>
	Those parts are sometimes made or assembled at home, on kitchen  
tables or in garage workshops. The mostly immigrant labor force is 
sometimes paid as little as a penny per component, sometimes barely 
earning minimum wage, and gets no overtime for work that can be 
hazardous, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears the same thing that's happening in the garment and  
agricultural industries is happening in Silicon Valley,'' said Tom 
Rankin, president of the California Labor Federation.''It's the 
misuse of independent contractors to avoid labor laws, to shield 
the real employer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The practice of paying workers for each item made, so-called  
``piecework,'' rather than by the hour isn't necessarily illegal, 
but the pay rate must mesh with minimum wage and overtime laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The government probe will mark the first in Silicon Valley's  
industrial sector in nearly two decades. A 1980 investigation was 
stalled by a lack of Vietnamese-speaking investigators and ended 
when industry leaders and politicians persuaded labor officials to 
let them police the problem themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	In their upcoming probe, investigators will be checking into  
whether pieceworkers should be classified as independent 
contractors or employees, Friday said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe most companies want to comply with the law,'' Friday  
said. ``Some may be ignorant of what's going on at the lower levels 
of their own companies. Others may just see it as an industry 
practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contract manufacturers have built parts and systems for  
companies such as Hewlett-Packard Co., Sun Microsystems Inc. and 
Cisco Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest contracting company, Solectron Corp. of  
Milpitas, said after the newspaper's reports that while it did use 
home assembly some time ago, the practice now is against company 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Solectron said it conducted an internal audit earlier this year,  
found one subcontractor paying workers by the piece, and suspended 
business with that company. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Microsystems, one of Solectron's biggest customers, said it  
``would fully support any actions taken to eliminate the alleged 
labor violations.'' Company officials said they were not aware of 
any such practices by its contractors or subcontractors.

	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets pushed ahead Friday, with  
blue chips in Tokyo and Hong Kong hitting levels unseen since the 
early months of the region's economic crisis and Singapore shares 
climbing to another record finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets were filled with optimism that any interest rate worries  
are out of the way for now, after the U.S. Federal Reserve nudged 
its rates higher on Wednesday but suggested no more monetary 
tightening is likely to be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 652.44 points, or 4.8 percent,  
to close at 14,184.58, its highest point gain of the year and the 
best finish since Oct. 9, 1997, when the Asian financial crisis was 
starting to be felt in the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. is now less inclined to raise rates, which is helping  
Hong Kong stocks,'' said Patrick Yiu, an analyst at Kingsway SW 
Securities Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's session was Hong Kong's first chance to respond to the  
U.S. interest rate news, after a public holiday on Thursday, so the 
gains were somewhat exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian markets gained further encouragement from Wall Street,  
where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 95.62 points to 
11,066.42 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, Asia's biggest market, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei  
Stock Average rose 71.72 points, or 0.40 percent, closing at 
17,932.47 points. It was the index's highest closing since Sept. 
29, 1997, when it finished at 17,987.21. On Thursday, the Nikkei 
had closed up 331.01 points, or 1.89 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurred by continued brisk buying from overseas institutional  
investors, the Nikkei average briefly passed the 18,000-point, 
rising as high as 18,066.28 before falling back on profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confidence in our country's economy is being reflected in  
stocks, and I am happy about it,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu 
Nonaka told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	On currency markets, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 121.08 yen by  
late afternoon, up 0.32 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also 
above its late New York level of 120.78 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore shares inched up to their second record in as many  
days, pushed higher by small investors buying up small-company 
shares. The benchmark Straits Times Index closed at 2,222.45 
points, up 7.70 points, or 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only very selective buying on the blue chips. The  
small stocks are the ones dominating today,'' said broker William 
Pang at G.K. Goh Stockbrokers said. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai blue chips rose 2.2 percent, after giving up about  
half of their early huge gains. The SET index rose 11.56 points to 
533.33. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares bucked the trend and fell, as renewed  
clashes between police and demonstrators kept nervous investors out 
of the market. The JSX Composite Index dropped 2.504 points, or 
0.37 percent, to 670.538. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed sharply higher on strong buying in

<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher as interest rate worries  
vanished. The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 35.42 
points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,578.72. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed higher, with stronger  
prices for commodities giving a lift to resource-based companies. 
The All Ordinaries Index rose 26.8 points, or 0.9 percent, to 
3,028.9. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Sentiment was boosted by the U.S. interest rate news and  
expectations of a speedup in reforms by leading conglomerates. The 
Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 13.44 points, or 1.4 
percent, to 933.42. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Prices were buoyed by regional and Wall Street  
gains as well as enthusiasm about local economic prospects. The 
Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, closed at 
845.62, up 10.31 points, or 1.23 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cubans: US Authorities Taunted Us </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Two of six Cuban refugees who were allowed to  
remain in the United States after frantically trying to swim past 
Coast Guard boats say U.S. authorities later taunted them and made 
them pose with a photo of Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Duviel Rodriguez, 17, and Carlos Hernandez Cordova, 29, told  
reporters that before they were taken to Krome Detention Center for 
processing, they were detained by authorities they perceived to be 
U.S. Border Patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
	```This is our country,' they told us,'' Hernandez said  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees said they were taunted and cursed, then forced to  
look into a camera while holding a photo of the Cuban president. 
</P>
<P>
	When they protested, they were told to hold the photo higher,  
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's outrageous that these people would be forced to take a  
picture with a photo of Fidel Castro,'' said Ninoska Perez 
Castellon, a spokeswoman for the Cuban American National 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	A Border Patrol spokesman said the agency would investigate.  
</P>
<P>
	``It goes without saying that we would not condone and we will  
not tolerate such behavior,'' spokesman Michael Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Coast Guard also is investigating its treatment of the  
six refugees. Television reports showed the Coast Guard blasting 
the men with a hose as they stood in their 14-foot rowboat about 
150 yards from shore. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency then swarmed them as they jumped overboard and swam  
toward shore. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were later freed from custody and allowed to remain in  
the United States following large protests by the Cuban community. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also were investigating whether the men really came  
all the way from Cuba in their rowboat. Border control agent Dean 
Sinclair said the refugees had numerous inconsistencies in their 
stories, leading investigators to believe their effort may have 
involved a more sophisticated smuggling operation.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Ratings Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. women's soccer team's quarterfinal win  
over Germany was seen in nearly 1.7 million homes, the best cable 
rating so far in the Women's World Cup but still a small number as 
TV ratings go. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night's game on ESPN in which the U.S. defeated Germany  
3-2 received a 2.19 rating, which translates to 1.67 million 
households. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as ratings go, the women have fallen short of their male  
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the United States played Colombia in the first round of  
the men's World Cup. The game on ESPN drew a 4.3 rating and was 
seen in 2.7 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the only men's World Cup quarterfinal game on cable  
was watched by 833,000 homes on ESPN2, a game between Italy and 
France. The three quarterfinals broadcast by ABC averaged 2.3 
million households. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans' tournament-opening win over Denmark this year was  
watched in 1.7 million homes on ABC. Their first-round victory 
against Nigeria was seen in 1.4 million homes on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. advanced to the quarterfinals last Sunday with a win  
against North Korea, a game that received a 1.96 rating and was 
seen in 1.3 million homes. It was the highest rating for any soccer 
match on ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, ESPN has averaged a 1.05 rating with six World Cup games  
aired, which translates to 800,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN2, which has broadcast 20 of the tournament's games, mostly  
involving other countries, has turned in a 0.53 rating, or 343,000 
households. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program. Each cable point represents 766,000 
homes on ESPN and 644,000 homes on ESPN2.

<HEADLINE> Grace Sent to Scranton; Perez to DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies placed left-hander  
Yorkis Perez on the 15-day disabled list Friday, and optioned 
right-hander Mike Grace to Triple-A Scranton. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-handers Joe Grahe and Steve Schrenk were called up from  
Scranton. Also, shortstop Desi Relaford was transferred from the 
15- to the 60-day disabled list recovering from surgery on his 
right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, who has an inflamed left elbow, was one of the club's  
most effective pitchers out of the bullpen this season, compiling a 
3-1 record and 3.94 ERA. Since May 1, he posted a 2.63 ERA, 
allowing 19 hits in 24 innings. His last appearance came Thursday 
when he injured his elbow after pitching 1-3 of an inning, allowing 
a hit and a run, in the Phillies' 12-7 loss at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, 31, was scheduled to undergo an MRI on the elbow Friday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yorkis has a sprained ligament in his left elbow,'' Phillies  
team physician Dr. Phillip Marone said. ``Whatever the result, he 
will be disabled for at least 15 days. This type of thing comes 
from repetitive pitching, not from just one pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grace posted a 1-1 mark in 21 games, but was tagged with 46 hits  
and 25 earned runs in 30 innings for a 7.50 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrenk, 30, was 3-1 in 32 relief appearances for Scranton with  
a 2.93 ERA and two saves. It will be his first stint in the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Grahe, 31, had a team-high 10 saves in 19 games with the Red  
Barons and had a 0-1 record with a 4.24 ERA. He has spent parts of 
six seasons in the majors, most recently with Colorado in 1995, 
when he was 4-3 in 17 games.

<HEADLINE> GTE Sues Five Insurers Over Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- GTE Corp. has sued five insurance companies  
to recover $400 million it says it has to spend to repair and test 
its computers for the transition to the year 2000, in a case that 
tests whether insurers may be held responsible for such expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The telecommunications company sued under three policies it has  
with the Allendale Mutual Insurance Co. of Johnston, R.I., from 
1996 to 2000. The primary policy covered ``destruction, distortion 
or corruption of any computer data, coding, program or software,'' 
and obligates GTE to ``sue, labor and travel'' if necessary to 
protect its property. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract also said Allendale would contribute to expenses  
GTE incurred for those efforts, according to the lawsuit filed June 
18 in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The four other insurers that negotiated contracts with identical  
language are Affiliated FM Insurance, the Allianz Insurance Co., 
the Federal Insurance Co. and Industrial Risk Insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurers have until July 18 to file their initial response.  
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits like GTE's are not addressed in the year 2000 liability  
legislation agreed upon Thursday by Congress, which focuses on 
limiting lawsuits against vendors over defective products and on 
potential lawsuits against computer owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Consultants told The New York Times in Friday's editions that  
insurers have paid some claims for year 2000 repairs to avoid 
lawsuits like GTE's. Estimates of the insurance industry's 
potential liability for Y2K problems have varied widely. A recent 
study estimated the costs could run from $15 billion to $35 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Jamie Koven Begins Sculls Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HENLEY ON THAMES, England (AP) -- Former world sculling champion  
Jamie Koven of Green Village, N.J., scored another dominant victory 
Friday in defense of his Diamond Sculls title at the Henley 
Regatta. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing in the colors of Riverside Boat Club of Boston, Koven  
easily beat Oxford University sculler Matthew Crocker to advance to 
Saturday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The other American in the Diamond Sculls, Koven's training  
partner Aquil Abdullah, racing for Potomac Club of Washington D.C., 
lost after damaging his boat. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah was forced to a sudden halt when his sliding seat  
mechanism jammed just three strokes after the start of his race 
against Richard Briscoe of British club Leander. 
</P>
<P>
	Briscoe stopped and offered a re-row, so both scullers went back  
to the start. Abdullah's problem repeated and Briscoe was given the 
result. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. national sculling squad members, racing as the Augusta  
Sculling Center, had a successful day. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``B'' quadruple scull crew opened their campaign in the  
Queen Mother Cup with a 3 3/4 length win over a composite from London 
club Auriol Kensington and Mainzer from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The lightweight pair of Conal Groom and Steve Tucker moved into  
the semifinal of the Double sculls event with an easy win over 
British club Dart Totnes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Augusta heavyweight double of Ian McGowan and Nick Petersen  
also won easily against another British club, Minerva-Bath. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Augusta Sculling Center ``A'' crew, racing in the Queen  
Mother Cup for quadruple scullers, completed a clean sweep of 
victories for all four U.S. national squad crews, gliding to a win 
over a quartet from the London club. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Temple Cup for University eights, Princeton moved into  
the quarterfinals with a 1 1/2 length win over Cherwell from Oxford, 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard's freshmen crew defeated St. Joseph's University ``B''  
team from Philadelphia by 2 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Princess Elizabeth Cup for schoolboy eights, St. Joseph's  
Preparatory School lost by 2 1/2 lengths to Australia's St. Peter's 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Fawley Cup for junior quadruple sculls crews, well-known  
English prep school Eton was too good for the Bachelor's Barge Club 
of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, University of California made its debut in the Ladies  
Plate and beat a composite from London Rowing Club, England, and 
Mainzer, Germany, by three lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	The Berkeley crew will face the British lightweight squad,  
racing as Nottinghamshire County and Oxford Brookes University in 
the semifinals.

<HEADLINE> US Auto Industry On Pace For Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. reported  
Friday that their U.S. sales edged up 1 percent in June, compared 
with their strong performances a year ago, as the auto industry 
continued its steady growth toward a record sales year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, industry sales were up 7  
percent. If sales were to continue at the same seasonally adjusted 
annual rate in the second half, the industry could sell 16.6 
million cars and light trucks, well ahead of the record 16.1 
million sold in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will 1999 be the best year in the U.S. auto industry? The  
question is fast becoming: By how much will the industry sales 
record be eclipsed?'' said Bob Rewey, Ford's sales and marketing 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said its car sales were up 3 percent last month, excluding  
its Jaguar and Volvo units. The strongest gains came in a segment 
that has been given up for dead by some automakers: coupes. Sales 
of the redesigned Mustang were up nearly 23 percent, while sales of 
the Mercury Cougar shot up 166 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But like DaimlerChrysler AG, which reported Thursday that its  
Chrysler unit's sales were down 5 percent last month, Ford and GM 
saw demand for their light trucks level off. Analysts and 
executives blamed the comparison to June 1998, when ``loyalty 
coupons'' and other heavy incentive spending spurred record sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a tough comparison to a year ago,'' said analyst  
David Healy of Burnham Securities Inc. ``I don't think there's any 
real sustained weakness there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's truck sales were flat, with demand for the F-series  
pickup, the nation's most popular vehicle, down fractionally for 
the first time in months. Most of Ford's sport utility vehicles 
also were down. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's truck sales were down about 1 percent. Hard-hit were its  
big SUVs, such as the Chevrolet Suburban, down 24.5 percent, and 
the Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon twins, both down 27 percent. GM is 
winding down production of those models as it prepares to introduce 
redesigned models in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Car sales at GM were up about 2 percent, with the biggest  
percentage gains coming at Buick, Pontiac and Saturn. GM has been 
struggling to get its market share back above 30 percent since last 
year's strikes severely damaged the No. 1 automaker's U.S. sales. 
For the first half, it stood at 29.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has some of the highest rebates available this summer,  
ranging as high as $4,000 on the Oldsmobile Aurora. In addition, GM 
has been placing more emphasis on regional discounts in the past 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've really jacked up incentives aggressively,'' said  
Healy, who estimated GM's discounts were averaging $2,000 a 
vehicle. GM officials said that figure was high, but declined to 
say what the actual figure was. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're point blank going to be competitive in the  
marketplace,'' said Roy Roberts, vice president of North American 
sales. ``But we want to grow our market share profitably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry executives remained optimistic about the rest of the  
year. They praised the Federal Reserve's action this week of only 
slightly raising interest rates while signaling that further rate 
increases may not be needed to cool off inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taking out a little insurance against inflation enhances the  
likelihood that the business expansion will continue into the next 
century,'' Rewey said. ``We believe sales will remain strong in the 
second half of 1999, driven by a healthy economy, confident 
consumers and the introduction of several innovative products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Jameson, vice president of sales and marketing at  
DaimlerChrysler, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the minimalist action by the Fed and the reaction of the  
market and all the other leading indicators, you'd have to be a 
real contrarian to forecast a downturn in the very near future,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other automakers that reported Friday, DaimlerChrysler's  
Mercedes-Benz unit said its U.S. sales were up 8.5 percent in June; 
Hyundai posted a 101 percent gain; Kia improved 47.5 percent; and 
strong demand for its SUVs gave Suzuki a 92 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at Jaguar surged 116 percent last month, while Volvo  
posted a 1 percent gain.

<HEADLINE> HMOs Closing Doors on Many Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 200,000 elderly and disabled Americans  
who get health care through HMOs will have to find alternatives 
when those plans shut their doors to Medicare beneficiaries in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Those affected can stay in their health plans until the end of  
this year, and Medicare officials say they would be well-advised 
not to rush to make a change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would caution them not to act too quickly, to really  
consider their options,'' said Carol Cronin, Medicare's director of 
beneficiary services. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimate of 200,000 people affected by HMO pullouts from  
Medicare next year came from the American Association of Health 
Plans. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs must notify affected beneficiaries individually, by mail,  
no later than Oct. 1. But many will hear from their health plans 
within the next few weeks, AAHP president Karen Ignagni said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plans are going to do their level best to get them a letter  
very soon,'' Ignagni said. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs faced a July 1 deadline to let Medicare know their  
intentions for 2000, and the government is expected soon to 
complete an official tally of pending closings. Some large health 
plans have announced pullouts from selected markets already, 
including Cigna HealthCare, Pacificare Health Systems, United 
HealthCare and Humana. 
</P>
<P>
	For those looking for another HMO, industry experts recommend  
waiting until fall to shop around. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing HMOs will have to provide service through Dec. 31. More  
importantly, those staying in business have until mid-September to 
decide on changes in their fees or benefit packages for 2000. The 
same financial pressures that have prompted some plans to close are 
expected to lead many others to make such changes this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would encourage people not to move too quickly because they  
really need to wait to have a sense of what their alternatives are 
going to be,'' said Howard Drescher, spokesman for Cigna 
HealthCare. 
</P>
<P>
	Those wanting to return to traditional Medicare coverage are  
even more strongly cautioned to stay with their HMOs until Dec. 31. 
That's because special protections allowing them guaranteed access 
to certain Medigap policies -- regardless of pre-existing medical 
conditions -- apply only after the HMO terminates coverage, not if a 
person leaves voluntarily. Medigap policies are for private 
indemnity insurance and are designed to supplement Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	One exception is for those who joined an HMO for the first time  
within the last 12 months: If they quit before the end of the first 
year of HMO enrollment, they are guaranteed re-enrollment in any 
Medigap policy held immediately prior to joining the HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	The anticipated closings in 2000 will mark the second  
consecutive year of upheaval for more than 6 million elderly and 
disabled Americans who, instead of submitting each medical bill 
directly to the government, choose to get their Medicare coverage 
through private managed care health plans that receive flat federal 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, about 400,000 Medicare beneficiaries in more than 30  
states were affected when about 100 HMOs opted against renewing 
1999 Medicare contracts after lawmakers cut the growth in payments 
to the plans as part of their 1997 agreement to balance the federal 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Retirees and disabled Americans who lose their HMOs are still  
covered by Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever decisions HMOs make about doing business with  
Medicare, Medicare will always be there for every beneficiary,'' 
said Medicare Administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle. 
</P>
<P>
	This fall, Medicare will conduct an education campaign to help  
people understand their choices, including mailing them basic 
information about HMOs still available in each zip code and 
offering more details on the Internet and through a toll-free 
telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
	Those beneficiaries who take no action to change their coverage  
will automatically be re-enrolled in traditional Medicare -- in 
which the government directly handles each medical bill -- on Jan. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many of those affected by health plan closings have  
become accustomed to more comprehensive coverage offered by many 
HMOs. HMO perks often include lower out-of-pocket fees and benefits 
Medicare does not normally cover, such as prescription drugs, 
hearing aids and eye examinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Options to fill these voids include joining another HMO -- in  
most places there will be plans left to choose from -- or buying a 
Medigap policy.

<HEADLINE> Fireworks Delayed, Residents Miffed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Independence Day fireworks are exploding in  
some towns around the country, but not the kind that light up the 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mesa, residents have bombarded City Hall with hundreds of  
complaints over a club's decision to push the city's traditional 
July 4 pyrotechnics display back a day, some saying the belated 
show is practically un-American. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sertoma Club cited poor turnout and the reluctance of its  
Mormon members and volunteers to work when the holiday falls on a 
Sunday, like this year. 
</P>
<P>
	City Councilman Jim Davidson said the fireworks dispute has  
generated more public response in the city of 380,000 than any 
other issue in his first year in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overwhelmingly, the population wants it back on the Fourth of  
July, Sunday,'' he said. ``I agree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of my family fought so we can have a Fourth of July.  
Independence Day was the Fourth of July and that's why we celebrate 
on the Fourth of July,'' said Mesa resident Hope Burkhalter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sertoma Club has staged the fireworks show as a charity  
fund-raiser for 35 years. This year the city kicked in $10,000 
toward the show. Some residents believe that since public money is 
involved, the fireworks should go on. 
</P>
<P>
	Many other small towns have also changed holiday plans. Most  
cities and towns in predominantly Mormon Utah have moved 
Independence Day celebrations so they won't conflict with the 
Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fairfax, Va., the city moved its parade and fireworks display  
to Saturday in part because of the difficulty in getting volunteers 
to work on Sunday, said event coordinator Van Garber. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Rockledge Borough, Pa., many residents are angry about a  
town decision to hold a parade one day early out of courtesy to 
churches, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sertoma Club president Harry Friedlander played down the role of  
religion in the Mesa decision. He said the last time Independence 
Day fell on a Sunday, attendance was poor, volunteers were hard to 
come by and the club lost money. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson said the controversy has prompted the City Council to  
re-examine how it deals with private groups that receive taxpayer 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``This (dispute) has really ruined the Fourth of July for me,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE>  N. Ireland Negotiators Struggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Negotiators in Northern Ireland  
struggled today to surmount the single obstacle blocking the 
creation of a new Protestant-Catholic government, the heart of last 
year's troubled peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, said his party  
was prepared to postpone forming the government indefinitely until 
the Irish Republican Army promised to commit itself to a timetable 
for ``decommissioning,'' or surrendering, its arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're going to force society to wait, well, we will  
wait,'' said Trimble, adding that the alternative to securing IRA 
decommissioning was ``to decommission democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The British and Irish prime ministers, Tony Blair and Bertie  
Ahern, entered Stormont, site of the talks, without speaking to 
reporters. They were planning a formal statement outlining progress 
and the potentially dangerous route ahead after a week of 
negotiations that Blair had expected to produce a breakthrough two 
days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Their efforts have failed to reconcile the demands of Trimble's  
Ulster Unionists -- Northern Ireland's major British Protestant 
party -- and the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ulster Unionists insist on a start to IRA disarmament as the  
price for sharing power with Sinn Fein. But Sinn Fein insists the 
government's unconditional, immediate formation is the only way to 
encourage an eventual IRA move. 
</P>
<P>
	As he arrived at Stormont, Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin  
McGuinness criticized the Ulster Unionists for rejecting a paper 
presented Thursday that represented the maximum distance Sinn Fein 
was prepared to go toward promising IRA disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
	That paper said Sinn Fein leaders believed they ``could succeed  
in persuading those with arms to decommission them in accordance 
with the agreement'' if they got their allotted two seats in the 
envisioned 12-member government. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling today's negotiations ``an absolutely critical phase in  
the history of this island,'' McGuinness accused the Ulster 
Unionists of acting like ``spoiled children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn Fein's offer was lauded by Blair as a ``seismic shift'' in  
the party's previous steadfast refusal to link the IRA's arsenal 
with the right to hold office, but the Ulster Unionists want a 
cast-iron assurance that the IRA will disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble, who would lead the government, said Sinn Fein's use of  
``could'' revealed how little had actually been promised. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because `could' also means `could not.' We need to know what  
the IRA actually will do, and when,'' he told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, Gen. John de Chastelain, the Canadian head of the  
international commission that has been seeking disarmament of the 
IRA and outlawed pro-British groups, presented his report on the 
situation to Blair and Ahern and said he hoped it would ``move 
peace forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report confirmed that the IRA, via de Chastelain's  
occasional meetings with McGuinness, had yet to give any 
``unambiguous commitment'' to disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, de Chastelain judged that Sinn Fein's latest  
proposal ``may translate into a commitment to decommission 
paramilitary arms'' by the IRA. For the intended May deadline for 
the IRA's total disarmament, he wrote, ``the process of 
decommissioning should begin as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All sides had been hoping for a breakthrough before July's  
``marching season,'' when hard-line Protestants parades across 
Northern Ireland cause sectarian tensions to run at their highest. 
</P>
<P>
	The major marching group, the Orange Order, says it will defy  
restrictions on a march Sunday in the Protestant heartland of 
Portadown, where confrontations have inspired the worst violence in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Before dawn today, British soldiers began erecting obstacles  
across farm fields to prevent Orangemen this weekend from reaching 
the nearby Garvaghy Road, Portadown's major Catholic section.

<HEADLINE> Jones' SUV Held Up As Example </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- George Jones' mangled vehicle will serve  
as a vivid -- and elevated -- reminder of the dangers of drinking and 
driving this holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lexus sport utility vehicle that Jones wrecked in March is  
being dangled 100 feet in the air from a crane just off Interstate 
40. It has a sign reading, ``Drive Safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message is being sponsored by radio station WKDF and the  
owner of the car, Raymond Turek, who paid $22,000 for it a few 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The station will run a promotional spot taped by Jones all  
weekend that says, in part: ``Don't drink and drive. It could kill 
you. And that's the cold, hard truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was driving alone when he lost control and smashed the  
Lexus into a concrete bridge. He nearly died, but has since 
recovered enough to perform. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer pleaded guilty to driving while impaired and  
violating the state's open-container law. He was fined $550 and 
ordered to receive counseling.

<HEADLINE> Primary Calendar Concerns GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An advisory panel being set up by the chairman  
of the Republican National Committee will look into ways to stop 
states from holding earlier and earlier presidential primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is so compressed and it goes off like a string of  
firecrackers once it starts,'' RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson said 
Friday. ``A person who might have gotten a bounce because of a 
surprisingly good showing in an early primary ... (won't have) time 
to really maximize that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In releasing a tentative primary schedule for next year,  
Nicholson noted that the Iowa caucuses, one of the first major 
events in 2000, could come as early as Jan. 31. And by the end of 
February, about 40 percent more delegates will have been chosen 
than by the same time in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our major concern is that not enough people get involved in  
this process of choosing who the nominees will be for the most 
important job on Earth,'' Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I think if you would ask the candidates, they would  
agree,'' he said. ``They would like to have more time to be out in 
more states and learning their issues and learning more about those 
regions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson said he will appoint senior Republican officials to  
his advisory panel, which probably will be chaired by a former RNC 
leader since many former chairmen ``have run for and been elected 
president of the United States. ... They've been through the mill 
in this process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will issue findings by the end of the year so that the  
suggestions can be considered during the RNC winter meeting next 
January in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will instruct them to examine all possible options,  
including the plan recently put forth by the National Association 
of Secretaries of State, which is a regional rotating primary,'' he 
said. ``I'm going to ask them to look at other possibilities, 
including a stronger incentive-based program, perhaps, a national 
delegate selection day, and others that have been put on the table 
around the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previous incentives, like giving states more delegates if they  
push back their primary, have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson said the RNC rules committee also is studying the  
issue.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank: N.Y., London Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The 5,500 layoffs resulting from  
Deutsche Bank's takeover of Bankers Trust will come mainly in New 
York and London -- places where the two banks had overlapping 
trading operations, Deutsche Bank said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs will be split ``about 50-50'' between the two  
cities, bank spokesman Dierk Hartwig said. None of the layoffs will 
be in Germany because Bankers Trust ``had no presence in Germany'' 
before the merger, hence there is no overlapping, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	In a radio interview Friday, chairman Rolf Breuer said both  
Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust employees will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5,500 job cuts, which have already begun, represent almost 6  
percent of the current workforce of 96,000 employees in the merged 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger of Germany's biggest bank and Bankers Trust, the  
eighth largest bank in the United States, was completed last month. 
</P>
<P>
	It created the world's largest commercial financial institution  
with assets of about 1.55 trillion German marks ($820 billion), as 
of March 31.

<HEADLINE> Congress Mulls Asbestos Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opponents of a plan to resolve asbestos injury  
claims in an administrative procedure instead of the courts say it 
would possibly deny thousands of people the compensation they 
deserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Trial Lawyers of America said it doesn't  
believe legislation pending in the House and the Senate will 
provide badly needed relief for a legal system now choked by 
hundreds of thousands of slow-moving asbestos-related lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they say, it will create another layer of bureaucracy  
for people -- many of them suffering from cancer and other disabling 
diseases -- to fight through. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not fair,'' Richard Middleton, the group's  
president-elect, told the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday. 
``It is not fast, it is not efficient and it is not right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But supporters praised the idea as a better and faster way to  
get money to sick and injured people who really deserve it. It also 
would weed out people who are not sick, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The courts of this land simply are not equipped to handle the  
more than 200,000 asbestos-related cases currently in the system 
and the 8,000 new filings thrust upon the courts on the last month 
alone,'' said Conrad Mallet, a former chief justice of the Michigan 
Supreme Court and president of a business group lobbying for the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only losers are a few dozen powerful lawyers,'' said  
Christopher Edley Jr., a Harvard Law School professor. ``This bill 
benefits almost everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Supreme Court decision that threw out a proposed $1.5 billion  
asbestos agreement last week called on Congress to create a better 
way to settle asbestos claims, saying current rules are not 
flexible enough to accommodate cases involving multiple claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would create a quasi-governmental agency, the  
Asbestos Resolution Corp. Asbestos companies would pay all the 
costs of the non-judicial administrative process, supporters said. 
No taxpayer dollars would be used. 
</P>
<P>
	The first stage of the process would be the determination of  
whether the applicant was ill or injured. If an applicant qualifies 
and receives a ``certificate of medical eligibility,'' the case 
would proceed to mediation if a settlement with the potentially 
liable companies isn't reached during a 60-day grace period. 
</P>
<P>
	If mediation fails, the claimant could choose to file a lawsuit  
or try arbitration. Only claimants with the medical certificate and 
a release from mediation would be allowed to go to court. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation's seven-member board of directors would be  
nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. A Medical 
Advisory Board would provide expert advice to the board on medical 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Payments would be made only to claimants who can demonstrate  
that they are sick or have been injured as a result of exposure to 
asbestos using criteria spelled out in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Punitive damages would be prohibited ``so as to ensure that  
funds would be available to compensate people who may in the future 
become impaired by asbestos-related diseases,'' said a Judiciary 
Committee statement explaining the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Claimants would be able to collect money for nonmalignant  
disease, such as asbestosis -- scarring of the lungs -- without 
losing their right to future compensation if they develop cancer 
later, supporters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney fees and expenses would be capped at 25 percent.  
Supporters of the plan said that as much as two-thirds of some 
asbestos awards today go to lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1283.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits 24th, 25th Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his 24th and 25th home runs  
Friday night, a pair of two-run shots for St. Louis off Brian 
Anderson of the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's first homer landed in the bullpen beyond the  
left-field wall, a drive measured at 392 feet. He topped that with 
a 432-footer in the fifth, a ball that bounced off the Stadium Club 
glass just below Big Mac Land and the upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his third multi-homer game this season and the 56th of  
his career, putting him one ahead of Jimmie Foxx for fourth on the 
career list. Babe Ruth is No. 1 on the list with 72, followed by 
Willie Mays with 63 and Hank Aaron with 62. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire had 10 multi-homer games in his record 70-homer season  
last year, including a three-homer game against Arizona on April 
14. He has seven homers and 15 RBIs in 35 career at-bats against 
the Diamondbacks, and his last three this season have come against 
them, including a homer June 24 at Arizona off Omar Daal. 
</P>
<P>
	This was his first multi-homer game this season at Busch  
Stadium, where he has 62 homers in 142 career games. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of the homers came with J.D. Drew aboard. Drew doubled with  
one out in the first and singled with one out in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire remained well off his record pace. At this point last  
season, he had 37 homers.

<HEADLINE> Gas Stop Produces Riches in Minn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEVILLE, Minn. (AP) -- Farrah Slad's wish list is still taking  
shape, but she's eyeing a trip to Mexico, veterinary school and 
perhaps a new car. 
</P>
<P>
	Why not all of it? Ms. Slad beat 80-million-to-1 odds to claim a  
$150 million Powerball jackpot prize on Thursday. It's the 
third-biggest prize ever in the multistate lottery, and one of the 
richest jackpots ever for an individual. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Slad chose to collect all the money in a ``cash option''  
lump sum worth $78.8 million. After taxes, she will receive $50.4 
million. She is 21. 
</P>
<P>
	She saw the winning numbers on television on Wednesday night  
while rewinding a videotape of ``Austin Powers: International Man 
of Mystery.'' At first, she thought she had matched all the numbers 
except the Powerball. Then she checked them with her parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked it over a hundred times,'' she said, ``and it didn't  
seem real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for a $5 impulse buy at a Holiday store in nearby  
Baxter. She was on her way to dinner at her parents' house, and 
stopped off only because her 1991 Acura Integra was running low on 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank my parents and my car for this,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	She hadn't bought any Powerball tickets since last summer, and  
allowed the computer to pick her numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest Powerball jackpot was $295.7 million on July 29 last  
year. The winning ticket was sold at a gas station in Richmond, 
Ind., and was bought by 13 machinists who worked together in 
Westerville, Ohio.

<P>
	Ms. Slad, who earns $9 an hour at a mortgage company, told her  
boss, Mark Lunde, that she would miss work on Thursday because of a 
death in the family before claiming the jackpot at lottery 
headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three weeks ago, she'd talked with Lunde about what they  
would do if they won the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunde said he was naming things he'd buy, while Ms. Slad said  
she would spend money on her family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she'll be very responsible with it,'' Lunde said.  
``She's been very generous and kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Ms. Slad she will likely perform some ``good deeds,''  
which will include some purchases for her parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Slad said she plans to hire an attorney and an investment  
adviser soon, though she's in no hurry to make big decisions. She 
said she wants to train her replacement at work and let things sink 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of thinking to do,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Denies Link to Financier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican formally distanced itself from a  
U.S. insurance scandal and two priests who reportedly provided a 
cloak of respectability for a missing financier. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first official statement on the matter, the Vatican said  
Thursday a charitable foundation established by Martin Frankel, the 
missing money manager, had neither legal standing with the Vatican 
nor an account at the Vatican bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators in the United States suspect the charity was  
merely a front for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel disappeared May 5 after a fire at his home in Greenwich,  
Conn. He is being sought in the disappearance of at least $200 
million from several insurance companies. A lawsuit filed by some 
of the companies put the loss at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing may be as much as $1.98 billion from the St.  
Francis of Assisi Foundation, which Frankel established in the 
British Virgin Islands last August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Peter Jacobs and Monsignor Emilio Colagiovanni were  
apparently persuaded by Frankel to support the foundation, 
according to The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said  
the Holy See had no relations with Jacobs and neither furnished nor 
received funds from the St. Francis foundation or the Monitor 
Ecclesiasticus Foundation, of which Colagiovanni is president. 
</P>
<P>
	That foundation was established by the archdiocese of Naples in  
1967 and was not connected to the Vatican, Navarro-Valls said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican bank, formally called the Institute for Religious  
Works, was badly tainted by a banking scandal in the 1980s due to 
the collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Offers To Lend Bush Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nevermind that George W. Bush raised a record  
$36.25 million for his presidential campaign during the first half 
of the year. Republican rival Pat Buchanan is offering to lend the 
front-runner money. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush declined to compete in a New Hampshire straw poll this  
weekend that charges participants $25 each. ``We are uncomfortable 
with the idea of our New Hampshire supporters having to spend their 
hard-earned money to show their support of Governor Bush,'' Sen. 
Judd Gregg wrote to the poll organizers on behalf of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand the governor's problem,'' Angela ``Bay''  
Buchanan responded Friday. ``After speaking with my brother Pat, 
the Buchanan campaign has agreed to loan the Bush campaign the 
price of any tickets his New Hampshire supporters may need.''

<HEADLINE> Branch Davidian Suit Will Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- A federal judge has cleared the way for a  
lawsuit that claims the federal government is responsible for the 
fiery and deadly end to the 1993 Branch Davidian standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. pared the number of  
defendants and plaintiffs, but ruled Thursday that the case can go 
to trial, said Mike Caddell, lead attorney for the Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what the judge did is a great victory for the  
Davidians and for the country,'' Caddell said. ``Our folks can't be 
happier, and look forward to having their day in court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit -- filed by surviving Davidians and the relatives of  
the dead -- challenges the government's conclusion that the 
Davidians started the fire and that they also shot first during the 
federal raid on their compound. 
</P>
<P>
	David Koresh and about 80 followers died in the fire that ended  
the 51-day standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants include Attorney General Janet Reno and top  
officials of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the 
FBI, including then-Director William Sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still reviewing the decision at this point,'' said Myron  
Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The multimillion-dollar lawsuit has been on hold since early May  
while an appeals court considered whether Smith should be removed 
from the case. The plaintiffs wanted another judge because Smith 
has ruled in criminal cases involving Branch Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Davidians contend that when federal agents punched through  
the walls and fired tear gas into the cult compound on April 19, 
1993, the canisters ignited, burning the building and the people 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional hearings have pointed to mistakes by the law  
enforcement officers, but none has been charged with a crime.

<HEADLINE> Coke: Another Recall in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Coca-Cola recalled a new batch of mineral  
water in Poland on Friday, this time due to bacteria contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall was the second this week in Poland and came even as  
the world's largest soft-drink company was restocking Belgian 
supermarket shelves with Coke as it attempts to recover from a 
four-week health scare. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke trucks in Belgium were bedecked with huge signs proclaiming  
``Your Coca-Cola is Back'' and full-page ads appearing Friday in 
major Belgian newspapers declared, ``The problems that affected 
some of our products are completely solved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in Warsaw, Coca-Cola Co. was expanding a recall.  
</P>
<P>
	Although no illnesses have been reported in Poland, a Health  
Ministry expert said sampling at the plant discovered E. coli 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Some forms of the bacteria can cause illness and death, but the  
experts said that while they were trying to identify the type of E. 
coli involved, the amount found at the Coca-Cola plant in southwest 
Poland was so small that it posed no health risk. Coca-Cola said 
the bacteria it detected was not hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Pugsley, general-director of Coca-Cola Beverages Poland,  
told a news conference that an estimated 180,000 plastic half-liter 
containers of Bonaqa Plus mineral water were being pulled off store 
shelves for failing to meet quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest recall extends a dismal summer in Europe that has  
cost Coca-Cola Co. and its bottlers at least $60 million. After 
hundreds of people complained of illness from drinking its 
beverages in Belgium and France last month, the company recalled 
its beverages in those countries and faced restrictions on the 
sales of its products elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the June 25 discovery by a consumer in Poland of mold  
in a bottle of Bonaqa mineral water, which led the company to 
withdraw all of its beverages in one-third liter returnable glass 
bottles earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Pugsley announced the recall of Bonaqa Plus mineral  
water, which boasts a higher content of magnesium and calcium than 
the regular Bonaqa brand. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonaqa Plus was bottled only June 4-6, and Pugsley said the  
company would now reconsider whether to make any more. 
</P>
<P>
	A first round of routine testing detected no problems, he said,  
but a second round of testing this week -- which he also called 
routine -- showed unacceptable levels of bacteria in the batch 
produced on June 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``The product poses no health threat but does not meet company  
standards of quality,'' Pugsley said. He said the problem was 
caused by procedural mistakes that were never repeated. 
</P>
<P>
	While Coca-Cola officials deny any problem with the water at the  
plant at Sroda Slaska, the chief sanitary official in the Health 
Ministry said tests found excessive amounts of bacteria in the 
water used at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, Irena Glowaczewska, said further testing was  
needed to determine if the bacteria originated in the plant or if 
the water supply was contaminated. ``If other beverages are 
produced from this water, then other products could also be 
contaminated,'' she told reporters after Coca-Cola's news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Another health expert, Janina Stefanska of the Health Ministry,  
identified bacteria found in samples of the Bonaqa Plus mineral 
water as E. coli. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Health Ministry news conference, Coca-Cola spokeswoman  
Sonya Soutus said the company stood by its statement that its tests 
showed the water source was uncontaminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Soutus said the company's tests showed the bacteria was a  
``nonhazardous form of coliform bacteria.'' She said all production 
at the plant was halted Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Pugsley, Friday's announcement was unrelated to the  
much wider Polish recall announced Wednesday of all one-third liter 
glass bottles of Coca-Cola beverages due to mold found in some of 
the bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanislaw Kafel of the government Food Institute said the mold  
posed no health threat because of the small amounts involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Pugsley said he had no estimate of the cost of the recalls.  
</P>
<P>
	But the latest problems so far seem to have little impact on  
Coca-Cola sales in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Sebastian Modzelewski, a buyer for the Makro Cash  
and Carry Poland chain of supermarkets, there has been no drop in 
sales despite the health scare publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewa Pietrzak, sales attendant at a small downtown Warsaw grocery  
said people were not concerned about the news and continued to buy 
Coca-Cola products. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have drunk Bonaqa today myself. I looked closely at the  
bottle, it was clean so I drank it,'' she said. ``Everything is 
contaminated these days, meat, vegetables are sprayed with 
chemicals. We shouldn't panic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgium, Coca-Cola resumed production early this week under  
strict new government sanitary standards. But the company still 
relies on imports from neighboring nations to resupply shops and 
supermarkets and not all sizes of bottles were available as the 
weekend began. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have waited with lots of patience,'' its ads told  
consumers.

<HEADLINE> Agencies Announce Egg-Safety Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an effort to assure eggs are kept fresh and  
disease-free from hen to skillet, two federal agencies have 
proposed guidelines for refrigerating and cooking eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture Department  
on Thursday proposed a federal requirement that eggs and egg 
products prepared for consumers be kept refrigerated at 45 degrees 
or colder. 
</P>
<P>
	The action came at the same time a report criticizing their  
efforts was presented at a congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the General Accounting Office found that too many  
federal agencies have done too little, too slowly to protect 
Americans from salmonella-contaminated eggs. It concluded that new 
national standards and better coordination among the several 
agencies with jurisdiction over the issue is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA and Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service  
share responsibility for measures designed to combat food-borne 
illnesses. The FDA regulations apply to grocery stores, nursing 
homes and schools, while the FSIS directive applies apply to 
warehouses that store eggs packed in containers for sale to 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the refrigeration requirement, the FDA has  
proposed that each egg carton carry safe handling instructions for 
consumers that warn that eggs ``may contain harmful bacteria known 
to cause serious illness, especially in children, the elderly, and 
persons with weakened immune systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The instructions recommend that eggs be kept refrigerated, that  
egg yolks be cooked until they are firm, and that foods containing 
eggs be cooked thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
	Further measures to control egg-borne diseases are being  
developed by the President's Council on Food Safety and will be 
completed by Nov. 1, the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Undercooked eggs have been a common source of a digestive  
illness caused by a pathogen called salmonella enteritis. Incidence 
of the disease has decreased by 44 percent since 1996, but it 
remains a troublesome public health problem. Officials said the 
proposed new measures could prevent up to 66,000 illnesses and 40 
deaths a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw or undercooked eggs can be found in such favorites as runny  
fried eggs, thick-cut French toast, Caesar salad and unbaked cookie 
dough. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmonella Enteritis can cause diarrhea, fever, abdominal  
cramps, headache, nausea and vomiting. Healthy people usually 
recover, but the disease can be life-threatening for children, the 
elderly and for persons with weakened immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The new proposed regulations are being published in the Federal  
Register and will be open to comment for the next 75 days.

<HEADLINE> Kurt Andersen Sees Future of TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hey, fellow couch potatoes, these are pretty  
good ideas: 
</P>
<P>
	-- E!2, pronounced ``E squared,'' would be a channel spun off  
from cable's E! Entertainment network airing nothing but raw 
footage of celebrity events. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Another cable service, The Chopper Channel, would run 24-hour  
video from helicopters. (``The big picture, from the air, on the 
air, for you!'') 
</P>
<P>
	-- And on the cool new series ``Supreme Court,'' celebrity  
lawyers would argue celebrities' cases in a fake-trial setting 
presided over by Judge Robert Bork. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't look for this programming on your TV just yet. But it's  
part of Kurt Andersen's eerily plausible, wickedly amusing vision 
of life one short year from now, as captured in ``Turn of the 
Century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with mapping the media universe, Andersen's instructive  
new novel charts a modern marriage whose partners (Lizzie runs a 
computer-software firm; George produces TV shows) face the 
prevailing struggle of the new millennium: convergence. 
</P>
<P>
	Web sites, it seems, are fated to converge with TV. Business  
must converge with art, show biz with real life. The sacred, of 
course, is converging with the profane. And all the while, staying 
converged with those you hold dear gets trickier by the nanosecond. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's this sense that the old rules are gone,'' Andersen  
said in a recent interview. ``How can I take advantage of that? How 
am I going to be crushed by that? It's an odd new Zeitgeist, 
terrifying and exciting simultaneously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then who can make sense of it? Certainly not George, despite  
pulling down $16,575 per week as a TV magnate, or Lizzie, who just 
might sell her company to Microsoft for $30 million dollars -- all 
at the possible cost of their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	And who can plot the future? Not even Andersen, who shares the  
uncertainty voiced by George and Lizzie's daughter: ``Is that a 
good thing or a bad thing, Daddy?'' she repeatedly inquires. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer is, both good and bad, according to the novel, whose  
crafting left its author in ``a state of acute ambivalence, more 
than resolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter. It's hard to imagine anyone laying out the  
possibilities and pitfalls of the bitstream revolution in a manner 
more lucid yet rambunctious. More than telling a story, ``Turn of 
the Century'' tells you ideas. Big and small and usually hilarious. 
By the bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Turn to any of its 659 frisky pages and find passing reference  
to a cafe called Ellipsis... (dots included). Or this USA Today 
headline: ``Experts Fear We're Suffering 'Third Millennium' 
Malaise.'' Or a consultant's advice on anchor-appropriate surnames: 
``Nonethnic and bisyllabic with the accent on the first -- like 
RATH-er, BRO-kaw, KOP-pel, JEN-nings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One part Evelyn Waugh and one part Wired magazine, ``Turn of the  
Century'' is a high-res social satire of the dot-com age. 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen, 44, came to it naturally. A gangly intellectual with  
tortoise-shell glasses and a wry wit, he co-created the humor 
magazine Spy, ran New York magazine, dabbled in TV production and 
currently writes for The New Yorker. Earlier this year he was a 
runner-up for president of cable's Comedy Central. Clearly, he 
knows the media inside out, understands all the players and their 
fatuous folkways. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Turn of the Century,'' he set out to create ``a hyper-real  
world that could fit into the real world we inhabit, seamlessly,'' 
as he told TV interviewer Charlie Rose, who, naturally, is among 
the media figures and pop-culture citations with which his book is 
brimming. 
</P>
<P>
	And so it goes: Andersen's convergence of what is and what could  
be. 
</P>
<P>
	Just consider the programming ideas listed above. They seem at  
once preposterous and plausible, which, if you hadn't noticed, are 
conditions no longer mutually exclusive. This marketplace mentality 
is what fuels George's series, ``Real Time'' -- a news magazine 
combined with a hard-hitting drama where the actors and journalists 
are interchangeable. 
</P>
<P>
	Preposterous. But since it just might sell, also plausible.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the moment of absolute hegemony of marketplace  
values,'' Andersen said. And among the media, those marketplace 
values swell into this chorus: Let us entertain you! 
</P>
<P>
	``Entertainment, by its nature, is whatever the majority thinks  
is funny or sad or moving,'' Andersen noted. ``So, to regard 
everything, including news, as entertainment is simply another way 
of saying that attracting the most eyeballs is the goal -- period. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can also make it good, so much the better. But there no  
longer is an independent set of values in healthy conflict with the 
profit-making motive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, everything you see or hear must fit into a business plan,  
Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity for particular, somewhat crazy passions, among  
the creators of culture and the consumers as well, is less than it 
once was. I think there is a sense of joylessness combined with the 
excitement over what's going to happen next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's going to happen next? Maybe something called TVTVTV.  
Played on monitors installed in its own fleet of school buses, it 
would program nothing but advertising for products aimed at kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Appalling? Brilliant! Why is Andersen giving million-dollar  
ideas away? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best of both worlds,'' he replied, smiling. ``I get  
to invent them and imagine what they'd be like -- and I don't have 
to ask myself, Is this really what my life has come to?'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`20/20': Correspondent Chris Wallace reports how some domestic  
cleaning personnel may be cleaning up the wrong way. In 
hidden-camera footage, he captures one cleaning woman rifling 
through drawers and pocketing cash she finds hidden around the 
house. ``I'd love to have someone clean my house,'' says one victim 
of maid theft. ``But I don't trust anyone in my home anymore.'' It 
airs on ABC News' ``20/20'' tonight at 10 p.m. EDT.

<HEADLINE> Former Teen Olympic Swimmer Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- Anita Nall was a  
record-breaking swimmer and an Olympic gold medalist at 15 -- and 
out of the sport by 19. 
</P>
<P>
	After overcoming health problems that led her to quit, Nall is  
back in the pool and heading the U.S. team at the 20th World 
University Games, where Friday's action was limited to preliminary 
round soccer matches. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening ceremony is Saturday, when events get underway in  
earnest with gymnastics, basketball and volleyball. Over 4,000 
athletes are expected to take part in the 12 sports on tap for the 
biannual games, which run through July 13 on the Spanish island of 
Mallorca. 
</P>
<P>
	Swimming starts Sunday, and Nall can't wait to make her return  
to international competition after a four-year layoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great opportunity for me,'' said Nall, who turns 23  
this month. ``I don't know what to expect out there. But the 
thought of losing doesn't even faze me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was seemingly born to win.  
</P>
<P>
	Though she has long gone by her middle name, Anita, Nall's first  
name is Nadia. She was named for Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci, 
who captivated the world with perfect 10s at the 1976 Olympics the 
day Nall's mother went into labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Nall made quite a splash in 1992, smashing the world record for  
the 200 meters breaststroke twice in one day at the national 
Olympic trials, where she also won the 100 breaststroke. The 
Towson, Md., native went on to win gold, silver and bronze medals 
at the Barcelona Games. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a high school freshman and a star with all the  
trappings: endorsement deals, magazine photo spreads. 
</P>
<P>
	``That all seems like forever ago and a whole different person  
ago,'' Nall said. 
</P>
<P>
	That, in large part, is because she struggled throughout 1995  
with what she said was eventually determined to be a blood pressure 
abnormality, and went to the 1996 U.S. trials for the Atlanta 
Olympics without proper preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nall finished fourth in both breaststroke events, failing to  
make the team, and promptly retired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was probably already beaten before getting in the pool,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nall went through several doctors before one was able to  
successfully diagnose and treat her. In May 1998, she returned to 
her favorite pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, she qualified for this University Games  
team, and now has the 2000 Sydney Olympics in her sights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt really reassured when I qualified and thought why  
wouldn't I try this for one more year,'' said Nall, who is studying 
communications and Spanish at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	She is a co-captain of the U.S. swimming team, and an  
acknowledged leader. ``I try the best I can to lead and share 
experiences I've had that in any way can help,'' Nall said. ``Now 
I'm a strong individual, an adult. Before, I was a piece of clay, 
molded by others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another past breaststroke phenom, Amanda Beard, is also on the  
U.S. team. Beard was 14 when she took one gold and two silvers at 
the 1996 Olympics, and will swim the 100 meters breaststroke in 
Mallorca. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Rises to 4.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The unemployment rate edged up slightly to 4.3  
percent in June even though job growth showed a strong rebound 
during the month as amusement parks, restaurants and construction 
firms gobbled up workers, the Labor Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing, however, continued to miss out on the economic  
good times, with job losses in that sector now totaling nearly a 
half-million workers since the Asian crisis hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate for more than a year has been at levels not  
seen in nearly three decades. Unemployment in May had dipped to a 
29-year low of 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, which is hoping the good economy  
will convince voters to keep a Democrat in the White House next 
year, pointed to the creation of 268,000 new jobs in June as a sign 
that the current expansion is steaming ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamentals of this economy remain strong,'' Labor  
Secretary Alexis Herman said, noting that unemployment for blacks 
dipped to another record low. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets, which are worried about inflationary  
pressures arising from tight labor markets, took today's report in 
stride. The Dow Jones industrial average was up about 50 points in 
morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing lost another 35,000 jobs in June, bringing the  
total job loss at factories since March 1998 to 488,000. 
Manufacturing has been the hardest hit sector from the global 
financial turmoil, suffering a loss of major export markets 
overseas and increased competition from cheap imports. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report today, the Commerce Department said orders to  
American factories for manufactured goods rebounded in May, rising 
1.1 percent, led by a big increase in demand for aircraft, autos 
and other transportation products. 
</P>
<P>
	The low overall jobless rate is a result of the long economic  
expansion. The country is now in its ninth year of uninterrupted 
growth, a peacetime record. This long stretch without a recession 
has allowed prosperity to reach many sectors of the workforce who 
traditionally lag behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said today that unemployment for blacks fell to a  
new record low of 7.3 percent in June. Rates for women and 
hispanics remained close to their lowest levels in three decades 
</P>
<P>
	Employment at American businesses accelerated sharply last month  
with a total of 268,000 new jobs created with all industries except 
manufacturing and mining posting solid gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in payroll jobs was slightly stronger than  
economists had been expecting and signaled that labor markets 
remained exceptionally healthy going into the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve on Wednesday boosted a key short-term  
interest rate by a quarter point, citing concerns that tight labor 
markets could begin pushing inflation higher as workers demand 
higher wages. 
</P>
<P>
	While financial markets were initially encouraged that the  
central bank signaled that one rate hike may be all that is needed 
to keep inflation under control, analysts said the strong June jobs 
report means the Fed might still feel the need to raise rates again 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,  
increased by 3.7 percent in June, compared to a year ago, to 
$13.23. This was up only slightly from the May year-over-year 
increase of 3.5 percent. Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, 
Lufkin and Jenrette, said Fed policymakers are certain to be 
concerned about this upward creep in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The gain in payroll jobs represented a bounce back from an  
unusually weak performance in May, when business payrolls shrank by 
5,000 workers, the first outright decline in payroll growth since 
January 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The declines in manufacturing jobs were widespread last month,  
led by large job losses at aircraft factories and plants making 
electrical equipment and apparel. Mining, another hardhit sector, 
lost another 3,000 jobs in June. 
</P>
<P>
	But construction, which had suffered big job losses in May,  
rebounded last month, posting a gain of 26,000 jobs with plumbing, 
electrical work and roofing all showing increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall gain of 268,000 payroll jobs was led by strong  
hiring at amusement parks with a gain of 20,000 jobs in amusement 
and recreation services. 
</P>
<P>
	Also posting big gains were retail trade, which added 49,000  
jobs in June, bringing total job growth in this sector to 265,000 
through the first half of this year. The largest gain in June came 
from hiring at restaurants and bars. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.1 percent gain in factory orders was led by a big 9.5  
percent increase in demand for transportation products in May, 
rebounding from a 12.5 percent decrease in the previous month.

<HEADLINE> Study: Immigrants Assimilate Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Within 20 years of arrival in the United  
States, more than 60 percent of immigrants lived in their own homes 
in 1990, says a study on how well immigrants integrate into 
American society. 
</P>
<P>
	About 76 percent of immigrants who had lived in the country for  
40 years were naturalized citizens, and three of four spoke English 
well within 10 years of arriving in the United States, said the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	``Immigrants are much better prepared in English than is  
commonly thought,'' said the report, released Thursday by the 
National Immigration Forum, an immigrants' advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Assimilation is not about immigrants rejecting their past, but  
about people of different racial, religious and cultural 
backgrounds coming to believe that they are part of an overarching 
American family,'' the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assimilation is a long-term and sometimes multigenerational  
process, the report said. Immigrants rarely discard their native 
language and culture immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	There were more than 26 million foreign-born people in the  
United States in 1998, about 9.8 percent of the total population, 
the report said. ``Of these, 67.2 percent had arrived in the U.S. 
before 1990, with almost a third (32.8 percent) settling between 
1990 and 1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 27.1 percent of immigrants living in the United  
States were of Mexican origin. The Philippines were the second most 
common country of origin, at 4.6 percent, and China was third, with 
3.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly one-third of all immigrants live in California. Six  
states are home to more than 70 percent of immigrants: California, 
New York, Florida, Texas, Illinois and New Jersey, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Data for the study were taken from the 1990 census and the  
Current Population Survey, which tracks generational differences.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Financial Markets Rebounding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Two regional stock markets marked the second  
anniversary of the Asian financial crisis Friday by reaching their 
highest levels in 21 months, more signs of improvement that have 
become nearly a daily routine. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though everyone agrees that the rebound of Asia's stock  
and currency markets has been remarkable, many economists say it's 
still too early to say the region is on the road to a full 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thailand, where the crisis began July 2, 1997, when the baht  
currency was floated and then collapsed, the Central Bank is now 
considering buying dollars to slow its rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indonesia, one of the worst victims, the stock market has  
bounced back a remarkable 160 percent from last year's low point. 
The rupiah currency, which fell so far it became a laughingstock on 
world markets, is now 150 percent higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Japan, the world's second largest economy, is struggling to  
prevent the yen from rising against the dollar. The reason? That 
would hurt exporters such as Sony Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp., 
crucial assets in a country battling its worst recession since 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 4.8 percent to close  
with its highest point gain of the year and its best finish since 
Oct. 9, 1997. In Japan, the Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.40 percent 
to reach its highest level since Sept. 29, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong  
Kong, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand, also have 
experienced strong recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
	P.K. Basu, chief economist for Southeast Asia at Credit Suisse  
First Boston in Singapore, said prolonged rallies such as these are 
a sign of hope for the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as all of Asia went down together, all of Asia can rise  
together. A rising tide will lift all boats in Asia,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased demand in countries that recover the fastest will  
drive recovery in the rest of the region, Basu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Japan, whose economy is bigger than all the other Asian  
ones combined, could be helped by increased demand from its 
recovering neighbors, given how much they import from Japan, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other economists are less optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	Market rallies such as these ``are not based on fundamentals.  
They are based on expectations. This euphoria may be a bit 
premature,'' said Bruce Gale, an analyst for Political and Economic 
Risk Consultancy, a research firm based in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse still, such improvements could lead governments to delay  
the painful economic reforms demanded by the International Monetary 
Fund in an effort to prevent another crisis, Gale said. 
</P>
<P>
	They include reducing Asia's excessively cozy relationship  
between governments and businesses that led to a lot of bad 
investments, and redesigning faulty and struggling banking sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia's turmoil began in 1997 with a huge and sudden withdrawal  
of foreign investment from countries such as Thailand and their 
fast-growing economies, setting off a banking and currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The baht nose-dived, and the Thai financial system quickly  
collapsed. Meltdowns followed across Asia, eventually spreading to 
emerging markets from Russia to Latin America. Even Wall Street 
suffered some big losses as investors worried whether the strong 
U.S. economy could withstand a global crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Asian markets have stabilized or improved  
dramatically, and some of the region's economies are recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea, the largest Asian economy to require an IMF  
bailout, saw its gross domestic product grow by 4.6 percent in the 
first quarter of this year. Singapore's GDP grew by 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Indonesian economy grew 1.82 percent in the second  
quarter, compared with a year earlier. It was the first 
year-to-year rise in growth since the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But unemployment remains high across the region, and no sign  
exists that the huge numbers of poor people are falling. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, a recent World Bank report said the world's population  
of people in abject poverty grew by 200 million in the past decade. 
The report cited the Asian crisis as a primary cause, and it called 
for bailout programs and preventative measures to provide urgent 
relief for suffering people, not just suffering economies. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Korea, where financial markets appear healthy again,  
some economists say it's too early to make too much of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``The markets show that South Korea has come a long way since  
the breakout of the crisis,'' said Kim Byong-joo, an economics 
professor at Seoul's Sogang University. ``Most economists, 
including me, agree that the foreign currency crisis that triggered 
the financial difficulties is definitely over. 
</P>
<P>
	``But many also believe that the end of the currency crisis  
means only the beginning of our economic recovery. Now that we have 
relatively stable markets, it is time to push hard for corporate 
restructuring and financial reforms,'' Kim said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Approves Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government approved key economic  
reforms Friday, apparently inspired by the improved prospects of a 
badly needed foreign loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank announced it was lifting a major  
currency-trading restriction, while the upper house of parliament 
approved several economic bills -- all conditions for getting a $4.5 
billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF team that visited Moscow this week praised Russia's  
economic performance and indicated that lending could soon be 
resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian government officials sounded upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
	``The (economic) crisis has gradually become history, and I hope  
we will soon cease talking about it,'' Prime Minister Sergei 
Stepashin was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabinet officials have been making similar pronouncements for  
months, but the millions of Russians struggling to pay for food and 
housing would be hard-pressed to see any difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Moscow is eager to meet the IMF's terms and secure the  
loan, which would allow Russia to pay off this year's payments on 
old debts from the fund and avoid a potentially disastrous default. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank announced that on Monday it will lift a ban on  
foreign banks buying hard currency with rubles kept in required 
Central Bank correspondent accounts. The ban was issued as a way to 
control the ruble's rate by limiting the demand for hard currency 
on money markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban also allowed the Central Bank to fill its own  
hard-currency coffers at a more advantageous rate, but it ran 
against IMF free-market policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank also protects the currency by spend its own  
foreign-currency reserves to buy rubles, thus shrinking the ruble 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bank on Friday apparently chose to preserve its  
dwindling resources and stopped interfering with money market 
trading, allowing the ruble's value to drop to 24.47 to the dollar, 
down from 24.21 to the dollar on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other key IMF-mandated reforms were approved Friday by  
the upper house of parliament that further freed up money and 
metals markets. One bill allows the Central Bank to buy gold 
directly from mining companies -- making it easier to increase 
reserves of precious metals and foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federation Council also approved a bill that would impose a  
tax on big luxury cars, a bill that would allow the bank to issue 
securities, and one that would allow the liquidation of insolvent 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills have already been approved by the lower house, the  
State Duma, and now must be signed by President Boris Yeltsin.

<HEADLINE> Entrepreneurial Britains Look to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- John Culverhouse's colleagues were stupefied when  
he quit his job editing sports stories at a newspaper to test his 
entrepreneurial skills importing fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen years later, Culverhouse's firm, Fantastic Fireworks  
Ltd., employs 15 workers and posts annual sales of $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	His decision to scrap a comfortable career to start his own  
small business demonstrates an entrepreneurial zeal that British 
officials worry is all too rare today in the land that produced 
Adam Smith and his doctrine of laissez-faire economics. 
</P>
<P>
	To help cultivate a stronger, risk-taking culture in Britain, 75  
American entrepreneurs, policy-makers and venture capitalists 
shared insights Friday with their British counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	No one expected the single day of workshops to transform  
ingrained attitudes and policies in the United Kingdom, but many 
welcomed it as the start of a necessary evolution in mentality. 
</P>
<P>
	``The word 'profit' is still a dirty word in the U.K. British  
society is very modest and doesn't like to boast, and profit is 
about boasting. But without profit, there's no employment,'' said 
Stephen Alambritis of the Federation of Small Businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	British soccer players and pop stars are celebrated as heroes,  
yet ``many successful business people are berated as greedy fat 
cats,'' said Andrew Parkinson, a British Chambers of Commerce 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The need to modify these views is clear. A recent London School  
of Business survey found that a third of all economic activity is 
connected to the work of entrepreneurs, yet only one of every 30 
Britons is actively trying to start a business -- less than half as 
many as in the United States, Canada and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The same survey found that 95 percent of Americans believe  
working as an entrepreneur is a respectable occupation, a view 
shared by only 30 percent of Britons interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	British officials, even leaders of the formerly socialist Labor  
Party, are increasingly aware of the need to encourage people to 
take the risk of creating a business. They've sought inspiration 
from the United States, where the dynamic formation of new firms 
has contributed to galloping growth and low unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Innovation is the key to success in the new enterprise  
economy,'' Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said at the 
conference. ``We here in the United Kingdom have a great deal to 
learn from the successes in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Britain that perfected the idea that businesses should  
operate without government interference, and Scottish economist 
Adam Smith laid the intellectual framework for a global free 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet a fear of failure in business has retarded start-up activity  
-- and growth -- in Britain today, executives say. 
</P>
<P>
	``My old boss just couldn't understand why I was giving up a  
safe, well-paid job to take a risk like the one I was taking,'' 
said Culverhouse, the fireworks entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
	Harsh, Victorian-era bankruptcy laws have reinforced this fear.  
In Britain, owners of companies that fail cannot borrow money from 
a bank for at least three years. They cannot serve as company 
directors, and in London, they can't even get a license to drive a 
taxi. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. laws give bankrupt companies breathing room to reorganize  
their debts, and owners of failed businesses can quickly start 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	David Rose, 42, of New York City, had to completely restructure  
his software business after cheaper access to the Internet made his 
original plan obsolete. His firm, AirMedia, avoided bankruptcy, but 
its sales dried up and he had to slash its workforce from 120 
people to 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of being traumatized that our first attempt didn't  
work, we picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off and tried 
again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A comparatively weak network of support services makes matters  
worse for Britons who want to strike out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, just this week, the Department of Trade and  
Industry unveiled plans for a Small Business Service, which aims to 
help entrepreneurs and small firms. The service will have an 
initial budget of $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, small U.S. companies have access to a pool of $48  
billion in loans from the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	American start-up companies have better opportunities for  
financing from venture capitalists. British venture capitalists 
have focused more on buying out existing firms than investing in 
new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Britain's shortcomings, conference participants seemed  
to agree that it still is five to 10 years ahead of its European 
neighbors in terms of supporting its entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you that we fully intend to push these issues  
with our European partners,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Americans strained to keep the conference from sounding  
like a triumphant celebration of U.S. business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Elkus Jr. of Atherton, Calif. was one. Elkus helped  
develop the first VCR, heads two high-tech firms and serves on the 
boards of several others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things change. This is a pretty dynamic world,'' he said.  
``What laurels do you rest on?''

<HEADLINE> Officials: Kosovo Campaign No Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While relishing what some call a revolutionary  
triumph for air power, senior Air Force officers and strategists 
are working to ensure the Kosovo campaign doesn't become a model 
for future wars. 
</P>
<P>
	These specialists worry that NATO's victory in the Balkans could  
set unrealistic expectations for airstrikes and legitimize faulty 
strategic decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	They are urging that policy-makers avoid repeating the ``war by  
committee'' waged by NATO, and the gradual application of air power 
that they say prolonged the conflict in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of these specialists also say that if the United States  
again participates in an air-only campaign, the top officers should 
include a commander steeped in the uses of combat air power. 
</P>
<P>
	Others caution against expecting the next victory to come with  
no U.S. or allied pilots killed in combat. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Lt. Gen. Marvin Esmond likens the 78-day Kosovo  
campaign to ``throwing a no-hitter,'' in that only two NATO planes 
and no pilots were lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't get used to that kind of performance,'' said Esmond,  
deputy chief of staff in charge of air and space operations. 
</P>
<P>
	While displaying unabashed pride in his service's  
accomplishment, he says the United States runs the risk of becoming 
``so confident that we lose our cautiousness about putting (the 
military) in harm's way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For as long as airplanes have flown into battle, accepted  
military doctrine has held that only combat troops can decisively 
change the military and political situation on the ground, that air 
power alone cannot decide a conflict. In the wake of the Kosovo 
campaign, some military analysts are rethinking that doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to change my beliefs, but there was too much  
evidence accumulating to stick to the article of faith,'' military 
historian John Keegan wrote in The Daily Telegraph of London 
recently. ``It now does look as if air power has prevailed in the 
Balkans and that the time to redefine how victory in war may be won 
has come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Lt. Col. Peter Faber, a senior strategic planner, said  
the Air Force ``proved a major point'' in military circles by 
showing that airstrikes can accomplish more than simply prepare a 
battlefield for a ground assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Kuehl, a professor at the National Defense University and  
one of the planners of the Persian Gulf War air campaign, views the 
success of air power in Kosovo as evolutionary, rather than 
revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
	But he suggests that in the future political leaders, made  
overconfident by Kosovo, ``may feel tempted in a crisis to splash a 
little air power on the problem and it will go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An internal Air Force critique of the Kosovo campaign, however,  
questions the Clinton administration's initial decision to remove 
ground troops as an option should Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic 
refuse to buckle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat or use of all branches of combat arms should be  
brought to bear upon an aggressor motivated by unlimited 
objectives,'' concludes an Air Force document to be used as talking 
points by senior officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Another complaint is the slow start of the bombing. The Kosovo  
campaign began with what Esmond called a ``confidence-gaining 
phase'' that lacked the punch to force Milosevic back to the 
negotiating table. But it was necessary to convince political 
leaders that more air power could be unleashed with minimal risk of 
major U.S. losses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could we have done it quicker? Absolutely,'' Esmond said.  
``But then, what cost is that speed?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force paper, obtained by The Associated Press,  
attributes the slow start to an unwillingness by policy-makers to 
risk casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Airmen would have preferred (inflicting) shock and  
paralysis,'' in the opening stages of the campaign, the paper 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	Air power specialists worry that the gradual approach to bombing  
allows more time for variables such as diplomacy, casualties and 
errant bombs to affect the outcome, said Faber, the strategic 
planner. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a feeling that we dodged a bullet,'' Faber said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  
acknowledged the concern in a news conference following Serbia's 
agreement to pull troops out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it's true that U.S. military doctrine is geared toward  
hitting an adversary hard from the very start, it's also true in 
this instance that the strategy that NATO adopted ... was 
successful,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He conceded that the NATO strategy was ``not exactly'' the  
approach the United States would have taken had it been acting 
alone. Defense Secretary William Cohen called the strategy ``the 
best of a series of bad options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Association analyst Steve Aubin questions a military  
hierarchy that placed a pair of Army generals, Shelton and NATO 
military commander Wesley Clark, in charge of an air war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Across the top echelon of military leadership, you had no  
people who really understood aerospace power and how to employ 
it,'' Aubin said.

<HEADLINE> Bald Eagle Soon Off Endangered List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American bald eagle, the living symbol of  
the nation since 1782, is back from the brink of extinction and can 
now be removed from the endangered species list, President Clinton 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrating a three-decade struggle to protect the bald eagle  
against pesticides and encroachments on its habitat, Clinton 
announced a process that is expected to remove the majestic bird 
from the list by July 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to think of a better way to celebrate the birth of a  
nation than to celebrate the rebirth of our national symbol,'' the 
president said on the eve of the Independence Day weekend. ``The 
return of the bald eagle is a fitting cap to a century of 
environmental stewardship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president was joined on a flag-backed platform on the South  
Lawn of the White House by a 10-year-old bald eagle named 
Challenger, who flapped his long brown wings and cocked his 
snowcapped head. 
</P>
<P>
	Challenger was blown from a nest in the wild as an eaglet and  
experienced too much human contact at a young age to be able to 
survive in the wild. The bird screeched during the president's 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe it or not,'' Clinton said, ``Ben Franklin wanted our  
national symbol to be a turkey. The press would be having a field 
day with that to the present day, wouldn't they?'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the banning of the pesticide DDT in 1972 and the passage of  
the Endangered Species Act a year later, the bald eagle began 
making a dramatic recovery. Today, there are 5,800 breeding pairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, with recovery well under way, the eagle was  
upgraded from endangered to threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Removing the bald eagle from the government's endangered list  
will not expose it to new dangers and its status will be closely 
monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	The eagle will continue to be protected, from hunting or capture  
by two laws: the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits the 
taking, killing, possession, transportation and importation of 
migratory birds, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, 
which bans the taking, possession, transportation, export and 
import of a bald or golden eagle, alive or dead. ``Taking'' is 
defined as shooting, poisoning, molesting or harming the bird. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Continental Congress in 1782 placed the bald eagle in  
the center of the Great Seal of the United States, an olive branch 
in one claw and 13 arrows in the other, there were as many as a 
half-million eagles in the skies of North America. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1963, however, only 417 breeding pairs remained in the lower  
48 states as a result of hunting, loss of prey and habitat and the 
widespread use of the DDT. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our majestic eagle was slipping toward extinction,'' the  
president said. ``The eagle struggled barely to survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation declared, Clinton said, ``that extinction is not an  
option -- not for the eagle, not for the other creatures put here by 
God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also used the ceremony to prod Congress to approve his  
Lands Legacy initiative to provide permanent financing of at least 
$1 billion a year to protect wildlife habitat, farms, urban parks 
and natural treasures across America.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Iran Jew Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department and the House  
International Relations Committee criticized Iran today for 
arresting 13 Iranian Jews on espionage charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The charges are unfounded and unacceptable,'' State Department  
spokesman James Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The arrest of these Iranian citizens is a specious act and an  
indication that Iran is going backward,'' said Rep. Benjamin 
Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iranian foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, has rejected as  
insults to the authority of Islamic Iran demands for release of the 
13. Kharrazi said this week that the Iranian Jews had ``only been 
charged and no sentences have been issued against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jews, rabbis and religious teachers, are charged with spying  
for Israel and the United States. If convicted, they could be 
executed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S., German and Israeli officials have demanded their release.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've made very clear our views publicly,'' Foley said. ``To  
describe publicly our efforts to persuade Iranian authorities to do 
the right thing and to drop the charges and release them are not 
necessarily those that would be best described publicly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Foley said, ``rest assured that we're in contact with  
other governments, and we think this is a very important matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman's committee condemned the arrest in a resolution that  
also urged all countries with diplomatic and economic relations 
with Iran to condemn the arrests and demand that the prisoners be 
released.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Russians Oppose US Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Nearly half of Russians don't want American  
investments in the area where they live, apparently because their 
resentment of U.S. influence outweighs any suffering from poverty, 
a poll released Friday indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-six percent of respondents in a June 19 poll by the  
independent Public Opinion Fund said they didn't want Americans to 
invest in their home regions or republics. The figure marked a 
sharp increase from the 32 percent who opposed U.S. investment in 
1995, according to a similar poll by the same agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO airstrikes against Russian ally Yugoslavia stoked  
strong anti-American feelings in Russia. Deepening economic 
troubles have also made many Russians increasingly bitter about the 
loss of superpower status and resentful of U.S. influence in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Many opponents of U.S. investment said it would make Russia  
completely dependent on the United States or even turn Russia into 
an American colony, according to poll results carried by the 
Interfax agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters cited prospects for economic growth, jobs, advanced  
technologies and help in overcoming the country's grinding economic 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	No margin of error was given for the poll of 1,500 people  
throughout Russia.

<HEADLINE> Gotti Says Son Belongs in Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Flabbergasted by the carelessness that  
helped get his son indicted, John J. Gotti said an insane asylum 
might better suit ``Junior'' than prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors filed transcripts Thursday of a prison conversation  
taped in January 1998 that the elder Gotti had with his daughter 
and his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	The material was submitted in advance of a sentencing hearing  
set for next Thursday for John A. ``Junior'' Gotti, who pleaded 
guilty in April to racketeering, bribery, extortion, fraud and 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know too much about indictments to believe anything I read  
in the indictment,'' the elder Gotti said in the transcript. ``But 
these people here if ever found guilty they should never be sent to 
jail. They should all be sent to the insane asylum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti was especially appalled that FBI agents had found $358,000  
in cash in a basement his son controlled. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son who is the most legitimate, upstanding citizen you  
could find if you want to be technical. Look what he gives them to 
(hang) their hat on. Funny money in the basement,'' he said in the 
transcript. 
</P>
<P>
	He implied the money could have been from wedding gifts to his  
son, and said, ``A beautiful wedding, you got your money, you take 
your money and you put it in a safe deposit box. That's what a 
normal person would do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanna know what part of this was intelligent,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gotti Sr., the onetime head of the Gambino crime family, got the  
nickname ``Teflon Don'' for escaping conviction in three trials. He 
was finally found guilty in 1992 in a racketeering case that 
featured the Mafia's highest-ranking turncoat, Salvatore ``Sammy 
the Bull'' Gravano. He is serving a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors accused his son of taking over the crime syndicate,  
saying he performed all the duties of a crime boss and kept a 
``promotion list,'' which was available only to high-ranking Mafia 
members, according to the court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Junior'' Gotti's lawyer, Gerald Shargel, implied that the  
prosecution's argument was actually meant for the press. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing in that letter that the judge has not already  
seen,'' he said. ``I wonder who they're doing it for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter accompanying the transcripts, prosecutors asked  
federal Judge Barrington Parker to sentence young Gotti to seven 
years and three months, the maximum mentioned when he pleaded 
guilty. They detailed some of the evidence prosecutors would have 
presented at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Gotti Jr. received $400 each week for having lunch  
with the owner of a construction company, the papers said. He was 
also the only ``employee'' to get a Christmas bonus -- $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gotti's lawyer said his client ``is not the villain that the  
government portrays him to be.''

<HEADLINE> Apache Opens Door for Collaboration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOREST HILL, Md. (AP) -- Apache, the most widely used software  
for powering Internet servers, will become part of a not-for-profit 
corporation, a move designed to add stability and enable 
collaboration with established companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The free, open-source software, is produced by volunteer  
programmers who share ideas and computer code to create the server 
software now used by 61 percent of Internet-connected servers, 
according a survey by Netcraft, a consulting firm in Bath, England. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Apache Software Foundation will provide organizational,  
legal and financial support for its projects, the group said in a 
statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Apache's installed base is far ahead of its closest competitor,  
Microsoft's Internet Information Server, which is on 22 percent of 
Internet servers, according to Netcraft. 
</P>
<P>
	By incorporating, Apache can now accept intellectual property  
from companies such as IBM Corp., which has said it will provide 
coding and a team of programmers to the Apache foundation. Sun 
Microsystems Inc. also announced that it will contribute its 
JavaServer Pages software to the Apache project.

<HEADLINE> FTC Investigating Calif. Gas Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission is stepping up  
its investigation of California gasoline prices with a new round of 
subpoenas seeking information about oil company pricing methods, a 
source familiar with the investigation said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is one of several regulatory agencies looking  
into California prices, which rose sharply in February and March 
and remain higher than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
	The California and Nevada attorneys general also are  
investigating the price increase. The federal General Accounting 
Office also has been asked to look into gasoline prices in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	One company, San Francisco-based Chevron Corp., acknowledged on  
Friday that it had been notified that it and other oil companies 
would receive subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have indications that a subpoena will be issued to Chevron  
and all oil companies as part of the investigation,'' spokesman 
Fred Gorell said. ``We intend, as before and in all investigations, 
to cooperate fully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials expect the investigation to conclude that the  
price increase was a result of market forces, not collusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Tosco Corp. and Arco Products Co., the retailing  
arm of Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., said they could 
not determine whether the companies had been subpoenaed or notified 
subpoenas were on the way because corporate attorneys could not be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Shell Oil Co. and Texaco Inc. after business hours  
Friday were not immediately returned. A call to the FTC also was 
not returned, though the agency typically will not comment on its 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoenas seek company pricing records and other documents  
that might reveal how companies decide gasoline prices for 
different regions, according to a source who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil refiners have blamed the price hike on a variety of factors,  
including production cuts by OPEC nations and refinery fires that 
forced companies to import gasoline to California from Asia and the 
U.S. Gulf Coast. They also have said that production slowed as 
refineries made their annual switch to summer gasoline formulas 
designed to reduce air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Barbara Boxer, who requested the FTC investigation,  
applauded news that the agency was intensifying its probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am gratified to learn the FTC is now escalating that  
investigation,'' she said in a prepared statement. ``I believe that 
California drivers have been overcharged at the gas pumps to the 
tune of tens of millions of dollars.''

<HEADLINE> Martin Suffers Happy Hour Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Martin thought he was driving  
the best car he had ever brought to Daytona. He won't have the 
chance to find out, due to an accident in Pepsi 400 practice Friday 
evening that left his arm in a splint and his car on a wrecker. 
</P>
<P>
	The right front tire on Martin's Ford split as he was entering  
the third turn of the 2.5-mile trioval at Daytona International 
Speedway during the final ``happy hour'' practice session before 
Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	He received minor injuries to his left wrist and left leg,  
although it's his psyche that surely took the biggest beating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit the wall about as hard as I've ever tangled with it,''  
Martin said. ``I'm a little bit sore, but I'm going to be OK. We 
had a fabulous car. This is the best restrictor-plate car I've ever 
driven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from Goodyear said it didn't appear there was anything  
structurally wrong with the tire. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what we can see, it appears there was a cut close to the  
inside shoulder of the tread that caused rapid air loss,'' Goodyear 
public relations manager Carole Swartz said. ``That would explain 
why there was so little warning before the accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swartz said technicians would examine the tire more thoroughly  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's car ran the fastest lap of the afternoon practice at  
192.703 mph. That came a day after he qualified third with a speed 
of 194.376. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident crumpled the car's hood. Minutes later, his crew  
was wheeling the backup car into the garage for a few frantic hours 
of work. 
</P>
<P>
	The new car will start from the back of the field for the race.  
Martin said he will take the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'll drive tomorrow,'' he said. ``I'd be ready to drive  
tonight. If they were starting in five minutes, I'd line up and 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Green clipped Martin at the end of the crash, but his car  
received little damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spun out and did about two or three spins,'' Green said. ``I  
didn't hit anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also during happy hour, Tony Stewart skidded into the wall, but  
his car was expected to be race ready. Stewart, the leading rookie 
on the Winston Cup circuit this season, said he heard there was oil 
on the track near where he wrecked.

<HEADLINE> Stocks in Record Area; Dow Up 56.36 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks pushed higher today, lifting the Dow  
Jones industrial average and other market barometers into record 
territory as investors responded to a strong government jobs 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was up 56.36 at 11,122.78,  
just above its May 13 record close of 11,107.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also moved higher.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 7.44 to 1,388.40, and the  
Nasdaq composite index rose 21.02 to 2,727.20. Both indexes set 
closing highs on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose as a government jobs report showed a healthy labor  
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that employment at American  
businesses accelerated sharply last month with a total of 268,000 
new jobs created. All industries except manufacturing and mining 
posted solid gains. The increase in jobs was slightly stronger than 
economists expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,  
increased by 3.7 percent in June, compared to a year ago. Higher 
wages can drag earnings down because labor costs account for most 
of consumer prices. They also raise the specter of another increase 
in interest rates following this week's modest hike by the Federal 
Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bond market, which often sets the tone for stocks, was  
unmoved by the jump in wages, as the yield on the benchmark 30-year 
Treasury bond remained steady at 6.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobs report also found unemployment rates remained near  
their historic lows during June. The jobless rate edged up 0.1 
percent to 4.3 percent as U.S. factories continued to shed jobs. It 
still remains near the lowest levels in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclical stocks, which perform best during times of economic  
expansion, led the Dow today. International Paper rose 1 7/16 to 51 
3/16 and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing rose 1 11/16 to 88 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks fed gains on the Nasdaq, with Cisco Systems up  
1 13/16 at 66 3/16 and Sun Microsystems up 2 1/4 at 70 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 423.71 million 
shares, down from Thursday's pace. Volume was light ahead of the 
three-day Independence Day weekend. U.S. markets will be closed 
Monday in observance of the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.72 at 654.05, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 7.54 at 802.49. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which measures the performance of  
smaller companies, rose 1.29 to 455.71.

	After six months of negotiations, both sides ironed out all  
major differences and were fine-tuning wording of a formal 
agreement to be signed soon, officials at Seoul's Financial 
Supervisory Commission said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The national news agency Yonhap, quoting unnamed commission  
officials, said the government and Newbridge will announce their 
agreement Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Newbridge had engaged in takeover talks since December to  
acquire a 51 percent stake in Korea First Bank, in which the Seoul 
government is the major shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides extended their talks several times as they  
differed widely over the value of the bank's assets and terms under 
which the South Korean government will purchase some of the bank's 
future bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	President Kim Dae-jung's government insisted on selling  
debt-ridden Korean banks to foreigners to demonstrate its 
willingness to open the cloistered domestic financial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Such takeovers will serve as an important vote of confidence in  
the crisis-hit South Korean economy, Kim has said.

<HEADLINE> Summers Sworn in as Treasury Sec. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawrence Summers was sworn in Friday as the  
nation's 71st treasury secretary in a private ceremony at the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers, with his wife, Victoria, three children and parents  
watching, took the oath of office from Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and other members of his economic team,  
including outgoing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, were present 
for the brief ceremony in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers had been confirmed by the Senate on a 97-2 vote  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Summers, 44, became the youngest tenured professor in  
Harvard's history at the age of 28, he will not be the nation's 
youngest treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Hamilton, the first treasury secretary, was 34 when he  
took the job in George Washington's Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers joined the administration in its early days and has  
served as one of the architects of many of the president's economic 
initiatives. He also was the point man for the administration's 
efforts to deal with the Mexican peso crisis in 1995 and the Asian 
financial crisis, which began in July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers served as undersecretary for international affairs at  
Treasury, working under Clinton's first treasury secretary, former 
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the deputy treasury secretary, the No. 2 job in the  
department, in 1995 when Rubin succeeded Bentsen. Rubin announced 
his resignation on May 12 and Clinton immediately nominated Summers 
to be his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, Summers and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
developed a close working relationship as they struggled to deal 
with first the Mexican crisis and then the Asian currency crisis. 
The three men usually met once a week for either breakfast or 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who appointed Greenspan to a third term as Fed chairman  
in 1996, will have the chance to fill that post next June when 
Greenspan's four-year term is up. 
</P>
<P>
	While there has been speculation that Clinton may nominate  
Greenspan for a fourth term to avoid a fight with the 
Republican-controlled Senate over another candidate, Clinton said 
in an interview published Friday that he has yet to make a decision 
on the Fed job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even know if he wants to do it. I haven't talked to  
him. I don't even know if he is interested,'' Clinton said of 
Greenspan in an interview with Business Week magazine.

<HEADLINE> Boorda's Navy Record Won't Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- The Navy has decided that the official  
record of Adm. Jeremy ``Mike'' Boorda, who committed suicide amid 
questions about Vietnam combat decorations he had worn, should 
continue to show he did not earn the medals. 
</P>
<P>
	A board of three civilians recommended last month that the  
official record remain unaltered, Navy spokesman Capt. Mark Van 
Dyke said Friday. The ruling was upheld by Carolyn Becraft, who has 
the final say as assistant secretary of the Navy for manpower and 
reserve affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Boorda, who joined the Navy at 16 and became the only enlisted  
man to rise to chief of naval operations, took his life in 1996 
after 40 years of service. He was about to be asked by Newsweek 
reporters about why he wore Combat Vs -- tiny bronze letters 
standing for ``valor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a suicide note ``to my sailors,'' he said he felt disgraced.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, then-Navy Secretary John Dalton placed a memo in  
Boorda's file -- backed by another memo from Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt 
Jr., the Vietnam War-era chief of naval operations -- that declared 
him eligible to have worn the decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	Dalton said only the Navy review board could officially change  
the record to say Boorda had the right to wear them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boorda family petitioned the Board for Corrections of the  
Naval Records last September to change the record and show he was 
entitled to wear the decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The final decision was there was no error or injustice in Adm.  
Boorda's record and the panel was unanimous in their 
recommendation,'' Van Dyke said. 
</P>
<P>
	He provided the information to The Associated Press after an  
inquiry prompted by the state of Illinois' decision to award a 
$20,000 grant for a memorial in Boorda's hometown, Momence, about 
50 miles south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Boorda had been awarded the decorations for service on a  
destroyer, the USS Craig, off the coast of Vietnam in 1965 and as 
executive officer aboard another destroyer, the USS Brooke, in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
	He removed the decorations from his ribbons in 1995, on the  
advice of the Navy's Office of Awards and Special Projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Dalton's memo says the citations justifying the awards ``plainly  
state they were awarded for service including combat operations.'' 
Zumwalt's memo said it was ``appropriate, justified and proper'' 
for Boorda to have the decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing an unauthorized decoration is a severe breach of  
military protocol.

<HEADLINE> Americans Face Calcium Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- You bypass the grocery dairy aisle, shun  
broccoli and greens, skip the calcium-fortified orange juice. 
Wonder if your bones are weak? 
</P>
<P>
	Americans are facing what experts say is a dire shortage of  
calcium in their diets. It starts in childhood, when kids quickly 
learn to guzzle colas or sugar-filled ``fruit drinks'' instead of 
milk -- one aghast nutritionist even spotted baby bottles sporting 
soft-drink logos. 
</P>
<P>
	Calcium's claim to fame is building strong bones and teeth. But  
this versatile mineral also may play other important roles, such as 
lowering blood pressure or preventing colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet three out of four Americans are thought to eat too little  
calcium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter who you are -- we are not ingesting enough  
calcium from childhood up,'' said University of Colorado nutrition 
professor Susan Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States needs a national, comprehensive plan to  
improve the calcium nutrition of our people,'' Dr. Robert Heaney of 
Creighton University told fellow calcium specialists at a meeting 
last week to discuss how to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is launching two new campaigns to boost calcium  
consumption by children and teen-agers -- the ages bone builds 
fastest -- but key to increasing calcium consumption is 
understanding why it's important and what foods have it. 
</P>
<P>
	When you don't eat enough calcium, the body leaches the mineral  
from your bones, weakening them over time. Ten million Americans, 
mostly women, already have osteoporosis, where their bones are so 
brittle they snap. 
</P>
<P>
	But research suggests calcium's benefit may extend far beyond  
bones, Heaney said. Calcium-poor diets seem to increase risk of 
high blood pressure. Increasing dietary calcium in patients prone 
to colon cancer significantly cut their risk of tumors. Calcium 
even seemed to cut in half symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	How much calcium do you need? The Institute of Medicine set  
1,000 milligrams a day as an adequate level for most adults. 
Teen-agers need more, 1,300 milligrams, because their bones are 
growing so fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Need varies for other ages -- 500 milligrams a day for toddlers;  
800 milligrams for 4- to 8-year-olds; and 1,200 milligrams for 
people over age 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, dairy products like yogurt, milk and cheddar cheese  
pack the most calcium. For most children, a few glasses of milk a 
day would meet the need. 
</P>
<P>
	Your child only likes chocolate milk? No problem. Chocolate,  
skim, low-fat or regular, the calcium's the same, about 300 
milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are many other choices. Calcium-fortified orange juice  
packs as much calcium per glass as milk. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sources may not have as much calcium as dairy, but can add  
up: Dark leafy vegetables, broccoli, soybeans, canned salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	You may be sneaking in calcium without knowing it: A slice of  
cheese pizza, for instance, has 220 milligrams. Two tablespoons of 
blackstrap molasses has about 270. A handful of almonds has 100. 
</P>
<P>
	To help parents understand exactly how much their children need  
at each age -- and what foods to choose -- the government is offering 
a free booklet as part of calcium campaign called ``Milk Matters.'' 
To get the booklet, call 1-800-370-2943. 
</P>
<P>
	And the U.S. Public Health Service is about to launch a special  
bone health campaign aimed at increasing teen-age girls' calcium 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	Calcium supplements can help, too, but experts agree that  
calcium from food is best because calcium-rich foods also pack 
other vital nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
	Use supplements to ``top off an otherwise good diet,'' Heaney  
advises. ``They're not a substitute for good eating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What if you have trouble digesting lactose, or milk sugar? It's  
a problem for millions of Americans, especially minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from non-dairy calcium sources, lactose-free milk and  
tablets that aid in milk digestion are widely sold. Calcium-rich 
hard cheeses contain little lactose. But studies show many 
lactose-intolerant people can digest some milk as long as they 
drink it with meals, said Dr. Duane Alexander of the National 
Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	But calcium alone isn't enough. Adequate vitamin D -- from the  
sun, certain foods like milk or cereal, or supplements -- helps the 
body absorb calcium. High-protein diets, in contrast, can inhibit 
calcium absorption.

<HEADLINE>  NL Suspends Umpire For Three Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Here's a twist: An umpire has been suspended for  
bumping a player. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hallion was suspended for three games without pay by NL  
president Len Coleman on Friday for his actions during an argument 
with Colorado catcher Jeff Reed and pitching coach Milt May last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	While penalties against players are common, baseball officials  
couldn't recall another suspension of an umpire for an on-field 
dispute -- umpires' union head Richie Phillips said it had not 
happened in his 21 years as general counsel. But they also could 
not rule out that it happened before. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, NL president Bill White was prepared to suspend umpire  
Joe West for slamming Philadelphia pitcher Dennis Cook to the 
field, but commissioner Fay Vincent intervened and no discipline 
was imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute Saturday began when Rockies pitcher Mike DeJean,  
while walking to his dugout after an inning, complained to third 
base umpire Terry Tata about a check-swing call. Hallion, who was 
working at home plate during the game in San Diego, told DeJean to 
get in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	DeJean said he told Hallion he was going to the dugout. At that  
point, DeJean and manager Jim Leyland were ejected. During the 
ensuing argument, it appeared Hallion made contact with Reed and 
May, a charge Tata denied after the game on Hallion's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	No Rockies were penalized. Hallion, in his 14th NL season,  
stands to lose about $2,500 of his salary, which is $140,000 
according to the salary scale in the umpires' labor agreement. The 
suspension is scheduled to start July 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallion declined comment Friday as he walked into the ballpark  
at Cincinnati before a game between the Astros and the Reds. He had 
no controversial calls at third base in Houston's 7-5 win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom did nothing on the field that day which would warrant the  
imposition of a sanction of any kind,'' Phillips said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If any discipline was warranted, it should have been levied  
against the pitcher, catcher and manager who incited the situation, 
physically and verbally threatened the umpire and flaunted the 
umpire's authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips added later: ``Tom has got an unblemished career. If a  
player takes a machete out, they get two games and it gets cut to 
one, and that's with pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeJean took a conciliatory approach before Friday night's game  
between Colorado and San Diego at Coors Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't just Tom Hallion and Terry Tata. We were all to  
blame,'' DeJean said. ``My beef wasn't with Tom Hallion. I don't 
have a problem with him now and I didn't then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he expected to be disciplined, DeJean said, ``I am  
sure there is going to be a fine. I would hate to see something 
happen to him, then get off scot-free. They will be saying that 
players get away with anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Leyland: ``So he got suspended, who cares?''  
</P>
<P>
	Umpires contended the penalty resulted from internal politics in  
baseball. Commissioner Bud Selig wants to switch authority over 
umpires next year from the leagues to Sandy Alderson, an executive 
vice president in the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been some concern that umpires are out of control,  
which were sentiments by Bud Selig and Sandy Alderson, and I think 
Len is falling into that trap,'' umpires president Jerry Crawford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips took a similar view, saying the suspension was  
``nothing more than an act of expediency designed to pander to the 
people in baseball calling for the centralization of control of 
umpires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hallion is appealing the penalty, and Coleman will hold a  
hearing Thursday in Philadelphia, where the umpires' union is 
located. When players are suspended for on-field disputes, league 
presidents also hear the appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably will be wasting our time,'' Crawford said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mario Puzo, who won two Oscars for his  
adaptation of his best-selling novel ``The Godfather'' and 
romanticized the Mafia with his depiction of the fiercely loyal and 
honor-bound Corleone family, died of heart failure Friday. He was 
78. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of Italian immigrants, who wrote seven other novels and  
assorted Hollywood screenplays, died in his home on Long Island. He 
had just completed ``Omerta,'' the third book in his Mafia trilogy, 
said Neil Olson, his literary agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo was an obscure if critically acclaimed novelist when he sat  
down at his vintage manual typewriter in the late 1960s, determined 
to write a blockbuster that would pull him out of debt. 
</P>
<P>
	He succeeded. ``The Godfather,'' published in 1969, sold 21  
million copies worldwide and introduced the world to his Corleone 
family, who mingled old-world Sicilian values with new-world 
American violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola co-wrote the screenplays  
for ``The Godfather'' and two sequels; they earned Academy Awards 
in 1972 and 1974 for their work, and the first two films became 
American cinematic classics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corleones were brought to life on screen by Marlon Brando as  
Don Vito Corleone, with James Caan, Al Pacino and John Cazale 
playing his sons Sonny, Michael and Fredo. In the sequel, Robert De 
Niro played the young Don. The two movies won a combined nine 
Oscars, including two for best picture. 
</P>
<P>
	The first screenplay contained some of the classic lines in film  
history, especially: ``I'm gonna make him an offer he can't 
refuse'' and ``Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coppola called Puzo ``an absolutely wonderful man,'' and said  
his death is ``a personal loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Writer and Puzo friend Gay Talese said ``The Godfather'' struck  
a powerful chord. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an America that has lost touch with family life, `The  
Godfather' book and `The Godfather' films emphasized the importance 
of family, the idea of fidelity to family and vengeful reaction to 
those who are disloyal to family,'' Talese said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1996 interview with The Associated Press, Puzo acknowledged  
that his portrayal of the Corleones, with their emphasis on honor 
and family, romanticized the thuggery and buffoonery of real-life 
mobsters. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not my Mafia,'' he said. ``My Mafia is a very  
romanticized myth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo's story of Mafia life actually wound up influencing the  
real thing. Gambino family underboss Sammy ``The Bull'' Gravano, 
the turncoat antithesis of Puzo's tight-knit mob, once recalled the 
afternoon when he saw ``The Godfather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I left that movie stunned,'' he remembered. ``I mean, I  
floated out of the theater. Maybe it was fiction, but for me, then, 
that was our life. It was incredible. I remember talking to a 
multitude of guys, made guys, who felt exactly the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo was born Oct. 15, 1920, in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen, the  
son of illiterate Italian immigrants. His father deserted a wife 
and seven children when Puzo was 12, and the youth took a job with 
the New York Central Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
	By age 16, Puzo had decided to become a writer -- but World War  
II interrupted. After serving in Germany, Puzo came home and began 
writing pulp stories for men's magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	His literary ambitions were much higher, and he published his  
first novel, ``The Dark Arena,'' in 1955. The Saturday Review 
praised Puzo as ``a new talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo spent nine years on his next book, ``The Fortunate  
Pilgrim,'' an autobiographical piece about the Italian immigrant 
experience. Although cited as ``a small classic'' by The New York 
Times Book Review, it too languished. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 45 years old, $20,000 in debt, with a wife and five  
children, Puzo took a $5,000 advance from Putnam and opted to forgo 
literature for a best-seller. ```The Godfather' is not as good as 
the preceding two (novels),'' he once said bluntly. ``I wrote it to 
make money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Godfather'' arrived in 1969 and exploded to the top of the  
best-seller lists. After its success, Puzo was often asked if he 
had ties to organized crime -- and his answer was always no. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might have been preferable to be in the Mafia,'' he said in  
1996. ``I'm glad I'm a writer, but it's hard work. Nobody likes to 
work hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His Oscar-winning work on the ``Godfather'' series led to other  
screenplays, including two Superman movies, ``The Cotton Club,'' 
and ``Christopher Columbus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo's other books included ``Fool's Die,'' a 1978 effort on  
casinos; the No. 1-best-seller ``The Sicilian'' in 1984; ``The 
Fourth K,'' a futuristic political thriller about a fictional 
member of the Kennedy family, in 1992; and ``The Last Don'' in 
1996, a return to his favorite topic, the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Last Don'' became another runaway best seller and was the  
basis for a highly rated television miniseries. It was also the 
second book in his Mafia trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo spent the last three years on ``Omerta,'' about a mob  
family on the brink of legitimacy. ``Omerta'' is the word for the 
mob's code of silence; the book is due out in July 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's vintage Puzo,'' said his editor, Jonathan Karp. ``He was  
a virtuoso storyteller right up to the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When not writing, Puzo lived what he liked to call the  
``bourgeois life,'' splitting time between his homes in Los Angeles 
and Long Island. He loved tennis, sports and gambling in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo is survived by his children, Anthony, Dorothy, Eugene,  
Virginia and Joseph; a sister, Evelyn Murphy, and brother, Anthony 
Cleri, his companion of 20 years, Carol Gino; and nine 
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Baby Boomers' Kids Fill Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Remember how the baby boom generation flooded  
the nation's schools decades ago? Well, they're at it again. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it's their children jamming the classrooms, something  
population researchers refer to as an echo effect when a generation 
reproduces itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau reports that the number of students enrolled  
in U.S. elementary and high schools reached 48 million in 1997, 
just short of the all-time high of 48.7 million recorded in 1970 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past few years, as the children of baby boomers reached  
school age, elementary and high school enrollments have risen, and 
this trend is expected to continue for the near future,'' said 
Gladys Martinez, one of the report's authors. 
</P>
<P>
	``This comes on the heels of declining enrollments in the 1970s  
and early 1980s when there was a general decrease in the 6- to 
17-year-old population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, ``School Enrollment in the United  
States -- Social and Economic Characteristics of Students: October 
1997,'' elementary and high school students in 1997 were more 
racially and ethnically diverse than students of the baby boom 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
	When the crest of the baby boom was in school, in 1972, for  
example, 85 percent of the student population was white, 14 percent 
was black and the remaining 1 percent was Asian or other races. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, 78 percent of elementary and high school students were  
white, 17 percent black, 4 percent Asian and the rest other races. 
</P>
<P>
	The proportion of students of Hispanic origin, who can be  
members of any race, increased from about 6 percent in 1972 to 14 
percent in 1997, reflecting immigration trends that have also 
contributed to the rising school population. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the increase, too, reflects the fact that nursery school  
attendance has become more common, thus increasing the potential 
student population by including a younger age group. 
</P>
<P>
	From only about 500,000 in 1964, nursery school enrollment grew  
to 4.5 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said:  
</P>
<P>
	-- College enrollment of traditional college-age students -- those  
under age 25 -- reached a record high of 9.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- There were 4.5 million children enrolled in public or private  
nursery schools, up from 500,000 in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	-- About 9 million elementary and high school students had a  
foreign-born parent. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Of all students enrolled in college, 81 percent were White, 12  
percent black and 6 percent Asian. Also, about 8 percent were 
Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	-- More than a quarter of the nation's population, 72 million  
people, were enrolled in some type of school.

<HEADLINE> Hepatitis Culture May Aid in Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A team of German scientists has coaxed a form  
of the Hepatitis C virus to reproduce in a laboratory, a 
preliminary step that could make it easier to develop treatments 
for the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide, Hepatitis C affects an estimated 170 million people  
and can lead to chronic liver problems, including cirrhosis and 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to develop a treatment for Hepatitis C have been  
hampered by the resistance of the virus to being grown in 
laboratory cultures where scientists can study it. 
</P>
<P>
	A paper in this week's edition of the journal Science reports  
that a team at Johannes Gutenburg University in Mainz, Germany, 
managed to engineer the virus' genome in a way that forces it to 
reproduce in cultured human cells. 
</P>
<P>
	In theory, they said, unlimited reproduction of the virus would  
be possible, making it easier to study the virus and test potential 
antiviral drugs.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down; Coffee Falls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures fell sharply a second day Friday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid concerns farmers this fall will 
harvest bumper crops, resulting in continued ample inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, crude rose to new 19-month highs, while coffee  
fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans were expected to escape relatively unscathed  
after a weekend of temperatures soaring into the upper 90s in 
Midwest growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have seesawed over the past few sessions as market  
participants attempted to evaluate whether hot, dry weather would 
hurt young crops. But some forecasters are calling for a return of 
normal temperatures later next week and say there is ample soil 
moisture to protect roots. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service after trading had ended reported  
temperatures will remain above-normal to much above-normal in major 
growing regions over the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also were pressured by talk that production could  
soar above 10 billion bushels if they make it through the crucial 
pollination period without significant damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans begin their flowering period next month, and there  
currently appears no threat to reducing what is expected to be 
bumper production. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by expectations for active  
harvesting of the winter wheat crop over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for September delivery fell 7 cents to $2.51 3/4 a bushel;  
September corn fell 6 cents to $2.02 1/4 a bushel; September oats fell 
3 cents to $1.08 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 12 1/2 cents to 
$4.34 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange as  
Americans took to the road for the Fourth of July holiday, boosting 
expectations inventories will continue to tighten. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy prices have rallied this week amid industry data that  
shows supplies have been tightening steadily as world oil producers 
have worked to hold a collective 5.3 million barrels daily off the 
market since the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A year-to-year world surplus in crude now has shrunk to a 3  
percent deficit over this time a year ago, according to the 
industry organization the American Petroleum Institute, helping 
reinforce a belief that world oil producers are sticking to 
commitments to reduce available supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  
and other top producers have shown unusual cooperation in reducing 
daily output. Much of that came after they saw their revenues 
tumble precipitously because of oversupply and weaker world demand. 
</P>
<P>
	August crude rose 30 cents to $19.69 a barrel; August heating  
oil rose .32 cent to 49.14 cents a gallon; August unleaded gasoline 
rose 1.43 cents to 58.46 cents a gallon; August natural gas fell 
2.2 cents to $2.287 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures tumbled on the Board of Trade of the City of New  
York amid expectations Brazilian coffee-growing regions will remain 
frost-free over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee's fortunes have been tied to weather conditions in Brazil  
during its winter. The world's largest producer has gone through 
several growing seasons with no major damage to its crops or trees, 
leading to bumper supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	September arabica coffee fell 2.45 cents to 98 cents a pound.

                         *Viktor Chebrikov    	
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Viktor Chebrikov, the head of the Soviet-era KGB  
who presided over the downing of a Korean airliner carrying 269 
people over Russia's Far East, died Friday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebrikov headed the Committee for State Security, or KGB,  
during one of the most infamous incidents in the Cold War, the 
shooting down of Korean Airlines Flight 007 in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The KGB ordered the 747 downed after concluding that it was on a  
spying mission orchestrated by U.S. secret services. All 269 people 
aboard were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Chebrikov and then-Defense Minister Dmitry Ustinov  
urged that the government keep secret the plane's black boxes, 
which contained information that they said would undercut the 
spying allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, then-Soviet leader Yuri Andropov put him at the helm of  
the KGB. He was made a member of the Communist Party Politburo, the 
elite ruling body of the Soviet Union, in 1985 by Andropov's 
successor, Mikhail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorbachev ousted Chebrikov from the KGB in 1988, and then  
removed him from the Politburo in 1989.

<P>
                          *Edward Dmytryk    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Edward Dmytryk, a director and member of the  
Hollywood Ten who served prison time during the Red Scare-era witch 
hunts and was blacklisted until he named names of his communist 
comrades, died Thursday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Dmytryk was a rising young director at RKO Pictures in 1945 when  
he joined the Communist Party. He said he stayed ``only a few 
months,'' but two years later the House Committee on Un-American 
Activities called him and nine other Hollywood figures to a 
Washington hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	All refused to answer questions about party membership. They  
were convicted of contempt and sentenced to a year in prison. When 
Dmytryk finished his sentence, he admitted that he had been a party 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1951, Dmytryk returned to the House committee and identified  
26 people as communists. Only then did he find work in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	After making a string of low-budget films for Stanley Kramer,  
the producer assigned him to the 1954 World War II drama, ``The 
Caine Mutiny,'' starring Humphrey Bogart. The film's success made 
Dmytryk an in-demand director. 
</P>
<P>
	Dmytryk also directed ``Raintree County,'' ``The Young Lions,''  
``The Carpetbaggers'' and other films starring some of Hollywood's 
most famous names.

	SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) -- Shig Kariya, a Japanese-American  
businessman who was interned during World War II and later founded 
Mikasa Inc. tableware company, died June 25. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with his parents, Kariya was placed in a relocation camp  
during the war years because of his ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
	After his release, Kariya and seven others teamed up in 1948 to  
create American Commercial Inc. to import tableware from Japan. The 
company soon changed its name to Mikasa, which continues to market 
china, crystal and flatware. 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya earned Japan's Emperor's Award in 1988 for his work in  
promoting relations between his native and adopted countries.

admiral who in the mid-1970s was simultaneously commander-in-chief 
of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and NATO's supreme allied commander in 
the Atlantic, died Sunday after battling cancer. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd began his Navy career in 1942 after graduating from the  
Naval Academy. When he retired in 1978, he had 23 years of sea 
duty, including commands of destroyers, destroyer divisions and 
squadrons, a flotilla and three U.S. fleets in the Atlantic, 
Pacific and Mediterranean.

<P>
	McLEAN, Va. (AP) -- Forrest Mars Sr., who created M&AMP;Ms candies  
and built one of the biggest fortunes in America as head of the 
Mars candy empire, died Thursday. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	The candy giant began in 1911 with Frank C. Mars' small business  
in Tacoma, Wash. In 1940, his son, Forrest, devised a candy modeled 
after a British confection: a circle of chocolate covered with a 
crunchy coating. 
</P>
<P>
	M&AMP;Ms -- promoted, as every Baby Boomer knows, as the candy that  
melts in your mouth, not in your hand -- were created as much out of 
meteorological necessity as anything. 
</P>
<P>
	The candy, originally sold in paper tubes, came in brown,  
yellow, orange, red, green and violet, later replaced by tan. 
Beginning in 1950, the candies were stamped with the trademark 
``M'' to assure customers they were getting the real thing. Peanut 
M&AMP;Ms came out in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	The company now has 30,000 employees. Besides M&AMP;Ms, its candy  
brands include Skittles, Milky Way, Dove, Snickers and Three 
Musketeers. Other brands owned by the Mars companies include Uncle 
Ben's Rice, the Kal Kan and Pedigree pet food labels, and Combos, 
Kudos and Twix snack foods.

</P>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Guy Mitchell, a country-pop artist from the  
1950s whose recordings of ``Singing the Blues'' and ``Heartaches by 
the Number'' skyrocketed to the top of the charts and became 
standards of the era, died Thursday. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	He also appeared in movies, on Las Vegas stages and had his own  
television show in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950, after Frank Sinatra declined to record ``My Heart Cries  
For You,'' famed band leader Mitch Miller offered it to Mitchell 
and he not only had a million-seller with that Columbia Records 
recording, but another million-seller with the B-side of that 
record, ``The Roving Kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It launched a career that made Mitchell a household name in the  
'50s. He followed it up with ``My Truly Truly Fair,'' in 1952. He 
would go on to have 16 million-selling recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, Mitchell starred with Rhonda Fleming in the movie  
``Those Redheads From Seattle,'' and a year later starred with 
Rosemary Clooney in ``Red Garters.'' From 1957-58 Mitchell starred 
on television in ``The Guy Mitchell Show'' and appeared on all the 
major TV shows of that era. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, he released the No. 1 recording of ``Singing the  
Blues,'' and a year later topped the charts again with ``Heartaches 
by the Number.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert Polhill, an American professor at  
Beirut University College who was held hostage in the Middle East 
for 39 months, died Thursday of complications from throat cancer. 
He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Polhill was working as an assistant professor of business  
studies when he and three fellow faculty members were seized in 
January of 1987 by gunmen posing as police officers on the 
college's campus. 
</P>
<P>
	During most of his time in isolation, Polhill was chained in  
windowless rooms, receiving only occasional visits from doctors to 
treat his diabetes. He was released in 1990, as part of an effort 
to improve relations between Iran and the United States.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mario Puzo, who won two Oscars for his  
adaptation of his best-selling novel ``The Godfather'' and 
romanticized the Mafia with his depiction of the fiercely loyal and 
honor-bound Corleone family, died of heart failure Friday. He was 
78. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of Italian immigrants, who wrote seven other novels and  
assorted Hollywood screenplays, died in his home on Long Island. He 
had just completed ``Omerta,'' the third book in his Mafia trilogy, 
said Neil Olson, his literary agent. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	He succeeded. ``The Godfather,'' published in 1969, sold 21  
million copies worldwide and introduced the world to his Corleone 
family, who mingled old-world Sicilian values with new-world 
American violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola co-wrote the screenplays  
for ``The Godfather'' and two sequels; they earned Academy Awards 
in 1972 and 1974 for their work, and the first two films became 
American cinematic classics.

<HEADLINE> W. Virginia Losing Its Orchards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSBURG, W.Va. (AP) -- West Virginia's fruit orchards are  
going the way of the buggy whip. 
</P>
<P>
	They are ``getting to be obsolete,'' says third-generation  
grower John M. Miller III of Gerrardstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Numbers back Miller's opinion.  
</P>
<P>
	Since 1987, the number of acres used to grow apples in the  
Eastern Panhandle has gone from 15,330 acres to 8,000 acres, says 
Henry Hogmire, extension specialist for the West Virginia 
University Extension Farm in Kearneysville.

	Peach orchards filled 3,340 acres in 1987 but today make up only  
1,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining profits and pressure to develop open space are among  
the reasons the orchards are vanishing, agricultural experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Many growers, struggling with lower profit margins, are selling  
their land for commercial and residential development, Hogmire 
says. ``All you have to do is drive around here and see what is 
happening. It's sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia is not alone.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we're seeing all along the Eastern  
Seaboard,'' says Jim Cranney, vice president of the U.S. Apple 
Association in McLean, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition from China and Poland is hurting the domestic  
industry, too, Cranney says. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign producers are exporting apple juice concentrate at far  
lower prices than U.S. growers offer, mainly because they receive 
subsidies from their governments to offset costs. U.S. growers do 
not receive subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers in Washington state, the nation's main apple grower,  
have wisely invested in extensive irrigation systems to support 
their orchards and large buyers. That hasn't happened in West 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogmire says many Eastern Panhandle growers have diversified,  
planting Christmas trees, pumpkins, strawberries and sweet corn. 
Others, like George S. Orr &AMP; Sons in Arden, have built on their 
foundation, selling a line of apple butter, fruit baskets and 
related goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinsburg grower Jim Seibert is trying to cut costs by selling  
his fruit directly to processors, eliminating the need for packing 
lines and cold storage. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	WOODBURN, Ore. (AP) -- Rebounding Japanese demand for  
strawberries along with a crackdown on a pesticide in California 
will help boost Oregon berry prices despite another decline in the 
state harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the strawberry harvest is running about 6 million to 9  
million pounds short of the 1998 harvest of 46 million pounds, said 
Bob Conroy of International Flavors and Fragrances, a processing 
plant in Woodburn. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year we were getting about 500,000 pounds a day on our  
peak days. This year, we'll run maybe 320,000,'' said Conroy, who 
may have watched more strawberry harvests come in than anyone else 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther north at Oregon Berry Packing in Hillsboro, Roy Malensky  
says not only is there less fruit from the first picking coming 
into his processing plant, but much of that fruit is 
``monkeyfaced'' or deformed, with hard, seedy green ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Some deformities are to be expected, but Malensky said workers  
on his processing line had to sort out 50 percent more fruit in the 
first week than they did in all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the berries have a higher sugar content than a year  
ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Malensky expects yield per acre will be down, but the price for  
the processed berries was set last week at 51.5 cents a pound, a 
penny and a half higher than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the reason for the slight increase in prices is Japan,  
said Dalton Hobbs, international trade manager with the Oregon 
Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Also boosting the Oregon industry is increased demand from  
Eastern Canada, now up to 17 million pounds.

<HEADLINE> Gypsies Flee From Ethnic Albanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KOSOVO POLJE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- As one of Kosovo's Gypsies,  
Naser Adiqi says he tried to get along with both Albanians and 
Serbs. Now, in the squalor of a refugee camp, he says both sides 
are punishing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Adiqi is one of about 3,000 Gypsies who have jammed into the  
field outside a schoolhouse in this town six miles west of the 
Kosovo capital, Pristina, fleeing threats from ethnic Albanians and 
seething with bitterness over being brushed off by Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Their number is miniscule compared to the 860,000 or so ethnic  
Albanians who fled Kosovo this spring, and the Gypsy refugees tell 
mainly of beatings and threats over the past three weeks rather 
than massacres. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chaotic camp is a stark reminder of the ethnic tensions  
that still shoot through Kosovo following the end of the 78-day 
NATO air war last month and of the disdain directed at Gypsies from 
many sides. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson cited the Gypsy  
refugee camp this week in her assessment that ``now is the most 
worrying time'' for restoring security to postwar Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Gypsy houses have been torched across Kosovo since the Yugoslav  
army withdrew last month, part of a wave of retaliation by 
Albanians for years of violence and oppression at the hand of 
Serbs. Albanians widely assert that Gypsies collaborated with the 
Serbs and even participated in mass killings. 
</P>
<P>
	That allegation is denied by Gypsies in the camp, who say they  
were caught between the two larger ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were the people who didn't take sides,'' said Adiqi, a  
leader in the camp. But, he said, last month Albanians came to his 
home in Magura and told him to leave in two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took my 6-year-old daughter and threatened to cut her  
throat. They said, 'If you leave, we will give you your daughter 
back,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just screamed,'' said his daughter Gjulijet.  
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't done anything, but they still chase us away,''  
Shehide Gashi said while her friend Ikire Hasani stood beside her 
in the rain, miming gestures of throats and breasts being cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can understand the Albanians were bitter ... but now that  
they're returning, we're paying,'' Adiqi said, sitting in a filthy 
room in the schoolhouse while cries and shouts echoed in the 
hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we are even more angry with Serbia because it will not  
accept us,'' he said. ``If there's no country that can take us, 
something catastrophic will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Gypsy refugees say their tormentors wore uniforms of  
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which they see as a bitter irony. 
Kosovo's Gypsies often have Albanian names and speak Albanian as 
their mother tongue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to trust in the KLA. Otherwise, I would have left  
earlier,'' said Selman Berisha of the small settlement, Dobroje 
Vogel. 
</P>
<P>
	Lirak Celaj, a spokesman for the KLA in Pristina, denied that  
the group was involved. ``We have sent many of our people to appeal 
(to Albanians),'' he said. ``Stop doing this to these people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged that resentment of Gypsies is high. Asked  
how many of the refugees he believes may have collaborated with 
Serbs, he said, ``Most of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The displaced Gypsies feel betrayed also by aid agencies and say  
that food aid has been scarce. Adiqi said the 3,000 in the camp get 
only 600 loaves of bread a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Boro Boracic, a Serb who heads the Kosovo Red Cross that  
supervises the camp, said his agency is desperately seeking for 
more food donations and lamented: ``The simple people are suffering 
the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, showing the suspicion that so many in Kosovo harbor toward  
Gypsies, he said: ``Some of them in the camp, they're just there 
because they heard the food was free. They're used to living 
without working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to go to another country,'' he added, ``we wish  
them a safe journey.''

<HEADLINE> Euro Rises Against the Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro crawled back against the dollar Friday,  
a day after dropping to another low against the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0240, up  
from $1.0229 late Thursday. The dollar also was quoted at 121.01 
Japanese yen, up from 120.78. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro had tumbled on Thursday after the European Central Bank  
chose not to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in lowering interest 
rates. Perceptions of slower growth in Europe versus the United 
States have been wearing down on the euro currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5687 Swiss francs, slightly down  
from 1.5692, and 1.4645 Canadian dollars, off from 1.4729. The 
British pound edged up to $1.5783 from $1.5728. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9099 German 
marks, down from 1.9120; 6.4061 French francs, down from 6.4144; 
and 1,890.36 Italian lire, down from 1,893.94.

<HEADLINE> Nichols Seeks Supreme Court Reprieve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Oklahoma City bombing co-conspirator Terry  
Nichols has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn his life 
sentence, arguing that a federal judge wrongly applied guidelines 
for first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The same reasoning was used by Michael Fortier to get his  
sentence thrown out earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, convicted of conspiracy and involuntary manslaughter in  
the 1995 bombing, filed the appeal Wednesday. He also is 
challenging whether an FBI special agent should have been allowed 
to testify about the scientific evidence against him in his federal 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier, who pleaded guilty to having advance knowledge of the  
bombing, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. An appeals court 
tossed out the sentence on Wednesday after ruling that guidelines 
for involuntary manslaughter, rather than first-degree murder, 
should have been the basis for his prison term. 
</P>
<P>
	But that court's opinion noted that the case was different from  
Nichols' because Fortier had not shown the same malice and 
premeditation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 44, is set to appear before a federal judge next week  
to argue separate issues with an appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols' appeal to the Supreme Court says his acquittal on  
charges of first- and second-degree murder show that the jury 
didn't believe he knew of Timothy McVeigh's intention to kill 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	His life sentence from U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch was on  
the count of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. 
Nichols also received concurrent six-year sentences for each of the 
eight counts of involuntary manslaughter.

<HEADLINE> Tragedy Strikes at Special Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARY, N.C. (AP) -- A 14-year-old athlete died in his sleep. A  
volunteer collapsed and died at the opening ceremonies. Four 
competitors disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	The Special Olympics, an international sports festival for the  
developmentally disabled, have brought together nearly 70,000 
people from around the world for nine days. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers say deaths and disappearances can happen when so many  
people -- many with special medical needs -- are involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to remember that this is a global movement,''  
said Timothy Shriver, president and chief executive officer of 
Special Olympics Inc. ``We have thousands of events a year, and 
periodically we have tragedies occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1995 Special Olympics in Connecticut, an athlete  
drowned during a beach outing, and two competitors walked away. 
Both were located. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's event features about 7,000 competitors -- most of  
them mentally retarded -- from 150 countries. There are about 2,000 
coaches, 15,000 friends and relatives and 45,000 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Special Olympics were founded in 1963 by Eunice Kennedy  
Shriver. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes after the opening ceremonies ended last Saturday,  
volunteer Neale Orrok, 62, of Hendersonville collapsed and died of 
heart problems while walking to a bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Dominican basketball players and two Moroccan soccer players  
slipped away from their delegations in the days that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Mohamed Abdul Baset Barin, a volleyball player from  
Egypt, died in his sleep, apparently from an epileptic seizure. The 
rest of the 32-member Egyptian delegation remained in the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	And University of North Carolina chancellor Michael Hooker died  
of cancer this week. Hooker, 53, was on the Special Olympics board 
of directors and was instrumental in bringing the games to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the ironic thing is they represented three different  
aspects of the games that are very key to our success -- our 
athletes, our community leadership that helped bring the games 
here, and our wonderful volunteer force,'' said Joe Freddoso, chief 
executive officer of the World Games Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Freddoso said the three would be remembered at Sunday's closing  
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been such a great week of joy for the athletes, and  
we've set new standards for the Special Olympics, but anytime 
something likes this happens we have to take time out to mourn,'' 
Freddoso said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was never a doubt the games would continue following the  
deaths, said LeRoy Walker, president of the Games and former 
president of the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker was an assistant coach on the U.S. track and field team  
when 11 Israelis were killed by terrorists in the 1972 Munich 
Olympics. There were calls at the time to stop the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it was the Israeli delegation that made it very clear that  
there was something more important to this particular incident and 
its meaning,'' he said. ``We had one day of mourning and went on to 
complete the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So the Special Olympics, with hugs and tears of joy for  
thousands who meet individual goals, will run as scheduled through 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was good news Friday when word spread that Jamal Agdani,  
23, one of the missing Moroccans, had turned up at Union Station in 
Washington, apparently safe and healthy. The other three who left 
are in their 20s, described as ``highly functional'' and not 
legally obligated to immediately rejoin their delegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite temperatures in the 80s and humidity to match, no  
problems have developed at outdoor competition sites this week. 
However, officials discussed converting Sunday's marathon into a 
13-mile race because of temperatures forecast in the 90s. They 
decided to run the whole race. 
</P>
<P>
	Tents with water and other drinks will be placed at mile  
intervals along the course, and bicycle-riding physicians and 
volunteers will monitor the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100 runners also must reach the marathon's midway point in 2  
hours, 15 minutes or be pulled from the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be one happy guy when everyone crosses that finish  
line,'' marathon coordinator Butch Robertson said.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of subway riders were trapped  
underground inside dark, smoky cars after a fire stalled the system 
during the busy rush-hour commute. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 4,500 passengers were stuck on three trains after the  
fire broke out in an underground storage shed around 5 p.m. 
Thursday, said New York City Transit spokesman Al O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
	One train was forced to stop in a tunnel just west of the  
Broadway-East New York subway station in Brooklyn. With the lights 
and air conditioning off, the temperature rose and acrid smoke 
billowed into cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't see anything,'' said passenger Grace Duku. ``The  
train was filled with black smoke. Everyone was scared because we 
couldn't breathe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 passengers were evacuated along a catwalk to an  
emergency exit, but the rest were kept on the train when it 
appeared power would be restored, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no serious injuries. Fire officials said 51 people  
were required some treatment, mostly for smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was under control at 6:40 p.m. and service was back to  
normal by the morning commute.

<HEADLINE> Indictment Expected in ValuJet Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Under pressure from families of ValuJet crash  
victims, federal prosecutors were expected to file charges soon 
against a maintenance contractor and some of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
	SabreTech Inc., which already has been fined for its lapses,  
expects to be indicted unless an agreement can be reached with 
prosecutors, company attorney Ken Quinn said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Some relatives of the 110 victims are pushing for tough charges  
against SabreTech and ValuJet executives, but a government source 
said today an indictment was expected to charge a few line workers 
with knowingly falsifying documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment was expected within two weeks, the source said,  
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said more serious charges such as negligent homicide  
are not expected because there's no evidence that someone had 
intentionally placed flammable oxygen canisters on the plane 
knowing they would explode. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn denied there is evidence of any criminal behavior, saying  
the May 11, 1996, crash was ``the result of an inadvertent series 
of errors and omissions by many parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But attorney John Howie, who represents the families of several  
victims, said an indictment was long overdue. He called charges 
against low-level workers ``perhaps appropriate, but it's 
unfortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All 105 passengers and five crew members died when the DC-9  
nose-dived into the murky Everglades swamp minutes after takeoff 
from Miami on a flight to Atlanta. Flames from a cargo fire had 
torn through the floor of the passenger cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	Crash investigators concluded SabreTech employees improperly  
labeled the oxygen canisters, which had been placed in the cargo 
hold by ValuJet workers. 
</P>
<P>
	SabreTech was assessed a record $2.25 million fine by the  
Federal Aviation Administration for improperly handling the 
canisters. It has appealed the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal investigation began while crews were still at the  
crash site trying to recover pieces of the jet. 
</P>
<P>
	After the third anniversary of the crash, families of victims  
sent letters to Attorney General Janet Reno and Congress, 
complaining that too much time had passed without action. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash investigation split the blame among SabreTech, ValuJet  
and the FAA for lax oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	ValuJet merged with the Orlando-based discount carrier AirTran  
after the crash and flies under the name AirTran. 
</P>
<P>
	SabreTech's maintenance operation was owned by St. Louis-based  
Sabreliner at the time of the crash and has since been sold.

	But Miss Wishart said she doubts it will happen anytime soon.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't believe the politicians,'' she said. ``There's an  
election coming, and they're just blowing hot air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, which faces potential opposition from  
Republicans and the pharmaceutical industry, Medicare beneficiaries 
could choose to buy drug coverage for $24 a month with no 
deductible. Medicare would provide 50 percent reimbursement for up 
to $2,000 a year in drugs. All drug costs above that would be paid 
by the beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
	The average Medicare beneficiary spent $600 on medicine in 1995,  
the latest year statistics were available, with $303 of that paid 
out of pocket and the remainder covered by insurance, according to 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Over $2.50 lunch plates of teriyaki chicken and rice at the  
Olive Branch Senior Center in Sun City, a retirement community 
outside Phoenix, senior citizens forced to pay retail prices out of 
their own pockets reacted to the president's plan with both praise 
and skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy McGregor, smartly dressed in a floral print blouse,  
matching hat and oversize eyeglasses, shoved aside a half-eaten 
slice of cake and ice cream and ticked off her ailments that 
require costly medication: ``high blood pressure, heart, 
diabetes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sprightly 91-year-old said she spends $1,600 a year out of  
her own pocket for various medications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I use Social Security and belt-tightening to pay for my  
medication,'' she said. ``It means I don't have money left to do 
everything I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Chicago native said she is holding her own financially,  
unlike some of her friends. ``I know a couple of people that it 
comes down to buying medicine or eating,'' Mrs. McGregor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McGregor is all for the president's Medicare prescription  
plan, noting that Medicare currently covers only in-hospital 
medications: ``It will help many, many, many people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't be around to benefit, but that's OK,'' she added.  
</P>
<P>
	Other seniors also voiced support for the plan.  
</P>
<P>
	Former truck driver Charlie Hudson's eyes drifted toward the  
ceiling as he paused to ponder how many pills he pops a day. 
There's Tagamet for his stomach, Cardizem for his heart, Paxil as 
an antidepressant, and other drugs to keep his cholesterol and 
blood pressure in check. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson and his wife, Stella, both 72, consider themselves  
fortunate. Each time they visit the pharmacy, they have just a $5 
co-payment per prescription under their PacifiCare of Arizona HMO 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am thrilled to death that everyone will have the opportunity  
to enjoy the medication benefits that we enjoy,'' said Mrs. Hudson, 
a former electronics plant employee in Springfield, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hudson, who has been on pain medication for months after  
breaking her arm in a fall, wondered: ``If HMOs like ours can cover 
the cost of drugs, why can't they have them everywhere for the 
elderly?''

<HEADLINE> GOP Congress Receives Tax Talk Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans who want to talk taxes at home  
over the Fourth of July recess got some help before leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
	The House GOP leadership has sent its 223 members to their home  
districts with a ``Tax Relief Action Packet'' designed to promote a 
tax cut bill expected to total between $778 billion and $996 
billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need your help to communicate this message outside the  
Beltway,'' Rep. J.C. Watts, the No. 4-ranking House Republican, 
wrote in a letter to lawmakers, referring to the superhighway that 
encircles the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ensuring that Americans keep more of what they earn, including  
the tax overpayment due them, is a vital part of our agenda,'' said 
the Oklahoma Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans frequently complain that President Clinton is able  
to outfox them on issues ranging from welfare reform to Social 
Security through his communications skills and use of the 
presidential spotlight. GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have pledged to 
present a more unified message, blaming their 1998 election losses 
in part on their failure to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats say this latest tax-cutting exercise is nothing  
but politics geared to the 2000 elections. Clinton, they say, would 
never sign such a huge tax cut into law, and the GOP has made no 
attempt to craft a more modest compromise with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their goal is purely political -- to energize their political  
base by forcing through an irresponsible tax bill that the 
president will veto,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, top 
Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. ``The Republican 
leadership does not care about actually enacting a tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to begin considering  
its tax cut bill, which uses projected budget surpluses, the week 
of July 12. Before that, however, Republican leaders must determine 
how to divide the revised non-Social Security surplus among tax 
relief, higher government spending and Medicare reforms that 
include prescription drug benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the chances of a bipartisan deal on these issues appear  
slim, President Clinton may meet with top Republican and Democratic 
congressional leaders after the recess to discuss the possibility 
of compromise, according to GOP aides and White House officials 
speaking on condition of anonymity Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-page House GOP tax packet includes quotes from Democrats  
that can be used against them in speeches, talking points and fact 
sheets for press conferences or broadcast interviews and sample 
newspaper opinion pieces on several planned elements of the tax 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical talking point: ``You and your family need a break. You  
need more control over your own lives and your own money.'' 
Another: ``You deserve the ability to make your dreams come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watts also asked GOP House members to consider holding a ``tax  
relief event in your state, either a press conference or a town 
hall meeting,'' and show up on local talk radio to get out the 
message. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the same information was included in a larger Republican  
``recess and message packet'' given to both House members and 
senators, which says that the ``main communications focus will 
shift to tax relief'' for the weeklong Independence Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
	That package also includes some basic American history for  
members to recite. It notes, for instance, that Thomas Jefferson 
wrote the first draft of the Declaration of Independence, which was 
voted on by the Continental Congress in Philadelphia on July 4, 
1776.

<HEADLINE> INS Officer Reassigned Amid Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An Immigration and Naturalization Service officer  
was reassigned after allegations that Border Patrol agents taunted 
two Cuban refugees and made them pose with a photo of Cuban 
President Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer was ``temporarily assigned to duties which do not  
involve contact with INS detainees,'' the INS said in a statement. 
The Border Patrol is an arm of the INS. The statement did not 
identify the officer or specify what position he held. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees were among six who frantically tried to swim past  
Coast Guard boats earlier in the week. The two accusing the Border 
Patrol of abuse made it to shore and were detained. Four were 
pulled from the water and taken to an INS detention center. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were freed from custody and allowed to remain in the  
United States following large protests by the Cuban community. 
</P>
<P>
	``INS does not condone or in any way tolerate unprofessional  
behavior on the part of its employees,'' the INS statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duviel Rodriguez, 17, and Carlos Hernandez Cordova, 29, told  
Spanish radio WQBA Thursday they were taunted and cursed. ```This 
is our country,' they told us,'' Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they were forced to look into a camera while holding a  
photo of Castro. When they protested, they were told to hold the 
photo higher, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The allegations are so disgustingly outrageous that if there's  
any truth to them I certainly expect more than a reassignment,'' 
said Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. ``That's blatant 
psychological torture reminiscent of a totalitarian state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Janet Reno said she was ``deeply troubled'' by the  
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no room for abusive conduct among the ranks of our  
law enforcement personnel,'' Ms. Reno said in a joint statement 
with Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder. ``We take these, and all 
such allegations, extremely seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Justice said the allegations will be reviewed  
by its Office of Inspector General and its Civil Rights Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard also is investigating its treatment of the six  
refugees. Television reports showed the Coast Guard blasting the 
men with a hose as they stood in their 14-foot rowboat about 150 
yards from shore. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency then swarmed them as they jumped overboard and swam  
toward shore.

<HEADLINE> Powerful Fireworks Ring Broken Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Authorities have now charged five people with  
running an illegal fireworks ring nearly a year after the death of 
a 17-year-old boy triggered an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ring allegedly sold fireworks in several states ranging from  
$2 to $30, for a thousands of dollars in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about an operation that sold, conservatively,  
hundreds of thousands of devices, and it may be in the millions,'' 
said Eric Stone, legal director of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal indictments unsealed Thursday charged Donald Peters,  
daughter Peggy Malueg and Charles Childers of selling, 
manufacturing and transporting illegal fireworks. Rodney Harris and 
Albert Castellano Jr. pleaded guilty to charges last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictments do not specify what the defendants are accused  
of selling. But authorities have seized more than four tons of 
illegal fireworks in Wisconsin over the past year, including more 
than 65,000 quarter-sticks, half-sticks, M-80s and other explosives 
illegal under federal law, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mario Gonzales 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges carry penalties of 10 to 21 years in prison and  
fines up to $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General James Doyle said an investigation began  
after Eric Pluger, 17, was killed last July 14 when he and his 
friends blew up a mailbox with a quarter-stick of dynamite, an 
illegal explosive. 
</P>
<P>
	Pluger died after his truck stalled and he was hit by metal  
flying from the exploding mailbox in Shiocton, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the five defendants was connected with the explosive  
that killed Pluger, Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional investigations into illegal fireworks are underway in  
Wisconsin and across the country, said Alan Schoem, director of 
compliance for the safety commission.

<HEADLINE> Officials Call For Holiday Quiet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK, Wash. (AP) -- The wild wail of a car  
alarm echoes off the cliffs. An RV rumbles by, closing in on a 
precious parking space. Behind the clouds, unseen but not unheard, 
a jetliner clears its throat across the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Ah, the serenity of a day in Paradise -- or at least a day in the  
Paradise parking lot at Mount Rainier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fourth of July weekend is the noisiest of holidays in  
America's national parks and recreation areas. But this summer, 
amid the snarl of Jet Skis, the clatter of sightseeing helicopters 
and the honking hordes of motorists, there comes a plea for a 
little peace and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	National Park Service officials say the rising din of mechanical  
noise in natural areas has made them realize they must manage the 
parks not just for sights but for the sounds, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of parks look like they did 200 years ago, but they  
don't sound like they did,'' said Wes Henry, a natural resources 
specialist at the agency's ranger division in Washington, D.C. He's 
helping to write a new ``soundscape preservation'' policy that 
would guide park managers in identifying and reducing bothersome 
noises. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's motorboats on rivers or buses or planes or cars  
or generators in the campground, the noise signature of people is 
everywhere,'' Henry said. ``You can get away from the sight of 
people, but it's infinitely harder to get away from the sound of 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the loudest spots:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Grand Canyon National Park, where a decade-long fight over  
the noise of air tours has not prevented a huge increase in the 
number of sightseeing flights, now more than 140,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Yellowstone National Park, where the winter use of snowmobiles  
is growing, despite environmentalists' complaints that the machines 
not only kill wildlife and ruin air and water quality, but shatter 
the solitude. 
</P>
<P>
	-- National seashores and recreation areas where Jet Skis and  
other personal watercraft still whine. When the park service last 
September proposed banning the craft it exempted 25 sites, but now 
environmentalists and local park managers want some of those 
declared off limits, too. The industry is fighting further 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mount Rainier, which in 1907 became the first national park  
to allow cars, park managers deal with a varied cascade of noise. 
They're studying the possibility of using shuttle buses to thin the 
stampede of motor vehicles that arrives each summer. Snowmobiles, 
now allowed on some unplowed roads in the winter, would be banned 
under one option in a proposed management plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Park managers also have split the 236,000-acre park into zones  
according to how much use they receive. For example, they can tell 
a visitor seeking solitude not to linger near Paradise, where each 
hiker on trails near the parking lot can expect just 13 feet of 
personal space on a busy summer day, said park planner Eric 
Walkinshaw. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the parade of jetliners ripping a swath of noise across  
the sky on their way to and from Seattle-Tacoma International 
Airport, there's little the park service can do, Walkinshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	The clamor in the parks is not all external. Park officials also  
contribute. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Hempton, who makes his living recording the sounds of  
nature, was dismayed when he visited California's Yosemite National 
Park to document the sounds that naturalist John Muir once heard. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1868, Muir wrote: ``No temple made with hands can compare  
with Yosemite. Every rock in its walls seems to glow with life ... 
and myriads of small winged creatures -- birds, bees, butterflies -- 
give glad animation and help to make all the air into music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hempton's findings: ``I recorded leaf-blowers and  
street-sweepers in Yosemite Village. On a day-and-a-half-long hike 
up the John Muir Trail, I heard power generators being operated 
with a special-use permit to provide electricity to a backcountry 
camp. I heard gas-powered water pumps to operate fire hoses in case 
of a forest fire. There was dynamite blasting going on, and 
jackhammers were being used to construct a stairway out of the 
stone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Human noises not only can spoil a visitor's wilderness  
experience, they can disrupt wildlife, Henry said. They may make it 
harder for frogs to hear potential mates peeping, for example, or 
mask the airy whistle of hawk feathers alerting a vole that it's 
about to become lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The birds aren't just singing for us,'' Henry said. ``They're  
talking to each other. They need to mate and reproduce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's draft policy on noise management, circulating among  
park service officials but not yet released publicly, calls for 
monitoring noise levels in the parks and restoring ``degraded 
soundscapes'' so modern visitors can experience the natural music 
that Muir heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Other efforts to cut the fog of noise:  
</P>
<P>
	-- A draft policy for guiding park administrators in regulating  
air tourism over parks is due out this fall, drawn up by the 
Federal Aviation Administration in conjunction with the park 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The park service is expanding a study on the impact of  
snowmobiles, prompted by environmental groups' petition for a ban 
on the machines, now allowed in 28 parks. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the hottest noise debates concerns personal watercraft,  
those water scooters that zip over the waves like amplified 
hornets. Known by such trade names as Jet Ski, Sea Doo and Wave 
Runner, they have boomed in popularity in recent years. Nearly 1.3 
million are now in use, with annual sales hovering just under 
130,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ride them, you like them,'' said Larry Lambrose,  
executive director of the Personal Watercraft Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But if you're on shore or quietly fishing from a canoe, you  
don't. That's why the park service last September proposed a rule 
restricting the use of personal watercraft. 
</P>
<P>
	It banned them from most of the park system, limiting their use  
to 25 recreation and seashore areas. Since then, local park 
superintendents have reduced access even more, enacting or 
proposing restrictions in 11 of those 25 areas, Lambrose said. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes personal watercraft have been targeted unfairly.  
They don't make any more noise than some motorboats, he said, and 
new models get quieter every year -- an argument also forwarded by 
makers of snowmobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because it's the park service, there's a tendency to be a lot  
more responsive to environmental groups,'' Lambrose said. ``But do 
they really have an idea of the impact on various businesses that 
support this type of sport? They don't. Did they evaluate the 
impact on personal watercraft users who go to the park to recreate? 
No, they did not. It's one of those situations where it's like, `We 
don't like you and we'll come up with reasons, whether they hold 
water or not.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over personal watercraft will last for years, if the  
wrangling over aerial tourism is any indication. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Congress directed the park service and Federal Aviation  
Administration to regulate sightseeing flights over the Grand 
Canyon to reduce the noise. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve years later, the park service, air-tour operators,  
environmentalists, tribal organizations and river guides still are 
fighting over the issue. Meanwhile, the annual number of flights 
over the canyon has doubled to about 144,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never succeeded at getting the parties to talk to each  
other,'' Henry said. ``They're usually at each other's throats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of reasons for that: Aerial tourism contributes about  
$375 million to the southern Nevada economy, according to a study 
by the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. And people like Gordon 
Hempton believe there's no place at all for ``flightseeing'' over 
the national parks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have a natural experience from a helicopter --  
period,'' Hempton said. ``Individuals in the sky are violating 
everybody's right to quiet. They have no right to be there. It just 
absolutely infuriates me. I would just as soon have them flying 
model aircraft inside our theaters and concert halls.''

<HEADLINE> One-Gun Bill Sent to Calif. Gov. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Handgun buyers in California would be  
allowed to purchase just one per month under a bill before Gov. 
Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, approved Thursday by the Senate, is the first gun  
control measure to pass the Legislature since lawmakers vowed to 
make gun laws tougher following the massacre at a Littleton, Colo., 
high school in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, a person can walk into a store, buy countless handguns,  
and feed them to the black market where they're snatched by kids, 
felons and gang members,'' said Assemblyman Wally Knox, a Democrat 
and the bill's author. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has not yet taken a position on the bill. Law enforcement  
authorities, federally licensed collectors and security guards in 
the nation's most populous state would be exempt from the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents contend limiting handgun sales would infringe the  
constitutional right to bear arms and do little to make California 
safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law doesn't ration guns; it rations rights. It's like  
saying you can have your freedom of speech, but only once a 
month,'' said Sen. Bill Morrow, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Knox cited a study by Handgun Control Inc., which said about 80  
percent of the guns seized by Southern California law enforcement 
officials were originally purchased from legal gun dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 40,722 handguns were sold in California.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the state Senate in New Jersey passed a bill  
requiring the sale of ``smart guns'' with sensors that allow them 
to be fired only by their owners. In a compromise backed by the 
Republican Senate president, the requirement would go into effect 
only when such guns become available commercially from at least two 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill passed, 23-17, and now goes to the state Assembly. Gov.  
Christie Whitman, a Republican, has said she supports trigger locks 
and ``smart guns,'' althought she has not publicly said whether she 
would sign this compromise bill if it clears the Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Say They're Ready for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and Canadian airlines say they are 95  
percent finished with their Year 2000 computer repairs and will be 
all done by summer's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration also said Thursday that,  
despite a late start, all of its air traffic control computers had 
been repaired and tested by the agency's own June 30 deadline. A 
public declaration of success will come later this month after an 
inspection by government auditors and an outside consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	The news put the focus on two other areas of the airline  
industry that have yet to give a clear picture of their readiness: 
airports -- both domestic and abroad -- and foreign air carriers. 
Information from those sources is trickling in, but it may be 
months before it gets out to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N.-based  
group, has been collecting airport and airline preparedness data 
from foreign governments. The State Department, which has access to 
the data, may wait until this fall before warning U.S. travelers 
about areas of the world they should avoid at the new year, when 
some computers may not be able to recognize the date 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the International Air Transport Association, which  
represents 265 international airlines, has been surveying its 
members. But the group's findings will remain private in an effort 
to promote full disclosure by the carriers. Passengers may not know 
which foreign airlines are having problems until later this year, 
when they start canceling flights around the New Year's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of airline readiness was made by the Aviation  
Millennium Project, a group organized in March 1998 by 102 U.S. and 
Canadian airlines to ensure airline, airport and air traffic 
control readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The group estimates that the airlines will spent more than $750  
million solving the problem; worldwide the figure is expected to be 
$2.3 billion. The U.S. and Canadian systems that have been repaired 
and tested to date are wide-ranging, from computerized reservations 
to crew scheduling and aircraft operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000  
Conversion, said at a news conference Thursday he was pleased by 
the progress made by U.S. and Canadian airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	As for major U.S. airports, Koskinen said they have ``addressed  
everything from baggage handling to runway lights to gate 
assignments. The focus is increasing on the smaller airports, who 
are addressing it. Fortunately, they have more simplified and 
straightforward systems that take less time to remediate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also sought to play down concerns about the safety of flying  
overseas.

	``As a general matter, the issue in flying internationally is  
not safety, it really is a question of congestion and timing,'' he

	The Year 2000, or Y2K, problem is glitch that may cause  
computers to malfunction on Jan. 1. Some computer software was 
written to recognize years in a two-digit format, such as ``99'' 
for 1999. There is uncertainty about what will happen when the year 
changes to 2000, since some computers may misconstrue the ``00'' 
for 1900 instead of 2000.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed slightly higher Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	In London, the fight for control of Allied Domecq's pubs and  
stores took center stage, while blue chips paused for breath after 
Thursday's surge. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the tussle in the brewing sector, the trend  
elsewhere in London was flat, as the FTSE-100 closed up a slight 
0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, the CAC 40 index of most actively traded French stocks  
added 0.2 percent to finish at a record 4,620.67 points. Casino, 
the food retailer, posted the biggest gain, rising 4.6 percent. 
Renault, the car and truck maker, was the second-leading gainer 
with a 3.9 percent climb. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a fragile start, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX made a major  
comeback, closing at a yearly high of 5,519.05 points, up 0.7 
percent. Its rise was marred only by the underperformance of 
automobile shares in its home market and across much of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	But most investors were preoccupied by gains among European  
technology stocks -- notably the Frankfurt software group SAP, 
Paris-listed semiconductor maker Thomson CSF, Stockholm's Ericsson 
and Helsinki's Nokia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Auto index declined 0.7 percent -- the  
worst-hit sector Friday. Volkswagen closed down 3 percent -- the 
biggest decliner of the Frankfurt market -- and DaimlerChrysler lost 
1.5 percent after it reported a 5 percent dip in June U.S. sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 594 European companies and the Dow  
Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 295 companies in countries 
that joined the euro single currency, both closed up 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan's MIBtel index slipped to close down 0.01 percent, and  
Madrid's IBEX-35 index was up 0.3 percent. Among smaller markets, 
Budapest's BUX ended up 1.8 percent, Dublin's ISEQ rose 1.7 
percent, and Prague fell 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Fraud Suit Standards Tightened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In a victory for high-technology companies  
and others facing securities fraud suits, a federal appeals court 
ruled Friday that such suits must be dismissed at the outset unless 
they contain detailed evidence of deliberate fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2-1 ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a  
business-sponsored 1995 federal law, passed over President 
Clinton's veto, was intended to set a strict standard to discourage 
meritless suits. 
</P>
<P>
	That means a suit, when filed, must allege ``in the greatest  
detail possible'' what company officials knew, and how they knew 
it, when they made the statements that were the basis of the fraud 
claims, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockholders' lawyers said they would appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	The territory covered by the nine-state circuit court includes  
California's Silicon Valley, home of companies that have been 
frequent targets of securities suits. Those suits typically follow 
a drop in stock prices and claim that company insiders issued 
misleading statements while selling their own stock at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling conflicted with interpretations by the federal  
Securities and Exchange Commission and most other federal courts, 
which have declared standards that would let more suits survive 
pretrial challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the other  
major forum for securities fraud suits, ruled earlier this year 
that it was enough to allege facts showing that a company or its 
executives had the motive and opportunity to commit fraud or acted 
recklessly -- a considerably more lenient test than Friday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	A disagreement among appellate courts makes Supreme Court review  
more likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a reason for every American who's got wealth tied to  
the stock market to care'' about the dispute, said Joseph 
Grundfest, a professor of law and business at Stanford Law School. 
``We don't want frivolous litigation, but on the other hand we 
don't want fraud. Congress adopted a very unclear statute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposing parties in the case disagreed on the effect of the  
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The details required by the court wouldn't be available even to  
a company's chief executive, said Paul F. Bennett, lawyer for a 
stockholder who accused a computer company of stock manipulation 
and insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Vanyo, lawyer for Silicon Graphics Inc., countered that  
the ruling merely required investors to show ``that they have a 
real factual basis for their claim of fraud, as opposed to bad news 
and a stock drop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which makes desktop graphic workstations, and six  
officers were accused by stockholders of hiding bad news about a 
new product between September and December 1995. The officers sold 
large numbers of shares before the information was disclosed and 
the stock price plunged, the suits alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	The suits said fraud was shown by internal company reports  
showing problems with the product while officers were making 
optimistic public statements. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court, upholding a lower-court ruling, said the  
allegations weren't specific enough under the Private Securities 
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. That law requires shareholder fraud 
suits to state, in their initial pleadings, ``facts giving rise to 
a strong inference'' of deliberate fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Those facts must demonstrate at least ``deliberate or conscious  
recklessness,'' said the opinion by Judge Joseph Sneed. He said the 
claims against Silicon Graphics failed to allege what was in the 
company reports, who prepared them and who read them; also, the 
stock sales, though substantial, weren't unusual enough to show 
they were probably based on inside information. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is In re Silicon Graphics, 97-16204.

	Clinton Welcomes N. Ireland Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today called a plan to  
salvage the stalemated peace accord in Northern Ireland a ``a very 
welcome development.'' Clinton said there were guarantees for both 
sides in the agreement announced today by British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern. The leaders 
announced a formula to form a long-postponed Protestant-Catholic 
government, the heart of last year's troubled peace accord. But the 
plan failed to gain the support of key local politicians.

	NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In Novi Sad, 5,000 people  
demonstrated against President Slobodan Milosevic's government 
Friday night. It was the second anti-government rally in Serbia 
this week. Leaders of NATO countries have refused to help rebuild 
the country while Milosevic is in power. Meanwhile, American 
peacekeepers arrested five Serb soldiers who claimed they strayed 
across the border into Kosovo, and Dutch forces took into custody 
six armed Yugoslav policemen broadcasting clandestinely, NATO said.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. reported  
today that their U.S. sales edged up 1 percent in June, compared 
with their strong performances a year ago, as the auto industry 
continued its steady growth toward a record sales year. For the 
first half of the year, industry sales were up 7 percent. If sales 
were to continue at the same seasonally adjusted annual rate in the 
second half, the industry could sell 16.6 million cars and light 
trucks, well ahead of the record 16.1 million sold in 1986.

The Dow rose 586.68 points for the week, a gain of more than 5 
percent and the biggest one-week gain in its 103-year history. 
Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange led decliners 
1,695-1,220. The Nasdaq composite index rose 34.84 to 2,741.02, a

	Humming Economy Fuels Job Growth  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy is still roaring ahead, creating  
more than a quarter-million new jobs in June. Though the overall 
unemployment rate crept up to 4.3 percent, all industries except 
manufacturing and mining posted solid gains. Indeed, some 
economists suggested the strong job growth could prolong concern at 
the Federal Reserve that the economy might be growing too fast for 
its own good. American businesses added 268,000 new jobs, a big 
turnaround from May when they cut payrolls by 5,000, the Labor 
Department said today.

	Aversion to Movie Violence Drops

Americans don't seem to be as upset by violent movies as they used 
to be. The poll found that 40 percent of adults said they would be 
less likely to see a movie if they knew it contained violence -- 20 
points lower than the percentage who answered the same way a decade 
ago. In the poll, only one-third of respondents said violence is 
the biggest problem with current movies. Thirteen percent said 
there is too much sex on the big screen.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Nearly ten weeks after the world watched  
his bullet-bloodied body tumble from a window at Columbine High 
School, survivor Pat Ireland limped out of the hospital today. 
Standing with one crutch and a leg brace, Ireland told reporters he 
was eager to get on with the healing process -- at home. Ireland was 
one of the most critically wounded victims of the April 20 school 
massacre. He was shot once in the foot and twice in the head. One 
bullet grazed his scalp but another lodged into his brain, causing 
severe trauma that has left him partially paralyzed on his right

fourth defendant. Jay Jarrell and Robert Whiteside, both executives

Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic urged the council to implement 
an aspect of the June 3 peace agreement that would allow for the

deal set no timeframe for the return of Serb troops to the province

<HEADLINE> Croatian Teen Nears Wimbledon Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- A year ago, Mirjana Lucic was living  
in fear. Now she's one match away from the Wimbledon final. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the 17-year-old Croatian upset 1998 runner-up  
Nathalie Tauziat 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 to reach the semifinals, marking an 
amazing turnaround in her fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
	After long being spoken of as one of the new teen-age stars  
along with Martina Hingis, Venus and Serena Williams and Anna 
Kournikova, Lucic has made her breakthrough on tennis' biggest 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	While holding a place in tennis history by winning her debut  
tournaments in both singles and doubles, Lucic was distracted by a 
volatile relationship with her father Marinko, a former Olympic 
decathlete. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucik accused him of beating her whenever she lost matches, a  
charge he denies. 
</P>
<P>
	After her second round defeat at Wimbledon a year ago, she  
revealed that her father had tried to stop her from playing again, 
and the entire family -- mother Angelka, together with two brothers 
and sisters -- made the decision to move to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``At Wimbledon (in 1998) he told me he would make sure I never  
play tennis again,'' Lucic told a Zagreb newspaper, Slobodna 
Dalmacija, after arriving in the United States. ``Beatings ... 
there have been more of them than anyone can imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucic, who won the 1998 Australian Open doubles title with  
Hingis, is thrilled that she made the move to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it,'' she said Friday. ``It's perfect. I have the  
support of so many people. My whole family is very happy, healthy, 
so I enjoy it very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucic, who upset fourth-seeded Monica Seles in the third round,  
walked a tightrope to victory over Tauziat, with the Frenchwoman 
serving for the match at 5-4 in the final set. When it was over, 
Lucic raised her arms in celebration of the biggest moment of her 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beating Monica was definitely big,'' she said. ``But I would  
say this win today was bigger, because it's the first time that I'm 
playing the quarterfinals (of a Grand Slam).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucic's match against the eighth-seeded Tauziat began on  
Thursday and was repeatedly suspended by rain before being 
postponed with Tauziat leading 6-4, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went on and off three times yesterday, and to come back  
today and be down 5-3 in the third, it's really tough,'' Lucic 
said. ``I'm very happy that I did it because it was not just about 
tennis. It's very mental, this game.''

<HEADLINE> Y2K Bill Awaits Clinton's Signature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is ready to sign into law a  
bill that could save American businesses billions of dollars in 
legal costs from Y2K-related lawsuits but that some consumer groups 
see as an infringement on basic legal rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Following months of tinkering to make the bill acceptable first  
to Democrats and then to the White House, the legislation passed 
Thursday by sweeping margins, 404-24 in the House and 81-18 in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would seek to delay or prevent expensive  
lawsuits by giving companies 90 days to fix computers that break 
down because they only read the last two digits of dates and 
mistake the year 2000 for 1900. It encourages mediation, caps 
punitive damages for small businesses, puts limits on class action 
lawsuits and ensures that in most cases companies will be held 
responsible only for the damage they cause. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chief Senate sponsor with  
Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., will 
``make sure that America's prosperity does not screech to a halt 
when the calendar pages slip over to start a new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., a chief House sponsor, said it would  
protect ``tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions in assets'' 
threatened by frivolous lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would become the second to help businesses gird for the  
Y2K bug, following a law enacted last year allowing businesses to 
share information on fixing the problem free from concerns of legal 
repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House repeatedly threatened to veto the originally  
passed House and Senate bills, saying they went too far in 
restricting the rights of Americans to go to court and win full 
compensation for wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Senate Democrats, Wyden and Dodd, led intense  
negotiations over the weekend that gave consumers some added 
protections in the bill and won the White House's reluctant 
acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Chief of Staff John Podesta, in a letter Wednesday,  
said that it was only because of the ``unique and unprecedented'' 
nature of the Y2K problem that the president would sign the bill. 
Normally, he said, ``the administration would oppose many of the 
extraordinary steps taken in this legislation to alter liability 
and procedural rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill will go off the books after three years, but opponents  
argued that it was a foot in the door for Republican-led efforts to 
change product liability laws to protect businesses from expensive 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., a leading supporter of the Y2K bill,  
acknowledged that the bill was ``a precedent out there for a number 
of issues we've been fighting for for many, many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Democrat, Sen. Ernest Hollings, was also among the most  
critical of what some critics said was the effort of both the White 
House and Congress to seek favor with the high-tech industry, which 
strongly favored the legislation and which is expected to 
contribute heavily to presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were going to get a bill for the vice president,''  
Hollings, D-S.C., said, adding that the White House wanted to win 
Silicon Valley money for Vice President Al Gore and ``they ought to 
be taken to task for this kind of performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This legislation will protect the very same corporations that  
knowingly created the Y2K defect for their own profit,'' Public 
Citizen's Joan Claybrook said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dodd, one of the Senate's leading experts on the Y2K  
problem, said that while no one knows the extent of disruptions 
from the computer glitch, ``there will be repercussions affecting 
virtually every facet of our lives ... and in America where there 
are problems, lawsuits are never far behind.''

<HEADLINE> Leaders Meet Before Indian March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHADRON, Neb. (AP) -- The governor met with American Indian  
leaders Friday as authorities evacuated the tiny town of Whiteclay, 
closed down its businesses and sent in 100 troopers on the eve of a 
protest march. 
</P>
<P>
	Sioux Indians from the Pine Ridge Reservation set fires and

	Activists said they would again march the two miles from the  
reservation in South Dakota over the state line into Whiteclay, 
where they planned to set up tepees and occupy the village until 
state officials addressed their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal leaders called Saturday's event a prayer march and said  
they didn't want it to turn ugly because it could scare President 
Clinton away from his visit to the reservation on Tuesday. Clinton 
plans to discuss economic development in Indian communities and 
tour tornado-damaged parts of Oglala, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gov. Mike Johanns ordered the evacuation of Whiteclay's  
22 residents and sent in the troopers to protect the village. 
Later, he met for an hour with four Oglala Sioux tribal officials, 
including president Harold Salway, who promised that Saturday's 
demonstration would be peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you come to pray, I don't see how there can be any  
worries,'' Salway said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor met with tribal officials in Chadron, about 65  
miles west of Whiteclay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we have a good start,'' Johanns said. ``This is a  
prayer march. We want to emphasize that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Indian Movement leaders and members of the Oglala Sioux  
tribe allege the U.S. government has violated an 1868 treaty that 
reserved parts of North and South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana and 
Nebraska for the Sioux. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribe members are also upset that a few stores in Whiteclay sell  
more than $3 million worth of beer each year, mostly to Indians 
with drinking problems. The rate of alcoholism is high among 
Indians, and alcohol is banned on the Pine Ridge Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If them bars weren't there, a lot of our people, including my  
cousin and younger brother, would be alive today,'' said Tom Poor 
Bear, who organized last weekend's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, tribe members say local police have not done enough to  
investigate the deaths of Wilson Black Elk Jr., 40, and Ronald Hard 
Heart, 39, whose bodies were found June 8 in a culvert near the 
Nebraska line. Poor Bear is Black Elk's older half-brother and Hard 
Heart's cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns said the state could not offer much help with the  
investigation because the bodies were found in South Dakota. 
Federal and tribal police have announced a $15,000 reward for 
information on the slayings.

<HEADLINE> India Jets Pound Islamic Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- Indian fighter jets pounded Islamic  
guerrillas entrenched on Himalayan mountaintops in Kashmir today as 
advancing ground troops closed in on a strategic peak overlooking 
an Indian national highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Press Trust of India news agency said the Indian soldiers  
launched a final assault on 16,500-foot Tiger Hill on Thursday 
night after surrounding it from three sides. Local commanders said 
supply lines from the Pakistani side to the fighters had been 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground troops used shoulder-fired missiles to destroy several  
guerrilla bunkers dug into the rocky ridges below the peak, field 
commanders said. There the soldiers seized arms and ammunitions 
that would have lasted the guerrillas three months, they said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Late this evening, warplanes hunted for fighters riding  
snowmobiles sighted northwest of the peak, air force spokesman 
Group Capt. D. N. Ganesh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Round-the-clock airstrikes for the past week accompanied the  
fiercest fighting in seven weeks between Indian soldiers and 
secessionist Islamic fighters in Indian-held Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	India says the opposing fighters include Pakistani soldiers who  
crossed the 1972 cease-fire line that divides Kashmir between the 
two neighbors. Pakistan has said its troops are engaged only in 
retaliatory shelling. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan both claim all of Kashmir, which has been the  
focus of two of the three wars between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, suspected Islamic guerrillas attacked a village in  
India's troubled Jammu-Kashmir state, killing at least 10 Hindus, 
police said. It was the third attack on villagers this week in 
Kashmir by suspected guerrillas who have been fighting a separatist 
war since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten gunmen stormed two adjacent houses in Arahi, a village three  
miles from the cease-fire line, and gunned down six men, two women 
and two children, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting in Kashmir will not delay Indian general elections,  
expected to be held before the first week of October, India's chief 
election commissioner, M.S. Gill, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kashmir conflict has generated international concern because  
India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan repeated calls today for peace talks between the two  
countries. A government statement said New Delhi must understand 
the ``serious consequences of a wider conflict.'' India has 
rejected any dialogue over the hostilities unless the fighters are 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighboring China appealed to the two rivals Thursday to respect  
the 27-year-old dividing line and resume negotiations to ``seek a 
fair and reasonable settlement of all their differences.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Faces Tough Choices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Congress returns from its Fourth of July  
recess, the competition will be fierce on how to divide nearly $1 
trillion in budget surpluses among tax cuts, Medicare and more 
government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office's latest forecast is for a total  
surplus over 10 years of $2.9 trillion, including $996 billion that 
is not earmarked for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans want all that non-Social Security money used to  
cut taxes -- far above their initial plan for a $778 billion tax cut 
-- but others say Medicare changes should come first, including new 
assistance for prescription drugs as sought by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may put a little bit more money in tax cuts,'' said Rep.  
John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee. ``But 
we're not going to take all of these extra resources if we think we 
have a legitimate way to really reform Medicare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, contend that huge tax cuts would do  
nothing to erase the public debt and could severely hamper key 
programs ranging from education to national parks, which are 
subject to budget spending caps imposed during times of federal 
deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this tax cut proposal is totally irresponsible and  
misplaced in terms of its goals,'' said House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	But GOP House leaders vowed Thursday to press ahead the week of  
July 12 with a massive tax cut even though many GOP moderates, 
particularly in the Senate, believe it is too large and Democrats 
say its sheer size practically begs a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year package outlined in general terms would include cuts  
in taxes on income, inheritances and investments, as well as breaks 
to encourage personal savings for retirement and education and to 
enable more people to afford health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only reason for this surplus is because taxpayers are  
paying too much, which is why they deserve a refund,'' said Rep. 
Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. 
``If we don't cut taxes now and the money stays in Washington, the 
politicians surely will spend it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats believe Clinton will never sign a tax cut bill  
approaching $1 trillion, although he has said he is willing to 
consider a moderate bill using some of the surplus with benefits 
targeted to the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate presents another roadblock to a $1 trillion tax cut.  
Because the GOP budget only allows for $14 billion of the new 
surplus estimate to be added to the tax package, it could take 60 
of the 100 senators to agree to boost the number by more. The 
Senate has 55 Republicans, 45 Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters he  
was ``excited'' by the House proposals but added that there was no 
``magic number'' for the tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like for us to have the largest possible tax  
reduction,'' Lott said. ``But we have to get a bill ... through the 
Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Lott, Senate Finance Committee Chairman William  
Roth, R-Del., urged that only $14 billion of the new surplus money 
be added to the tax cut and the rest be set aside ``to carry out a 
comprehensive Medicare reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most on Capitol Hill now believe there will be a tax cut  
of some kind, given the giant budget surpluses driven by America's 
booming economy. Some moderate Democrats, for instance, are 
discussing tax relief of roughly $500 billion, possibly including a 
capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a prevailing consensus that there ought to be a tax  
cut,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. ``Now the question is 
how large it will be and what should be the components of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If any large tax cuts eventually pass, most of the impact will  
be delayed until after 2004 because, until then, the $2.9 trillion 
surplus is dominated by payroll taxes used to fund Social Security. 
After 2004, income tax revenue begins to take over. 
</P>
<P>
	CBO also had some words of caution about the surplus  
projections, saying that as baby boomers begin retiring in 2010 and 
relying in large numbers on Social Security and Medicare, 
``budgetary pressures ... can easily reverse the favorable fiscal 
forces that are operating today.''

<HEADLINE> Movie-Violence Poll Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on violence and movies is based on  
telephone interviews with 1,005 randomly selected adults from all 
states except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviews were conducted June 
25-29 by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by key  
demographic factors, such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	In the poll, no more than one time in 20 should chance  
variations in the sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 
percentage points from the answers that would be obtained if all 
Americans were polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll questions (because of rounding, sums may not total  
100 percent): 

</P>
<P>
	1. How many times have you gone to see a movie in the last year?  
</P>
<P>
	--None, 37 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--1 or 2, 22 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--3 to 10, 26 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--10 to 20, 9 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--more than 20, 5 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	2. If you heard a movie had violence in it, would that make you  
more likely to see it, less likely, or wouldn't it matter? 
</P>
<P>
	--More likely, 5 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Less likely, 40 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Wouldn't matter, 54 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	3. If you heard a movie had nudity in it, would that make you  
more likely to see it, less likely or wouldn't it matter? 
</P>
<P>
	--More likely, 6 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Less likely, 36 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Wouldn't matter, 56 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	4. Which one of the following do you think is the biggest  
problem with movies today? 
</P>
<P>
	--Too much violence, 32 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Tickets cost too much, 30 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Movies aren't as good as they used to be, 17 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Too much sex, 13 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--None of the above, 4 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	5. Theater owners recently announced they will check IDs to keep  
teens under 17 from seeing R-rated movies, which contain violent or 
sexual content. Do you think that step will be very effective, 
fairly effective, not very effective or not effective at all? 
</P>
<P>
	--Very effective, 19 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Fairly effective, 33 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Not very effective, 26 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Not effective at all, 19 percent.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Leaves Talks With North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- South Korea pulled its negotiators out of talks  
with North Korea today after the North refused to discuss reuniting 
separated families. 
</P>
<P>
	Seoul decided to suspend the shipments of fertilizer that had  
coaxed North Korea to the negotiating table until Pyongyang decides 
to discuss the reunions in good faith, said South Korea's chief 
negotiator, Vice Unification Minister Yang Young-shik. 
</P>
<P>
	``So long as the North does not change its position or attitude  
concerning these talks, we believe that is meaningless to continue 
on like this and have decided to go back to Korea,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's decision came as the talks in Beijing reached an  
impasse. After the last of three sessions ended inconclusively 
Thursday, North Korea's official news agency said no more meetings 
would be held until South Korea shipped more fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks were the highest level government contacts between the  
communist North and capitalist South in 14 months. In both cases, 
negotiations broke down over reuniting 10 million people separated 
from relatives by the division of the Korean peninsula 54 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korean negotiators -- headed by an official who once  
threatened to turn Seoul into a ``sea of fire'' -- appeared 
combative during the talks, huffily walking out of two of the three 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Yang said the North Koreans refused to shake hands, left  
sessions abruptly and showed no interest in rescheduling another 
meeting after Thursday's talks. They repeatedly raised the issue of 
last month's sinking of a North Korean gunboat in the Yellow or 
West Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sort of behavior or actions by the North tells us they  
are not fully prepared to talks about the separated family issue,'' 
Yang said. ``Perhaps because of the West Sea incident they need 
time to reorganize themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In last month's fight in the disputed sea, one North Korean  
gunboat sank and several others were heavily damaged. About 30 
North Korean sailors were believed to have died. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Korean border village of Panmunjom, North Korean Lt. Gen.  
Ri Chan Bok told the U.N. Command today that ``more serious blood'' 
will flow unless South Korea's navy stops intruding into its 
territorial waters in the Yellow Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Ri's remarks were carried by the North's foreign news outlet,  
KCNA. 
</P>
<P>
	The KCNA report said Ri charged that South Korea's navy has  
violated the North's territorial waters in and around the disputed 
zone 63 times since the June skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Maj. Gen. Michael M. Dunn, representing the U.N. Command,  
denied the North Korean charges and urged the North's navy to stay 
out of the contested area, command officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, Yang accused North Korea of violating an agreement  
made last month, under which the North promised to discuss 
reuniting families split by the 54-year division of the Korean 
Peninsula in return for fertilizer it badly needs to help revive 
its flagging agriculture sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Yang also said the North Koreans had promised to contact the  
South Koreans this morning but did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Withdrawing the badly needed fertilizer aid puts real pressure  
on North Korea to resume the talks quickly to get the rest of the 
fertilizer in time to use on summer crops, Yang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign aid groups have warned that the upcoming harvest will be  
meager without fertilizer for spent fields and fuel to run farm 
machinery. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Pyongyang and Seoul appeared to have compelling reasons to  
strike a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Successive years of floods and droughts wrecked North Korea's  
already struggling economy, leaving it dependent on international 
aid to stave off famine. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean President Kim Dae-jung has staked much political  
capital on a more open policy toward North Korea and needs proof of 
success to fend off domestic critics.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Medicare Plan Offers Saving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A little-noticed part of President Clinton's  
plan to overhaul Medicare would offer retirees the chance to save 
money if they see doctors who agree to special discount contracts 
with the health insurance program for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beneficiaries would pay lower cost-sharing when using  
preferred providers,'' said a document released by the White House 
late Friday, offering more details of proposed changes to Medicare 
that Clinton announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has not specified how much of a discount  
would be offered to retirees who used designated doctors. 
Currently, beneficiaries pay 20 percent of the costs of doctors' 
office visits regardless of which doctor they see. 
</P>
<P>
	The new system would make Medicare more like private managed  
care health plans, known as preferred provider organizations, in 
which many working-age Americans are enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
	People in such plans, commonly known as PPOs, can choose to see  
any doctor they want and still get reimbursed by insurers for a 
portion of the costs. But those who choose from a designated 
network of doctors, with whom the insurance company has worked out 
special pricing deals, pay less out of pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea would be to encourage Medicare beneficiaries to see  
doctors who have agreed to fee arrangements that would also save 
the government money. Such arrangements would not be limited to 
doctors under Clinton's plan, but also could include other types of 
health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``By selecting providers for special designation and providing  
beneficiaries incentives to use these providers, Medicare would be 
able to purchase high-quality services and items at more 
competitive rates, as private plans are able to do now,'' said the 
administration document. 
</P>
<P>
	To set up the new system, Medicare would likely contract with  
groups of doctors who already participate in similar private-sector 
arrangements, the administration document said. Those who agreed to 
participate would be offered perks by Medicare, such as faster 
claims payment.

<HEADLINE> RNC Asks for 'Soft Money' Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican National Committee is asking  
presidential candidates to help raise money for ads that would 
benefit the eventual GOP nominee next year. Both parties were 
criticized for such advertising strategies in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In a June 18 letter, RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson asked candidates  
to encourage people who have reached the $1,000 maximum for 
campaign donations to send additional money to the party for an 
``aggressive issue-advertising campaign'' designed to counter 
Democratic ads like those that helped re-elect President Clinton in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let your donors know that once they have reached their  
contribution limit, ... all further support should be channeled to 
the RNC,'' Nicholson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Many advocates of changing the campaign-finance laws view the  
tactic of directing contributions to the party for ``issue ads'' as 
a way to circumvent Watergate-inspired contribution and spending 
limits for presidential campaigns. The law requires that personal 
donations in excess of $1,000 go to the party as ``soft money'' for 
use in ``party-building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	RNC spokesman Mike Collins said ``it should come as no  
surprise'' that they seek donations from supporters of Republican 
presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's election law is so ridiculously complex that most  
Americans are unaware that, while their freedom to support a 
presidential candidate is restricted, they can still assist the 
candidate's political party,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee has never sent this kind of  
letter to its candidates, and it has no plans to do so, said 
spokeswoman Jenny Backus. But She said the party was keeping its 
options open on issue advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The RNC letter says candidates will be informed which of their  
contributors make donations to the Republican ``Media 2000'' ad 
campaign, which will begin after the presidential primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will assure them that you will be aware of their  
significant support,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	RNC spokesman Mark Pfeifle confirmed wording of the letter,  
which was first published Friday in The Arizona Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, with an early lead in the polls and a  
record $36 million in fund raising, will not tell his contributors 
to donate to the RNC advertising campaign, spokesman Dave Beckwith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are currently pursuing our own fund-raising efforts and  
will do so through the primary season. After the primaries are over 
I'm sure we'll work closely with the RNC,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the Forbes  
office was reviewing the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates of campaign finance reform have long criticized ``soft  
money,'' unlimited, unregulated donations that are supposed to help 
finance general political party activities but not to help elect 
federal candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Both national parties were criticized for using ``issue ads''  
paid for with soft money to help their presidential candidates in 
1996. But the Justice Department, after looking into the matter, 
found no evidence the ads violated election law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Election Commission rejected its auditors'  
recommendation that the campaigns of Clinton and GOP nominee Bob 
Dole repay millions of dollars in federal funds because of the ads. 
But commissioners have begun trying to clarify the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all completely legal, and it's exactly why we need reform  
of the campaign finance system,'' said Jodie Silverman, spokeswoman 
for Public Campaign, a group advocating campaign finance reform.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was 1903 when ``In Dahomey,'' a musical  
comedy in which most of the performers are black, first opened on 
Broadway, running 53 performances. A sprightly revival, starring 
Shirley Verrett, is now appearing at the off-Broadway Harry de Jur 
Playhouse in the Henry Street Settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only is it fascinating to see a Broadway show from that era,  
but ``In Dahomey'' is entertaining on its own terms, especially its 
songs. Besides Shirley Verrett, who sang in ``Carousel'' on 
Broadway after leaving the Metropolitan Opera, LaTrice Verrett, who 
plays her daughter and is not related to her, stood out in the 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Marion Cook, a noted composer and orchestra leader in his  
day, wrote the music, and Paul Laurence Dunbar was one of the 
lyricists. The vaudevillians Bert Williams and George Walker were 
in the original cast. Williams recorded two of the songs, now on CD 
compilations. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Shauneille Perry has worked on the book. She omitted a  
couple of songs from the original and used ``Brown Skin Baby of 
Mine'' and ``I Want To Be an Actor Lady,'' which Cook added to an 
early revival. 
</P>
<P>
	The plot, which exists as an excuse for some very attractive  
songs, requires a cast of 11. They rehearse a show, which will be a 
benefit for the African nation of Dahomey. There, LaTrice Verrett 
sings ``I Want To Be an Actor Lady'' to the displeasure of Shirley 
Verrett's character, who describes herself when she sings ``Colored 
Aristocracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another plot line, Kim Sullivan, playing a prince from  
Dahomey, hires two American detectives for some work back in his 
country. The two, played by Brian Chandler and Keith Lee Grant, 
both sang and danced well but need more presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Act 2, set in Dahomey, sags a bit as the plot is talked. In the  
livelier Act 1, most of it is sung. 
</P>
<P>
	What used to be known as ``parlor songs'' are heard in this  
musical -- and when does one get a chance to hear anything from that 
charming genre these days? There also is ``Cake Walk,'' a favorite 
of Cook's and Dunbar's. And there is ``I'm a Jonah Man,'' which 
expresses the hard-luck character Williams created for himself for 
vaudeville. 
</P>
<P>
	Act 2 has a pleasing love song, ``My Dahomian Queen,'' sung by  
Cedric D. Cannon to Shirley Verrett. Cannon also has sung opera and 
musical comedy, as Old Deuteronomy in ``Cats'' in Hamburg, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	By play's end, the problem needing detecting in Dahomey is  
solved, without much help from the detectives. They do manage to 
solve their romantic rivalry. They both loved the same girl back in 
Florida, where the benefit show was staged. One gets her in the 
final scene. The other wins an African sweetheart who will come to 
America later.

<HEADLINE> Aversion to Movie Violence Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For all the talk, Americans don't seem to be  
as upset by violent movies as they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
	An Associated Press poll, taken in the midst of a debate over  
the impact of violent movies and television programs on young 
people, found that 40 percent of adults said they would be less 
likely to see a movie if they knew it contained violence. That's 20 
points lower than the percentage who answered the same question the 
same way a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In the poll, conducted by ICR of Media, Pa., only one-third of  
respondents said violence is the biggest problem with current 
movies, about the same percentage who said tickets cost too much. 
An additional 17 percent said movies aren't as good as they used to 
be, and 13 percent said there is too much sex on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``People these days don't see too much wrong with the violence  
in movies,'' said Joan Hogue, a recent retiree from Denver. ``They 
are getting desensitized to all that stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stacy Cortez, a 22-year-old student from Las Vegas, said movie  
violence doesn't bother her ``because it's all fake.'' But she said 
young people should be kept away from movies with sex ``because 
they see how to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Movie violence became a hot issue after the school shootings in  
Littleton, Colo., in April. Several measures designed to curb movie 
violence were introduced in Congress, but they have not been 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	Theater owners pledged this month to check IDs to prevent  
youngsters from seeing R-rated movies. In the poll, 52 percent said 
the checks would be fairly effective or very effective, while 45 
percent said they would be not very effective or not effective at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who doubt that the restrictions will help shield young  
people from violent movies point to the easy access to videos, the 
use of fake IDs and the ability to switch movies after they enter a 
complex showing several films at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Hansen, a teacher in Champaign, Ill., for emotionally  
disturbed children, said she hears children as young as 5 years old 
talk about seeing violent films. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't seen `Bambi,' but they've seen `Scream,' `Scream  
II' and Chuckie (the movie `Child's Play' about a violent doll),'' 
she said. ``These kids don't go to the movies. They watch the 
movies on video at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a case certain to bring more heated debate on movie violence,  
two teen cousins were convicted in Los Angeles this week in the 
stabbing of one's mother in an attack the boys said was inspired by 
the ``Scream'' movies. Those movies are about a killer in a Grim 
Reaper costume who kills teen-agers with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the poll, women and older Americans were less  
likely to see a movie if they knew it contained violence. Almost 
half of the women surveyed fell into the category, compared to 30 
percent of the men. Two-thirds of those over 65 said violence would 
probably keep them from seeing a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also found:  
</P>
<P>
	--Whites, 42 percent, were more likely than blacks, 28 percent,  
to say violent content might keep them away from a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	--Women were twice as likely as men to say hearing about nude  
scenes might keep them from seeing a particular movie. People over 
65 were three times as likely as those under 35 to stay away 
because of nudity. 
</P>
<P>
	--People who have gone to only a couple of movies this year were  
three times as likely to be troubled by movie violence as those who 
have seen more than 20. 
</P>
<P>
	--Thirty-seven percent of adults have not seen a movie in a  
theater in the last 12 months, and 22 percent have seen only one or 
two. Five percent of the population attended more than 20 movies in 
the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 1,005 adults was taken Friday through  
Tuesday. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Denies Friction With Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he is ``frankly  
bewildered'' by reports of friction between himself and Al Gore 
over the vice president's efforts to distance himself from 
Clinton's character and impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Praising Gore as the only presidential candidate who has stated  
his views on issues, Clinton gave the vice president a pass to 
express differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want him to get out there, and if he disagrees with a  
decision that I make as president during the next year and a half, 
then of course he will have to say so, and I will take no offense 
at that,'' Clinton said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke at a news conference with visiting Egyptian  
President Hosni Mubarak. Asked about the other candidate in his 
life -- probable Senate hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton -- the 
president likewise said, ``I will take no offense'' if she publicly 
disagrees with his policies as she campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a dreary world indeed if we all agreed on  
everything,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed to be unaware of the source of recurring stories that  
he is hurt and angry that Gore has distanced himself on questions 
of Clinton's moral character and ``the wasted time'' of the long 
impeachment ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton complimented Gore as the most experienced candidate for  
president in terms of foreign policy, arms control and domestic 
policy ideas that ``have made America a better place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said, ``I have nothing bad to say'' about former  
Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's Democratic rival. But at the same time, 
Clinton did not offer any praise, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner for the  
Republican presidential nomination, would be marching in step with 
other GOP leaders if he declined to accept federal campaign money 
and the spending limits that go with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leadership of the Republican Party in general are  
unanimously hostile to campaign finance reform,'' the president 
said. ``They don't believe in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of White House friction have exposed tensions between  
Clinton's and Gore's staffs as the vice president tries to 
establish his political identity for the 2000 race. After a series 
of news stories, White House chief of staff John Podesta told 
Clinton's aides to remain silent if they have a problem with Gore's 
campaign or an opinion about his relationship with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been frankly bewildered by those reports ... and I  
honestly do not know what the source of the stories are, but they 
are not in my heart or my mind,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the first lady may have to state publicly where she  
has disagreed privately with him if she runs for the Senate from 
New York. ``That's the way democracy works,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He left an opening for Mrs. Clinton to disagree with  
administration-backed Medicare belt-tightening measures that have 
pinched New York teaching hospitals and other health care 
providers. Clinton suggested that New York lawmakers and others 
concerned with the problem should raise their concerns ``because I 
do think that's a legitimate issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, formally beginning his race for the White House, told  
Tennessee reporters last month that there have been many occasions 
over the past 6 1/2 years when he disagreed with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't ask Al Gore to become vice president so that he would  
agree with me on everything,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Brazil Stock Markets Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's stock market is making a strong comeback  
less than a year after the economy crashed, but fears of getting 
burned twice have tempered investors' urge to snap up low-priced 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	And on the Brazilian stock market, the long roller coaster ride  
touched off by the Asian financial crisis two years ago seems to 
have subsided, but analysts warned that Brazil is still not out of 
the woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueled by expectations of a new $4.5 billion loan from the  
International Monetary Fund and higher world oil prices, the 
Russian Trading System index rose 1.6 percent Friday to close at 
133.67 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The index is up 110 percent since last year's crash, a  
remarkable turnaround after the troubles set off by Asia's 
financial crash in the summer of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly bankrupt, Russia was forced to default on its debt last  
August and devalue the ruble, sending the market into a tailspin. 
Spooked by rumors of everything from government nationalization to 
the return of communism, investors fled. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russia limped through the crisis and its market has bounced  
back in spite of political turmoil that saw three prime ministers 
and new Cabinets with each one. 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, trading volumes on Russia's market these days are  
modest. On Friday, the volume reached $27 million, far below 
pre-crisis levels but still up from recent volumes of about $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebound is largely attributed to new IMF optimism and talk  
of more credits. Also, the government has made some headway in 
persuading creditors to reschedule its Soviet-era debts, which 
account for about two-thirds of its $150 billion foreign debt 
burden. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fact that prices are so low are certainly not a  
deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
	``People started buying Russian shares again mostly because the  
price is so low,'' Boris Fyodorov, former tax minister, wrote this 
week in Segodnya daily. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brazil, the Bovespa index of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange --  
Latin America's largest -- has averaged a healthy 11,300 points in 
the last four months. Investors, however, are still cautious, 
because they believe Brazil will remain vulnerable to external 
shocks until it puts its fiscal house in order. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bovespa index had reached a high of about 14,000 points in  
August 1997 but then dropped later that year, hitting 7,800 points 
on Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Panic struck. Investors pulled their money from Brazil. The  
Central Bank spent $10 billion to shore up the real currency and 
interest rates skyrocketed to 43 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A fiscal austerity package announced by the government in late  
1997 breathed life back into Brazilian stocks, which returned to 
the 12,000-point range by April 1998, but the euphoria was 
short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia defaulted on some of its debt, and the index nose-dived  
to less than 5,000 points in September of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of a $41.5 billion rescue package, stitched  
together by the IMF in November of 1998, and the Jan. 15 currency 
devaluation that made share prices cheaper in dollar terms, the 
markets slowly inched up to their current levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``While in nominal terms share prices have made a significant  
recovery, in dollar terms they are still some 20 percent below 
their pre-Asian crisis levels,'' said Odair Abate, chief economist 
at Lloyds Bank in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Worrying investors, he said, were stubborn budget and trade  
deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, official figures also show Brazil's unemployment  
rate at close to 8 percent. But in Sao Paulo, Latin America's 
largest city, labor unions say the jobless rate is 20 percent of 
the work force -- more than 1.7 million people.

<HEADLINE> Official Urges Passage of FAA Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The transportation secretary is urging the  
Senate to pass a bill renewing the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which has been delayed three times, includes critical  
funding for airport and air traffic control modernization, 
management changes at the FAA and a long-term, stable source of 
income for the agency. The latest extension expires on Aug. 6, the 
day Congress is scheduled to begin its summer recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``I clearly think it needs to be made more of a priority,''  
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said Thursday in an 
interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Senate leaders to pass the bill if only so it can be  
moved into a conference committee, where it can be reconciled with 
similar legislation already passed by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	It is in such committees that most congressional horse-trading  
occurs. The committees are also a prerequisite to developing a 
completed piece of legislation for final votes in the House and 
Senate and signature by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	While Slater refused to comment, legislative sources say the  
bill is hung up in the Senate over two issues favored by Sen. John 
McCain, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator, who is chairman of the Commerce Committee, wants  
increased flights at airports in New York, Washington and Chicago, 
as well as 24 daily exemptions to the current 1,250-mile limit on 
flights from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who is running for the Republican presidential  
nomination, has said both changes would benefit business and 
consumers alike. Legislators from the surrounding areas have fought 
back, saying the changes would increase noise and create safety 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator's spokeswoman said that, like Slater, McCain wants  
the legislation resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is McCain's intention to have comprehensive legislation  
pass this year,'' said spokeswoman Pia Pialorsi. ``We're simply 
waiting for (Senate Majority Leader Trent) Lott to schedule it for 
floor action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for whether McCain remained insistent on the flight and  
perimeter-rule provisions, Pialorsi said: ``He will try to pass the 
bill that passed the committee.''

<HEADLINE> Rogue Trader Leeson To Be Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- More than 4 years after destroying Britain's  
oldest commercial bank, Nick Leeson is heading for freedom but 
private investigators will still be watching his post-prison life, 
trying to recover some of the lost money. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeson's lawyer Stephan Pollard said Leeson was to be released  
Saturday, though his client wants to avoid publicity until he 
leaves Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollard would only reveal Leeson, 32, will be leaving Singapore  
on one of the two British Airways scheduled flights to London on 
Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	While working for Barings Bank in Singapore, Leeson, 32, made  
spectacular but unauthorized futures trades worth $1.4 billion. The 
deals ended in disaster and led to the collapse of the bank in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Singapore authorities said Leeson could be  
released as early as July 3rd for good behavior. But by late Friday 
they still would not reveal the exact timing of the release. 
</P>
<P>
	A Singapore law firm representing liquidators for the  
now-defunct Barings Bank have said it is still investigating 
whether Leeson may have hidden away some of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for Rajah and Tann law firm also has said they might  
want to talk to Leeson again. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollard called the allegations ``absurd.''  
</P>
<P>
	``He's answered every question they put to him. He's helped them  
to understand various things about the trading. And partly as the 
result of his help, as I understand it, they've reconciled every 
single trade he ever did,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once freed, one of the most notorious white-collar criminals of  
the past few decades will face the world as a celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers are reportedly vying to get Leeson's interview for a  
six-figure sum, while a movie based on his case, ``Rogue Trader,'' 
premiered last week in London before a star-studded audience. 
</P>
<P>
	A $700,000 advance for the book upon which the film is based has  
allegedly gone toward Leeson's huge legal bills.

<HEADLINE> Driver in Red Wings Crash Arraigned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTLAND, Mich. (AP) -- The driver of the limousine that crashed  
two years ago, severely injuring two members of the Detroit Red 
Wings organization, was arrested Friday on a drunken-driving 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Gnida was arrested just months after his license was  
reinstated following a three-year revocation, which was in effect 
at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	He was stopped along Michigan Avenue after he allegedly ran a  
stop sign about 2 a.m. Friday, Wayne County Sheriff Robert Ficano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gnida, 29, was arraigned in 18th District Court on a charge of  
third-offense operating under the influence of liquor. The 
misdemeanor carries a possible year in jail and $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	He had just gotten his license back April 19, a month after  
being released from jail for violating his probation stemming from 
the June 13, 1997 crash. Gnida was driving the limousine that ran 
onto a median and hit a tree in the Detroit suburb of Birmingham 
six days after the Red Wings won their first Stanley Cup in 42 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov and team masseur Sergei  
Mnatsakanov suffered disabling head injuries. A second player, 
Slava Fetisov, suffered lesser injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Gnida told police he had blacked out. Although blood tests found  
evidence of marijuana in Gnida's blood, prosecutors could not 
determine if that contributed to the accident. He was convicted of 
driving with a suspended license and served seven months of a 
nine-month sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Gnida was ordered back to jail in January after pleading guilty  
to probation violation charges. He was accused of skipping meetings 
with his probation officer, not receiving therapy, failing to 
attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and not completing community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	He was released in March after serving part of a 90-day  
sentence. The Secretary of State reinstated Gnida's driver license 
April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``That probation violation is a separate issue from the driving  
record review and doesn't bear on the review of the driver's 
driving record,'' said Julie Pierce, a spokesman for the Secretary 
of State's Office. ``Our issue is looking if that driver is safe to 
drive on the road and not a danger to others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland County Prosecutor David Gorcyca, who handled the 1997  
case, said that is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a crime in and of itself,'' he said. ``This guy  
violates every term of his probation, gets a year in jail and 
irrecoverably injures two people and gets his license back? Well, 
Merry Christmas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Secretary of State's Office originally revoked Gnida's  
license in January 1996 for having more than 12 points on his 
driving record. 
</P>
<P>
	Gnida was convicted in 1994 of driving while impaired -- under  
which his blood-alcohol content was below the state's .10 legal 
threshold for drunken driving -- and of operating under the 
influence. He had also been ticketed twice for speeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Gnida's driving privilege was reinstated after he presented a  
certificate proving he completed an outpatient abuse program in 
July 1998, said Elaine Charney, director of the state's driver 
license appeals division. 
</P>
<P>
	If Gnida is convicted of the latest charge, his license would be  
revoked for a minimum of five years, Pierce said. That's because he 
would have three drunken driving convictions within 10 years 
combined with a previous revocation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorcyca, unable to prosecute Gnida with a more severe penalty at  
the time Konstantinov was injured, drafted two bills. Under the 
measures, which are effective in October, a person could face five 
years in prison for causing a serious injury and 15 years for 
causing a death while driving on a suspended or revoked license. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had those laws been in effect at the time of the Red Wing  
incident, he (Gnida) would be spending five years behind bars,'' 
Gorcyca said. ``He's a menace to society and I'm amazed that he's 
not killed anybody. Obviously the one year in jail he's spent has 
had no effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Gail McKnight entered an innocent plea on Gnida's behalf  
Friday and ordered him jailed on $25,000 bond. A preliminary 
hearing is scheduled Thursday. Authorities said Gnida's family 
planned to post bond. 
</P>
<P>
	A man at Gnida's home Friday said he was baby-sitting and could  
not comment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firm May Buy Korean Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A Texas-based investment firm,  
Newbridge Capital Ltd., is near a final deal with the South Korean 
government on an agreement to buy Korea First Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	After six months of negotiations, both sides ironed out all  
major differences and were fine-tuning wording of a formal 
agreement to be signed soon, officials at Seoul's Financial 
Supervisory Commission said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The national news agency Yonhap, quoting unnamed commission  
officials, said the government and Newbridge will announce their 
agreement Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Newbridge had engaged in takeover talks since December to  
acquire a 51 percent stake in Korea First Bank, in which the Seoul 
government is the major shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides extended their talks several times as they  
differed widely over the value of the bank's assets and terms under 
which the South Korean government will purchase some of the bank's 
future bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	President Kim Dae-jung's government insisted on selling  
debt-ridden Korean banks to foreigners to demonstrate its 
willingness to open the cloistered domestic financial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Such takeovers will serve as an important vote of confidence in  
the crisis-hit South Korean economy, Kim has said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Releases Alaskan Fisherman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Canadian authorities released an Alaska  
fisherman on Friday after the U.S. State Department protested the 
seizure of his boat in waters involved in years of border disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was the first seizure in a decades-long dispute  
over a portion of Dixon Entrance, an expanse of water between the 
southern end of Alaska and British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Bosworth, 63, was fishing for black cod in waters claimed  
by both the United States and Canada when Canadian authorities 
seized the 41-foot longliner Lesley Ann and detained him Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States issued a protest and the vessel was released,  
said Melinda L. Kimble, acting assistant secretary for the State 
Department's bureau of oceans and international environmental and 
scientific affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, Canada and the United States operate under an  
agreement that lets each country police its own fishermen in the 
disputed area, said Lt. Cmdr. Ray Massey, a spokesman for the Coast 
Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was good to go in all aspects as far as the U.S. government  
was concerned,'' Massey said. 
</P>
<P>
	He ran into trouble because Canada does not acknowledge black  
cod as a traditional target of U.S. fishermen in the area. Only 
salmon and halibut are deemed traditional catches, said Athana 
Mentzelopoulos, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the details of the case it was determined that a  
warning to the captain was the most appropriate action,'' 
Mentzelopoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles called the seizure an ``illegal and  
outrageous international violation'' and said releasing Bosworth 
with a warning was ``an inadequate diplomatic fig leaf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska officials dismissed the notion that black cod, also known  
as sablefish, is not a traditional target for Alaska fishermen. 
Alaskan fisherman hauled 95 metric tons of sablefish out of Dixon 
Entrance last year, according to state figures.

<HEADLINE> Shandling, Ex-Manager Settle Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Garry Shandling settled a $100 million  
lawsuit against his former manager Friday, ending a dispute that 
had brought attention to the potential conflicts of interest 
created when managers double as TV producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms of the settlement between the comedian and Brad Grey  
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased we could achieve it without the necessity  
of a trial,'' said Shandling's attorney, David Boies, who also has 
been heading the government's side in the Microsoft antitrust 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Shandling's lawsuit alleged that Grey's role as his manager and  
executive producer of the now-ended ``The Larry Sanders Show'' 
represented a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit alleged that Grey was able to ``triple-dip,'' taking  
excess commissions and fees out of the HBO series. It also claimed 
Grey used Shandling's name to make $200 million-plus in other 
show-business deals and owed him a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Grey resigned as Shandling's manager in 1997. Shandling sued the  
following year. 
</P>
<P>
	While Grey's success as a producer is unusual, managers are  
increasingly serving as producers on sitcoms starring their 
clients. Networks and production companies have complained these 
executives don't always earn their producer title or money. 
</P>
<P>
	Grey's lawyer, Charles Shephard, said the case was not  
indicative of an industry-wide problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the issues were much more particular to Brad's  
relationship with Gary and to the personal issues between them,'' 
Shephard said.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-U.K. Aviation Talks Off Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and the United Kingdom were  
supposed to reconvene formal talks about a new aviation agreement 
next week but instead have postponed them indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials expressed disappointment Thursday about the  
decision announced by the British government in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been nine months since we last had formal talks with the  
British government ... and the time frame for accomplishing such an 
agreement is growing increasingly short,'' said Transportation 
Department spokesman Bill Schulz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear from what we've seen from the other side is  
there's an inability to develop a position,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hang-up reportedly stems from a dispute between British  
Airways and officials in the British Office of Fair Trading, as 
well as the country's transport offices. Both entities want the 
airline to surrender takeoff and landing slots at London's popular 
Heathrow Airport, but the airline apparently is balking at the 
number. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have insisted on more slots since British Airways  
proposed an alliance with American Airlines in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current aviation treaty, known as Bermuda II, only two  
U.S. carriers -- American and United Airlines -- are allowed to fly 
into Heathrow. Business travelers in particular like the airport 
because it offers the most connections to international points. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an ``open skies'' deal, an unlimited number of carriers  
could serve any U.S. or British airport. U.S. officials believe 
added access to Heathrow would drive down airfares and give 
customers more flight selections. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations collapsed last fall after only three days of  
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, top transportation officials from both countries said  
preliminary talks would resume, with an eye toward returning to 
formal negotiations. Recently, both governments announced the 
formal talks would take place next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The British government said in a statement: ``We are still  
refining our negotiating position in talks with the airlines. We've 
postponed our talks and no alternative date has been set.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Face Brazil in Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Brazil vs. the United States. Fourth of  
July. Stanford, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Again.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the two nations met at Stanford Stadium in the men's  
World Cup. Brazil won 1-0 and went on to win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, the same countries, the same venue and the  
same red-white-and-blue date are the setting for Sunday's semifinal 
in the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Only this time, the United States will be the favorite.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every game is a different story. Sometimes the same story  
repeats,'' Brazilian coach Wilson de Oliveira said. ``We hope this 
story repeats. We have a dream. If we can emulate what happened in 
this stadium five years ago, our dream will come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams advanced with one-goal victories Thursday night. With  
President Clinton and his family among the 54,642 fans at Jack Kent 
Cooke Stadium, defenders Brandi Chastain and Joy Fawcett scored off 
corner kicks to rally the U.S. team from a 2-1 halftime deficit in 
a 3-2 victory over Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we'll have to play better against Brazil,'' said coach  
Tony DiCicco, whose team overcame its first real test after winning 
its three first-round games by a combined scored of 13-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil blew a 3-0 halftime lead against Nigeria before Sissi  
scored the first sudden-death overtime goal in Women's World Cup 
history. The midfielder's 22-yard free kick, her tournament-high 
seventh goal, won the game 4-3 in the 104th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the game I turned into an old man,'' de Oliveira said.  
``But after the game I became a young man again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results mean all four teams have qualified for the 2000  
Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The doubleheader was evidence of the unexpected surge in  
popularity of the biggest all-women's sports event ever. Extra 
seats were made available to meet demand, and the crowd was late 
arriving because of a 20-mile backup to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, also arriving late, watched the second half of the  
U.S.-Germany match from a luxury box with wife Hillary, daughter 
Chelsea, two of Chelsea's friends and Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
	After the match, the presidential party met the U.S. team in the  
locker room. The players chanted ``Clinton'' as he posed for a 
group picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us what an inspiration the team was, coming from  
behind,'' midfielder Julie Foudy said. ``I told him thanks for 
coming, it makes a ton of difference for this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Down 2-1, the Americans tied the score in the 49th minute when  
Chastain volleyed in Mia Hamm's corner kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Fawcett, who almost never joins the attack -- she had 18 goals in  
140 international games heading into the World Cup -- scored the 
game-winner in the 66th when she was positioned perfectly for a 
side header past the outstretched arm of goalkeeper Silke 
Rottenberg. The corner kick came from Shannon MacMillan, who had 
entered the game seconds earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	As it has the whole tournament, the U.S. team came out sloppy.  
Chastain, who later would sustain a mile ankle sprain, played a 
loose ball back to goalkeeper Briana Scurry. Scurry wasn't 
expecting it, and the result was an own goal for Germany in the 
fifth minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffeny Milbrett's low shot tied the game in the 16th minute,  
but Germany regained the lead in injury time when Bettina Wiegmann 
made a move around Cindy Parlow and sent a 22-yard rocket into the 
top left corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	That prompted an urgent halftime talk from U.S. captain Carla  
Overbeck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carla said that everything we done in this lifetime comes down  
to these 45 minutes,'' Foudy said. ``We had 45 minutes to make a 
difference. That's it and we had to leave everything on the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second game, Sissi played a part in all four Brazilian  
goals. Her free kick started a sequence that led to Cidinha's score 
in the fourth minute, and her chip from the corner of the penalty 
box was headed home by Cidinha at the far post in the 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
	Sissi then played the ball to Nene for a 40-yard chip that  
sailed over goalkeeper Ann Chiejine's head from the right flank in 
the 35th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria rallied with goals from Prisca Emeafu, Nkiru Okosieme  
and Nkechi Egbe before Sissi's ``Golden Goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, Sissi is the queen of soccer,'' de Oliveira said.

	Negotiations in N. Ireland Fail  
</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Negotiations on a new  
government for Northern Ireland failed Friday, prompting the 
British and Irish prime ministers to launch an alternative plan to 
jump-start the government in the next 16 days. However, serious 
doubts remained that the plan -- devised by Britain's Tony Blair and 
Ireland's Bertie Ahern -- could ever get off the ground, since key 
parties in Northern Ireland did not endorse it. The talks this week 
stumbled over the long-running issue of disarming the Irish 
Republican Army.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak broke weeks of  
silence on peace issues Friday with a friendly telephone call to

office next week, Barak told Arafat he would take up the mantle of 
slain Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to restore confidence in the 
stalled negotiations and bring peace to the region, his office 
said. The two leaders agreed to meet soon after Barak takes office,

	U.S. Sees Serb Threat on Montenegro

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his  
army are threatening Montenegro with the presence of some 40,000 
troops, four times the normal strength in the republic, the Clinton 
administration said Friday. State Department spokesman James Foley 
said the troops were a threat to the democratically elected 
government of President Milo Djukanovic. The smaller of 
Yugoslavia's two republics behind much stronger and larger Serbia, 
Montenegro has staked out an independent course from Belgrade, 
thereby pleasing the Clinton administration.

	Clinton, Kim Warn NKorea on Missiles  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and South Korean President  
Kim Dae-jung agreed Friday that any further long-range ballistic 
missile tests by North Korea would pose ``a serious obstacle to 
peace.'' At the same time, the two leaders ruled out the 
possibility of responding to a new missile test by disavowing the 
1994 U.S.-North Korean agreement, under which the North pledged not 
to become a nuclear power. Clinton and Kim, who met for two hours, 
did not discuss the actual measures that would be taken in the 
event of a new missile test, senior officials said.

	Boorda's Navy Record Won't Change  
</P>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- The Navy has decided that the official  
record of Adm. Jeremy ``Mike'' Boorda, who committed suicide amid 
questions about Vietnam combat decorations he had worn, should 
continue to show he did not earn the medals. Boorda, who joined the 
Navy at 16 and became the only enlisted man to rise to chief of 
naval operations, took his life in 1996 after 40 years of service. 
He was about to be asked by Newsweek reporters about why he wore 
Combat Vs -- tiny bronze letters standing for ``valor.'' Wearing an 
unauthorized decoration is a severe breach of military protocol.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Delegates from 180 countries Friday  
approved proposals to slow world population growth -- including 
calls for giving women greater access to abortion and adolescents 
to sex education. Approval came despite reservations from a few 
conservative countries and the Vatican. But women's groups hailed 
the agreement as a giant advance beyond what was agreed to at the 
landmark 1994 U.N. population conference in Cairo because it 
compels governments to take action to increase and improve access 
to reproductive health care.

	Economy Booming for All

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A record-length peacetime economic expansion

blacks fell to a record low of 7.3 percent in June, the Labor 
Department said Friday. And rates for women and Hispanics remained 
close to their lowest levels in three decades. The economy is still 
roaring ahead, creating more than a quarter-million new jobs 
overall in June. Though the overall unemployment rate crept up to 
4.3 percent, all industries except manufacturing and mining posted 
solid gains. Financial markets were buoyed by today's report. The 
Dow Jones industrial average posted a record high close, up 72.82 
points to 11,139.24.

Cincinnati's four-game sweep at the Astrodome last weekend, pulled 
back into a first-place tie with the Reds in the NL Central.

<HEADLINE> Moon-Landing Anniversary Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Near the equator of the moon -- for all  
eternity or until a passing piece of space junk scores a bull's-eye 
-- stands a strange platform swaddled in gold foil, a monument to 
the most daring of the 20th century's scientific expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Around it, footprints are etched in the talcumlike dust, also as  
permanent as anything in the violent, changing universe can be 
permanent. The prints are the unmistakable evidence that two men 
from Earth walked there, the first humans to step on soil beyond 
their own planet. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been 30 years since Neil Armstrong and Edwin A. Aldrin  
climbed gingerly from their Apollo 11 moon-lander to the 
rock-strewn surface of the Sea of Tranquility. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,''  
said Armstrong, the first man on the moon. But the first ``a'' 
didn't make it to a billion people watching on television back on 
Earth. Purists have argued about the difference in meaning ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beautiful, beautiful,'' said Aldrin when he followed Armstrong  
18 minutes later. ``Magnificent desolation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What made that first landing, on July 20, 1969, such a big event  
-- one of those moments that no one then alive would ever forget? 
For Americans, it provided uplift and respite from the Vietnam War, 
from strife in the Middle East, from the startling news just two 
days earlier that a young woman had drowned in a car driven off a 
wooden bridge on Chappaquiddick Island by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the world celebrated along with America. More than  
100 world leaders sent their congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
	It also marked America's victory in the Cold-War space race that  
began Oct. 4, 1957, with the launch of the Soviet Union's Sputnik 
1, a 184-pound ball whose insistent beeps sent shock waves around 
the world. An embarrassed United States didn't launch its first 
satellite until four months later and remained behind in the 
spectaculars that followed: First human space flight, first human 
to orbit the Earth, first spacewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	But beyond that was this: Throughout recorded history, humans  
had wondered about alien worlds, especially the one biggest and 
nearest with the unchanging face. The moon was celebrated in poetry 
and song, in folklore and love stories, in mysteries and nursery 
rhymes. Even the ancients knew that it controls the ocean's tides 
as it makes its 27.3-day circuit around Earth, and they made it the 
basis for man's calendars. It is reflected in language with words 
such as lunatic and moonshine. Now, two men, each with an American 
flag on his left sleeve, were standing on it. 
</P>
<P>
	It is difficult today after a generation of uneventful ventures  
in space, manned and unmanned, to re-create the excitement that 
accompanied the flight of Apollo 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong released a TV camera as he stepped out of the ship,  
and the world watched as two men dressed like Pillsbury doughboys 
loped around the bleak surface, exulting in the lightness of their 
one-sixth gravity. They picked up rocks, the booty they had come 
for, and planted an American flag stiffened into waving position 
because there is no air or wind on the moon to ruffle it. 
</P>
<P>
	They spoke from the moon to their president, Richard M. Nixon.  
``This certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever 
made,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	They stopped by one of the four legs of their lander and read  
from the small metal plaque attached to it: ``Here men from the 
planet Earth first set foot upon the moon, July 1969. A.D. We came 
in peace for all mankind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A third astronaut, Michael Collins, circled the moon in the  
mother ship ``Columbia'' 60 miles overhead as Armstrong and Aldrin 
landed. His back seat to history was confirmed then and there. 
</P>
<P>
	When Houston sent word that Mission Control was full of smiling  
faces, Armstrong responded with ``there are two of them up here.'' 
Collins chimed in with ``and don't forget one in the command 
module.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins wrote later about seeing their target up close: ``The  
moon I have known all my life, that two-dimensional, small disk in 
the sky, has gone away somewhere to be replaced by the most awesome 
sphere I have ever seen. To begin with, it is huge, completely 
filling our window. Second, it is three-dimensional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The intricate plan for the flight worked nearly flawlessly,  
although they had only 15 seconds of fuel left after dodging 
surface boulders on arrival. The spindly legged LM -- 
astronaut-speak for lunar lander -- was plucked from their spent 
Saturn 5 rocket on the three-day, 241,000-mile trip to the moon. 
Nicknamed ``Eagle,'' it was a two-piece contraption, lumpy with no 
need for streamlining, with a descent stage at the bottom and an 
ascent stage on top. The bottom stage served twin purposes: It 
lowered the astronauts gently to the surface and became the launch 
platform when it was time to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Apollo 11 was set in motion on May 25, 1961, when John F.  
Kennedy asked a joint session of Congress to approve $1.8 billion 
in spending for space, the military and civil defense, and to build 
up the country's image. Remarkably, the United States at that time 
had only one manned flight experience -- the 15-minute suborbital 
hop by Alan Shepard just 20 days before. And in those early days 
more rockets were blowing up than making it into space. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the  
goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and 
returning him safely to Earth,'' Kennedy said. ``No single space 
project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more 
important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be 
so difficult or expensive to accomplish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And indeed it was. By the time Apollo 11 lifted off from Cape  
Canaveral, Fla., on July 16, 1969, the United States had spent $24 
billion on space and lost three astronauts in a fire during a 
rehearsal on the launch pad. There were six more moon flights to 
follow (including the ill-fated Apollo 13 which didn't land), but 
after the last, in 1972, there was no more official appetite for 
manned explorations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, in the celebratory glow of the 20th Apollo 11  
anniversary, President George Bush proposed a commitment to go back 
to the moon -- ``this time to stay'' -- and on to Mars by 2019. The 
idea went nowhere. A budget expert said it would cost $400 billion. 
The New York Times called a moon return ``a failure of imagination 
and fresh thought.'' Bush seldom mentioned it again, and NASA 
quickly forgot it. 
</P>
<P>
	To seal the end of their rivalry, the Soviets and the United  
States staged a joint mission, Apollo-Soyuz in 1975, and shook 
hands high above the Earth. And 30 years after the first moon 
landing -- 42 years after Sputnik -- the two countries are the 
mainstays of an international partnership building a space station. 
The United States flies Russians on its space shuttle, and the 
Russians have been hosts to a succession of long-stay astronaut 
visitors on their Mir space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Apollo 11 was the last mission for the three astronauts.  
</P>
<P>
	Collins said once he had few regrets in his lifeguard role  
waiting for Armstrong and Aldrin to return to the mother ship. 
``Clearly it was not the best seat,'' he said. ``But there were 
three seats for 3 billion people. I was lucky to occupy one of 
those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two moonwalkers ventured no farther than 275 yards from  
their spaceship and spent only 2 hours, 15 minutes walking on the 
moon. After 21 hours, 36 minutes on the lunar surface, the ascent 
stage blasted off, leaving only the foil-wrapped structure of their 
lander. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains as mute evidence, along with the footprints, that on  
Sunday, July 20, 1969, man first landed on the moon and walked its 
dusty surface.

<HEADLINE> King Said To Be Progressing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Stephen King has already faced the  
frightening prospect of physical therapy. He's now ready to put 
some weight on his right leg, the one broken in a car accident two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The horror novelist has been moving around in a wheelchair and  
has begun rehabilitation work, officials at Central Maine Medical 
Center said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	King has also undergone another minor operation, his fifth so  
far, and he is said to be progressing well. 
</P>
<P>
	King was hit by a van while walking along the shoulder of a  
highway near his summer home in North Lovell on June 19. He 
suffered multiple broken bones in his right leg, along with a 
punctured lung, broken ribs and cuts on his head. 
</P>
<P>
	King remains in stable but serious condition. Hospital officials  
said he has no more surgery scheduled. No date has been set for his 
release.

<HEADLINE> Gore Retools Inner Circle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to energize his presidential campaign,  
Vice President Al Gore is retooling his inner circle with additions 
of a new media consultant, policy adviser and pollster. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not termed a shakeup, advisers said the changes were part  
of a significant reorganization that would diminish the roles of 
some aides, redefine the jobs of others and create the potential 
for personality conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of consultant Carter Eskew creates the greatest  
shift in authority, cutting into the wide range of chores handled 
by longtime Gore confidant Bob Squier. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is bracing for a challenge for the Democratic nomination  
from former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. His political situation 
is complicated by the surging Republican candidacy of George W. 
Bush, the Texas governor who is handily beating Gore in 
head-to-head public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are defining roles and responsibilities and we're adding  
strong members to the team when appropriate,'' campaign chairman 
Tony Coelho said Thursday when told that Democratic officials were 
privately leaking word of the hirings. 
</P>
<P>
	He confirmed the addition of Eskew, pollster Celinda Lake and  
policy coordinator Lauren Choi, saying several more new advisers 
will be hired soon. Denying reports he planned to clean house, 
Coelho said, ``There will be no dismissals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Eskew adds an awkward personal dynamic to Gore's  
inner circle. He and Squier are former business partners who had a 
bitter falling out. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no evidence that their relationship has mended, and it  
was unclear how Squier would accept the changes, officials familiar 
with the hirings said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing that I'm interested in is that they both share  
with me one common desire and that is to get Al Gore elected,'' 
Coelho said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob is a key strategist, adviser and friend of Al Gore's. He's  
been that for years and he will remain that,'' Coelho said. 
</P>
<P>
	Squier will focus now on his specialty, political advertising.  
Eskew will work to refine Gore's message. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign officials compared Coelho's plans with efforts by  
former White House chief of staff Leon Panetta to reshape President 
Clinton's staff after his first administration got off to a shaky 
start. Heads didn't roll, but Panetta retooled many job 
descriptions and drew clear lines of authority in the West Wing. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskew, in his mid-40s, is a longtime confidant of Gore and  
worked on Clinton's 1992 campaign. He is a partner in the issues 
advocacy firm of Bozell Eskew. His clients include pharmaceutical 
manufacturers, a life insurance foundation and Empire Blue 
Cross/Blue Shield, New York state's largest health care company. 
</P>
<P>
	He also produced a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for  
the tobacco industry that is credited with helping kill the 
Senate's tobacco bill last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Squier was quoted by The Washington Post as saying, ``He  
certainly would not have been allowed to represent a client like 
this inside our company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eskew and Squier did not return telephone calls.  
</P>
<P>
	Lake's hiring beefs up Gore's polling operation, run by Mark  
Penn. Choi is moving from a senior post at the Treasury Department.

<HEADLINE> Boldon Wins Men's 100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Ato Boldon won the men's 100-meter  
showdown Friday night at the Athletissima track and field meet, 
beating world record-holder and training partner Maurice Greene. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Jones, the world champion in the women's 100, won in  
10.80 seconds, the fastest time of the year, and Michael Johnson 
showed he had recovered from a quadricep injury, winning in 43.92, 
also the year's best time. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, surged down the lightning quick  
Pontaise track in 9.86, tying the season's second-best time and his 
personal best. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing my mother said was, `Don't run 9.86 again,' ''  
Boldon, who has run the 100 in 9.86 four times, said laughing. 
``Maybe they were expecting a record, but it is nothing to be 
ashamed of when you hit your personal best for the second time in 
three weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon also ran 9.86 at Athens last month, but finished second  
to Greene, who shattered the world record in 9.79. This time, 
Boldon finished .07 seconds ahead of Greene. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it were anybody else I'd probably be upset,'' Greene said.  
``But I'm not unhappy. I ran the best race that I could today. He 
just ran better than me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Jason Gardener broke the 10-second barrier for the  
first time in his career, placing third in 9.98. Olympic silver 
medalist Frank Fredericks of Namibia was fourth in 10.00. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Bruny Surin, who had run under 10 seconds his previous  
three races including a wind-aided 9.88 at the Canadian 
championships last week, withdrew at the last minute because of 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was fresh off a victory in the 200 at Oslo Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Sevatheda Fynes of the Bahamas finished second in the women's  
100 in 10.91, ahead of Inger Miller, the U.S. champion, who was 
third in 11.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is unbeaten in a race since losing to Jamaica's Merlene  
Ottey in the 100 at Tokyo in September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who skipped a 200 showdown against Greene at the U.S.  
Championships last week because of the injury, became the first 400 
runner under 44 seconds this season. It was Johnson's 72nd win in 
74 finals in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't too concerned with my time,'' Johnson said. ``I was  
more intent on finding my form and the right feeling on the track 
after five weeks off. 
</P>
<P>
	``My injury was painful, but now I feel good.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jerome Young, the U.S. champion, was second in 44.34.  
</P>
<P>
	Making up for a disappointing seventh-place at the U.S.  
Championships, Larry Wade registered the season's fastest time in 
the men's 110 hurdles with 13.01. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be the best at what I do,'' Wade said. ``I don't  
have a time or a championship to aspire to. I just want to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade led an American sweep, as Mark Crear was second in 13.04  
and Olympic gold medalist Allen Johnson third in 13.10. Britain's 
Colin Jackson, the world record-holder indoors and outdoors, 
finished fourth in 13.13. 
</P>
<P>
	World record-holder Daniel Komen of Kenya set a meet record in  
the 3,000 of 7:30.62. Komen led a Kenyan sweep of the top six 
places, with Paul Bitok second in 7:36.25 and five-time world 
cross-country champion Paul Tergat third in 7:42.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Moroccans women had a good day, setting two meet records. Hasna  
Benhassi won the 800 in 1:57.45 and Nezha Bidouane took the 400 
hurdles in 53.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Morrison made up for a bad stumble at the U.S.  
Championships, winning the women's 100 hurdles in 12.74, .01 second 
ahead of. Nigeria's Glory Alozie. 
</P>
<P>
	Norberto Tellez of Cuba won the men's 800 in 1:44.05, the  
second-fastest time of the season. Kenya's Kennedy Kimwetich was 
second in 1:44.13 and Olympic silver medalist Hezekiel Sepeng of 
South Africa third in 1:44.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Falilat Ogunkoya of Nigeria posted the fastest time of the  
season in the women's 400 with 50.01, nearly a half-second ahead of 
Jamaica's Lorraine Graham. Suziann Reid, runner-up at the U.S. 
Championships, finished third.

<HEADLINE> Apple Sues Rival Over iMac Design </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. accused a  
competitor Thursday of stealing the design of its iMac personal 
computers to make low-cost PCs unveiled at a computer show last 
week, complete with a curvy translucent look and five gemstone 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's complaint, filed in San Jose District Court, alleges  
Future Power Technologies, an 8-month-old Silicon Valley company, 
and Korea's Daewoo Telecom illegally copied iMac's unique features 
to make their E-Power PC. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a universe of original designs that Future Power and  
Daewoo could have created for their computers, but instead they 
chose to copy Apple's designs,'' said Steve Jobs, Apple's interim 
CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've invested a lot of money and effort to create and market  
our award-winning designs, and we intend to vigorously protect them 
under the law,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo denies that it copied the iMac design. ``Our product is  
based on a totally different concept from that of iMac,'' the 
company said in a statement, noting that, unlike iMac, Daewoo's 
E-Power runs on Intel chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo acknowledged that its E-Power PC has a shape resembling  
iMac, but said Apple cannot sue just because of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot understand the lawsuit,'' the statement said.  
</P>
<P>
	Apple, which declined to comment beyond the wording of its  
complaint, wants an injunction preventing the companies from 
distributing the E-Power computers. It's also seeking actual and 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Future Power created a sensation at the PC Expo in New York City  
last week with the E-power, which has a shape resembling the iMac, 
and comes in five translucent colors: amethyst, ruby, topaz, 
emerald and sapphire. 
</P>
<P>
	Also like iMac, which Apple sells in strawberry, blueberry,  
grape, tangerine and lime -- the E-power has an all-in-one design 
and a single power cord. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the iMac, the E-power runs on Microsoft's Windows  
operating system and has a floppy disk drive. Also, it is priced to 
sell at two-thirds the cost of Apple's model. 
</P>
<P>
	Wired magazine reported from the PC Expo that Future Power  
didn't deny that iMac was its source of inspiration for E-Power -- 
the startup even held talks with Apple's lawyers before launching 
the new product, presumably in hopes of heading off a legal 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Future Power said the company would not  
comment until it received a copy of the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Branch Davidian Suit Will Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- A federal judge has cleared the way for a  
lawsuit that blames the government for the fiery end of the 1993 
Branch Davidian standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. pared the number of  
defendants and plaintiffs, but ruled Thursday that the case can 
reach trial, said Mike Caddell, lead attorney for the Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what the judge did is a great victory for the  
Davidians and for the country,'' Caddell said. ``Our folks can't be 
happier and look forward to having their day in court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit -- filed by surviving Davidians and the relatives of  
the dead -- challenges the government's conclusion that the 
Davidians started the fire and that they also shot first during the 
federal raid on their compound. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants include Attorney General Janet Reno and top  
officials of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the 
FBI, including then-Director William Sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still reviewing the decision at this point,'' said Myron  
Marlin, a Department of Justice spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The multimillion-dollar lawsuit has been on hold since early May  
while an appeals court considered whether Smith should be removed 
from the case. The plaintiffs wanted another judge because Smith 
has ruled in criminal cases involving Branch Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Davidians contend that when federal agents punched through  
the walls and fired tear gas into the cult compound on April 19, 
1993, the canisters ignited, burning the building and the people 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional hearings have pointed to mistakes by the law  
enforcement officers, but none has been charged with a crime.

<HEADLINE> Bush Discloses At Least $2.1M Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential front-runner George W.  
Bush gave Americans a more detailed picture of his wealth Friday, 
disclosing that he owns more than $7 million in U.S. Treasury notes 
and a blind trust worth more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of former President Bush also reported that he has two  
money market accounts with a total value of between $600,000 and 
$1.25 million, three checking accounts with a total value of 
between $3,000 and $45,000, and no debts. 
</P>
<P>
	And he received the first half of a $250,000 advance for a  
campaign biography he is writing with Houston Chronicle sports 
columnist Mickey Herskowitz. Bush's initial share, after 
commission, was $106,250, which he is donating to four youth 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who is paid $97,890 as governor of Texas, reported on his  
federal income tax return in April that he and his wife, Laura, had 
$18 million in income and paid $3.7 million in taxes in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in that total was the $14.9 million he received when  
the Texas Rangers baseball team was sold. Bush initially paid 
$606,302 for his share of the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush still has a share of the partnership that owned the team,  
valued at between $1 million and $5 million. When the partnership 
finally is dissolved, Bush is expected to receive an additional $1 
million to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor also earned capital gains income of between  
$100,000 and $1 million from the sale of real estate investments, 
capital gains income of $100,000 to $1 million from Advance 
Paradigm stock and capital gains income of between $50,000 and 
$100,000 from the sale of investments in oil and gas. 
</P>
<P>
	He reported his largest asset was his investment in U.S.  
Treasury notes, which he valued at between $7.2 million and $14 
million. He reported those notes alone earned him between $351,000 
and $1.2 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's book, expected to be published later this year, will talk  
about his principles and values and how they were shaped, 
spokeswoman Karen Hughes said. For example, she said, Bush learned 
to take risks growing up in Midland, Texas. ``When he grew up 
there, the motto was, 'The sky's the limit,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial disclosure report is required of all presidential  
candidates. Most of the others filed on May 15; Bush requested a 
45-day extension because his accountant was hospitalized.

<HEADLINE> Boorda's Navy Record Remains Same </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- The official record of Adm. Jeremy  
``Mike'' Boorda, who committed suicide amid questions about his 
combat decorations, will continue to show he did not earn them, the 
Navy has decided. 
</P>
<P>
	A board of three civilians recommended last month that the  
record remain unaltered, Navy spokesman Capt. Mark Van Dyke said 
Friday. The ruling was upheld by Carolyn Becraft, who has the final 
say as assistant secretary of the Navy for manpower and reserve 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Boorda, who joined the Navy at 16 and became the only enlisted  
man to rise to chief of naval operations, took his life in 1996 
after 40 years of service. He was about to be asked by Newsweek 
reporters about why he wore Combat Vs -- tiny bronze letters 
standing for ``valor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decorations were attached to a Navy Achievement Medal  
awarded in 1968 and a Navy Commendation Medal awarded in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	In a suicide note ``to my sailors,'' Boorda said he felt  
disgraced. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, then-Navy Secretary John Dalton placed a memo in  
Boorda's file -- backed by another memo from Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt 
Jr., the Vietnam War-era chief of naval operations -- that declared 
him eligible to have worn the decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	Dalton said only the Navy review board could officially change  
the record to say Boorda had the right to wear them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boorda family petitioned the Board for Corrections of the  
Naval Records last September to change the record and show he was 
entitled to wear the decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The final decision was there was no error or injustice in Adm.  
Boorda's record and the panel was unanimous in their 
recommendation,'' Van Dyke said. 
</P>
<P>
	He provided the information to The Associated Press after an  
inquiry prompted by the state of Illinois' decision to award a 
$20,000 grant for a memorial in Boorda's hometown, Momence, about 
50 miles south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Boorda removed the decorations from his ribbons in 1995, on the  
advice of the Navy's Office of Awards and Special Projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Dalton's memo says the citations justifying the awards ``plainly  
state they were awarded for service including combat operations.'' 
Zumwalt's memo said it was ``appropriate, justified and proper'' 
for Boorda to have the decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing an unauthorized decoration is a severe breach of  
military protocol.

<HEADLINE> Arson Suspected at Abortion Clinic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Arson was suspected in a fire early  
today at a clinic where abortions are performed. The blaze caused 
slight damage to the outside of the complex but no injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire at the Choice Medical Group was contained about 20  
minutes after it was reported at 3:20 a.m., said fire dispatcher 
Tom Shotwell. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know only that it was an apparent arson,'' said FBI  
spokesman Nick Rossi. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hartley, division chief of the American River Fire  
Department, said the three of the four entrances to the two-story 
office complex housing the medical clinic were damaged by fire. 
</P>
<P>
	A trash bin in the rear of the building also was damaged,  
Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the middle of a preliminary investigation. Despite a  
lot of speculation, we don't want to come out with a cause prior to 
more investigation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shotwell had said earlier that an investigator at the scene told  
him it was a firebombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's an arson attack on an abortion clinic, then I think  
everyone needs to be concerned,'' said Katherine Kneer, chief 
executive officer of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether or not you believe in a woman's right to abortion,  
it's an attack on Democratic principles that every American holds 
dear,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, arson fires were set at three synagogues in the  
Sacramento area, causing an estimated $1 million in damage. There 
have been no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires were set within minutes of each other June 18 at the  
150-year-old B'nai Israel in Sacramento and two suburban temples, 
the Congregation Beth Shalom and the Kenesset Israel Torah Center. 
Anti-Jewish fliers were found at two of the sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossi would not speculate on any connection between the  
synagogue blazes and today's fire.

<HEADLINE> Congress Faces Tough Choices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Congress returns from its Fourth of July  
recess, the competition will be fierce on how to divide nearly $1 
trillion in budget surpluses among tax cuts, Medicare and more 
government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office's latest forecast is for a total  
surplus over 10 years of $2.9 trillion, including $996 billion that 
is not earmarked for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans want all that non-Social Security money used to  
cut taxes -- far above their initial plan for a $778 billion tax cut 
-- but others say Medicare changes should come first, including new 
assistance for prescription drugs as sought by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may put a little bit more money in tax cuts,'' said Rep.  
John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee. ``But 
we're not going to take all of these extra resources if we think we 
have a legitimate way to really reform Medicare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, contend that huge tax cuts would do  
nothing to erase the public debt and could severely hamper key 
programs ranging from education to national parks, which are 
subject to budget spending caps imposed during times of federal 
deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this tax cut proposal is totally irresponsible and  
misplaced in terms of its goals,'' said House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	But GOP House leaders vowed Thursday to press ahead the week of  
July 12 with a massive tax cut even though many GOP moderates, 
particularly in the Senate, believe it is too large and Democrats 
say its sheer size practically begs a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year package outlined in general terms would include cuts  
in taxes on income, inheritances and investments, as well as breaks 
to encourage personal savings for retirement and education and to 
enable more people to afford health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only reason for this surplus is because taxpayers are  
paying too much, which is why they deserve a refund,'' said Rep. 
Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. 
``If we don't cut taxes now and the money stays in Washington, the 
politicians surely will spend it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats believe Clinton will never sign a tax cut bill  
approaching $1 trillion, although he has said he is willing to 
consider a moderate bill using some of the surplus with benefits 
targeted to the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate presents another roadblock to a $1 trillion tax cut.  
Because the GOP budget only allows for $14 billion of the new 
surplus estimate to be added to the tax package, it could take 60 
of the 100 senators to agree to boost the number by more. The 
Senate has 55 Republicans, 45 Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters he  
was ``excited'' by the House proposals but added that there was no 
``magic number'' for the tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like for us to have the largest possible tax  
reduction,'' Lott said. ``But we have to get a bill ... through the 
Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Lott, Senate Finance Committee Chairman William  
Roth, R-Del., urged that only $14 billion of the new surplus money 
be added to the tax cut and the rest be set aside ``to carry out a 
comprehensive Medicare reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most on Capitol Hill now believe there will be a tax cut  
of some kind, given the giant budget surpluses driven by America's 
booming economy. Some moderate Democrats, for instance, are 
discussing tax relief of roughly $500 billion, possibly including a 
capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a prevailing consensus that there ought to be a tax  
cut,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. ``Now the question is 
how large it will be and what should be the components of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If any large tax cuts eventually pass, most of the impact will  
be delayed until after 2004 because, until then, the $2.9 trillion 
surplus is dominated by payroll taxes used to fund Social Security. 
After 2004, income tax revenue begins to take over. 
</P>
<P>
	CBO also had some words of caution about the surplus  
projections, saying that as baby boomers begin retiring in 2010 and 
relying in large numbers on Social Security and Medicare, 
``budgetary pressures ... can easily reverse the favorable fiscal 
forces that are operating today.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Continues Abortion Funds Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abortion-rights forces have lost an attempt in  
the Senate to end a longtime ban on coverage of most abortions by 
federal workers' health-insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate refused to remove the prohibition Thursday from a  
$27.7 billion bill financing the Treasury Department and smaller 
agencies for the coming fiscal year. The vote to leave the ban 
intact was 51-47. The overall bill was approved by voice vote, and 
shortly afterward the Senate adjourned for a 10-day July Fourth 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also used a voice vote to approve $411 million in  
federal contributions to the District of Columbia's city budget. 
The measure bans the use of federal or district funds for most 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage of both measures means the Senate has approved seven of  
the 13 annual spending bills for fiscal 2000, which starts Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has passed three of the measures, but none have been  
sent to President Clinton. There remains a strong possibility of 
yet another autumn spending showdown between the White House and 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury measure also raises the possibility of a $4,600  
cost-of-living pay raise next year for members of Congress. 
Legislators get an automatic annual increase unless they vote to 
deny it, under a 1989 law. The Treasury bill is the traditional 
vehicle for a provision blocking the raise, but so far there is no 
such prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
	A version of the measure approved by a House subcommittee also  
lacks language blocking the pay raise. Lawmakers currently earn 
$136,700, a level reached two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The abortion prohibition for federal employees would allow  
exceptions for cases of rape, incest and when the woman's life is 
in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, sponsored the abortion ban, saying 73  
percent of the cost of federal workers' health plans comes from 
taxpayers' dollars. He said abortions ``violate the conscience of 
many taxpayers'' and federal dollars should not be used to pay for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said the 1.2 million women  
affected by the prohibition would lose coverage for a procedure 
that privately employed women have. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can't repeal her right to choose, take away her ability  
to pay for what is legal,'' Boxer said of her opponents' tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials said in a written statement the  
White House ``would strongly oppose'' the prohibition, but did not 
mention a veto threat. The ban has been included in the bill in all 
but two years since 1983, DeWine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury bill includes $8.2 billion for the Internal Revenue  
Service, nearly $200 million less than this year. And it would cut 
President Clinton's $195 million request for an anti-drug media 
campaign by $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House Appropriations Committee approved a $14.1  
billion measure financing federal land and cultural programs, and 
an $8.4 billion bill for military construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The land bill provides nearly $1.2 billion less than Clinton  
wants, cutting his requests for land and water conservation, 
purchase of property for federal and state parks, restoration of 
Florida's Everglades and energy conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee approved an amendment by Rep. Lucille  
Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., that would allow women to breast-feed in 
national parks or cultural institutions covered by the bill.

<HEADLINE> Olympic ShutOut: High School Bands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Some took on extra part-time jobs to raise  
money. Others delayed plans to attend college out of state. All had 
been learning new music all year. 
</P>
<P>
	But those preparations for a once-in-a-lifetime chance to play  
in front of millions at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, may 
have been for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,300 high school band students from the United States and  
Japan, including 800 in Southern California and several hundred 
more from Atlanta, learned this week that the Sydney Organizing 
Committee for the Olympic Games was rescinding its invitation for 
their bands to play a seven-minute show during opening ceremonies 
of the Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of upset. We put a lot of work into this,'' said Erik  
Donzella, a 15-year-old sophomore who plays the baritone at 
Valhalla High School in El Cajon, Calif., 20 miles east of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG chief Sandy Hollway said Wednesday that a reprieve for the  
students might be possible, but so far the invitations remain 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee had dropped the contingent of international  
children from the opening ceremonies after local radio programs and 
newspapers complained that the event should feature local culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Many students had taken on extra jobs and spent time in  
fund-raising activities to help pay for the $3,000 trip. An $800 
deposit that has already been paid will be returned if the students 
don't go to Australia, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the same radio stations and newspapers which tore into the  
organizing committee for including foreign band members are tearing 
into them for kicking them out. 
</P>
<P>
	Band leaders from six schools in Orange and San Diego counties  
are traveling to Australia this weekend and hope to persuade 
organizers to honor the original invitations. They were originally 
scheduled to make the trip to inspect performing facilities, but it 
has turned into a lobbying effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to convince them to turn this back  
around,'' said Roy Anthony, the band director at Valhalla High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad,'' he said. ``We're talking about an international  
competition and they have an opportunity to have an international 
band, but they're shutting us down to do their own thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway hinted on Wednesday that band members might be used  
after all, but perhaps in a capacity outside the opening 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a flicker of light and certainly a sense of sympathy,  
wherever it comes out for these people overseas who have been 
affected,'' Hollway said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to speculate, don't want to raise hopes because  
there might not be feasible alternatives, but yes, it's something 
that's worth looking at. I'm exploring it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted, ``I would be hurt if there's a belief that we have  
caused hurt over there -- we probably have some explaining to do 
with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hollway said the issue was not dead.  
</P>
<P>
	``Don't have a picture that the issue has been taken off my desk  
or simply relegated to the trash can,'' he said. ``I understand 
there's an issue here and I'm going to be doing everything I can to 
work it through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the students wait. Most aren't concerned with the  
money or time spent practicing, according to trumpet player Andrew 
Bearden, 15, of Valhalla High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``For most of the kids in my group this was going to be a big  
highlight of their lives,'' Bearden said.

<HEADLINE> Two Fillies Moving Up and Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Gather The Day will move up and Sapphire n' Silk  
will move down in the Prioress for 3-year-old fillies, one of two 
stakes Saturday at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other race, Notoriety and Optic Nerve, 1-2 in the  
7-furlong Jaipur, will meet again in the one-mile Poker on the 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's stakes doubleheader will be the 7-furlong Tom Fool  
Handicap and the 5 1/2-furlong Tremont for 2-year-olds. Carter 
Handicap winner Artax, 117, and Affirmed Success, 119, head a 
six-horse field for the $150,000 Tom Fool. More Than Ready, 119, 
will spot six rivals from four to six pounds in the $100,000 
Tremont. 
</P>
<P>
	Belmont's Fourth of the July weekend will conclude Monday with  
the $400,000 Suburban Handicap in which one of the probables is 
Behrens, winner of the Massachusetts Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Gather The Day, unbeaten in four starts, all at 6 furlongs, will  
make her stakes debut in the 6-furlong Prioress 
</P>
<P>
	Sapphire n'Silk will drop down in distance after having finished  
fifth in Belmont's one-mile Acorn after setting the pace. She had 
won her three previous starts, including the La Troienne at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fillies will get plenty of competition in the $150,000  
Prioress. Also in the 10-horse field are Confessional, the 1998 
Frizette winner; Paved in Gold, second in the Nassau County at 
Belmont, and Things Change, winner of the Adirondack and Spinaway 
last year at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	Another starter will be Show Me The Stage, winner of Calder's  
Azalea Breeders' Cup, high-weighted at 121 pounds with Sapphire 
n'Silk. Paved in Gold, Gather The Day, Confessional and Things 
Change each will carry 118 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Notoriety and Optic Nerve each will carry 116 pounds in the  
$100,000-added Poker. High-weighted at 118 pounds in the 11-horse 
field is Rob'n Gin, who has sustained narrow losses in three graded 
stakes this year.

<HEADLINE> Blind Unemployment at 70 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In a labor market so tight that many employers  
are begging for workers, 70 percent of blind Americans who want a 
job can't find one, and advocates blame discrimination, a drop in 
Braille literacy and, perhaps most important, the computer mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	With the nation's overall unemployment rate at close to a  
29-year low of 4.3 percent, the level of joblessness among the 
blind has remained stagnant for about a decade, according to the 
U.S. Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans with Disabilities Act seems to have had no  
impact on this,'' said Barbara Pierce, spokeswoman for the National 
Federation of the Blind, which is holding its annual convention in 
Atlanta through Tuesday. The act, passed in 1990, bans 
discrimination based on disability and requires employers to take 
``reasonable'' steps to accommodate disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 70 percent of the blind who are unemployed,  
30 percent of those who are working are considered underemployed in 
relation to their qualifications, according to the Labor 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, technology has made things much easier for blind  
people. Converting text to Braille, once a painstaking process, can 
now be done by computers, and some office equipment is available 
with Braille-embossed buttons. 
</P>
<P>
	But other technology has hurt the employment chances of the  
750,000 blind Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Many blind people once worked as receptionists, taking dictation  
and answering the phone for managers and executives. But voice mail 
and e-mail have changed the job description, requiring more 
computer skills. 
</P>
<P>
	And software that requires the user to move around the screen  
with a mouse and click on icons is nearly impossible for blind 
people to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	Peg Halverson, who has been out of a job for the past two years,  
said she could use software that includes graphics if someone would 
put it in a blind-friendly format that relies mostly on keystroke 
commands and speaks out loud to the user to alert him or her to 
what is on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be employed. I want to contribute to society,'' said  
Ms. Halverson, 44. ``I'm thinking, `I have a business degree, I 
have basically 20 years of administrative experience, and I can't 
even get a customer service job.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pierce said software makers that convert point-and-click  
programs so that the blind can use them are a couple of years 
behind the rest of the fast-moving computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates said another problem has been a decline in the number  
of blind children learning Braille. During the past 30 years, the 
percentage of blind children learning Braille in the United States 
has fallen from about 50 percent to less than 10 percent, according 
to the federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: a push during the past two decades to get blind  
children out of special schools and ``mainstream'' them with other 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	The federation backs mainstreaming, but according to Ms. Pierce,  
many school systems saw it as a chance to cut costs by hiring fewer 
teachers for disabled students and rolling back Braille instruction 
to only once or twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Another big obstacle for blind people trying to find jobs is  
employers' attitudes, advocates said. Many managers think blind 
people are helpless and can't be effective workers. ``This is 
pity-based discrimination,'' Ms. Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates said there is technology to help the blind in many  
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies may balk when told that a blind employee will  
require a $3,000 Braille embosser that works like a computer 
printer that would cost less than $500. However, Ms. Pierce said, 
there are state, federal and private programs that help employers 
pay for such equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	At the convention, blind people are attending workshops on  
writing resumes, interviewing and dealing with discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Mattioli, a hospital dietitian in Baltimore, said she  
doesn't try to avoid the subject of her blindness during job 
interviews. Instead, she tells employers exactly how she proposes 
to overcome her disability and get the job done.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Job Growth Surging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy is still roaring ahead, creating  
more than a quarter-million new jobs in June everywhere from 
amusement parks to banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the overall unemployment rate crept up to 4.3 percent,  
all industries except manufacturing and mining posted solid gains. 
Indeed, some economists suggested the strong job growth could 
prolong concern at the Federal Reserve that the economy might be 
growing too fast for its own good. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets, however, were buoyed by Friday's report. The  
Dow Jones industrial average posted a record close, up 72.82 points 
to 11,139.24. That meant a gain of 586.68 points for the week, more 
than 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	American businesses added 268,000 new jobs in June, a big  
turnaround from May when they cut payrolls by 5,000, the Labor 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate went up slightly because the people  
entering the labor force outpaced even the large number of jobs 
that were created. May's rate of 4.2 percent had been a 29-year 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	The record-length peacetime economic expansion is reaching  
groups that often lag behind. The jobless rate for blacks fell to a 
record low of 7.3 percent in June. And rates for women and 
Hispanics remained close to their lowest levels in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	For some economists, the overall employment figures indicated a  
tight job market that could push wages up and lead to broader 
inflation, something the Federal Reserve is keeping an eye on. 
</P>
<P>
	Average hourly earnings -- a key gauge of inflation -- were up by  
3.7 percent over the previous June, to $13.23. 
</P>
<P>
	``The firmness depicted in these data certainly keeps the debate  
open regarding an Aug. 24 rate hike,'' said Marilyn Schaja, an 
economist at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, referring to the date 
of the Fed's next meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve on Wednesday boosted a key short-term  
interest rate by a quarter point, citing concerns that tight labor 
markets could begin pushing inflation higher as workers demand 
higher wages. But financial investors were encouraged when the 
central bank signaled that one rate hike might be all that was 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co., believes the  
Fed will probably raise interest rates once more before the end of 
this year, but said ``the numbers in this report were not enough to 
dislodge the Fed from its current steady-as-she-goes posture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The overall gain in payroll jobs reflected strong hiring in  
services. In two very different fields, amusement parks and other 
recreation centers added 20,000 jobs in June, while financial 
institutions, including banks, increased employment by 13,000. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. manufacturers, meanwhile, lost an additional 35,000 jobs in  
June, bringing the total job loss at factories since March 1998 to 
488,000. Manufacturers have been the hardest hit from the global 
financial crisis, suffering a loss of overseas demand for their 
products and increased competition from cheap imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the bad news on the jobs front, manufacturers did get a  
dose of good news in another government report Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders to American factories rebounded in May, rising 1.1  
percent, led by a big increase in demand for aircraft, autos and 
other transportation products, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manufacturing sector of the economy is still not out of  
the woods yet,'' said Gary Thayer, chief economist with A.G. 
Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. ``I think a lot of the problem is because the 
strong dollar makes America-made goods more expensive for foreign 
buyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, which is hoping the good economy  
will persuade voters to keep a Democrat in the White House next 
year, said that June's unemployment report provided an overall 
picture of a healthy economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamentals of this economy remain strong,'' said Labor  
Secretary Alexis Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she said the statistics show that unemployment remains  
high in inner cities and other distressed areas of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton will highlight the need to boost economic  
development in these areas during a six-state trip next week 
promoting his program to provide government loan guarantees and tax 
breaks for development in poor neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``This New Markets Initiative basically is designed to put in  
place for the whole nation, all distressed areas, the same 
incentives we give (companies) to invest in developing economies 
overseas,'' Clinton said in an interview with USA Today.

<HEADLINE> Bush Discloses At Least $2.1M Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush reported today he  
has no debts and a hefty financial portfolio that includes at least 
$7 million in U.S. Treasury notes and a diversified trust worth at 
least $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The early front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination also  
reported to the Federal Election Commission that he received an 
advance of $106,250 for an unspecified book. He reported he has 
earmarked those proceeds for youth charities. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial disclosure report, required of all presidential  
candidates, shows the son of former President George Bush is a 
millionaire several times over. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the report lists assets and income in only broad  
ranges, it gives a far less complete picture than the income tax 
return Bush made public in April that showed he and his wife had 
$18 million in income and paid $3.7 million in federal taxes in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The report he filed today described income only in ranges that  
fell between $2.1 million and $10.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush reported his largest asset was his investment in U.S.  
Treasury notes, which he valued at between $7.2 million and $14 
million. He reported those notes alone earned him between $351,000 
and $1.2 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	His other large assets included a diversified trust valued at  
between $1 million and $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also disclosed three checking accounts valued at between  
$3,000 and $45,000 as well as a few thousand dollars in stocks in 
high-tech companies like computer chip maker Intel, software giant 
Microsoft and communications company Lucent Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	He also reported owning two money market accounts with a total  
value between $600,000 and $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush described his largest source of income as capital gains  
from his sale of his interest in the Texas Rangers professional 
baseball team, which he listed at more than $1 million. The actual 
total is $14.9 million. In addition, Bush reported retaining an 
interest in the partnership that owned the team worth between $1 
million and $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his $97,890 governor's salary, Bush also listed:  
</P>
<P>
	--Capital gains income of between $100,000 and $1 million from  
Crescent Real Estate Equities. 
</P>
<P>
	--Capital gains income of $100,000 to $1 million from Advance  
Paradigm. 
</P>
<P>
	--Capital gains income of between $50,000 and $100,000 from GFW  
Energy LP. 
</P>
<P>
	--A book advance of $106,250 that he said was donated directly to  
the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and other youth charities.

<HEADLINE> DreamWorks Withdraws From Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After nearly four years of planning,  
DreamWorks SKG has pulled out of a controversial project to build a 
film studio near sensitive wetlands, citing changes in financial 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The $200 million studio was considered a key portion of the $8  
billion, 1,000-acre Playa Vista development, an industrial and 
residential project near the Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	But higher interest rates and construction costs made the deal  
less attractive than when DreamWorks owners Steven Spielberg, 
former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and record mogul David 
Geffen first considered the plan in late 1995, the company said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is to include 600,000 square feet of retail stores,  
more than 13,000 townhouses and condominiums and more than 500 
acres devoted to wetlands and parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Playa Vista has attracted numerous lawsuits by  
environmentalists, who claim the area along Ballona Creek is home 
to endangered species. The developers say no endangered species 
have been seen there for years. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Katzenberg said Playa Vista was ``no longer in  
DreamWorks' best interest. It simply was not meant to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg said he was ``committed first and foremost to doing  
what is best for our company.'' DreamWorks is ``exploring other 
options for our permanent home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Playa Vista President Peter Denniston said developers were  
``disappointed'' by DreamWorks' decision, but said the 47-acre 
parcel represented only 4 percent of the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, other prospective tenants have avoided making a  
commitment pending DreamWorks' decision.

<HEADLINE> Boorda's Navy Record Won't Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- The Navy has decided that the official  
record of Adm. Jeremy ``Mike'' Boorda, who committed suicide amid 
questions about Vietnam combat decorations he had worn, should 
continue to show he did not earn them. 
</P>
<P>
	A board of three civilians recommended last month that the  
official record remain unaltered, Navy spokesman Capt. Mark Van 
Dyke said Friday. The ruling was upheld by Carolyn Becraft, who has 
the final say as assistant secretary of the Navy for manpower and 
reserve affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Boorda, who joined the Navy at 16 and became the only enlisted  
man to rise to chief of naval operations, took his life in 1996 
after 40 years of service. He was about to be asked by Newsweek 
reporters about why he wore Combat Vs -- tiny bronze letters 
standing for ``valor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decorations were attached to a Navy Achievement Medal  
awarded in 1968 and a Navy Commendation Medal awarded in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	In a suicide note ``to my sailors,'' he said he felt disgraced.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, then-Navy Secretary John Dalton placed a memo in  
Boorda's file -- backed by another memo from Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt 
Jr., the Vietnam War-era chief of naval operations -- that declared 
him eligible to have worn the decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	Dalton said only the Navy review board could officially change  
the record to say Boorda had the right to wear them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boorda family petitioned the Board for Corrections of the  
Naval Records last September to change the record and show he was 
entitled to wear the decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The final decision was there was no error or injustice in Adm.  
Boorda's record and the panel was unanimous in their 
recommendation,'' Van Dyke said. 
</P>
<P>
	He provided the information to The Associated Press after an  
inquiry prompted by the state of Illinois' decision to award a 
$20,000 grant for a memorial in Boorda's hometown, Momence, about 
50 miles south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Boorda removed the decorations from his medals in 1995, on the  
advice of the Navy's Office of Awards and Special Projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Dalton's memo says the citations justifying the awards ``plainly  
state they were awarded for service including combat operations.'' 
Zumwalt's memo said it was ``appropriate, justified and proper'' 
for Boorda to have the decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing an unauthorized decoration is a severe breach of  
military protocol.

<HEADLINE> Gore Backer Acquitted in Money Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Tennessee developer who has known Vice  
President Al Gore since childhood was acquitted of giving illegal 
donations to Gore and other politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury cleared Franklin L. Haney of 42 charges on  
Thursday in a case prosecutors had called open and shut. ``If you 
looked at the facts in this case, you would convict in five 
minutes,'' prosecutor Pamela Huff said in her closing argument to 
the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury took about six hours, and at one point declared  
itself deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to putting this trial behind us and getting on  
with our lives,'' Haney said in a statement issued at the 
courthouse. He declined interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney is the only person acquitted so far in the Justice  
Department's investigation of unorthodox contributions to the 1996 
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign. A dozen people have pleaded 
guilty or have negotiated a deal to cooperate with prosecutors from 
the Justice Department's campaign finance task force, and five 
other cases are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney was accused of using straw donors to mask about $100,000  
of his own political donations to the 1996 race and other 
campaigns, and lying about it in filings to federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney's lawyers admitted he gave the money but argued that Haney  
misinterpreted a confusing set of rules on how to raise and record 
political donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors did not comment after the trial, but Justice  
Department spokesman Myron Marlin said the verdict will not affect 
the task force's work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed, but we respect the verdict,'' Marlin  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	During six days of testimony, prosecutors argued Haney tried to  
dodge campaign rules by reimbursing friends, employees and even 
strangers who made political donations at his behest. Paperwork 
sent to the Federal Election Commission listed the individuals, 
because federal campaign finance rules limit individual donations 
to $1,000, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors tried to show the Chattanooga, Tenn., millionaire  
was a sophisticated political veteran who got in over his head when 
he pledged to raise tens of thousands for Clinton-Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic booster for three decades, Haney, 59, was  
accustomed to giving his own money but unprepared to find enough 
legitimate individual donors to fulfill his promise, prosecutors 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense did not present any witnesses. Defense lawyer Ted  
Wells argued to the jury Wednesday that prosecutors did not prove 
Haney knowingly did anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Haney believed that it was permissible, and in no way that  
he was violating the law,'' Wells said after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells called the reimbursements gifts, and said Haney had made  
no attempt to hide the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney was also at the center of a Justice Department  
investigation last year into whether he paid a $1 million reward to 
1996 Clinton-Gore campaign manager Peter Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, a former top aide to Gore, got the money shortly before  
he took the campaign job. Congressional Republicans issued a report 
in December questioning whether the money was an illegal 
contingency fee for helping to get the Federal Communications 
Commission to move to a Haney development in Washington called 
Portals. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney and Knight both have said the payment represented legal  
fees for Knight's work on several Haney projects over three years.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A recent rally by stock mutual funds with a  
small-cap value strategy has brought a taste of sweet vindication 
for fund investors and managers who pride themselves on thinking 
contrarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past several years until this spring, small-cap value  
funds had been suffering from a double whammy. Investors favored 
big stocks over small, and high-flying ``growth'' stocks over 
out-of-favor ``value'' stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Many value managers felt as though they had two strikes against  
them before they even got a turn at bat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Value investing in general has been through a very difficult  
couple of years,'' said Bret Stanley, lead manager of the AIM Basic 
Value Fund, part of the $109 billion fund family run by AIM 
Advisors Inc. in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how difficult? In 1998, Morningstar Inc.'s small-value  
average, measuring funds specializing in small stocks with 
relatively low market valuations, dropped 7.19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morningstar average of small growth funds, by contrast, rose  
5.16 percent, while large-cap value funds gained 12.59 percent and 
large-cap growth funds soared 35.51 percent. From the front to the 
back of this stretched-out field, small-cap value trailed large-cap 
growth by 42.7 percentage points! 
</P>
<P>
	The picture was much the same in the first quarter of this year.  
Then in April it suddenly shifted. In the three months ended May 
31, according to Morningstar, small value funds returned 11.30 
percent, besting small growth, up 9.76 percent; large value, up 
9.07 percent, and large growth, up only 3.10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take much more than a few months to reverse a trend that  
has been in force for years. But many analysts argue that a 
turnaround was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something's stirring in the stock market. It could be the  
return of some sanity,'' says veteran fund-watcher Jay Schabacker 
in the current issue of his Mutual Fund Investing newsletter, based 
in Potomac, Md. ``The overpriced large-cap growth stocks are taking 
a well-deserved breather. On the upturn are the previous laggards, 
the small-cap value stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schabacker sees ``two reasons why the time is ripe for a  
small-cap value resurgence'' -- a huge disparity in relative values, 
and a possible change in the economic climate that might favor 
small value. 
</P>
<P>
	By his reckoning, price-earnings ratios of small value stocks  
recently averaged about 19 to 1, or about half the 38 multiple 
commanded by large growth stocks. In addition, he points to recent 
signs of stronger-than-expected growth in the economy, accompanied 
by stirrings of concern about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This economic mode favors the economically sensitive small-cap  
value industrial stocks and natural-resource stocks,'' Schabacker 
argues. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Kobren, a Wellesley Hills, Mass., adviser on funds, says,  
``I'm pleased that the market has finally broadened out and has 
begun to focus on value stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, investors should be willing to pay more for a company  
growing 20 percent a year (a typical growth stock) than for a 
company growing 12 percent a year (a value stock). But the 
difference just got too great. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second reason, and the likely catalyst for the value rally  
that started in April, was the stronger-than-anticipated economy,'' 
Kobren added in his FundsNet Insight letter. ``Value stocks are 
inherently more sensitive to the economy than growth stocks, and 
the report of improving growth prompted investors to plow money 
into value stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, the golden economy has trickled down to smaller  
firms. Thanks to the terrific economy, small- and mid-cap firms are 
showing consistent earnings improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What next? Recent experience reinforces the idea that it's very  
hard to guess when investors' favor will shift next among big and 
small, and growth and value stocks. Advocates of small-cap value 
proclaimed buying opportunities for many months before the category 
showed any signs of life -- and by then they had lost a good part of 
their audience. 
</P>
<P>
	So the recent small-cap value revival doesn't tell us much about  
whether it is likely to last, or for how long. It does, however, 
remind everybody concerned that no category of stocks wins the 
performance derby every time.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Financial Privacy Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to consumers' fears about  
commercial abuse of their privacy, the House voted overwhelmingly 
to give people the right to block banks and other financial 
companies from sharing their personal data with outside firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on the measure, proposed by House Republican leaders,  
was 427-1. It was attached to sweeping legislation that would allow 
banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge. The 
overall bill, which would overturn Depression-era prohibitions on 
the banking industry, was passed late Thursday with a veto-proof 
vote, 343-86, just before the House began its Fourth of July 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are strong new protections for consumer privacy,'' said  
Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, who sponsored the amendment with Rep. 
Deborah Pryce, also an Ohio Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure still would allow banks and other financial  
companies that are affiliated with each other to share customer 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking Committee,  
told reporters that privacy was ``an issue that Congress is going 
to have to continue to examine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lone vote against the privacy measure came from Rep. Ron  
Paul, R-Texas, a physician who once ran for president as the 
Libertarian Party's nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Disgruntled Democrats, who had pushed a stricter privacy  
provision, tried earlier to scuttle the vote on the financial 
overhaul legislation but failed on a party-line, 227-203 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats also objected to a provision in the bill that  
would allow health insurance companies to share medical data with 
life insurers when people apply for life insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed a substantially different version of the  
overhaul legislation in May. The two bills must be blended into one 
by House and Senate negotiators before legislation can be sent to 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We face some very high hurdles, and negotiations will require  
a tremendous effort,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chairman of 
the Senate Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill must benefit consumers by making the broadest array  
of financial services available at the lowest possible price,'' 
Gramm said. ``If it doesn't do that, then it's not worth having.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House supports in principle allowing banks, brokerages  
and insurers to combine, and while it objects to parts of the House 
bill, it has not threatened a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, however, has drawn a Clinton veto threat over  
several issues, including provisions that Democrats view as an 
attack on the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy protection emerged as a key element of the landmark  
legislation to restructure the financial service industry, which 
has come closer to enactment this year than in 20 previous years of 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton recently urged Congress to bolster consumers' rights  
when banks and other financial companies seek to share information 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer activists, including Ralph Nader, have maintained that  
the financial overhaul legislation would create serious privacy 
risks for Americans as banks, brokerages and insurers compiled 
profiles of customers' buying habits, hobbies and health 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	But proponents of the legislation, led by Wall Street and the  
banking and insurance industries, maintain it is needed to keep the 
U.S. financial industry competitive in global markets and that it 
would save consumers millions by providing one-stop financial 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats, led by Reps. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and John  
Dingell, D-Mich., had pushed a provision that would enable 
consumers to stop banks, securities firms and other financial 
companies from sharing their personal data with either affiliated 
or outside companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Commerce Committee, in a surprise move, recently  
adopted the provision. But it was removed from consideration 
Wednesday by the House Republican leadership, which controls the 
rules of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP-backed alternative, preferred by the financial  
industries, would let consumers block companies from selling their 
data to outside firms, such as telemarketers, but not from sharing 
it with affiliated companies under the same corporate parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharing of customer information, such as addresses, phone  
numbers, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and checking and 
credit card account information, is a major reason why financial 
companies want to merge. The data sharing opens numerous 
opportunities for the companies to market their services. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill also would require banks and other financial  
companies to disclose to customers their policies for collecting 
and protecting confidential data. The measure also would make it a 
federal crime for anyone to misrepresent themselves to obtain 
someone's private financial information.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Survivor Heads Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Nearly ten weeks after the world watched  
his bullet-bloodied body tumble from a window at Columbine High 
School, survivor Pat Ireland limped out of the hospital Friday in a 
new pair of sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing with one crutch, a leg brace and a baseball cap  
covering evidence of the bullet wounds that nearly took his life, 
the 17-year-old Ireland told reporters he was eager to get on with 
the healing process -- at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really exciting that I've made it this far and going home  
is just the next step,'' he said. ``I'm doing good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland was one of the most critically wounded victims of the  
April 20 school massacre. He was shot once in the foot and twice in 
the head. One bullet grazed his scalp but another lodged into his 
brain, causing severe trauma that has left him partially paralyzed 
on his right side. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland escaped from the school by tumbling out of a library  
window and into the arms of the police, a rescue caught on live 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Friday, plans were announced to distribute the $3.8  
million ``Healing Fund.'' Lump sum payments will made to the 
families of wounded students, including Ireland, to help pay for 
medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Though his son's bills will continue to grow, John Ireland said  
the payment is a good beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good start to the rehabilitation process for each one  
of these kids here and obviously there's going to be more and more 
needed all the time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Ireland faces months of therapy in addition to the hundreds  
of hours he has already spent working with physical and speech 
therapists. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ireland began therapy, he had difficulty with movement  
tasks because of the partial paralysis on his right side. He had to 
relearn how to eat, dress himself and walk. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen's doctor, Dr. Alan Weintraub described Ireland's  
recovery as ``impressive'' though expected. ``For Pat, his goal is 
full recovery,'' Weintraub said. ``Might it be different? We just 
don't know. It's too early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland says he intends to join his fellow classmates at  
Columbine when the school year begins in August. He also hopes to 
back on water skis -- one of his passions -- by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not being able to get out to the lake and water ski, that's  
been the biggest disappointment up to this point,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 25 people were wounded and 13 killed by two teen gunmen  
who took their school by storm on before turning their guns on 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the attack, donations have poured in from around the world  
and several funds have been established to help pay for victim and 
community needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Healing Fund, initiated by Mile High United Way, grew to  
$3.8 million and an advisory committee was formed to decide how to 
best spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest portion -- $1.46 million -- will be paid in lump sums  
to victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that money, payments of $150,000 will be made to the families  
of each of the four students with brain and spinal chord injuries, 
$50,000 will be paid to families of the deceased and $10,000 will 
be allotted to 21 other physically injured students. 
</P>
<P>
	Another $1.1 million will be used for outreach and direct  
services to the more than 2,000 victims at the school and in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	Community programs will receive about $500,000. The final  
$740,000 will be spent on the unanticipated needs of victims such 
as additional medical costs.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Change Medical Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Dr. Michael G. Ciccotti took over as the  
Philadelphia Phillies' team doctor Friday, replacing Dr. Phillip 
Marone, who becomes assistant director. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John McShane will serve as an assistant director of the  
medical team. Ciccotti and McShane are both affiliated with the 
Rothman Institute at Jefferson Hospital. Marone heads the Jefferson 
Sports Medicine Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Marone, the team physician for 26 years, told Phillies general  
manager Ed Wade in December this season would be his last. Marone 
will be 69 on Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``Along with my orthopaedic practice, it just became a little  
too much for me,'' Marone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciccotti is a graduate of the College of Holy Cross and  
Georgetown medical school. Ciccotti has served as an assistant for 
the Los Angeles Lakers, Rams, Kings, Dodgers and Angels among 
others and has been an orthopaedic consultant for the Flyers and 
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transition has been in the planning stages for several  
years,'' Ciccotti said. ``Dr. Marone has as much experience with a 
major league baseball team as anyone and over the years has shown 
tremendous devotation and loyality. I will try to continue that 
trend.''

<HEADLINE> Tour-de-France Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- After a year of accusations and investigations, the  
Tour de France starts amid a big question: Can the cycling showcase 
recover from the drug scandal that overtook last year's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the 180 riders on 20 teams were gathering for Saturday's  
prologue at Puy-du-Fou in western France, recriminations from last 
summer's debacle still abounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The former director of Festina, the team at the heart of the  
scandal, spoke of drug use among riders. He alluded to former team 
member and French star Richard Virenque, who denies having used 
illegal substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruno Roussel, one of two Festina officials who has been banned  
from the sport, said the drug demands of the riders became 
``incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Given their state of dependence, it was no longer possible to  
talk to them, to do anything,'' Roussel said n Friday's French 
sports newspaper L'Equipe. 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque remains under investigation on drug charges, but he  
will be riding Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Tour de France bowed to cycling's governing  
body and readmitted the rider. Organizers initially barred him 
because his ``presence would be incompatible with the image of the 
Tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Cycling Union, citing a technical error,  
ordered organizers to rescind the ban. Race director Jean-Marie 
Leblanc called the order a ``takeover by force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been prevented from leading our rehabilitation,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Virenque, now with the Italian team Polti, the  
cycling union ordered Tour officials to drop its ban of Manolo 
Saiz, sporting director of Spain's ONCE team. 
</P>
<P>
	Leblanc fears the decisions will make it tougher for the sport  
to shift the focus to cycling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour begins with nobody happy. Riders are furious about what  
they say is a witch hunt. Sponsors are wary of supporting a 
discredited sport. Many fans are simply fed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Making things worse, many stars are not competing, among them  
defending champion Marco Pantani. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian said the course didn't suit him. But his place would  
have been in jeopardy anyway after he was kicked out of the Tour of 
Italy last month. A blood test showed he might have used a drug 
that increases stamina. 
</P>
<P>
	The two previous winners are injured -- Jan Ullrich of Germany  
and Bjarne Riis of Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other riders, Casino's Laurent Roux and Cofidis' Philippe  
Gaumont, have been banned, as have the entire TVM and Vini 
Caldirola teams. World No. 1 Laurent Jalabert of ONCE is boycotting 
to protest the treatment of riders. 
</P>
<P>
	With the field open, Virenque, a top climber in good form, looks  
to be a favorite. Also in contention is last year's surprising 
third-place finisher, American Bobby Julich of Cofidis. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American to watch is former world champion Lance  
Armstrong. He was diagnosed with an advanced stage of testicular 
cancer in 1996 at age 25. Armstrong races for the U.S. Postal 
Service team. 
</P>
<P>
	Other strong contenders: Climber Christophe Rinero of Cofidis,  
Tour of Italy winner Ivan Gotti of Polti, Alex Zuelle of Banesto, 
and Abraham Olano of ONCE. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's prologue, a 4-mile time trial at Puy-du-Fou, time  
trial specialist Chris Boardman of Britain appears the favorite. 
Boardman won last year's Tour de France prologue in Dublin but had 
to abandon the race in the second stage because of a fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The race covers 20 stages and 2,286 miles. It is about 125 miles  
shorter than last year's race and features an extra rest day. The 
finish is July 25 in Paris with the traditional ride up and down 
the Champs-Elysees.

<HEADLINE> Tariffs Recommended For Steel Wire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. trade panel recommended Friday that  
President Clinton impose tariffs on foreign shipments of a type of 
steel used to make fencing and other wire products. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who has grappled to balance the needs of a struggling  
U.S. steel industry with his desire to keep international markets 
open, will have until mid-September to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the trade complaints were filed under a special section  
of U.S. trade law, the U.S. International Trade Commission's 
recommendations on steel wire rods are not binding. But Friday's 
action forces Clinton to confront the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases were filed by U.S. steel producers and their  
steelworkers' unions to combat low-priced imports, which they blame 
for thousands of layoffs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports reached record highs last year because of the Asian  
economic crisis, in which lowered demand abroad forced foreign 
producers to send products to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three voting commissioners recommended 15 percent  
tariffs on wire rod for the first year, with the tariff level going 
down each year to 9 percent in the fourth and final year. They did 
not recommend quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	The third commissioner did not detail her minority  
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	The tariffs would cover most wire rod imports, although  
shipments from Canada, Mexico and Israel would be among those 
exempted. Also exempted would be certain specialty grades of wire 
rod, including those used to make tire cords and valve springs. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the commission reached a split decision on whether  
foreign steel wire rod is hurting U.S. producers. Three 
commissioners who found injury were the ones who voted Friday on a 
relief recommendation.

<HEADLINE> Retailer Laura Ashley Sells Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- British-based Laura Ashley Holdings has completed  
the sale of its unprofitable chain of 94 North American stores. 
</P>
<P>
	But the retailer of English country fashions and furnishings  
still has to overcome years of losses and management turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Ashley sold its U.S. and Canadian stores to a group of  
investors supported by Malayan United Industries, the Malaysian 
firm that last year injected $70 million into Laura Ashley in 
exchange for a 40 percent stake. Terms of the sale, completed 
Friday, were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Ashley had been successful in the 1970s selling women's  
clothes, bedding and other home furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
	After the sudden death in 1995 of its founder, designer Laura  
Ashley, the company suffered a string of reversals. During the 
1980s it failed to keep up with changing fashions. In 10 years, 
Laura Ashley had seven chief executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Ashley began to expand aggressively into the United States  
in the 1980s and early 1990s. But its stores have struggled for 
years. The company reported an annual pretax loss of $26.7 million 
for the year ending January 1999 -- nearly all of it attributable to 
its U.S. operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new arrangement, Boston-based Laura Ashley (North  
America) Inc. will buy products from the British firm, paying a 
royalty based on a percentage of sales and licensing fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives Laura Ashley's North American division an  
infusion of $6 million from investors and a line of credit with a 
bank in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	It also allows the former parent company to write off $34.4  
million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, announced April 28, leaves Laura Ashley with some 300  
stores in Britain and continental Europe and an additional 200 
franchised and licensed stores in other countries.

<HEADLINE> Russia Oil Firm to Restructure Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Creditors of Russia's fifth-biggest oil producer  
have agreed to drop bankruptcy proceedings against the company and 
come up with a restructuring plan, the company said in a statement 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sidanko owes $400 million, $150 million of it to foreign  
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of bankruptcy proceedings ``is a step on the road (but)  
it's very much a work in progress,'' said Howard Chase, director of 
external relations for BP Amoco, which is owed about 5 percent of 
Sidanko's debt and is also owner of 10 percent of the company. 
</P>

	BP Amoco has a lot of money riding on the outcome of Sidanko's  
bankruptcy, but the damage to BP Amoco's investment in Sidanko 
could also bode ill for other foreign investors in Russia, Chase 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfgang Rutke of Dresdner Bank, chairman of the Sidanko  
creditors' committee, said creditors representing 96 percent of 
Sidanko's debts have approved the basic principles of a debt 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, a previously unknown, Russian-registered company  
called Beta-Ekho launched bankruptcy proceedings against Sidanko, 
suing it for debts of around $20,000 -- a fraction of Sidanko's 
overall debts. 
</P>
<P>
	From the beginning, the bankruptcy process was murky, with no  
disclosure of whom the creditor company represents. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco took control over Sidanko's board in April, teaming up  
with other minority shareholders to take some control over the 
bankruptcy process. 
</P>
<P>
	The same month, Russia's prosecutor general began a criminal  
investigation into the possibility that Sidanko had illegally 
forced itself into bankruptcy. The suggestion was prompted by the 
mystery surrounding Beta-Ekho.

<HEADLINE> Choir Founder Guilty Over Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The man credited with building the Boys Choir of  
Harlem into a famed institution has pleaded guilty to filing a 
false income tax return. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Turnbull, 54, pleaded guilty Thursday and apologized for  
failing to report $55,000 in personal income on his 1990 return. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers showed Turnbull also admitted that he understated  
taxes from 1984 through 1988 by at least $10,000 each year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Jones set sentencing for Oct.  
7. Under federal guidelines, Turnbull could receive up to eight 
months in prison and a fine of up to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plea agreement, he could receive a lesser sentence  
``based solely on extraordinary charitable works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement, Turnbull agreed to file corrected tax  
returns and pay past taxes and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnbull's famed boys choir provides musical training as well as  
counseling to hundreds of inner-city youths.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Killing Sick Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEBRON, Neb. (AP) -- A man who believed his wife was terminally  
ill with cancer and shot her to death to relieve her pain has been 
sentenced to at least two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy, however, revealed she died cancer-free.  
</P>
<P>
	Vernal ``Bob'' Ohlrich, 77, had pleaded no contest to  
manslaughter and was sentenced to between two years and three and 
one-third years. He will be eligible for parole in a year. He could 
have been sentenced to 20 years at Friday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohlrich told the judge that he killed his wife of 57 years in  
October because a doctor had diagnosed her with colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had pain, pain, pain,'' he wept. ``She wanted to die.''  
</P>
<P>
	After shooting his wife, Ohlrich laid the gun on a nurses'  
counter and told one of them to check on Mrs. Ohlrich. He said he 
had put the gun to his own temple after shooting his wife, but it 
jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors did not dispute that Mrs. Ohlrich was in a lot of  
pain, but they argued that it may have been from a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy of 74-year-old Phyllis Ohlrich's body found she did  
not have cancer when she was killed. Ohlrich's attorney disputed 
the autopsy results during the hearing, but showed no medical 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Timothy Sullivan, who treated Mrs. Ohlrich before her death,  
said his examinations showed the woman was suffering from colon 
cancer. However, he said he could not disagree with the autopsy 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Merrkatz, a nurse who was on duty the day Mrs. Ohlrich  
was killed, testified that Mrs. Ohlrich was in pain -- but it was 
not constant. Ms. Merrkatz said Mrs. Ohlrich never told her she 
wanted to die. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's only daughter, Annette, said she thought her father  
performed an unselfish act and ``is not a criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's stronger than I am,'' she said.
