Soldini, who battled strong winds to reach Autissier, spotted
the 42-year-old yachtswoman's 60-foot sailboat PRB at 1405 GMT and
minutes later had taken her safely aboard.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Autissier called her support team in France to indicate
that she was about to capsize.
</P>
<P>
After her rescue she faxed a note saying: "Ah, well, I'll do
some tourism in Italy ... not unhappy." She added that the yacht
had keeled over but quickly righted itself.
</P>
<P>
She was on the third leg of the solo Around Alone yacht race
which left Auckland 10 days ago bound for Uruguay, via the
dangerous Cape Horn, when tragedy struck.
</P>
<P>
Autissier, who was the race's overall leader when the fleet
departed Auckland bound for Punta del Este on February 6, was

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Summer Games sports
federations Tuesday showed their support to the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch embattled
for the biggest scandal in the Olympics history.
</P>
<P>
The council of the Association of Summer Olympic International
Federations (ASOIF) declared its confidence in Samaranch's "unique
ability" to get the IOC through a widening scandal stemming from
the revelations of widespread corruption in Salt Lake City's
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
ASOIF, led by athletics boss Primo Nebiolo and grouping
together all 28 federations represented at the Summer Games, said
in a statement: "The council is convinced that Samaranch is
exceptionally qualified to navigate the IOC through these troubled
waters.
</P>
<P>
"At a time like this when strength, wisdom and determination
are absolutely necessary to reinforce faith in the Olympic
movement his experience and leadership cannot be questioned."
</P>
<P>
Samaranch has faced numerous calls for his resignation from
newspapers and personalities outside the IOC as a result of the
corruption scandals surrounding the Olympic bidding process.
</P>
<P>
Four IOC members have resigned, five more face expulsion and
three more are under investigation.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Tuesday that it
would be premature to discuss the deployment of international
peacekeeping forces in Kosovo at the this time.
</P>
<P>
The top priority now should be to work for a political
settlement between Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians, said Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin.
</P>
<P>
"It would be premature, to say the least, to speak of any steps
assuring its implementation before a political agreement between
Serbia's authorities and Kosovo Albanians is in place," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no forces can be deployed in Kosovo without
Belgrade's consent as the the province "is part of a sovereign
state, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin reiterated Moscow opposition to the use of force in
Kosovo without U.N. Security Council authorization or of threats
of the use of force, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Agricultural Prices for 1999/2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Tuesday proposed prices for agricultural products for the period
from 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, estimated that in 1999 the appropriation requirements of
the union-wide agricultural guarantee funds would amount to 40.5
billion euros (45.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The estimated figure overruns the budget appropriations by 82
million euros (92.6 million dollars) but still leaves a margin of
4.7 billion euros (5.3 billion dollars) in relation to the
guideline projection.
</P>
<P>
The commission proposal has to be adopted and approved by the
European council of ministers and the European Parliament before
being applied.
</P>
<P>
The new estimate was based on the euro-to-dollar exchange rate
used for the budget and the average real value of the dollar
during the period from August 1998 to January 1999 was 0.86 euros.
</P>
<P>
The commission adopted a preliminary draft budget with an
estimated appropriation of 40.4 billion euros (45.7 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 1998 budget for European Union agricultural production was
40.4 billion euros (45.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that the proposal on agricultural
prices in 1999/2000 continues to stick to the policy of stability
and simplicity, which has prevailed since the 1992 agricultural
reforms.

<HEADLINE> Mali Offers Jail Facilities for Rwandan Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations court
on Rwanda confirmed Tuesday that Mali will provide prison
facilities for convicts of the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
</P>
<P>
Kingsley Moghalu, legal adviser for the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), told Xinhua over telephone that an
agreement on the matter was signed by the U.N. court and the
government of Mali last Friday in Bamako, the Malian capital.
</P>
<P>
The western African nation is the first country that has signed
a formal agreement with ICTR, based in Arusha, north Tanzania, for
the enforcement of the tribunal's sentences.
</P>
<P>
Moghalu, who is also a spokesman for ICTR, however declined to
specify the location of the facilities for security concerns.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the Registrar of ICTR Agwu Okali last Friday,
Malian President Alpha Konare promised that his government will
fully co-operate with the court, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
Moghalu said from Arusha that other African countries and
several Scandinavian countries have also offered to provide
prisons for the genocide convicts, but ICTR prefers to have them
jailed in Africa for "social and cultural reasons."
</P>
<P>
He said by imprisoning them in Africa, a continent strife with
conflicts, more Africans could learn a lesson from the Rwanda
genocide.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR was created by the United Nations Security Council in
November 1994 after one of the intense periods of mass
extermination in human history.
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 people, primarily Tutsis and moderate Hutus,
were massacred in just three months in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal has handed down three sentences, including those
of the former Prime Minister of Rwanda, Jean Kambanda and the
Mayor of Taba Commune, Jean-Paul Akayesu, both of whom sentenced
to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The third one was that of Omar Serushago, the former
Interahamwe militia leader who was penalized 15 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
However, the three have appealed against the sentences and are
still under detention at ICTR facilities waiting for the disposal
of their appeals.

<HEADLINE> (rpt with correction)Georgia Protests Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Georgian Foreign Ministry
lodged a strong protest against some Russian regions'
establishment of direct ties with Abkhazia, Itar-Tass reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a note sent to Moscow, the ministry said Russian regions and
federal structures "obstinately continue to establish direct
business contacts with the separatist leadership of Abkhazia"
despite numerous protests from Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the Kostroma region of Russia signed a deal on
trade and economic cooperation with Abkhazia. The Rostov region
and the Stavropoi Territory are also preparing similar agreements
with Abkhazia, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian Foreign Ministry said "cooperation with the
separatists in any form and in any field is a violation of the
Alma Ata Memorandum on the Maintenance of Peace and Stability in
the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) of February 10, 1995,
and of the decision on measures to settle the conflict in
Abkhazia, approved by the Council of the CIS heads of state under
the chairmanship of the President of Russia on January 19, 1996."
</P>
<P>
Tbilisi also protested the invitation, without consultation
with and consent of the Georgian government, of Abkhazian
President Vladisiav Ardzinba and South Ossetia leader Lyudvig
Chibirov to the February 6-8 meeting of the Russian association
North Caucasus in Sochi.
</P>
<P>
That meeting was also attended by Russian First Vice-Prime
Minister Vadim Gustov, which "lent an official state status to the
event," Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
The fact that "the leaders of separatist authorities from
Abkhazia and South Ossetia were invited" to Russia's internal
event is an "obvious act of connivance for anti-constitutional
regimes," Georgia said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting in Sochi as an "interference in the
internal affairs of sovereign Georgia," the Georgian Foreign
Ministry said participants at the meeting "turned it into a forum
to provocative statements against Georgian authorities, into some
sort of a trial for Georgia's policy."

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Tuesday called for some
countries to step up security around its representative
institutions in their states against possible attacks to Turkish
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli
issued the call after Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
announced that Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), was brought back to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21 foreign ambassadors in Ankara were summoned to
the Turkish Foreign Ministry Tuesday and were briefed on the
latest developments regarding the capture of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli said that Turkey thanked the ambassadors for their
cooperation in the struggle against terrorism, adding that they
also wanted the continuation of the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that Ocalan's capture triggered Kurdish
demonstrations across Europe.
</P>
<P>
Turkish security forces stepped up security Tuesday around
the embassies of the United States, Greece, Russia, Israel, the
U.N. House and the Turkish Prime Ministry in Ankara after Ocalan
was brought back to Turkey earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit announced that Ocalan, Turkey's most wanted man, has
been brought to Turkey at 03:00 local time (01:00 GMT) Tuesday
and will face a death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported that the private plane
which brought Ocalan to Turkey landed at the Ataturk
International Airport in Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey,
and left soon.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Role in Turkish Kurdish Leader's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel denied Tuesday that
it had played a role in the capture of Kurdish leader Abdullah
Ocalan by Turkey, with which it has close military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Israel categorically denies various media reports that it was
involved in passing on information, which led to capture of
Abdullah Ocalan," Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after a German news agency quoted western
intelligence officials as saying that Israel's foreign
intelligence agency, Mossad, had played a decisive role in
Ocalan's capture by delivering important message to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan is the leader of Turkish Kurdish Workers' Party, which
has been fighting since 1984 a guerrilla war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish leader, who was brought back to Turkey Tuesday, has
sought asylum in various countries in Europe and Africa over the
last several months.
</P>
<P>
"Israel wishes to make it absolutely clear that it was not
involved in any way in this matter," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Embassy in Ankara was among several foreign embassies
around which the security has been beefed up following the capture
of Ocalan for fear of terrorist revenge, Israel Radio said.

<P>
MOGADISHU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting has ignited
between rival militiamen from the clansmen of Warsanegli and Da'ud
inside the very busy market of El-Ma'an natural port, 30 km
northeast of the Somali capital Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
There is no exact casualty figures available at this stage as
the fighting still continues late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
However, reports from the natural port of El-Ma'an indicate
that at least nine people were killed and more than 15 others
were wounded including civilians when battle wagons from the
warring sides have exchanged heavy gunfire in and outside the
market place.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting today is not known, however the two
clans who both belong to the main Abgal clan of Ali Mahdi Mohamed
roots back to clan animosity which rose after gunmen from the
Da'ud clan have killed and destroyed several vehicles at a
roadblock near Gololey Village, about 45 km north of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's fighting has also affected the operations of the
natural port of El-Ma'an which is now the only port serving
southern Somalia after the other natural port of Merca, about 100
km south of Mogadishu, had stopped its operation for reasons
undisclosed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies "Direct Involvement" in Capture of Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The White House on Tuesday
denied any direct involvement in the handover of Kurdish guerrilla
leader Abdullah Ocalan to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that the U.S. had no direct involvement in
the handover," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who The Turkish government had asked Italy to extradite
when he first surfaced there last year after several year of
hiding but later fled to other countries, has been caught up with
in Kenya, where he had taken refuge in the Greek embassy.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said afterwards that
Ocalan left the embassy of his own accord and entered the custody
of the Kenyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the handover, that was done between the Kenyan and
the Turkish governments and I'd refer you to those governments for
any of the details," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Pressed on whether the United States had any indirect role, for
example in helping to locate Ocalan, Lockhart said: "That's all I
have. I don't comment on intelligence matters."
</P>
<P>
Oclan's capture ignited a wave of Kurdish demonstrations across
Europe largely directed against Greece.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Goes out of Control in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cholera situation in the southern Gedo region seem to be
getting out of hand as the death rate and those falling for the
disease are increasing by the hour.
</P>
<P>
According to the local health authorities, the disease is now
especially attacking the recently opened refugee camps and the
town of BardeTa itself,
</P>
<P>
420 km Southwest of Mogadishu,
</P>
<P>
Qasim Aden Egal, director of Bardera town hospital, said that
their treatment facility is now over-flooded with cholera patients
arriving mainly from the countryside and the refugee camps just
outside the town.
</P>
<P>
Egal, the former director general of the ministry of health
during the late regime, said 250 cholera patients are now being
treated in the hospital, while the number is even increasing by
the hour,
</P>
<P>
Egal who contacted the journalists here in Mogadishu on the VHF
 radio Monday night said 60 people have been recorded dead in the
hospital while many more who could not make to the hospital for
treatment are believed to have died in the countryside in the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
He added that 45 of the dead have come from the four refugee
camps surrounding Bardera town, while the other 15 were citizens
of the town,
</P>
<P>
The villages of Dhobley, Sharinley, Tubako and Bilaleh, a few
kilometers north and south of Bardera Town are among the worst
affected villages.
</P>
<P>
The death rate in those villages is reported to have exceeded
four people per day, while the recently opened refugee camps
where over 11, 000 people are now being fed are similarly
characterized as horrific places with an average death of three
per day in each camp. Egal said the death rate will rise even
higher especially in those villages where the sanitation is not
good and the potable water is scarce,

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army to Create Rapid Strike Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Army will create
light "strike forces" that could rapidly deploy to world hot spots
such as Kosovo to either go to war or enforce peace, Army
Secretary Louis Caldera said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"As we look out toward the future, the Army becomes a power
projection Army," Caldera said. "We need to be a lighter Army, a
more agile, more lethal Army, to be able to get to the fight
quicker."
</P>
<P>
Now, U.S. Army divisions are designed for conventional warfare
with heavy tank and artillery units and up to 18,000 soldiers. As
a result, although the Army provides the majority of U.S. ground
troops in battlefields and for peacekeeping missions, it takes at
least weeks to move out.
</P>
<P>
The first Army strike force will be created within the year at
Fort Polk, Louisiana State, where it will be tested in war games.
</P>
<P>
A "strike force" would typically include 3,000 to 5,000
soldiers with lighter, but more technically sophisticated tanks
and artillery, Caldera said. Soldiers would likely be based in the
United States, but could move out overseas more rapidly than now,
nonetheless, he said.
</P>
<P>
Specialized equipment and soldiers could be added to any strike
force depending on the need -- such as deploying an airborne force
to secure a landing strip or engineers or heavy combat troops,
Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
The Army is already trimming six of its 10 heavy battle
divisions in a shift from more conventional forces. Instead of
more than 18,000 soldiers, the smaller divisions would have more
than 15,000. Heavy equipment also is cut, from 58 tanks to 45 per
battalion, for example.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Former Chief of Staff in Rwandan PM's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The trial of Antoine
Bizimana, former chief of staff in the Prime Minister's office,
resumed Tuesday in the Butare criminal court, south of the
capital Kigali, Rwandan News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Bizimana was arrested in June of last year for involvement in
the genocide and crimes against humanity he committed in his home
area of Mbazi Commune where around 20, 000 Tutsis were massacred
by the Hutu Interahamwe militia at the Gihindamuyaga monastery.
</P>
<P>
The trial of Sibomana started on June 23, 1998, but the accused
had asked that the case be handled by the Court of Appeal
claiming lack of fairness by the Butare court. However, the court
of Appeal had refused to take the case arguing that Sibomana's
fears were not founded.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's hearing which opened with the testimony of
seven prosecution witnesses, Siboma and the victims were assisted
by lawyers provided by the Belgian non-governmental organization,
Lawyers Without Borders.
</P>
<P>
Sibomana's wife, Marie Claire Mukasine, also a lawyer and chief
of staff in the Ministry of Gender and Women in Development was
present at the court. The hearing is due to continue Wednesday.

<P>
BERLIN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Kurdish activists in Germany
protested on Tuesday against the arrest of Kurdish Workers Party
(PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Protests took place at Greek diplomatic posts in Bonn,
Duesseldorf, Berlin, Stuttgart, Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn about 10 demonstrators forced their way on to the
embassy grounds and smashed windows and barricaded themselves in.
Traffic in the area was being diverted.
</P>
<P>
Other demonstrators forced their way into the Kenyan embassy in
Bonn and were hold two Kenyan nationals, a man and a woman. But a

whether or not they were being held as hostages. The protesters
had also not set any demands.

extinguisher. Six policemen were slightly injured while 40 Kurds
in the immediate vicinity were taken into custody as a security
measure.

<HEADLINE> U.N.-Libya Contacts Goes on Over Lockerbie Issue, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday told reporters that contacts are under way
between the United Nations and Libya, together with other relevant
parties, over plans for the trial of two Libyan suspects in the
1988 Lockerbie airliner bombing.
</P>
<P>
In answering a press question whether he had provided Libya
with relevant written assurances it required, Annan said, "We are
in discussion. We are in touch with them and I would hope that
within the next week or so we will have a clearer indication of
what is happening."
</P>
<P>
Libya confirmed over the weekend that it was willing to hand
over the suspects for trial before a Scottish court in the
Netherlands, but diplomats said Tripoli first wanted certain
written assurances.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan suspects have been indicted in both Britain and the
United States on charges of placing a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103,
which exploded over the Scottish village of Lockerbie in December
1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Saudi Arabia, which had sent envoys to Tripoli
to persuade Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to hand over the two
accused, announced on Saturday that agreement had been reached.
</P>
<P>
"Everything has been resolved, and the matter is now in the
hands of the secretary-general of the United Nations," a spokesman
for South African President Nelson Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who was reported by a spokesman on Saturday to be
encouraged "by the important progress," declined to go into
details on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I think I have said all I need to say at this stage. We are at
a delicate stage. We are in discussions and I would prefer not to
go into details," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was in touch with the United States and
Britain as well as Libya, he replied: "We are in touch with all
the parties."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992, and
toughened them in 1993, because of its failure to hand over the
two men for trial in Britain or the United States.
</P>
<P>
In August last year, those two countries said they would no
longer insist that the accused be extradited to either of their
countries and challenged Libya to make good on its repeated offer
to allow them to be tried before a Scottish court in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In response to Libyan demands that the suspects should serve
their prison terms in Libya if convicted, the United States and
Britain insisted last week that the two must be jailed in Scotland
but said the United Nations could monitor their treatment.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who held talks with Gaddafi during his visits to Libya
in early January, had failed to persuade Trilipoli into
surrendering the two suspects, but he later asked South Africa and
Saudi Arabia for assistance to mediate a settlement to the
outstanding issue surrounding the Lockerbie trial.

GENEVA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations food agency
said on Tuesday it was releasing 2.4 million U.S. dollars to buy
food for some 80,000 hungry farmers in drought-hit southern
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said the World Food Program

The Rome-based WFP has distributed 5,000 tons of rice and beans
to people in the southern provinces of Gaza, Maputo and Inhambane,
hardest hit by drought, she told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"But this is not enough. The agency has just unblocked $2.4
million to provide food aid to 80,000 farmers until the next
harvest in May," the WFP spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Government Concerned on Violation in Hague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch government
expressed serious concerns on Tuesday about some activists'
violation of the diplomatic status of the Greek ambassador's
residence in The Hague, where the Dutch central government is
located.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dutch Government information Council, the
government takes an extremely serious view of the occupation of
the Greek ambassador's residence and the fact that three people
have been taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozias van Aartsen has
contact his Greek counterpart Theodoros Pangalos and expressed his
sincere regret about the incident, the council said in a new
release in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
"The Dutch government is doing everything within its power to
bring the occupation and the hostage situation to an end as
quickly as possible," the news release said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry is not issuing any statements about the
actual situation at the residence, the council said. No injuries
and further details have been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that this incident is referring to one of the
protests worldwide against the situation of Turkey's Kurdish
leader Abdullah Ocalan. Some Kurdish people said in a statement on
Monday that Ocalan, who was staying at the Greek Embassy in Kenya
for some time, was taken away by the Kenyan police from the Greek
Embassy in the evening at 6 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very dangerous and ambiguous development. Therefore,
the Kenyan and the Greek Governments must clarify the situation
without delay," the statement said.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The bombings in central
Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Tuesday killed nine people and injured 15
others, Uzbek Interior Minister Zakir Almatov said.
</P>
<P>
He said there were six bombings in various parts of the city
from 10:52 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. local time. The explosives had been
planted in cars.
</P>
<P>
Uzbek President Islam Karimov appeared in state television
after the blasts and told the nation that the terrorist acts were
aimed against him.
</P>
<P>
Nobody has claimed to be responsible for the explosions, but
Security chief Rustam Inoyatov was quoted as telling the
parliament that "this is the work of extremists outside the
country and people linked to them inside the republic."
</P>
<P>
"The explosions occurred just a few minutes before the
president arrived at the government building. A car pulled up to
Independence Square, terrorists came out and, by shooting at it,
blew it up," Inoyatov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Central Asian republic has sealed its borders and
law-enforcement officers have surrounded the capital and are
conducting raids and searches.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
called Karimov and condemned the bombing in Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also expressed his condolences to Uzbekistan for the
deaths caused by the explosion, Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff
Sergei Prikhodko said.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Woman Protester Sets Self on Fire in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A Kurdish woman protester
taking part in a protest outside the Greek embassy in London on
Tuesday set her clothes alight amid protests in support of a
Kurdish leader detained in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The burned woman was being treated at the scene by paramedics,
witnesses said. Her condition was not clear.
</P>
<P>
About 400 supporters of Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish guerrilla
leader who was arrested on Monday in Kenya and was later transferred
to Turkey, staged a sitdown protest outside the building while up
to 50 people have barricaded themselves inside.
</P>
<P>
Trouble broke out as protesters broke through police lines. The
woman set herself ablaze and was receiving medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Kurdish demonstrators who seized the embassy had
vowed to set fire to themselves in support of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to die. We have petrol. We are ready to burn
ourselves," a spokesman for the demonstrators was quoted by
Reuters as saying through a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The protest in London began on Tuesday morning as Ocalan was
taken into Turkish custody. A group of Kurds forced their way into
the Greek Embassy, a five story building in west London, shortly
before 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was wanted in Turkey for leading a separatist war and on
charges of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish leader arrived Turkey after leaving the Greek
embassy in Nairobi. Greek and Kenyan missions across Europe have
been occupied in protest at Ocalan's treatment.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the demonstrators in London said they were
prepared to stay there until they received assurances about the
safety and whereabouts of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
"We will stay here until we get news from the Greeks about our
leader. We want the problem solved," he said.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder and Industry Agree Nazi Slave Labourer Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder and German industry executives on Tuesday announced the
creation of a fund to compensate ex-Nazi era slave labourers.
</P>
<P>
But they declined to say how much money would be made available
for payments.
</P>
<P>
"Germany is dealing with its history in a responsible manner,"
said Schroeder at a Bonn news conference.
</P>
<P>
The private sector fund, which is expected to total between 2
and 2.5 billion marks (1.2 to 1.5 billion dollars), will be used
to pay symbolic compensation to people forced to work for Adolf
Hitler's Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder refused to reveal how much money would be paid into
the fund and said further details still had to be hammered out on
how German banks and major industry would support the initiative.
</P>
<P>
That we cannot talk about the amount of money in the fund has
something to do with the difficulty (of this question)," said
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said the moral and ethical goal of the fund was to
assist aging ex-Nazi slave labourers to improve their standard of
living.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement by Schroeder and German business said the
fund should be operating by September 1, 1999, and that its top
goal would be to dispense swift, fair and unbureaucratic aid,
given the advanced age of victims.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder stressed, however, the fund was also aimed at
achieving legal security for German firms against any further
claims for compensation stemming from the Third Reich era.
</P>
<P>
"(The fund) will establish a foundation to counter legal
claims, especially class action suits in the U.S., as well as
campaigns aimed at the reputation of our nation and undermining
its economy," said the joint statement issued by Schroeder and
German business.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive of Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank,
Rolf Breuer, termed the fund "a milestone".
</P>
<P>
" We cannot drag this issue behind us over generations," said
Breuer, who attended the news briefing with Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said the fund was aimed first at former slave
labourers in the United States. He noted Germany had already paid
compensation to East European nations on a bilateral basis. "In
which form this money benefits victims cannot be determined from
here," he said.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement was also vague on this matter: "It is the
declared goal of the companies involved that humanitarian
assistance to victims should be made regardless of their religion
or nationality."
</P>
<P>
All money in the fund, which will be run as a foundation, is to
come from banks and major German industrial concerns.
</P>
<P>
The German state has already paid 80 billion dollars in
compensation for Nazi crimes since 1945, according to Schroeder's
chief-of-staff, Bodo Hombach. Another 24 billion dollars in state
money is earmarked for future payments.
</P>
<P>
German companies launching the fund Tuesday were: Allianz AG,
BASF AG, Bayer AG, BMW AG, DaimlerChrysler AG, Deutsche Bank AG,
Degussa- Huels AG, Dresdner Bank AG, Freidr. Krupp AG,
Hoesch-Kruupp, Hoeschst AG, Siemens AG and Volkswagen AG.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he expected more firms to join before the fund
was activated.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 16 (Xinhua)-- Kurdish protesters seized Greek
missions around Europe Tuesday, taking diplomats and families
hostage, in protests over the arrest of their guerrilla leader
Abdullah Ocalan, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds accused Greece of allowing Abdullah Ocalan to be
taken from its embassy in Kenya and transported to Turkey, and
they vented their fury on Greek missions in at least 21 European
cities.
</P>
<P>
Protesters took hostages at Greek missions in the Netherlands,
Austria, Germany, and Italy, and the Kenyan Embassy in Paris. In
cities across Europe, Kurds threatened to burn Greek embassies or
consulates they occupied or set themselves afire.
</P>
<P>
Protesters occupied the Greek embassies in Moscow, in Brussels,
Belgium, and in Stockholm, Sweden, but left voluntarily after
several hours, reports said.
</P>
<P>
There were few large protests in Greece. Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos ordered Kurds to leave all Greek diplomatic
areas or authorities would ``take appropriate action.''
</P>
<P>
Greek authorities insisted they had no role in Ocalan's capture
Monday, saying he left their embassy compound in Nairobi
voluntarily. Kenya also denied having a hand in his capture.
</P>
<P>
Dutch lawyers working for Ocalan, however, said he was
physically dragged out of the embassy by Kenyan police and put on
a plane for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, 49, has been on the run since he was forced to leave
Syria last year under threat of military action by Turkey.

underlying inflation was slightly above target in January.
</P>
<P>
One of the analysts said: "The inflation data are quite
disappointing, but January is a month when all kinds of
distortions to the series come into the picture."
</P>
<P>
The figures could also spell a bitter disappointment for UK
industry and trade unions who had called for even lower interest
rates to boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, not all analysts are that pessimistic. One of them
said the Bank might hope "that as we go through the late months of
the year inflation will subside to the target and below the
target" and ignore the January inflation data.

<HEADLINE> Toll of Uzbek Explosions Rises to 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of people killed in
Tuesday's explosions in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, rose to 13, and 128
were injured, of whom 83 were hospitalized, the Uzbek government
said.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet expressed condolences to the families of the people
killed in the bombings, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Uzbek Interior Minister Zakir Almatov said there were six
bombings in various parts of the city from 10:52 a.m. to 12:00
p.m. local time. The explosives had been planted in cars.
</P>
<P>
Nobody has claimed responsibility for the explosions, but
security chief Rustam Inoyatov was quoted as telling the
parliament that "this is the work of extremists outside the
country and people linked to them inside the republic."
</P>
<P>
"The explosions occurred just a few minutes before the
president arrived at the government building. A car pulled up to
Independence Square, terrorists came out and, by shooting at it,
blew it up," Inoyatov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Central Asian republic has sealed its borders and
law-enforcement officers have surrounded the capital and are
conducting raids and searches.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
telephoned Karimov and condemned the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed his condolences to Uzbekistan for the deaths
caused by the explosion. He has also instructed Interior Minister
Sergei Stepashin to assist Uzbek law enforcement agencies to
investigate the tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Albright: No Time Limit for U.S. Troops Stay in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States would not
set any timetable or deadline for American peacekeeping troops if
they are sent to Kosovo, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We really learned a lesson in Bosnia that setting an
artificial deadline doesn't work," Albright said in an interview
with ABC TV program "Good Morning America."
</P>
<P>
"What one needs to do is to put down benchmarks," she added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Bill Clinton, when announcing his
intention to dispatch some 4,000 troops to Kosovo, said the troops
would be brought back home in a year.
</P>
<P>
Albright has said a NATO peacekeeping force had to be part of
any settlement for Kosovo. The Serbs, however, insist in
negotiations with ethnic Albanians in Eambouillet, France, that
they would not permit NATO soldiers on their territory, including
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But there would be no agreement on Kosovo's conflict if the
Serbs's refusal to allow NATO peacekeeping troops in the province,
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"No NATO force is a deal breaker from our perspective," she
said.
</P>
<P>
And she threatened that if there is an impasse, "that means
that it would be followed by NATO bombing."
</P>
<P>
If there is a settlement, some 4,000 U.S. troops would be part
of a NATO force of about 28,000. Once the NATO troops enter the
province, Kosovo will set the stage as NATO has planned for
election to implement self-rule. And that would mean control of
the province by the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeepers also would disarm Serb and Albanian forces and
clear the way for setting up a local police force.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. troops would stay in Kosovo as long as
it takes to deal with those "benchmarks."
</P>
<P>
"So we're not putting that down as a period of time," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has briefed Congress on its plan to
dispatch U.S. troops to Kosovo, but is not seeking authorization.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has a constitutional right to send the Americans to
Kosovo without Congress' approval.

<P>
HARARE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Banking
Corporation (Zimbank) said Tuesday that its minimum lending rates
will still rise from 40.5 percent to 43.5 percent with effect from
Wednesday, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the commercial bank said the increase in
minimum lending rates was in response to the move by the central
bank to raise the repo rate from 38.5 percent to 42.5 percent on
January 27.
</P>
<P>
This triggered the country's commercial banks to raise their
prime lending rates to around 43.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbank spokesman said interest on local loans or overdraft
 facilities had gone up by 3.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Slovenia Supports Kuwait on POWs Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Slovenian Prime
Minister Janez Drnovsek underlined here on Tuesday that more
pressure should be put on Iraq to release Kuwaiti prisoners
of war (POWs).
</P>
<P>
Slovenia supports Kuwait's causes, especially on the issue of
POWs, Drnovsek told a press conference at the Royal Palace here
before concluding his two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
"As a member of the United Nations Security Council,
Slovenia is very active on this issue and I must say that
we have the same perception of this situation with our
friends in Kuwait," he said.
</P>
<P>
In comments on Iraq's renewed threats to Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia, Drnovsek said that "I think these threats showed that the
international community must continue their efforts to contain
Iraq to ensure that Kuwait and other countries will not be
threatened by Baghdad."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused Saudi Arabia and Kuwait of facilitating
U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq in mid-December and allowing
them to use their bases to patrol the no-fly zone in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On the matter of the low bilateral economic exchanges, the
Slovenian leader said that "very soon we are going to sign a
couple of agreements on investment protection and on trade
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
He said that an agreement on avoidance of double taxation
will also be concluded soon.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Slovenia signed an agreement last October on
medical and financial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, bilateral trade between the two countries is still
very low, which does not exceed 2 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Drnovsek, who arrived here Monday, described his visit as
"excellent" and very "satisfying."
</P>
<P>
He said he had established "very good contacts with Kuwaiti
leaders which he believed is the basis of all other
activities."
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay, Drnovsek held separate talks with
Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and his Kuwait's
counterpart Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah on a wide
range of issues.

Riyadh Tuesday for a visit aimed at promoting economic relations
with the Gulf Arab country.
</P>
<P>
Oualalou, accompanied by a 70-member delegation, will meet his
Saudi counterpart Ibrahim Al-Assaf and several other cabinet
ministers, Moroccan Ambassador Abdul Karim Al-Sumar to Saudi
Arabia told the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sumar said that Oualalou will also meet Saudi entrepreneurs

</P>
<P>
The Moroccan delegation will attend the first meeting of the

Morocco is seeking Saudi investment in tourism and mining
projects, he said.

<HEADLINE> No More Trade Concessions to EU: S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is refusing
to bow to pressure from European Union (EU) countries to make
further concessions in the free trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin and EU
commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro drafted a deal in Davos,
Switzerland last month.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is quite confident that the package is fair to
all parties and any further change would cause an imbalance,"
South African Press Association quoted Erwin as saying in Cape
Town Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore have no intention of changing our position and if
this means there is no agreement it would be a great pity and I
think a mistake by the EU," said the South African minister.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said that it was hoped an acceptable trade package had
been agreed to at a meeting in Davos, and South Africa understood
that the EU commissioners supported it.
</P>
<P>
"It now seems there may be member states that have some doubts
about this and are raising further issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was impossible for South Africa to negotiate separately with
the 15 EU member states, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is for the EU to resolve its internal differences and for
the EU to come back to us with a response to our letter.
</P>
<P>
"We have informed the European Union on behalf of the South
African government that we do not believe there is any need or any
justification to reopen the matters that were resolved in Davos.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the EU will accept this position and pass it. It
would be a great pity if this were not the case."
</P>
<P>
Erwin said even if an agreement could not be reached, there was
no question of changing of Europe's status as South Africa's main
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the agreement between the EU and South Africa
is to basically stabilize our trading environment over 12 years.
That must be the first prize.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said South Africa remained optimistic and hoped the EU
ministers would see sense and conclude the matter.
</P>
<P>
The deal drafted in Davos envisions duties being scrapped on
about 90 percent of total trade between South Africa and the EU
within 12 years.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of South African exports would enter the EU
duty-free within 10 years, while tariffs on 86 percent of the EU's
exports to South Africa would be dropped within 12 years.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which is to be considered by the European Council of
Ministers next Monday, has already been approved in principle by
the South African cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rejects U.S. Report on Lethal Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa dismissed Tuesday as "lacking in seriousness" a U.S. report
about Egypt's attempts to seek lethal weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The report provides a new proof of the double-standard policy
and non-seriousness (of the U.S.)," Moussa told reporters after a
meeting with President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency issued a report last week,
saying that eight countries, including Egypt, are seeking weapons
of mass destruction, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the report failed to mention Israel, which
it said is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons. Israel,
however, has neither confirmed nor denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
"All countries mentioned in this report should deem it
non-serious and pay no heed to it," the Egyptian minister said.
</P>
<P>
"This report does not inherently deal with the weapons of mass
destruction," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The report is aimed at getting all to "accept the presence of
such weapons in a certain country, to which other countries have
to expose themselves," he added.

HARARE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Finance Ministry
said Tuesday that the government will begin to introduce a
computerized financial management system next month to overcome
some of the problems in public finance management.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in its latest bulletin that the new computer
system to be called the Public Financial Management System (PFMS)
will be used to carry out accounting and financial transactions
for all ministries.
</P>
<P>
The new system, consisting of two major components, will
replace the current one being operated by the Central Payments
Office and the Central Computing Services.
</P>
<P>
A situation analysis and a strategy development were contained
in the first stage done last December.
</P>
<P>
The second component involved computerizing all government
public finance management systems down to provincial levels
starting with a pilot phase in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Some of the benefits of the new system would be better control
and management of finances, simplified data gathering, support for
negotiations with international institutions and improved
management of national budget.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) Tuesday accused media and
opposition parties of running a smear campaign against it over its
candidate lists for elections.
</P>
<P>
"The ANC has noted with uttermost disgust, the outrageous
reporting on its candidates lists by certain section of the
media," ANC spokesman Smuts Ngonyama said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The outrage which followed the release of the ANC's lists of
candidates for provincial legislatures and the National Assembly
is an attempt by the opposition and some of our media to portray
the ANC as an organization which has no morals," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The release of the lists Monday sparked an outcry from
opposition parties because of the inclusion of Health Minister
Nkosazana Zuma and ANC Women's League President Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Zuma was the third on the list of candidates for the National
Assembly and Madikizela-Mandela was on the 10th place.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties accused Zuma of corruption and
Madikizela-Mandela of being a criminal.
</P>
<P>
The ANC statement said Zuma was cleared of any wrong doing by
the public prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
It said all candidates on the lists had been selected through a
process which included close scrutiny to ensure that they all
comply with the criteria drawn up by the ANC.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM to Expound Views on Mideast Peace March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss said Tuesday that his coming visit to Egypt will focus on
expounding Beirut's views on Israel's occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arab
radio, Hoss, who is due in Cairo Saturday, said he will also
discuss with Egyptian leaders Lebanon's stance on the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to
allegedly protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
No breakthrough has been yielded since 1991 when the peace
talks began in Madrid, Spain, due to Israel's failure to undertake
an unconditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel offered last year to pull back from south Lebanon if
Beirut guarantees the security of its north.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the offer, insisting that the withdrawal be
unconditional in line with the U.N. Resolution 425 adopted in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Hoss spoke highly of Egypt's privatization policy, underlining
wide prospects for businessmen of both countries to set up joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started economic reforms in 1991 to loosen control over
and privatize state-owned enterprises. In 1995, Egypt decided to
sell 300 state companies. Up to now, more than one third of the
targeted firms have been privatized.
</P>
<P>
The economic reforms have raised the growth rate of the gross
domestic product from 2 percent to over 5 percent and lowered the
inflation rate from 20 percent to less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt and Lebanon are negotiating for a free trade
agreement aimed at enhancing the bilateral trade relations.

<HEADLINE> EU Encourages Women's Participation in Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Wednesday that it has asked European Union (EU) member states to
encourage women to participate in scientific research programs.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc,
intends to arouse the awareness of women to participate in
scientific research activities via a wide debate.
</P>
<P>
It has also decided to establish a threshold of 40 percent for
women who wish to participate in the Marie Curie research
scholarships, and in consultative bodies and evaluation panels of
the Fifth Framework Program (FP5) for Research, Technological
Development and Demonstration (1998-2002).
</P>
<P>
The percentage of women in different disciplines at
universities is 65 percent for the arts and medical studies, 27.6
percent for mathematics and computer sciences, and 18.7 percent
for engineering and architecture.
</P>
<P>
But statistics are almost non-existent at the European Union
level on the participation of women in scientific careers after
graduation.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the commission and the European Parliament have
jointly analyzed the reasons behind the under-representation of
women in research activities and particularly the obstacles
hindering women from participating in scientific activities.
</P>
<P>
The commission expects member states to profit from the Fifth
Framework Program so as to encourage research by, for, and on
women.
</P>
<P>
The focus on socio-economic objectives will enable the
integration of the gender issue within the priorities of the FP5.

<HEADLINE> Ocalan Held in Jail in Maramara Sea: Turkish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit confirmed here on Wednesday that Kurdish rebel leader
Abdulah Ocalan had been sent to a jail on Imrali Island in
Maramara Sea near Turkey's western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit announced Tuesday that Ocalan, leader of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), had been brought back to Turkey
early in the day by a Turkish special task force after nearly
two-decades on the run.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said Ocalan's capture came after a secret, 12-day
operation, which only 10 senor Turkish officials knew about.
</P>
<P>
When Ocalan left the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, on
Monday, the Turkish task force, accompanied by undisclosed foreign
intelligence units, intercepted the car carrying Ocalan and placed
him on a private plane, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The private plane, sent by a Turkish businessman, took Ocalan
to Turkey, the local daily Daily News reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who had been leading the PKK in fighting a war for
independence in southeast Turkey, was ousted by Syria, his
long-time hideout, in November under immense pressure from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
After a brief stay in Russia, Ocalan left for and stayed in
Italy until January.
</P>
<P>
Italy refused to extradite Ocalan to Turkey because he might
face capital punishment there. But neither did Rome render asylum
to him.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, whose whereabouts had been a mystery to the world
since he left Rome in January on an odyssey seeking in vain
political asylum, was seen most recently in the Greek embassy in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Kenya have accused each other of disclosing the
whereabouts of Ocalan to Ankara, but some sources said the Israeli
intelligence agency Mossad was involved in Ocalan's capture.
</P>
<P>
Turkey condemned Ocalan of being responsible for the PKK war
with the Turkish government, which has claimed over 37,000 lives
since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Construction Rises 3.8 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON February 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. construction of new
homes rose 3.8 percent in January to a 12-year high, the Commerce
Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Though weather was icy in the Northeast and Midwest, builders
started construction of houses and apartments at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.80 million, the most since December
1986.
</P>
<P>
For all year of 1998, they started 1.62 million units, an
11-year high, and economists had expected January would mark the
start of a modest decline during 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the conditions that drove homes sales and construction
in 1998 continued into this year because of the low mortgage
rates, plentiful jobs and high stock prices.
</P>
<P>
In January, starts of single-family homes rose 1.2 percent to
an annual rate of 1.39 million, a 15-year high. Starts of
apartments jumped 17.1 percent to a rate of 410,000.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the South more than accounted for the national
gain. Starts there shot up 22.3 percent to a rate of 890,000, the
most in 13 years. They rose 3.7 percent in the West to a rate of
446,000.
</P>
<P>
But they dropped 25.3 percent, the sharpest decline in five
years, to a rate of 316,000 in the Midwest and slipped 3.2 percent
to a rate of 152,000 in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, housing permits -- a barometer of construction
plans -- rose 2.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.78 million, the most since July 1986.

Greece and Kenya have accused each other of disclosing Ocalan's
whereabouts to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The ERNK called on all democratic parties, organizations and
institutions, as well as all democrats, to actively defend the
life of Ocalan by sending "delegations to Turkey, which will
monitor the situation and guarantee the life of Abdullah Ocalan".
</P>
<P>
The ERNK stressed it wants a political solution to the Kurdish
issue, peace in Kurdistan, and human rights and freedom of
expression to be established in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It said the demonstrations and protests were "not directed
against the Greek people," but "against the policy of the Greek
government and especially the policy of Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos and Prime Minister Costas Simitis."
</P>
<P>
Turkey accused Ocalan of being responsible for the 14-year PKK
war for independence in southeast Turkey, which has claimed more
than 37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Chonburi, Thailand's Most Popular Tourism Destination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The eastern province of
Chonburi has become the most popular tourism destination in
Thailand for both domestic and foreign tourists, the Public
Relations Department said in a press release available here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of a poll conducted by the Assumption
University for the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) to find
more information about the nature of tourists and the budget an
average tourist would spend on a trip.
</P>
<P>
The poll divided the tourists into seven groups: government
officials, private sector employees, executives, politicians,
retirees, students and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
All groups except retirees said they mostly frequented the
seaside province of Chonburi and most of them spent 2.3 days for
each trip.
</P>
<P>
Chonburi is where two popular beaches, Bang Saen and Pattaya,
are situated. After Chonburi, the foreign tourists listed the
northern city of Chiang Mai and the southern island of Phuket as
the next destinations they want to visit.
</P>
<P>
The retirees prefer Nong Kai, a northeastern province, as their
favorite destination, saying they visited the province because
they like the nature and the historical sites.
</P>
<P>
For a visit of 2-3 days to a province, 15.9 percent of foreign
tourists spend less than 1,000 baht (27.8 U.S. dollars), about 39
percent spend more than 5,000 baht (138.9 dollars), and the rest
spend between 1,000 to 5,000 baht.
</P>
<P>
Most foreign tourists like Thailand's beaches, the seas, and
the islands most, followed by historical sites, mountains and
forests. The products they buy most are Thai handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 7.79 million foreign tourists came to Thailand for a
visit.

<HEADLINE> Nazarbayev Blasts Terrorist Action in Tashkent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev denounced the terrorists who detonated six car bombs
Tuesday in Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, claiming they "posed a
threat to regional stability and security."
</P>
<P>
Six explosions rocked Tashkent early Tuesday in an obvious
attempt on the life of Uzbek President Islam Karimov.
</P>
<P>
A sudden change of schedule saved Karimov from certain death
following the explosions which went off outside the government
building where he was scheduled to attend a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev called Karimov immediately after being informed of
the explosions and condemned the terrorist action.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev told Karimov that as long as the situation in the
region's surrounding areas remains unstable, "any terrorist
actions will run counter to the people's will and infringe on
regional stability and security."
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh president also stated his belief that no one can
induce the Uzbek people to retreat from marching toward the goal
of stability, democracy and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said that the presidents of Kirghizstan,
Turkmenistan, Russia and Georgia made calls of the same kind to
Karimov Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Uncovers Spy Ring Working for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's anti-Israeli military
group Hezbollah, or Party of God, has uncovered a spy ring
suspected of working for Israel, security sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite resistance group, in collaboration with state
security forces, arrested four members of the spy ring on Monday,
the sources added.
</P>
<P>
A Hezbollah officer spoke on condition of anonymity that the
clique has operated throughout the country under the guise of part
of German humanitarian organizations in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly received orders from the Israeli intelligence
agency Mossad and the security apparatus of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
The officer said one of the group's main tasks was to collect
information on Hezbollah's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah as
well as on other senior resistance officers.
</P>
<P>
Another task, he added, was to plant explosives in resistance
locations including those of Hezbollah and other groups.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been leading a guerrilla war
trying to oust Israeli occupying forces and its ally SLA out of
south Lebanon where Israel set up a self-declared security zone to
allegely protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas' attacks.
</P>
<P>
The group was uncovered three days after another spy ring was
smashed by Lebanese army intelligence. A total of 20 members of
the ring suspected of working for Israel were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Lebanon's Military Tribunal handed down prison
sentences to 75 people who were convicted of collaborating with
the Jewish state.

LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- In the first case of its kind
in Britain, two companies producing genetically-modified (GM) food
were fined Wednesday 31,000 pounds (51,000 U.S. dollars) for
breaching environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-based chemical giant Monsanto and the British company
Perryfields pleaded guilty to failing to stop the release of
pollen from GM crops into the environment before magistrates at
Caistor in Lincolnshire, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
They were charged with contravening the Environment Protection
Act by Britain's Health and Safety Executive.
</P>
<P>
Monsanto was fined 17,000 pounds and its British codefendant 14,
000 pounds, the BBC said.
</P>
<P>
The Health and Safety Executive brought the prosecution after a
routine inspection of an experimental field of oil-seed rape last
summer.
</P>
<P>
Investigators claimed they found a barrier to stop the transfer
of GM pollen from herbicide-tolerant oilseed rape to neighboring
crops of un-modified oilseed had been partially removed before
flowering.

MOGADISHU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- There are alarming reports
of famine in Bay and Bakol regions in south Somalia despite food
relief efforts by international aid agencies to thousands of
families in the area.
</P>
<P>
Six people have died in Gumarrey village just outside the
district of Tieglow of Bakol region in the past three days.
</P>
<P>
According to local authorities, the famine is especially severe
in 11 villages near Tieglow and Huddor of Bakol region controlled
by the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA). Thousands of people in
the countryside who lost the remaining of their livestock to the
drought, famine and lack of water are gathering in the main towns
and villages in search of food and water,
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Hussein Issak, the RRA representative in Tieglow town,
said the children and pregnant women are those who are dying due
to famine. The worst hit areas, he said, include Biyoley where an
Islamic group resides. Signs of mal-nourishment is common among
people who have developed inflated legs and abdomen because of
starvation.
</P>
<P>
In response to the famine, a food aid convoy consisting of 42
trucks Tuesday reached more than 15 villages and towns in Bakol
region. The convoy transporting 570 metric tons of maize and
porridge is aimed at saving more than 11,400 families who are
scattered in the villages between Huddor and Tieglow of Bakol
region. The relief aid also included 27 metric tons of protein
rich unimax from United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as a

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Rules Out Amendment of Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai said Wednesday that his government would not support any
attempt to amend the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
His stance is similar to that of House Speaker Wan Muhammad Nur
Matha, who expressed his disagreement to early changes to the
Constitution also on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The House speaker said the Constitution, which is just over a
year old, should be fully implemented for some time so that flaws
and problems emerge. Amendments should then be done to properly
correct the flaws.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan said it was not the right time to amend
the Constitution although he agreed it was far from perfect.
</P>
<P>
Charter amendment was raised at a recent Cabinet meeting, with
some ministers expressing concern over some problematic points.
</P>
<P>
However, Chuan cautioned that there should be no overly concern
over the matter and that time was needed to learn about possible
flaws in the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Three Shot Dead Outside Israeli Consulate in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Three people were shod dead
Wednesday outside the Israeli consulate in Berlin when Israeli
security guards opened fire to prevent Kurds from storming the
building, police here said.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 others were wounded in the shootout involving Kurds,
which occurred a day after the capture by Turkey of the Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Police said they did not open fire and reinforcements were
rushed in to the area.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, Uwe-Karsten, the German government spokesman,
described the shooting incident as "shocking" and appealed for
calm by all sides in the Kurdish conflict.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Israeli diplomatic missions around the world
have been placed on alert for possible attacks.
</P>
<P>
The move came after a news report claimed that Israel's
intelligence agency helped Turkey track down Ocalan, which Israel
has vehemently denied.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was handed over to Kenyan authorities by the Greek
embassy in Nairobi overnight Tuesday and in an undercover
operation Turkey took the Kurdish rebel leader back home where he
is going to stand trial on charges of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The operation ignited wide-spread protests by the Kurds
throughout Europe from London to Moscow in a show of support for
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Greek diplomatic missions across Europe were stormed and
occupied by angry Kurds, who also held Greek ambassadors and other
diplomats in Vienna and the Hague.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Chinese Celebrate Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Victims of last summer's
flooding in east China's Anhui Province moved into new houses and
many laid-off workers in the northern port city of Tianjin opted
to offer services along the city's streets in advance of the Lunar
New Year.
</P>
<P>
Some 260,000 people from 61,000 Anhui households have been
resettled in new villages and towns, with the former figure
accounting for 81.5 percent of the total number of people involved
in the government resettlement plan.
</P>
<P>
Many of Tianjin's unemployed workers cleaned public telephone
booths, or otherwise established street ventures to offer sewing
services, as well as bag and shoe repair.
</P>
<P>
"The Lunar New Year holiday provides a good opportunity to make
money," said one couple who opened a stand selling home-made
sausages.
</P>
<P>
Much needed precipitation in the form of heavy snow fell in
drought-stricken northwest China today. Residents in Lanzhou,
capital of Gansu Province, flew kites in spite of snow which
hopefully marked the last drought period this winter, while
soldiers in neighboring Shaanxi Province were drenched with sweat
while cleaning the moat around the ancient city wall in Xi'an.
People in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
decorated the city's street with colorful flags and balloons.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei
Province, decided to celebrate the traditional holiday by visiting
in restaurants instead of preparing meals at home. Still others
visited other parts of the country, or sent New Year's greeting to
their friends and relatives via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Farmers who lost their homes last year's during summer flooding
in central China's Hunan Province put up portraits of Mao Zedong
in temporary abodes.
</P>
<P>
"We always prayed to Buddha during past Lunar New Year
festivities, but the Buddha failed to bless us during last summer'
s floods. The Communist Party of China, in fact, helped us
overcome difficulties. Therefore, we thanked the Party and
government and refrained from calling on the Buddha for a happy
New Year," according to Pan Wenfang, an elderly farmer in Lixian
county.
</P>
<P>
"It's a pity that we could not find portraits of Deng Xiaoping
and President Jiang Zemin in the county seat," said Pan.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Corporate Tax to Be Cut Down by 5 pc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The corporate tax rate will be cut from 35 percent to 30
percent. This means that the government will take 2.5 billion Rand
(one U.S. Dollar equals to about six Rand) less in tax from
businesses in the 1999/2000 financial year, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said the government believed that the move would make
South Africa significantly more attractive to both foreign and
domestic investors, and result in significant cash flow benefits
for small companies.
</P>
<P>
He also announced a 4.5-billion-Rand tax relief package for
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Tax brackets were restructured, tax rates reduced, and the
primary tax rebate increased from 3,515 Rand to 3,710 Rand. The
secondary rebate for individuals over the age of 65 was increased
from 2,660 Rand to 2,775 Rand.
</P>
<P>
Anyone younger than 65, earning 19,526 Rand or less in a year,
will pay no income tax, and people older than 65 will pay no tax
if they earn 33,717 Rand or less.
</P>
<P>
Over half the tax relief package was for individuals earning
less than 70,000 Rand a year, although all taxpayers would
benefit, Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to fund part of the tax relief by making
its revenue collection more effective and efficient. It has
budgeted for the South Africa Revenue Services to collect an extra
2.7 billion Rand in 1999/ 2000.
</P>
<P>
Excise duty on cigarettes was raised by 41 cents a pack of 20,
and tax on pipe tobacco by 1.56 Rand per 100 gram. Cigar smokers
will pay 7.33 Rand more per 23 gram.
</P>
<P>
The government expects to reap an additional 494 million Rand
from these measures.
</P>
<P>
Beer drinkers will pay 1.6 cents more excise duty on a 340ml
can, while a 750ml bottle of spirits will go up by 56.6 cents.
</P>
<P>
Unfortified wine will cost 2.5 cents more a bottle, while
excise duties on soft drinks were cut by 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
The petrol levy was upped by four cents a liter, but there was
no tax increase on diesel.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said this was expected to yield 472 million Rand.
</P>
<P>
Transfer duties on property were reduced to encourage home
ownership, especially among lower-income earners.
</P>
<P>
Projected expenditure for 1999/2000 was 216.8 billion Rand and
revenue 191.7 billion Rand, leaving a deficit of 25.1 billion
Rand, or 3.5 percent of GDP. The deficit was in line with the
target set by the government in November last year.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to borrow 21.1 billion Rand this year and
its interest bill is budgeted at 48.2 billion Rand.
</P>
<P>
The projected economic growth rate for 1999/2000 has been
reduced from two percent to 1.8 percent. Growth is expected to
rise to 3.2 percent and 3.8 percent in the following two years.
</P>
<P>
Manuel estimated that GDP grew by 0.1 percent in 1998.

MADRID, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Spanish pole vaulter Dana
Cervantes was tested positive in August for the banned steroid
nandrolone, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF)
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard tested positive at the European Championships in

</P>
<P>
A source close to the Spanish federation said that there were a

</P>
<P>
Cervantes took the test at her own request after she was not
randomly selected in the qualifying rounds of the championship
where she set a Spanish national record and eventually finished 11
th in the finals.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Spanish federation) asked us to respect the athlete'
s confidentiality in this case, which would have been broken if we
published her name, although we have been assured by the Spanish
federation that she will not compete until the case is clarified,"
the IAAF spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
If Cervantes' positive test is confirmed, she could be banned
from the sport for two years.

GENEVA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The 30 Kurdish demonstrators
left the building of the Geneva-based United Nations High

<HEADLINE> Gore Arrives S. Africa for Bi-National Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- United States
Vice-President Al Gore arrived in Cape Town Wednesday morning for
a two-day session of the U. S.-South African bi-national
commission which will focus on job creation.
</P>
<P>
Anti-crime cooperation will also be discussed at Thursday's
gathering chaired by Gore and South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Already in South Africa are U.S. Attorney-General Janet Reno,
Commerce Secretary William Daley, Agriculture Secretary Daniel
Glickman and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who had held talks
with their South African counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The session is expected to end with the signing of a trade and
investment framework agreement, hammered out during long,
intensive behind- the-scene talks and which the United States
hopes will result in a full- blown free trade pact.
</P>
<P>
The accord will create a mechanism for managing trade disputes,
 including Washington's complaint that Pretoria is violating its
pharmaceutical patent rights, and Pretoria's concerns that its
steel industry is being unfairly targeted by U.S. anti-dumping
actions.
</P>
<P>
Gore will pay a courtesy call on Mandela at his Cape Town
residence later Wednesday.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Wednesday lost 8.26 points to 3,336.42
as against Tuesday's close of 3,344.68.
</P>
<P>
The national index also ended lower at 1,477.59 from the
previous close of 1,478.42.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 and U.S. dollar index, however, were quoted
marginally higher at 342.23 and 134.10 from Tuesday's close of
341.68 and 133.88 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Equities on the BSE Wednesday closed marginally lower in
volatile two-way trading on alternate bouts of buying and selling.
Initially, the market started on a steady note, but later prices
declined on selling pressure due to the decision of the Indian
National Lok Dal, one of the ruling BJP allies, to withdraw
outside support to the BJP-led government at the Center.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Introduces New Intelligence Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Wednesday introduced Ali Yunesi as new Intelligence
Minister to the Majlis (parliament) for approval.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi was named minister of intelligence on February 10, a day
after Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi resigned under mounting pressure
for some agents' involvement in political killings, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Darius Forouhar, leader of the opposition Iran
Nation Party, and his wife were stabbed to death and at least
three dissident writers were found dead after their mysterious
missing.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi, born in 1955 in the city of Nahavand in the western
province of Hamadan, led the investigation into the series of
killings.
</P>
<P>
His probe resulted in the Intelligence Ministry's disclosure on
January 5 some of its agents had been arrested in connection with
the five deaths.
</P>
<P>
The involvement admission by the conservative-controlled
Intelligence Ministry intensified rivalry between the hard-liners
and the moderates.
</P>
<P>
Pro-Khatami moderate groups voiced strong calls for
Najafabadi's resignation and a fundamental change in the country's
intelligence and security systems.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives also launched counterattacks by
claiming that some of Khatami's sworn supporters were behind the
political murders.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi once served in the Palestinian and Lebanese guerrilla
camps before the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
After the revolution, he has served as head of Tehran's branch
of the revolutionary court, head of second branch of army's
revolutionary court, head of army revolutionary court, public
prosecutor of Tehran from 1988-91 and head of the judicial
organization of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The parliament, according to its regulations, will discuss
whether to grant a vote of confidence to Yunesi within one week
after the introduction.
</P>
<P>
Local observers see Yunesi's appointment as a success for
Khatami to take over one of the most important organs of the
country controlled by the conservatives allegedly headed by the
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
However, some political analysts pointed out that the debate in
the parliament over Yunesi's appointment will be intense as the
conservatives enjoy a relative majority.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Australian PM's Forthcoming Trip to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard is expected to arrive in New Zealand on Saturday to
pay a three-day visit to the country as guest of Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, prime ministers of the two countries have met
annually. Last year, Shipley went to Australia to meet Howard for
the first time as prime minister, and they placed the issue of New
Zealand's future defense spending at the forefront of their
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Howard's forthcoming visit to New Zealand,
officials of the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade
said at Monday's press briefing that the two prime ministers have
"no formal agenda for their three-day meeting" and will instead
discuss issues as they arise.
</P>
<P>
It seems that Howard's New Zealand trip is a
relationship-building exercise rather than an attempt to thrash
out any bilateral problems. It will be a routine visit.
</P>
<P>
But New Zealand always views its relationship with Australia as
its most significant bilateral link. The New Zealand-Australian
relationship, also known as transtasman relationship, is
underpinned by geographical proximity, historical linkages,
shared outlook, similar social structures and an extensive
overlap in economic and security interests. That is why New
Zealand always values the visit of a prime minister from
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Howard will start his New Zealand trip from Queenstown on South
Island. Shipley is expected to go down to the city to greet her
guest.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the two prime ministers will spend their
first one and a half days there, holding private meetings and
visiting tourist sites before they head to Wellington where the
Australian prime minister will meet the New Zealand Cabinet on
Monday and attend a meeting with business leaders.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen Ninety-nine is New Zealand's term to chair the series
of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings. The informal
meeting of the APEC leaders will be held in September in Auckland,
the biggest city of New Zealand. It is said that APEC will be one
of the most important topics in discussions between Shipley and
Howard. During the APEC meeting in Kuala Lumpur last year, Howard
made it clear to Shipley that Australia considers it has
considerable strategic interest in New Zealand hosting a
progressive meeting in Auckland. Howard is keen that Australia
will join New Zealand in maximizing potential trade and tourism
synergy between the APEC meeting, the America's Cup and the
Sydney 2000 Olympics and in showcasing both countries through
media exposure.
</P>
<P>
It is also said that since 1999 is an election year for New
Zealand,  Shipley will be keen to learn from the strategy Prime
Minister Howard used last year to come from behind in the polls
and regain office while campaigning on a package of tax reforms,
including a new goods and services tax.
</P>
<P>
Australia is both New Zealand's largest bilateral export
destination and its largest bilateral source of imports, and has
been so throughout the 1990s. Since the two countries signed
Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement in 1983, bilateral
trade has increased by over 275 percent and it stood at 9.84
billion New Zealand dollars (5.4 billion U.S. dollars) last year.
Doubtless, Shipley and Howard will talk about strengthening
bilateral trade relations in generalities. As for the lifting of
further barriers against New Zealand fruit and other goods, "this
is at a Minister-to-Minister level and rarely involves direct
prime ministerial involvement," said an official with the New
Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Howard will not hide Australia's
disappointment at New Zealand backing off buying a third Anzac
frigate from the country. It is known to all that Prime Minister
Shipley and the New Zealand Ministry of Defense favor to buy it,
but their thought would not be accepted by majority of the MPs.
They know clearly that the current National-led minority
government would be endangered if they insisted on buying the
frigate. The two prime ministers will certainly touch the problem
during their talks. Howard is expected to show his understanding
of and sympathy with the difficult situation Shipley is facing on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Trade, the two prime ministers will also discuss
international issues such as Indonesia, East Timor, Papua New
Guinea, Bougainville and the United States trade commission ruling
that Australian and New Zealand lamb imports unfairly compete with
domestic sales.
</P>
<P>
In a word, the two prime ministers will discuss a wide range of
 topics during their three-day meeting. Howard's forthcoming New
Zealand trip will certainly help promote mutual understanding and
forge a stronger relationship between the two great powers in
South Pacific. It will be a visit of importance to the two
countries as well as to the whole South Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Closes All Embassies Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIRBOI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government
Wednesday ordered the closure of all its 34 embassies around the
world to avoid any further attacks by Kurdish protesters
following the Turkish government's capture of Abdullah O'calan,
leader of the Turkistan Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacob Chumba said that none of his
country's embassies worldwide would open and they would remain
closed until the security situation is improved.
</P>
<P>
O'calan sneaked into Kenya on February 2 with the assistance of
Greek Ambassador George Costorlas and left the country on
February 15 under the strong demand of the Kenyan government .
Ocalan is now under Turkish custody.
</P>
<P>
It is learned here that pro-Kurdish activists stormed Kenyan
embassies in Vienna, , Bonn, Paris Tuesday, mistaking Kenya for
having a role in making the rebel Kurdish leader captured by the
Turkish authorities.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Protest Might End Soon in London, Kurdish Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The dozens of Kurds who are
occupying the Greek embassy in London could end their protest soon,
a Kurdish spokesman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that the protest will soon end," the spokesman
for the Kurdish information center in London told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the 88 Kurds inside the mission are seeking assurances
from police that they would not be arrested for storming the
building early on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tens of Kurds are still in the Greek embassy in London,
protesting against the arrest of the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a police officer who was called to the site in west
London to negotiate with the Kurds inside the mission said the
talks were "going on well."
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was the most wanted man in Turkey for leading a
separatist war in southeast Turkey. He had earlier taken refuge in
the Greek embassy in Nairobi but was later arrested and
repatriated to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
His capture led to unrest in several European countries where
Kurds forced their way into Greek or UN missions to protest Greece'
s role in the affair.
</P>
<P>
The protest in London began Monday night after Ocalan was
handed over to authorities in Kenya, reportedly by the Greek
embassy in Nairobi that had been shielding him.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 Kurds stormed the Greek mission at about 3 a.m. Tuesday
GMT and threatened to set fire on themselves unless their leader
was released.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, a 15-year-old Kurdish girl from north London
doused herself with petrol and ran into a crowd of about 500 Kurds
outside the embassy with her clothes alight. Police struggled with
her before using their coats to extinguish the flames. The girl
was taken to hospital with several burns.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Planes Bomb Harsele Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said Wednesday
that its air force bombed Harsele for the second time Tuesday
night, inflicting heavy damage on Eritrean positions.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Ethiopian Government Spokesperson Selome Taddesse
said here that "at 10:45 p.m. last night, Ethiopia fighter planes
bombed Harsele, some 20 kilometers west of Assab which serves as a
logistical support center for the Eritrean army."
</P>
<P>
The office said the planes targeted the center because found at
it were heavy artillery, armored vehicles, military rations and
military personnel.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian defense force utilized MIG-23 fighter planes to
bomb Harsele at 1:45 p.m. Tuesday for the first time, destroying
weapons and munitions, heavy artillery, armored vehicles, military
rations and a water reservoir at the support center, according to
an earlier announcement made by the Office Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea resumed on February 6,
1999 on Badme front, before spreading to a second front around the
towns of Tsorona and Zalambessa. Ethiopia accused Eritrean planes
of first bombing Adi Grat, but Asmara said it was an excuse
fabricated by Addis Ababa for launching the offensive.
</P>
<P>
Addis is angry that Asmara refused to implement a peace pact
offered by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and this time
uses planes to attack Eritrean targets despite warnings by the OAU
and international community.
</P>
<P>
The OAU and the United Nations Security Council urged an
immediate cease- fire last week.

<HEADLINE> India's Coral Reefs Dying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Bleaching and death of coral
reefs has been noticed in Indian waters on Andaman and Lakshadweep
islands, said a report in the latest issue of journal Current
Science.
</P>
<P>
In Goa state along the west coast there has been a large number
of deaths of corals due to the black band disease caused by a
bacterium and white band disease whose cause is not yet known, the
report quoted the study by National Institute of Oceanography
(NIO) as saying here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Coral death was also caused by large-scale silt deposition in
the inter-tidal zone of reefs, which buried the coral colonies.
</P>
<P>
Scientists observed a severe incidence of coral bleaching in
July 1998 in some reefs in the Andamans. While more than 85
percent of coral reefs near Ross Island and Marina Park exhibited
partial bleaching, up to 10 percent were totally bleached, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
NIO scientists suggest that the country go in for international
reef monitoring programs to evolve strategies to protect the
endangered reefs.
</P>
<P>
Bleaching and death of coral reefs has caused alarm among
ecologists the world over.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and India Wednesday
formally signed a five-year agreement for the proposed commercial
bus service from New Delhi to Pakistan's second biggest city of
Lahore.
</P>
<P>
This is the first road passenger transit facility to facilitate
land travel between the two countries since their inception in
1947.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Secretary of Communication Akram Sheikh and Indian
High Commissioner to Pakistan G. Parthasarthy inked the agreement
in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The bus service will supplement the biweekly train service
between Attari in the Indian state of Punjab and Lahore.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee is coming to Lahore
in the inaugural bus service on February 20 on a short visit to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a Pakistani bus will drop passengers at
New Delhi with three stops on the Indian side at Pipli, Sirhind
and Kartarpur. The bus will cross the international border at
Wahga, about 22 kilometers east of Lahore.
</P>
<P>
The 494-kilometer journey takes about 13 hours. Two security
personnel and a liaison officer from the two sides will travel in
the bus.
</P>
<P>
The service will be available four days in a week -- Tuesday,
Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, in his meeting with
Vajpayee in New York last September, had shown interest in the
project on humanitarian grounds to facilitate members of the
divided families to easily visit their relatives.
</P>
<P>
The step is part of the confidence-building measures mounted
last year between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Alhaji Abubakar Atiku and Alhaji
Umaru Shinkafi have been chosen as running mates respectively to
the presidential candidates of the People's Democratic Party (PDP)
and the alliance between the All People's Party (APP) and the
Alliance for Democracy (AD).
</P>
<P>
Atiku was chosen from among six contenders for running mate of
APP presidential candidate General Olusegun Obasanjo Tuesday in
capital Abuja at a meeting which started Monday and lasted till
Tuesday evening, This Day newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The PDP running mate is a founding member of the People's
Democratic Movement which later merged with other associations to
form the PDP.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that with the Obasanjo and Atiku ticket, the PDP
has now given the presidency to the Southwest and the Northeast,
thereby leaving other zones of the country to seek the other key
legislative posts like president of the Senate and speaker of the
House of Representatives, and their deputies.
</P>
<P>
Shinkafi was endorsed at a closed-door meeting in capital Abuja
as running mate to Chief Olu Falae, joint presidential candidate
of the AD and the APP on the platform of the APP.
</P>
<P>
However, the original APP presidential candidate Ogbonnaya Onu
issued a statement Tuesday, denying the allegation that he stepped
down for AD presidential candidate Falae.
</P>
<P>
He said that "I remain the duly elected presidential candidate
of the All People's Party and will never surrender a mandate given
to me by the party convention."
</P>
<P>
But, APP National Chairman Senator Mahmoud Waziri said that the
decision of the party affecting the alliance with AD "is final and
binding on all the presidential aspirants of the APP".
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the party convention in Kaduna, northern
Nigeria, that ratified Onu's candidacy of the party, was the same
organ that empowered the National Executive Committee of the APP
to implement a logical conclusion, the alliance agreement with the
AD.

<HEADLINE> Kurds Keep Up Protest in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) - Dozens of Kurds are still
occupying the Greek embassy in London Wednesday in protest against
the arrest of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
In the early morning, police who were called to the site in
west London said they were still negotiating with the Kurds inside
the mission. A police officer said the talks were "going on well".
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to get people out of the embassy and end it
peacefully," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was the most wanted man in Turkey for leading a
separatist war in southeast Turkey. He had earlier taken refuge in
the Greek embassy in Nairobi but was later arrested and
repatriated to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Kurds forced their way into Greek missions in
several other European countries in protest against Athens' role
in Ocalan's arrest.
</P>
<P>
The protest in London began Monday night after Ocalan was
handed over to authorities in Kenya, reportedly by the Greek
embassy in Nairobi that had been shielding him.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 Kurds stormed into the Greek mission at about 3 a.m.
Tuesday GMT and threatened to set fire on themselves unless their
leader was released.
</P>
<P>
"We came here not to get out alive. We are prepared to do
everything until our conditions are met," a spokesman for the
protesters told reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of Kurds kept an all-night vigil outside
the locked five-storey building, braving the night's bitter cold.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, a 15-year-old Kurdish girl from north London
doused herself with petrol and ran into a crowd of about 500 Kurds
outside the embassy with her clothes alight. Police struggled with
her before using their coats to extinguish the flames. The girl
was taken to hospital with several burns.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds inside the embassy are holding a Greek caretaker but
police said he was in good health and being well treated.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Supreme Court Holds Military Courts Unconstitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Supreme Court
Wednesday in a unanimous decision held the establishment of
military courts as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
A nine-member bench headed by Chief Justice of the apex court
Ajmal Mian in an order declared that Ordinance 12 of 1998, which
allows the establishment of military courts and the trial of
offenses provided for in Section 6 of the said ordinance, is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The court directed that all the pending cases with the military
courts may be transferred to anti-terrorists courts in existence
or to be established later under the law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court provided ten guidelines for the
expeditious disposal of cases of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On January 30, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced
that military courts will be set up all over the country to
ensure prompt trial of terrorists and to give them deterrent
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Addressing party workers of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League
in the Punjab provincial capital of Lahore, Sharif said military
courts to be set up under Article 245 of the Pakistani
Constitution will start functioning soon across the country to
deal with criminals with an iron hand.
</P>
<P>
He said this decision was taken in view of the positive results
yielded by the imposition of the governor rule and the
establishment of military trial courts last November in Karachi,
capital of Sindh province.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of setting up the military courts was to award
exemplary punishments to hardened criminals involved in gang rape,
terrorism and sectarianism, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the governor rule and award of deterrent
punishments to terrorists, dacoits, murderers and criminals
involved in gang rape through the establishment of military courts
in Karachi helped a lot in stopping strikes, eliminating extortion
and reducing overall crime including acts of terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Promises to Withdraw Troops from S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- People's Democratic Party (PDP)
presidential candidate General Olusegun Obasanjo has promised to
withdraw Nigerian troops from Sierra Leone if elected later this
month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a meeting with labor leaders in capital Abuja
on Tuesday, he described Nigeria's involvement in Sierra Leone and
neighboring Liberia, where it still maintains a token
peace-keeping force, as a "waste of resources".
</P>
<P>
"I wonder what we are doing in Sierra Leone and Liberia when
Nigeria is peaceful and, after all, the nation's wealth is being
wasted," noted Obasanjo who was elected on Monday as PDP
presidential candidate for the February 27 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "the amount we are wasting in peace-keeping
in another country is enough to provide infrastructure in this
country."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria makes up the bulk of the 15,000 troops of the west
African peace- keeping force of ECOMOG in Sierra Leone and is said
to be spending one million U.S. Dollars a day on its military
operations in the country, an estimated five percent of its export
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's rival Chief Olu Falae, joint presidential candidate
of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) and the All People's Party
(APP), had earlier this month said he would pull the troops out of
the war-ravaged nation within a year.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar stated last
month he hoped peace would be restored in Sierra Leone so that
troops could be withdrawn in time for the Nigeria's transition
from military to civilian rule on May 29.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Obasanjo said his administration would tackle
corruption headlong as he would put in place an anti-corruption
agency which would be charged with the responsibility of "seeking,
searching and recovering stolen wealth from corrupt government
officials both within and outside the country."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the anti-corruption agency which would be
fashioned after the South African model would be fine-tuned to
deal with the country's peculiar situation.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo blamed corruption in the most populous African country
on " leadership, general atmosphere of morality in the country, as
well as the issue of payment of a living wage to workers."

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposes NATO Military Presence in Kosovo, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian defense official
said Wednesday that NATO plans for military intervention in Kosovo
will dismiss more peaceful options for a solution.
</P>
<P>
General Leonid Ivashov, head of the Russian Defense Ministry's
Main Department for International Military Cooperation, said NATO'
s plans to send a military contingent to the Yugoslav province "is
the rudest and simplest way of resolving the conflict," Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
"One of the main goals set by NATO leadership is to replace the
main European security institutions with NATO agencies," he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's initiative to use force in Kosovo, he said, was made on
the eve of NATO's 50th anniversary as a way of "demonstrating its
leading role in maintaining European stability."
</P>
<P>
Ivashov said speculations about a possible operation in Kosovo
"are nothing but attempts to put pressure on Belgrade and
encourage separatism."
</P>
<P>
He echoed the Russian Foreign Ministry's stance that it is
premature to talk about an operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"How can one talk about a military operation if the mission of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has not
been fully deployed in the region and has not started efficient
work," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Political, diplomatic and economic settlement measures have
not been tapped yet. The conflicting parties are capable of
reaching an agreement on how to settle this conflict and of
creating mechanisms of control over the peaceful implementation of
these agreements," Ivashov said.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Federation Council
Wednesday ratified the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and
Partnership with Ukraine by a vote of 106-25 with 17 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The pact cleared the upper house of parliament with an
amendment proposed by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov that it will
go into effect after Ukrainian parliament ratifies three
agreements on the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on March 31, 1997, was ratified
by Russia's State Duma, or lower house of parliament, on December
25, 1998, by a vote of 243-20 with four abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The Federation Council debated the pact on January 27 but
concerns over the future of the Crimean peninsula and the Black
Sea port of Sevastopol forced speaker Yegor Stroyev to postpone
the ratification until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three accords, signed by the Ukrainian and Russian prime
ministers on May 28, 1997, set the terms for basing Russian ships
in Ukraine's Sevastopol port for 20 years. Under the accords,
Russia should pay Ukraine 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian parliament approved the treaty without mentioning
the Black Sea Fleet accords on January 14, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt to Combat Tax Evaders: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The proposed law requiring all
citizens to file their statement of assets and liabilities (SAL)
would bolster the efforts of the Philippine government in
prosecuting tax evaders, a senior government official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said in a radio interview that
this measure, aside from raising funds for the government's
pro-poor programs, is an offensive against tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The tax evasion is a big problem that the government has to
address decisively, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Philippine President Joseph Estrada asked
Congress to approve immediately a measure requiring all citizens
to file their SALs.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the proposed law would broaden the tax base and
enable the government to collect correct taxes, which it needs to
fund programs designed to fight poverty.
</P>
<P>
At present, only government officials and employees are
required to file their SALs every year.

"We are going to look further into Israel because we know that
Ericsson and Israel can work together in a deeper way than we are
doing today," he said.
</P>
<P>
Andersson said that Ericsson, which saw a turnover of 24
billion U.S. dollars in 1998, was interested in Israeli
engineering talent.

"We need talented people. It is one of our biggest problems at
the moment. There are lots of talented people in Israel," he said.

<P>
Meanwhile, Andersson noted that Ericsson is undergoing a
restructuring program to integrate the telecommunications,
computing and the media industry into one general area.
</P>
<P>
He said that there will be strong emphasis on date
communications, an area in which Israel is particularly strong.

JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post,
</P>
<P>
-- A member of Israel's Knesset (parliament) Tuesday accused
the opposition Labor Party Leader Ehud Barak of racism. Adisu
Massala, who presents Ethiopian Jews in the country, said that
the Ethiopian constituency of the Labor Party had been abandoned
by Barak "in a racist manner."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz,
</P>
<P>
-- Israel Tuesday denied any involvement in the arrest of
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, an event that touched off
an unprecedented series of Kurdish protests around Europe. "Israel
wants to announce in the most clear-cut manner possible that
it was not involved in any way in this matter," a statement
issued by Israeli Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot,
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- With the arrest of Ocalan, the choice is simple for the
Turkish government: either it considers that it has won the war
and will have to continue it, or it engages itself in a radical
decentralization of the Kurdish region. The United States, which
played a heavy role in the arrest of Ocalan, will play a
determining role in the Kurdish problem of Turkey. The Europeans,
while urging Ankara to carry out a just and balanced trial of
Ocalan, should convince Turkey that the end of a barbarous
conflict will not come in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- After arresting Ocalan, Ankara should now act. It should
first judge Ocalan with all the guarantees proper to him to prove
that Turkey is a state of law. This is an indispensable
precondition for all the solution to the Kurdish question. The
trial of Ocalan will allow Ankara to make a breakthrough in
finding a solution to Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
L'Humanite:
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish regime thinks that it can, by beheading an armed
organization, take advantage of the occasion to destroy definitely
by force the aspiration of the Kurdish people to its dignity. If
the European governments follow the strategy of the Turkey, the
Kurdish question, with all the risks of explosion, will become a
European problem. This is the reason to impose to Ankara a
political solution.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde:
</P>
<P>
-- Several dozen Kurdish expatriates entered by force the Greek
consulate in Marseilles and threatened to put themselves on fire
to protest the delivery by Greece of PKK chief Ocalan to Turkey.

</P>
<P>
The affected goods are cooking oil, bath and washing soap,
margarine, confectioneries, tyres, batteries and many others.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Sets up Rare-Plant Nature Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 17 Xinhua -- China has set up a nature
reserve for rare plants on the verge of extinction in the
Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture of Dai nationality in
southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The reserve encompasses 90 hectares some 76 kilometers
southeast of the city of Jinghong, capital of the prefecture. The
reserve is nestled in a tropical rain forest at an elevation of
570 meters, and houses a European hornbeam, the only one in China,
Yunnan pellacalyx, an ancient plant native to the Mediterranean,
and the country's tallest tree, an 80-meter-high shorea
wangtiansuensis.
</P>
<P>
Other rare species include alsophila spinuiosa, golden peony
and dracaena.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zaifu, director of the botanical garden committee of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, said, "This is the first rare plant
reserve in China, with a collection of 110 species on the top of
the state protection list and accounting for one-third of the
country's total, and more will soon be planted here."
</P>
<P>
"It is of vital importance to build this reserve because it can
help botanists determine threats to these rare plants, and is a
good way to practice plant migration," he added.
</P>
<P>
Plant migration, a new concept raised a couple of years ago,
has become an important component in protecting living things, and
refers to transplanting species to places other than their native
habitats.
</P>
<P>
China has 23,000 high-grade plants, half of which thrive in
Yunnan, known as the "kingdom of plants." Xishuangbanna has 5,000
species and provides exceptional advantages for studying tropical
plants.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Declare War on Bad Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is planning to take
measures to reduce growing traffic congestion and accidents on the
country's highways and byways, the Daily Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with officials at Ministry of Public Works
and Transport and a team of transport experts, Lebanese Interior
Minister Michel Murr presented a series of practical and quick
solutions Tuesday to remedy the nation's motoring woes.
</P>
<P>
"We might consider limiting motorcycles' and mopeds' speed and
the hours during which they can drive. But most probably the
final decision would be to completely ban them from the road
together," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a month, traffic radar will be installed along the country's
major highways to monitor speeding motorists, with the first being
along Beirut's southern and northern entrances.
</P>
<P>
"Radar is used in all developed countries and we will use it
too," Murr said, adding that traffic patrols will be increased
fivefold to catch speeders.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested to equip police with electronic alcohol
detectors to breath-test drivers suspected of having been
drinking.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the police ask drivers to walk in a straight line
and touch their nose with the index finger of both hands.
</P>
<P>
Murr reminded motorists that using cellular phones in driving
will incur a fine of 50,000-120,000 pounds (about 33-82 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Interior Ministry's statistics, Lebanon, with a
population of about 3.5 million, has 1.3 million cars.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 343 people were killed and 3,424 injured in 2,333
accidents, down from the year before when 452 people died and
4,140 were injured in 2,930 accidents.

<HEADLINE> Lupus Victim Recovers After Bone Marrow Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A 29-year-old woman in east
China's Jiangsu Province has recovered from systemic lupus
following the successful transplantation of her own bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
The sixth operation of its kind performed worldwide follows
five previous successful transplantation procedures in Italy and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Systemic lupus is a chronic skin disease characterized by red,
scaly patches which most often cause scarring. The disease
sometimes affects connective tissues and involves the kidneys,
spleen and other internal organs. Lupus was previously considered
to be an incurable disease.
</P>
<P>
The patient contracted lupus some eight years ago. Surgeons at
the Gulou Hospital in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province,
carried out the successful transplantation procedure on October 30
last year. Doctors treated bone marrow extracted from the patient
with chemotherapy prior to completing the transplantation
procedure, gradually restored her immune system.
</P>
<P>
The procedure gradually restored the patient's immune system,
with the woman taking a noticeable turn for the better in a short
two weeks. The transplant resulted in a complete recovery and the
patient was discharged from the hospital on December 18.

<HEADLINE> AIDS-related Child Death Rising in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children
Education Fund (UNICEF) has said that the HIV/AIDS pandemic has
started reversing the gains made on child survival and
development in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF's Kenya representative Chrispin Wilson said Tuesday the
demographic and health surveys of 1998 show that infant morality
rate has gone up by 20 percent in the last five years, the same
point as that in 1969.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of care, nurture, health and psycho-social
development of the child cannot be discussed unless the HIV/AIDS
pandemic is addressed," the Kenya Times newspaper Wednesday quoted
Wilson as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 1.5 million Kenyans currently live with the
HIV virus, including 90,000 children most of whom are unaware of
their HIV status.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the prevalence of HIV has risen from 3.1 percent in
1990 to 9.0 percent in 1997, he said, adding that the rural
prevalence currently stands at 8-9 percent while the urban
prevalence stands at 12-13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wilson disclosed that his agency has declared war on the
HIV/AIDS in its new program.
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that the Kenya's Master Plan of Education for
period 1997-2010 places special emphasis on developing the
capacity of families and communities to actively participate in
children's program, he noted.

KAMPALA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- An Indian health delegation is
in Uganda to learn from their Ugandan counterparts in HIV/AIDS
control and prevention.
</P>
<P>
Anne Nakaweesi, coordinator in Uganda AIDS Commission, told
Xinhua in a telephone interview Wednesday morning that the
delegation, which arrived Sunday, will stay in Uganda for about a
week and they will exchange experience in HIV/AIDS control with
their Ugandan colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Uganda AIDS Commission Researcher John Rwomushana was quoted by
 Wednesday New Vision paper as saying that Uganda has reduced the
infection rate thanks to a multi-sectoral approach.
</P>
<P>
He said researchers were able to commit the politicians to turn
the AIDS program into a government policy and enabled Ugandans to
be sensitized.
</P>
<P>
Through sensitization and other methods, Uganda has reduced its
HIV infection rate in urban areas from 30 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Uganda is chosen as the pilot country in Africa to
try new anti-AIDS vaccine. The report said Uganda is in
consultation with Indian experts to facilitate cooperation within
the health sector. At present, Uganda imports 70 percent of its
drugs from India.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Police Refutes Report on Blast Motive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police have refuted a
press report which said the Sunday night's bomb blast, which
killed five people and injured more than 30 others, was linked
with Sudanese agents and international terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua Wednesday morning, Police
Spokesman Bob Ngobi said although they have found some clues to
the terrorist bombing, the motive of the blast has not yet been
established.
</P>
<P>
A recent report in the New Vision newspaper linked this blast
to Sudanese agents and bin Laden who has been wanted by the U.S.
for his role in Bombing the U. S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
last August.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi said so far nine people, including seven Ethiopians, one
Ugandan and one Austrian have been arrested and interrogated. The
Austrian, who is reportedly the husband to the proprietor of the
bar when the bombs went off, is still in custody, he added.
</P>
<P>
The bombs, planted outside two bars in Kampala's suburb of
Kabalagala, went off at 9:30 p.m. and 9:50 p.m. respectively,
killing three people instantly. Two others died in Mulago
hospital.
</P>
<P>
The two bars, close to each other, are said to be frequented by
 foreigners. Press reports said business in the two bars has been
at a halt following the blasts.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, President Yoweri Museveni condemned the bombing in
strongest terms and called on people to be alert for anything
suspicious.

<HEADLINE> 13 Communities in N. Ghana to Enjoy Solar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Twelve communities in the
Mamprusi East District and one in the Bolgatanga District in
Ghana's Northern Region will soon have electricity from
solar-powered cells at the cost of 2.5 billion Cedis (over one
million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Being the first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa, the project
aims at providing power to off-grid communities as a pilot effort
to confirm the technical, economic, social and institutional basis
for a national solar program, the Ghana News Agency (GNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Funds for the project were provided by the Ghanaian government,
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) under its Global
Environmental Facility and the United States Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
Fred Ohene Kena, Minister of Mines and Energy, who inaugurated
Tuesday a five-member board to oversee the project, said solar
electricity is a good choice for non-industrial off-grid areas
because it matches the needs of many household applications.
</P>
<P>
"It will adequately take care of lighting, entertainment, water
pumping, vaccine refrigeration, cottage industries and night
schools," he said.
</P>
<P>
The project will have well defined linkages to other priority
needs of the rural communities in their economic development,
according to the minister, who noted that the project would have a
direct impact on women and children in the areas of training,
bore-hole mechanism, operations of solar-powered grain grinders,
expanded economic productivity, dress making and enhance
opportunities for education and training.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said he was optimistic that the enterprise would
stimulate the emergence of international joint ventures between
equipment manufacturers and local companies, especially in local
production of batteries and charge controllers.

"It is my hope that the project will look at other forms of
renewable energy such as biomass and wind to complement the
existing energy source since we can no longer rely on hydro-power
and thermal complementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aboulie Janneh, UNDP resident representative, said the project
will seek to reduce the long-term cost of low green house
gas-emitting energy technologies.
</P>
<P>
"It is envisaged that the stabilization of green house gas will
require greatly increased utilization of renewal energy
technologies."
</P>
<P>
Janneh said UNDP's involvement in the project is a
demonstration of its will to help in the alleviation of poverty
and improve rural water supply, education, health delivery and the
general economic development of Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Millions of Kenyan Children Lack Basic Care: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- More than three million Kenyan
 children aged under six years have no access to early childhood
care, according to Kalonzo Musyoka, the Minister for Education and
Human Resource Development.
</P>
<P>
They live with the menace of malnutrition, poor health and
little exposure to an enabling education environment, the Daily
Nation newspaper Wednesday quoted Musyoka as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Kenya had 23,344 early childhood care and
development centers with an enrolment of 1.06 million children and
36,201 teachers.
</P>
<P>
However, the participation rate was only 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
"But even if there has been a 46 percent growth in enrolment in
the last four years, real progress has been hindered by poverty
which has affected participation in many development programs
including basic education," Musyoka said.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that early childhood care and girl education
had been neglected in the recent past "because the struggle for
survival takes precedence due to the state of the our economy."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Citizens Find Easy Way for Festival Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- More and more shanghai
citizens are extending new year greetings to their relatives using
telecommunication facilities such as internet and visual phones
instead of paying visits as they used to do over the years,
according to Shanghai Telecom.
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the lunar new year, or the Spring Festival,
Shanghai Telecom allowed citizens on the particular occasion to
make free visual-phone calls to send their best wishes to their
relatives outside Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Lu Qiong brought her little daughter with her to make a new
year call to her husband in Singapore. She was just one of the
call makers who took the advantage of modern technology since the
visual-phone service started in 1995, said an official with
Shanghai Telecom.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many net surfers sent E-cards via cyberspace to
their friends and this has become a fashion. Some sent e-mails to
relatives and friends, and others sent virtual cheques as new year
prizes.
</P>
<P>
For many busy citizens, sending new year greetings on pagers is
a better choice, and many of them use special codes such as "888",
which stands for "getting rich", and "666", which means "many
happy returns", on their friends' pagers. Some young lovers also
leave a "526" on their sweethearts' pagers to say "I love you".
</P>
<P>
However, most Shanghai citizens still prefer to visit their
relatives in person. But changes are also taking place in this
tradition.
</P>
<P>
Madame Wang, who works in a company, said that she plans to
invite all her relatives to have a party in her new apartment to
share the joy.

<HEADLINE> More Cultural Flavor in Festival Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese people are seen
taking part in more cultural activities during the Lunar New Year
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Museums and libraries in the port city of Tianjin decided to
remain open from the first day of the festival, to cater to needs
of increasing holiday-makers who prefer more cultural programs
apart from traditional activities, local sources say.
</P>
<P>
In the past, many cultural institutions chose to close at least
in the first day of the festival days, since according to custom
it is the day for family gathering.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to enrich the cultural life of local farmers,
mountainous Guizhou Province in southwest China plans to show a
total of over 10,000 films in the countryside during the Lunar New
Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
Workers of 140 film projection teams will sacrifice their own
holidays for the record-breaking program, provincial officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou listed 1998 as the Year of Film Projection in Rural
areas, and has decided to accomplish a scheme this year which will
enable every one to see a film every month.
</P>
<P>
In remote Yining City on the Sino-Kazakhstan border, more
people buy flowers to send to relatives and friends as festive
greetings. Many of the flowers sold in the dozen flower shops
which remain open during the long holidays were airlifted from
southern China.
</P>
<P>
Like in large cities, Yining residents belonging to 43 ethnic
groups also resort to modern telecommunication means such as
telephone or fax to transmit greetings.

Ito said his government appreciates Ghana's efforts to reduce
budget deficit and inflation rate, without which any development
program would not be meaningful and private activities would not
be vitalized.
</P>
<P>
''My government, therefore, appreciates the strong commitment
of the Ghanaian government in the implementation and management
of macro-economic policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The non-project grant aid would enable the government to
acquire indispensable materials and machinery for development and
economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Ito said for Ghana to attain stability, it is important to
increase its food production to meet increasing demands
considering the rate of population growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the Japanese ambassador, Japan has been providing
aid to Ghana since 1981 to increase food production, which has
proved to be effective.
</P>
<P>
Gbeho said this gesture ''clearly demonstrates the Japanese
government's understanding of the direction in which Ghana is
trying to move and the obstacles in our path.''
</P>
<P>
He said the grant represents only a small fraction of the
tremendous effort which the government of Japan has been making
in diverse ways to help Ghana move its economy forward.
</P>
<P>
''The people of this country fully appreciate the positive
impact that the friendly people of Japan have made on their lives
through these facilities," he added.

<HEADLINE> Genetically Modified Soybeans, Cottonseed Recommended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Genetically modified soybeans
and cottonseed have been recommended as safe for use in Australian
foods in the first assessment of its kind by the country's food
standards body.
</P>
<P>
Food containing Roundup Ready soybeans or Ingard Cottonseed
will not need to be labeled initially, because these products have
been assessed as "substantially equivalent" to unmodified soybeans
and cottonseed, the Australian New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA)
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But foods containing these modified products will have to be
labeled when a more stringent labeling standard, still being
developed, comes into force.
</P>
<P>
"ANZFA has found, following rigorous examination of test data,
that Roundup Ready soybeans and Ingard Cottonseed have no public
health and safety concerns," ANZFA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"These products were also found to be substantially equivalent
to food from their conventional counterparts in respect of its
composition, safety, wholesomeness and use."
</P>
<P>
Industry, professional and consumer groups will be asked to
comment on the assessments before health ministers consider the
matter in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Public comments on the testing process also will be accepted.
</P>
<P>
Ingard cotton is grown in Australia. Cottonseed oil extracted
from it is used in a variety of foods, including for frying,
mayonnaise and salad dressings.
</P>
<P>
Roundup Ready soybeans are imported from the United States and
used in vegetable oil and protein meal supplied to animal feed
manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Condemns Violence After Kurdish Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard condemned violence in Kurdish protests that erupted
Wednesday at Greek consulates in Sydney and Melbourne, the country'
s two biggest cities.
</P>
<P>
"Anything that involves a breach of the law, anything that
involves violence, anything that involves endangering lives or
property, is something that will be condemned not only by the
government but also by all of the Australian people," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish people staged violent protests around the world over
the arrest of Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan, who was
captured in Kenya after being given brief refuge in the Greek
consulate in Nairobi and is now under arrest in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has said it will prosecute Ocalan for waging a guerrilla
war in southeastern Turkey that cost at least 29,000 lives in 14
years.
</P>
<P>
There were violent scenes at the Greek consulate in Melbourne
Wednesday, where about 50 policemen clashed with about 70 Kurdish
protesters outside the Consul-General's office, the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, about 50 protesters stormed the Greek consulate in
Castlereagh Street in an early morning raid Wednesday, partially
shutting down the city center as riot police moved in.
</P>
<P>
The nine-hour siege ended following intervention by local
police. A 15-year-old boy, 20 women and 43 men were detained by
police to be charged under the Commonwealth Act with unlawful
assembly, the AAP reported.
</P>
<P>
Greek Consul-General Rosa Ieremia said the staff of the
besieged Greek Consulate in central Sydney was safe.

<HEADLINE> EU Blitz Inspection on Bank Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
carried out blitz inspections on eight banks in Germany, France,
Italy and Spain for alleged overcharges for currency exchange.
</P>
<P>
Local television RTL-TVI Wednesday quoted European Competition
Commissioner Karel van Miert as saying that the commission, the
executive body of the 15-nation European Union (EU), has decided
on the surprise move in order to obtain sufficient proof.
</P>
<P>
The banks were suspected to have created a cartel to maintain
or even raise their banking charges for currency exchanges and
transactions.
</P>
<P>
The eight banks inspected Tuesday were, according to sources
close to the commission, the Credit Agricole (Agricultural Credit)
Bank and the Societe Generale (General Company) Bank of France;
the Deutsche Bank and the Dresdner Bank of Germany; the Argentaria
Bank and the BBV Bank of Spain, and the BCI and Cariplo Bank of
Italy.
</P>
<P>
The 11 participating countries in the single currency mechanism
are advised not to charge for exchanges and transactions between
national currencies and the single currency so as to encourage the
use of the new-born euro.
</P>
<P>
Belgium right now boasts the lowest exchange charges among the
11 euro countries with a rate of 1.25 percent of the total amount
exchanged.
</P>
<P>
The commission has also decided to require information on bank
charges from other banks and banking associations in the euro zone
which includes Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,
Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, Ireland, Austria and Finland.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the commission promised to launch an investigation
into the alleged raise by some euro zone banks of their banking
charges.

DHAKA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
seeking 750 million U.S. dollars from donors to implement the
Dhaka Eastern Bypass Project to ease the traffic congestion in the
capital city, the New Nation newspaper reported Wednesday, quoting
official sources.
</P>
<P>
The estimated cost of the project, which will also facilitate

the government has prepared a project profile, earmarking the
portion of both domestic and foreign currencies for reaching an
agreement with the lending agencies by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The appraisal for the project will start in February, 2000 and
thereby negotiation will begin in May the same year, they added.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Parliament Approves 1999 Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Romania's controversial 1999
budget plan rammed through the parliament on Tuesday despite the
boycott of vote by opposition members.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which promises harsh cuts in government spending,
passed a joint session of the two chambers of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Social Democratic Party, the largest opposition
party in parliament, boycotted the vote along with other
opposition groups because the government rejected more than 100
amendment motions submitted by the party.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Romania's gross domestic product (GDP) will be
474 trillion leu (38.69 billion U.S. dollars), down 2 percent
compared with 1998. The inflation rate will be brought down from
last year's 45 percent to within 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The nation's revenue will amount to 84 trillion leu (6.86
billion dollars) and spending is projected to be 93 trillion leu (
7.59 billion dollars), leaving a budget deficit of nine trillion
leu (730 million dollars), which accounts for 2 percent of Romania'
s GDP.
</P>
<P>
After the budget plan was approved, Romanian Prime Minister
Radu Vasile said the plan was the only means for Romania to pay
its huge foreign debts that expire this year.
</P>
<P>
The government will consider adopting a series of incentives to
develop medium and small-scale enterprises, agriculture, the
service industry and infrastructure after it pays the major part
of its debts in the first half of the year.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Update with details Cuba Adopts Law to Fight Back U.S. Trade Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Parliament passed a new
law on Tuesday to fight back the tightening U.S. trade embargo
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The "Law for the Protection of Cuba's National Independence
and Economy", unanimously approved late Tuesday by the parliament,
set fines and prison terms for those charged for helping the
United States undermine Cuban national independence, sovereignty
and unification.
</P>
<P>
The law said that any Cuban citizens who directly or indirectly
provide the United States with information to help the U.S. apply
Helms-Burton law and subvert the Cuban regime will be sentenced to
7-15 years of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Helms-Burton law calls for sanctions against any

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian President Urges to Develop Domestic Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
said Tuesday that his country should make efforts to develop
domestic market and stabilize its currency while maintaining
control on inflation.
</P>
<P>
In light of the current financial crisis in the world, Ukraine
should pay more attention to developing domestic market, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of Ukrainian industrialists and entrepreneurs,
Kuchma announced that the share of exports has risen from 20.6
percent to above 40 in Ukraine's gross domestic product (GDP) for
the past four years, whereas that for most western countries
stands between some 15 and 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the Ukrainian economy relies too
heavily on the world economy and urged the state bank to lower its
discount rate from 60 percent to the 1997 level of 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
While sticking to open economic policies and building financial-
industrial groups and share-holder companies, Ukraine should give
top priority to the agro-technology, light industry and processing
industry, as well as housing and energy, the president said his
speech.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- "It's my long-time dream to
spend a Lunar New Year holiday in Lhasa," said a young man from
Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
"We really had an unexpectedly exciting New Year eve here.
Though firecrackers are banned in many of the large cities, We
were immersed in the sound of firecrackers the whole night in this
plateau city of Lhasa," he said while taking pictures with his
girl friend in front of Potala Palace.
</P>
<P>
He is one of those from across the country and overseas to join
the jubilant local holiday-makers in Tibet during the Lunar New
Year.
</P>
<P>
Jokhang Temple in downtown Lhasa not only draws local prayers
but also crowds of domestic and foreign tourists from very early
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Drawing by a good business prospect, most of the shop owners,
street peddlers and taxi drivers in Lhasa are working during the
holidays, though many of them open their business later than usual
since they themselves stay late into the night watching festival
TV programs.
</P>
<P>
As a festive scenery, traditional Chinese red lantern and Hada--
a piece of silk used as a greeting gift by Tibetans--can be seen
fluttering in front of shops and on taxis.
</P>
<P>
"I've sold tens of thousands of yuan (8.3 yuan equal to one US
dollar) more of firecrackers this Lunar New Year than usual," said
Mr. Li, the manager of a firecracker shop in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
Far away from Lhasa, in Beijing, the Tibetan students of Beijing
Tibet Middle School, are using a special televised telephone line
to send their holiday greetings back home.
</P>
<P>
The special line is installed by Beijing Telecom for three
consecutive years to cater to the students during the Lunar New
Year and the New Year of the Tibetan calendar (this year the day
falls on February 17).

<P>
ALMA ATA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of the
bombings in central Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on Tuesday has risen to
13 while 128 persons were injured, said a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The report said that curfew has been imposed in the country's
capital of Tashkent and the borders have been sealed in a bid to
hunt the bombers who aimed to assassinate Uzbek President Islam
Karimov.
</P>
<P>
Uzbek Interior Minister Zakir Almatov said that there were six
bombings in various parts of the city from 10:52 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.
local time. The explosives had been planted in cars.
</P>
<P>
Nobody has claimed to be responsible for the explosions, but
Security chief Rustam Inoyatov was quoted as telling the
parliament that "this is the work of extremists outside the
country and people linked to them inside the republic."
</P>
<P>
"The explosions occurred just a few minutes before the
president arrived at the government building. A car pulled up to
Independence Square, terrorists came out and, by shooting at it,
blew it up," Inoyatov said.
</P>
<P>
He said law-enforcement officers have surrounded the capital
and are conducting raids and searches.
</P>
<P>
Another report said that another explosion occurred at a
foreign embassy in Tashkent on Tuesday afternoon. So far,
investigations are underway.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President Rejects Deployment of Foreign Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic reiterated his strong objection to the deployment of
foreign troops in Kosovo in talks Tuesday with U.S. envoy
Christopher Hill, the Tanjug news agency quoted a presidential
communique as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Our negative stand on the presence of foreign troops is not
only the attitude of the leadership, but also of all citizens of
our country," Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
Hill left here late Tuesday to return to Rambouillet near Paris,
where Serbs and Kosovo Albanians have been talking for the past 10
days under strong diplomatic pressure to agree to an international
settlement of the Kosovo conflict before a deadline on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Deployment of an international force to monitor a peace
agreement in Kosovo has remained the major obstacle in the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Hill was dispatched to Belgrade after U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright telephoned Milosevic to warn him to accept the
troop deployment, or face NATO strikes.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Yugoslavia's Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic
warned in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation
that NATO attacks on Yugoslavia would destroy all chances of a
political solution to Kosovo crisis and the peace process would be
delayed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Yugoslavia's position which calls for a permanent
and democratic solution to the issue through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on Monday, spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army (
KLA) Arbin Kurti said in Pristina that the KLA would continue its
fight for independence if its demand for a referendum after a
three-year transition period of autonomy could not be met.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was unacceptable that the international
community did not allow the independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan proposed by the six-nation Contact Group on the
former Yugoslavia calls for a NATO force of up to 30,000 troops to
be deployed in Kosovo to enforce a settlement. The plan would
give Kosovo substantial autonomy for a three-year interim period,
while ensuring it remained within Yugoslavia.

TOKYO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has
decided to resume extending yen loans to Cambodia for the first
time since 1968, a leading Japanese newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>

Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will convey the decision
to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who is scheduled to visit
Japan later this month to attend an international meeting of

Japan made the decision in light of Cambodia's recent political
stability since the establishment of a new government led by Hun
Sen following last July's general election, the daily said,
quoting government sources.
</P>
<P>
Loans, which are likely to total more than three billion yen (
about 25.4 million U.S. dollars), will be used to repair Port
Sihanouk, a major port in line with Port Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Japan granted some 1.5 billion yen (about 12.7 million dollars)
in loans to Cambodia in fiscal 1968, but suspended yen loans later
as civil war and military conflicts flared.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Steelmakers File New Dumping Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The eight countries listed in the complaints filed by U.S.
leading steel companies and the United Steelworkers Union are
Czech Republic, France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Macedonia
and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The action came just days after the industry won a ruling by
the Clinton Administration that Japan and Brazil had illegally
dumped hot-rolled steel.
</P>
<P>
The new anti-dumping complaints involve a different type of
steel, cut-to-length plate. Imports of that steel product have
increased by 521 percent from those eight countries since 1995,
industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
In a joint news release, Bethlehem Steel Corp., Gulf States
Steel Inc., IPSCO Steel, Inc., Tuscaloosa Steel Co., USX Corp. and
the union said those eight countries were responsible for pushing
down prices that forced American factories to significantly cut
back production.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. International Trade Commission has 45 days and the
Commerce Department 160 days to make a preliminary determination
of injury that could lead to new tariffs on steel exports from
those countries.
</P>
<P>
Still pending is a Clinton administration decision on a deal
with Russia which was accused by the U.S. steel industry of
dumping hot-rolled steel in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said last Friday that it was discussing
with Russia a possible agreement to suspend dumping investigation
and the preliminary decision would be announced this week.

17.7-percent rise over 1997 in rupee terms, the Sri Lanka Customs
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The customs said the industry accounts for about half of Sri
Lanka's total export earnings in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government had taken several measures to strengthen the
industry to be prepared to meet the challenges of a quotaless
textile trade in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Local industrialists had been encouraged to produce fabrics and
other raw material for the industry. The move will help save an
enormous sum of foreign exchange being spent on raw material
import.
</P>
<P>
Various public sector institutions had been mobilized to take
many positive steps to upgrade the industry.
</P>
<P>
The Textile Training and Services Center and the Clothing
Industry and Training Institute provided comprehensive training
and services to people engaged in this sector.
</P>
<P>
At present there are 350,000 persons directly employed in the
industry and under the proposed 56 garment factories program a
further 19,000 youth will be employed eventually.

<HEADLINE> Germany Warns Angry Kurds Not to Attack Foreign Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- German Interior Minister Otto
Schily on Tuesday warned the Kurds in Germany not to stage attacks
on foreign missions in the country, saying violent activists will
either be brought to justice or be expelled.
</P>
<P>
Schily said German police will send more staff to disperse
those who are involved in violence.
</P>
<P>
Groups of angry Kurds, ranging from dozens to several hundreds,
stormed Greek, Turkish and Kenyan embassies or other diplomatic
facilities in Bonn, Berlin, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Hamburg,
Hannover, Munich and Leipzig on Tuesday to protest against the
arrest of Abdullah Ocalan, Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) leader and
the most wanted man of the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkey on Monday, immediately triggering
violence throughout Europe, as angry Kurds assailed Greek
embassies in 21 European cities. The Kurds accused Greece of
allowing Ocalan to be taken from its embassy in Kenya and
transported to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Kurd protesters occupied the Greek embassies in Moscow,
Brussels, Belgium, and Stockholm, but left voluntarily after
several hours, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Schily said Germany was not involved in the capture of Ocalan.
Germany neither knew his whereabouts nor did it participate in any
actions to apprehend him, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said about 2,000 among the half million Kurds living in
Germany had participated in the violent actions. He didn't rule
out the possibility of more violent actions by the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Security has been beefed up in all international airports to
protect Greek, Kenyan, Turkish and U.S. airliners from being
attacked.
</P>
<P>
Greek authorities insisted they had no role in Ocalan's capture,
saying he left the Greek embassy compound in Nairobi voluntarily.
Kenya also denied having a hand in his capture.
</P>
<P>
Dutch lawyers working for Ocalan, however, said he was
physically dragged out of the embassy by the Kenyan police and put
on a plane for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, 49, has been on the run since he was forced to leave
Syria last year under threat of military action by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Garuda Airways Ready to Cope With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian flag-carrier PT.
Garuda Indonesian airways has been ready to cope with the
millennium bug in its computer reservation system (CRS).
</P>
<P>
Head of Garuda's Communication and General Affairs Division,
Pujobroto said here on Tuesday that his company has been well
prepared for the computerization of its ticketing.
</P>
<P>
The replacement of its former two-digit computer reservation
system into a new four-digit one is being handled in cooperation
with the Atraxis Swiss Airline, Antara News Agency Wednesday
quoted Pujobroto as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the financial system, however, Garuda has invited assistance
from a German consultant and set a schedule for completion in
September 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Pujobroto refused to disclose the cost for the
replacement of the computer reservation system from the old
two-digit into four-digit, saying that it was still being
computed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Secretary General of the Indonesian National Air
Carrier Association (Inaca) Benny Rungkat reminded that such
replacement would be costly.
</P>
<P>
The replacement of the two-digit system into a four-digit one
at the turn of the century will cost an aviation company about 500
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Benny pointed out that the change would cover all computer
systems, including those in the aircraft cockpits, ticketing,
financial on-line, marketing and seating arrangement in the
aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Foreign Debt to top 59b U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
foreign debt is expected to stand at 59 billion U.S. dollars by
the end of the 1998/99 fiscal year ending March 31, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of foreign debt until December 31, 1998 was 57
billion dollars, Finance Minister Bambang Subianto said Tuesday
during a parliament hearing, press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the government loans, the country is also
burdened by mounting private foreign debts which stand at about 80
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 70 percent depreciation of the rupiah (national currency)
against the U.S. dollar since July 1997 has made it virtually
impossible for private companies to repay their debts. The
government must also rely on foreign assistance to ease the
burden, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government, Bambang said, is still seeking foreign loans of
at least 1.9 billion U.S. dollars to cover the development budget
shortage in the 1999/2000 draft state budget set at 6.32 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We are still trying to get 6.32 billion U.S. dollars. And at
the moment the loan which could be 'reserved' amounts to merely
4.4 billion U.S. dollars, and we still need 1.9 billion U.S.
dollars," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the shortage will be sought from various sources,
particularly the member countries of the consultative group on
Indonesia (CGI). Meanwhile, development earnings in fiscal
1999/2000 will be from bilateral loans such as from Japan, France,
Germany, Austria and China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- "We had a splendid red letter
day at our new home, and the county magistrate came to have dinner
with us on new year's eve," said Li Yu'e, a farmer in central
China's Hubei Province who was made homeless during last summer's
flooding.
</P>
<P>
Li is one of the 752,000 flood victims in four provinces of
Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui along the Yangtze River who have
moved to their new homes before the lunar new year.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC)
said that funds for the accommodation of 940,000 flood victims in
the region have already been settled and that 80 percent of them
spent the Spring Festival in their new houses.
</P>
<P>
To expand the floodwater storage capacity of local rivers and
lakes against possible future floods, the Chinese government plans
to relocate the flood victims along the rivers in nearby highlands
or move them to other places in stead of rebuilding the destroyed
villages in their original sites.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has approved the migration plan, and the
number of people involved in the plan is equal to that of the
relocation program in the Three Gorges Dam Project.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC has allocated 2.5 billion yuan for the migration plan
with another one billion coming in the first half of this year.
All the migrants are expected to move to their new homes by the
second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The government has also stressed the quality of new housing for
migrants and supporting facilities including those for power and
water supply.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Plans to Reduce Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 16 (Xinhua)-- The Brazilian government
is planning further cuts in this year's fiscal budget, the "State
of Sao Paulo" newspaper has reported.
</P>
<P>
The publication said that officials of the Ministry of the
Budget and Administration are formulating new cuts in government
spending, which will be presented to President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso next week.
</P>
<P>
Having adopted the system of free exchange fluctuation, which
is likely to raise the inflation rate and deepen the economic
recession, the Brazilian government has to modify the estimates of
income and expenditure for 1999, pointed out Martus Tavares,
executive secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
However, Tavares said that his ministry would not announce any
measures before Cardoso makes a decision.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the agreements reached by the Brazilian
authorities and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
Brazilian government has to raise the primary surplus (excluding
the payments of debt and interests) of the public sector gross
domestic product (GDP) from 2.6 percent to 3 or 3.5 per cent.

SOFIA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Libyan officials say that the
Bulgarian medical staff arrested last week are in good health and
have not been maltreated, the Bulgarian foreign ministry announced
Tuesday in a press release.
</P>
<P>
But the Libyan officials did not disclose whereabouts of the 19
doctors and nurses, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian ambassador in Tripoli Krustyu Ilov and other embassy
staff had held frequent meetings with Libyan officials to seek an
explanation on their arrests and demand a their prompt release.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan officials also assured the Bulgarian diplomats that
they would work to clarify the case, pledging to release them
after the investigative proceedings were completed.
</P>
<P>
On February 10, the authorities arrested 19 Bulgarian medical
workers in Benghazi, but no legal grounds were given.
</P>
<P>
Earlier newspaper reports said the nineteen were held in a
hospital and subjected to AIDS tests after cases of the disease
were registered in the hospital where they work.
</P>

The Bulgarian medical personnel were reportedly in trouble with
Libyan authorities for divulging cases of AIDS, a disease which

<HEADLINE> Canada's 1999 Budget Increases Support for Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Finance Minister Paul
Martin announced Tuesday in the 1999 federal budget that the
provinces and territories will receive an additional 11.5 billion
Canadian dollars (7.59 billion U.S. dollars) for health care over
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic increase in federal financial support for health
care is the largest single new investment the government has made
since coming to office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Of the additional funding for health, 8 billion Canadian
dollars (5.28 billion dollars) will be provided through future-
year increases in the Canada health and Social Transfer (CHST),
and 3.5 billion Canadian dollars (2.3 billion dollars) as an
immediate one-time supplement to the CHST from funds available in
the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks on the fiscal situation, the minister confirmed
that the government's books will once again be balanced or better
in the current fiscal year. "This will mark the first time in
almost half a century that the federal government will have
recorded two balanced budgets or surpluses, back to back," Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
Eliminating the deficit allowed the government to begin
providing broad-based tax relief in the 1998 budget. As part of a
long-term strategy to permanently reduce taxes, the 1999 budget
builds on last year's budget by reducing taxes for all taxpayers
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
As of July 1, the 3 percent federal surtax on those making more
than 50,000 Canadian dollars (33,000 dollars) is eliminated. It
was devised as a temporary measure in 1985 to fight the deficit.
</P>
<P>
A 5 percent surtax on taxpayers earning more than 65,000
Canadian dollars (42,900 dollars) a year stays, despite the
balanced books.
</P>
<P>
Martin removed another 200,000 Canadians from the tax rolls to
join the 400,000 who were relieved last year.
</P>
<P>
All Canadians will be able to make 675 Canadian dollars more (
445 dollars) this year before they are taxed. Lower-income groups
got the bulk of that break last year.
</P>
<P>
That brings personal tax relief for Canadians this year to 1.5
billion Canadian dollars (1 billion dollars).

MANILA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
raised growth target for the country's gross national product
(GNP) this year to a range of 3 percent to 3.7 percent from the
previous 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent, the Business World newspaper
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The adjusted target was agreed upon by the government's
Development Budget Coordinating Council (DBCC), which sees the
agriculture, industry and services sectors will take the lead in
the country's GNP growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DBCC believes the export will grow by 15.6
percent this year with the country's products becoming competitive
in terms of pricing, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Felipe
Medalla as saying that the agricultural production will expand by
at least 3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector should also post a mild recovery after
two years in the doldrums, the DBCC said, adding it expects the
sector to grow 1 percent to 1.5 percent this year from an 8.1
percent contraction in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government expects the services sector to grow 3 percent to
3.8 percent this year, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia not to Leave INRO: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will not leave the
International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) after the World's
largest rubber producer, Thailand, announced its withdrawal from
the club, Trade and Industry Minister Rahardi Ramelan has said.
</P>
<P>
"I will re-check Thailand's decision to leave INRO, and if it
is true, it means a setback for INRO," Ramelan said Tuesday on the
sidelines of a seminar on agriculture products export.
</P>
<P>
Thailand recently announced it had decided to leave INRO
following the example of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
If INRO disintegrated, the most important problem for Indonesia
would be how to release the natural rubber stock without damaging
rubber's domestic price, Antara News Agency Wednesday quoted
Ramelan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, executive director of the Indonesian Rubber
Association (Gapkindo) Budiman said INRO's imminent demise would
put pressure on the already depressed Indonesian market.
</P>
<P>
Rubber price has slipped to a 30-year low of around 60 U.S.
cents a kilogram since the Asian financial crisis began in the
middle of 1997.
</P>
<P>
INRO's main aim is to stabilize world rubber prices by buying
when prices drop sharply and selling when prices surge.

<HEADLINE> IOC Extends Deadline for Cities on Irregularities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The deadline for Olympic bid
cities to reply to a request for information on rule-breaking
behavior has been extended by the International Olympic Committee,
a spokesman said in Lausanne, Switzerland on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Monday was the previous deadline set by IOC president Juan
Antonio Samaranch who asked for evidence of ethical misconduct by
IOC members.
</P>
<P>
The IOC said it received an unspecified number of replies but
details were not disclosed as the letters would be passed on to
the special IOC panel investigating allegations of impropriety by
members.
</P>
<P>
The IOC sent out letters requesting information from 54 cities
which bid for the games from 1996 onward. The initiative was
prompted by the bribery scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Japanese Olympic officials said nine IOC members may
have broken rules during Nagano's successful bid for the 1992
Winter Games.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Expects to Take England Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Keegan would be named as
England new manager in the next few days after further talks with
the Football Association (FA) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The FA's international sub-committee met for two hours and
spoke to Keegan, who was in Newcastle, by phone.
</P>
<P>
"Conversations are continuing in connection with our options.
Progress is being made and discussions will continue on Wednesday
morning," FA spokesman Steve Double said.
</P>
<P>
Keegan's discussions with the F.A. are believed to have
centered on him being allowed to fill the post on an initial part-
time basis.
</P>
<P>
Keegan, chief operations officer and effectively manager of
second division Fulham, has a contract until the end of next
season and, while the FA are unlikely to allow him to fulfil it,
they seem happy to accommodate a part-time arrangement for the
rest of this season.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy for him to work with both the FA and Fulham but
we would want his position with his club resolved in the summer as
we don't want a part-time manager in the long-term,"acting FA
chairman Geoff Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
Acting F.A. chief executive David Davies, while insisting other
options were also being considered, said: "I am hoping that later
this week we will have something positive to say for all England
supporters. We are certainly moving speedily."

<HEADLINE> Rodman And Lakers Still in Holding Pattern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman may be in a
Los Angeles Lakers uniform as early as Tuesday when the team hosts
the Charlotte Hornes.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times reported Satureday that Rodman decided to
join the Lakers for the veteran's minumum of $1 million, pro-rated
to $600,000 for the shortened season.
</P>
<P>
The forward also would receive another $3 million from an
endorsement contract with Converse.
</P>
<P>
However, the Lakers have not confirmed an agreement has been
reached.
</P>
<P>
The report said Rodman's agent, Steve Chasman of International
Creative Management, has been negotiating with the Lakers for
almost two weeks and that Rodman has received a personal
invitation to join the Lakers from owner Jerry Buss.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported that Chaseman has discussed
possible movie deals for Rodman with Fox, which holds an option to
buy into the Lakers as a limited partner.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Rodman has led the NBA in rebounding each of
the last seven seasons and has been part of five NBA championship
teams, including the last three with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
Rodman also won titles with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and
1990.
</P>
<P>
His rebounding expertise, however, comes at a price. He has
been suspended six times in the last seven years, including twice
by the league, and once kicked a cameraman in the groin.
</P>
<P>
Rodman began his NBA career with the Pistons in 1986 and was a
key member of their back-to-back championship teams. He was NBA
Defensive Player of the Year in 1990 and 1991 and earned All-Star
berths in 1990 and 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese residents have begun
using the Internet for New Year's greetings for their relatives
and friends.
</P>
<P>
Before the Lunar New Year, Liu Han, a computer lover in
Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province, had already received
dozens of messages. Some were from online friends he did not even
know. Many online cards have a picture of a rabbit, this lunar new
year's zodiac sign.
</P>
<P>
Ying Li, a student at Nanjing University's International
Economics College, said that contacting friends and relatives on
the Internet is better this year because ready-made designs of
online greeting cards can be easily downloaded.
</P>
<P>
China has more than a million personal computers and that
number is growing by a million each year, according to one
computer magazine.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese used to visit, write to, or phone friends and
relatives during the Spring Festival, the most important
traditional holiday for the Chinese.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the largest trading
port in north China, has pledged to boost its foreign trade
development this year despite the impact of the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The export volume is expected to reach 5.8 billion U.S. dollars
this year, 4 billion dollars more than last year's figure, said Pi
Qiansheng, director the Municipal Foreign Economic and Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Ontracted direct investment from abroad will be 3.85 billion U.
S. dollars while the amount of overseas investment used for this
year will be 2.5 billion dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
To attain this goal, the municipal government will explore more
avenues of investment, attract more overseas high-tech companies
to Tianjin, and set up Sino-foreign consultancy and trade firms.
</P>
<P>
At present, the city has 12,000 foreign-funded enterprises
handling 10 billion U.S.dollars in imports and exports a year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the foreign-trade volume of Tianjin grew
by three percent last year to more than 10.61 billion U.S.dollars,
with a trade surplus of 381 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The processing industry's imports and exports accounted for 63.
2 percent of the total.

MADRID, February 16 (Xinhua) -- American Maurice Greene ran the
fastest but failed to realise his dream to break his own 60-meter
world record in Madrid on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The American won the event at the annual Jose Maria Cagigal
athletics meet in a time of 6.49, 10 hundredths of a second off
his own world record of 6.39 set at last year's competition.
</P>
<P>
Deji Aliu of Nigeria was 10 hundredths of a second behind him,
while American Vincent Henderson came in third in a time of 6.61.

After the 50-meter mark, Greene clocked a time four hundredths
of a second behind the 5.56 world record he set for the distance
in Los Angeles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The women's 60-meter flat was won by 18-year-old Nigerian Joan

<HEADLINE> Three Horses Killed in Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Three race horses have died in
a mass pile up involving nine of a 15-strong field at Sedgefield,
County Durham at the Alphameric Red Onion Novices Chase on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Problems began at the first fence when the horse Joss Bay fell,
bringing down Skane River and Sliema Creek.
</P>
<P>
All three animals then ran loose in the opposite direction to
the race around the mile-and-a-quarter oval circuit.
</P>
<P>
They found themselves on a collision course as the remainder of
the field approached the second last fence.
</P>
<P>
The impact was such that another six horses were brought down
with jockey Lorcan Wyer catapulted 10 feet into the air from his
mount Royal Scimitar.
</P>
<P>
Royal Scimitar was killed instantly together with Floss The
Boss and Skane River.
</P>
<P>
It was lucky enough that none of the jockeys was seriously
injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Wyer, whose only injury was a sore thumb, said: "I've no
ambition to take up sky diving after that. There's always a risk
at a course like this and at Fakenham.
</P>
<P>
"It all happened in a split second. I managed to avoid two of
the loose horses but I had no chance of missing the other one."
</P>
<P>
Jockey Club spokesman John Maxse saw the collision while
watching the race on television.
</P>
<P>
"The incident appears to have been an horrific and freak
accident, and one that must have been very upsetting to both
viewers and all those present at Sedgefield," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The case remains that no issue has a higher priority with the
Jockey Club than the safety and welfare of horse and rider.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly if there are any lessons that can be learned from this
tragic accident, we will take them on board straight away.
</P>
<P>
"Having said that, the problem of loose horses on the
racecourse is not a new one, and one that has already been studied
at some length by the Jockey Club," he added.
</P>
<P>
Solutions that have been studied include having handlers,
although the racing authorities believe that tends to make loose
horses go even faster.
</P>
<P>
"Also they have looked at the possibility of erecting a
corridor for loose horses to go through, but that is also far from
satisfactory," said Maxse.
</P>
<P>
John Robins, of Animal Concern, called for an inquiry into the
accident.
</P>
<P>
"We would hope that there will be a full inquiry involving not
only the race course administrators but also the RSPCA as an
impartial body," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If it is found that horses have been allowed to run on a
course that was not fit for racing heads should roll.
</P>
<P>
"People do not realise how much cruelty is involved and how at
risk these animals are from taking part in racing."
</P>
<P>
The RSPCA said is was "opposed to any activity which causes
distress to animals" and would be making its own inquiries.
</P>
<P>
"Accidents like these concern us greatly," said a spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Parties Agree to Shared-Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland peace
process registered a major boost on Tuesday as rival parties
backed plans for a coalition administration for the troubled
British province.
</P>
<P>
Political parties, at loggerheads on the arms question, united
in a crucial vote on power-sharing and defeated a challenge from
pro-British stalwarts by 77 votes to 29, according to a Reuters
report.
</P>
<P>
The result brought an immediate quickening of political
momentum. Political sources said delegations from Sinn Fein and
the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) would hold their
first-ever "party-to-party" meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Blair and First Minister David Trimble, the Protestant leader
who would head a new executive, are also to meet at the prime
minister's official Downing Street residence on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As the debate is going on, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams held
urgent talks with Blair to urge him to press on with full
implementation of the Good Friday deal.
</P>
<P>
"The vote today marks the end of one phase of the process,"
Reuters quoted Adams as telling reporters after the 45-minute
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The vote, after a two-day session of the Northern Ireland
Assembly, exposed a deep rift among Protestant politicians about
last year's "Good Friday" peace accord, which produced plans for
new government structures in the province.
</P>
<P>
The assembly's decision paves the way for the creation of a
10-minister provincial cabinet of Protestants and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
The vote came as Northern Irish police found a suspected Irish
Republican Army arms and explosives cache in a West Belfast house.
</P>
<P>
A police officer described it as the most significant guerrilla
arms haul in the one-time war zone in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Hopes of further progress in the peace process are snarled by a
dispute over when the IRA and other militias must hand in their
arms.
</P>
<P>
Protestant supporters of British rule, led by Trimble, refuse
to share power with Sinn Fein unless its Irish Republican Army
guerrilla wing disarms.
</P>
<P>
After the vote Sinn Fein and Ulster Unionists applauded the
result but were sharply divided about the next step.
</P>
<P>
"The day has been a good day for the peace process," Sinn
Fein's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness told reporters, saying
that Britain should proceed to trigger a shadow executive within
approximately two weeks and transfer powers on schedule.
</P>
<P>
Britain aims to hand over powers to an executive on March 10
but the arms impasse could mean that deadline may be missed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Proposes Labels to Settle Beef Issue in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. is proposing to
label beef exports to the European Union in an effort to settle a
trade fight over the European ban on hormone-treated beef, the
Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal suggests the U.S. label its beef as "Made in
America", but the labels wouldn't say the beef is hormone-treated.
U.S. officials said European consumers could then decide whether
they wish to eat U.S. beef, much of which is treated with
hormones. The proposal came in a February 11 letter from U.S.
Trade Rep. Charlene Barshefsky to her European Union counterpart,
Sir Leon Brittan, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, Europe says the labels aren't enough. "It doesn't
really address the central question," said Nigel Gardner,
spokesman for Leon Btittan. He said EU officials want to
specifically label the beef as hormone-treated.
</P>
<P>
The EU banned imports of U.S. beef in 1989, citing the common
U.S. industry practice of using growth hormones on cattle. The
U.S. challenged the ban in the World Trade Organization and won,
but Europe still hasn't removed its ban. Europe is facing a May 13
deadline to comply or it may face U.S. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Take Iraq's Threat to Neighbors "Serious" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States would
take Iraq's threat against Turkey, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for
their support in recent U.S. attacks in no-fly zones over Iraq,
the Pentagon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's media warned U.S. allies Tuesday that they would pay a
high price for hosting U.S. and British warplanes patroling no-fly
zones over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
And Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Monday that
Baghdad would attack Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, which was used
by U.S. and British warplanes, if their jets continued patroling
the northern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not he means this threat to be taken seriously, we
have to take seriously threats like this," Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a sign of Saddam Hussein's desperation and isolation that
Iraq is making such threats," Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon
said. "I think the threats will get him nowhere."
</P>
<P>
Bacon said Iraq could try three ways to carry out its threats:
fire scud missiles, attack by air with planes or conduct terrorist
raids.
</P>
<P>
But he said there was little chance for Iraq's depleted air
force to launch attacks deep into neighboring territory.
</P>
<P>
"All of these (three ways) would be difficult, given the
circumstances that Iraq faces today," Bacon said, referring to the
deterioration of its military since the 1991 Gulf War, the effect
of the U.N. economic embargo and the strength of U.S. forces in
the area that could retaliate.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that it would renew talks in New York with the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on possible access to an
underground site which Washington suspects to be part of a revived
nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
"In these talks, as in previous rounds, the United States
will seek steps by the DPRK to remove fully our suspicions about
the site, including by providing access to it," State Department
spokesman James Foley said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks would open on February 27 but said it was
not clear how long they would last. Ambassador Charles Kartman,
U.S. special envoy for the Korean peace talks, will lead the
U.S. delegation, Foley added.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has denied the site at Kumchang-ri has a nuclear
role and demanded compensation for any access asked by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
But Foley reiterated Washington would not pay the
compensation for the access.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to pay compensation. We've made that very
clear," he said. He also said Washington would not link food
aid to the DPRK to its requiring for the access.

LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Eating lots of fiber does
protect against bowel cancer, despite recent reports to the
contrary, leading British experts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Gordon McVie, director general of Britain's Cancer
Research Campaign, said that cancer specialists from around the
world still believe that high fiber, low fat, low calorie diet can
reduce bowel cancer.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. study of nurses, published last month in the New England
Journal of Medicine, suggested fiber had no effect on bowel cancer
rates.
</P>
<P>
But according to McVie, the research was a small study and the
nurses who participated in it were not representative of the
general population.
</P>
<P>
"The New England Journal paper does not change the message. A
high fiber, low fat diet protects against bowel cancer," he told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Most research around the world is still positive about the
beneficial effects and one recent study shows that it may even
help prevent breast cancer, according to McVie.
</P>
<P>
He said that there were at least 39 major studies on bowel
cancer and fiber. Twenty-five showed fiber had a positive effect
on cancer, 11 showed no significant difference and three showed a
negative impact.
</P>
<P>
He added that more research was needed into fiber and how it
protects against cancer but the recommended intake of 18 to 20
grams of fiber, or five portions of fruit and vegetable a day,
still stands.
</P>
<P>
Fiber, contained in cereals, wholemeal bread, fruit and
vegetables, protected against other conditions, including heart
disease, high blood pressure, colon disease, non-insulin diabetes
and constipation, McVie said.
</P>
<P>
A recent study published in the European Journal of Cancer
Prevention suggested that fiber, particularly wheatbran fiber, can
protect against breast cancer.

LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets showed
confidence as a whole Tuesday inspired by a strong start on Wall
Street and a firmer finish in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
In London, the FTSE ended up 85.4 points, or 1.4 percent, at
6108.6. It was the index's fifth straight daily gain and meant it
was in reach of its record high.
</P>
<P>
An upbeat trading statement from Barclays helped push banking
shares sharply higher. Its shares rose 102p, or more than 6
percent, to 1692p.
</P>
<P>
NatWest also added 97p to 1379p - a rise of 7.6 percent.
"NatWest hasn't reported yet so people are really living in hope
at the moment," one trader from a UK brokerage said.
</P>
<P>
Germany's benchmark Xetra Dax index inched less than 1 percent
higher on the day with a robust start to trading on Wall Street
supporting a market otherwise lacking in momentum.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra closed up 6.16 points at 4895.11 points while the
floor Dax rose 0.52 percent to 4904.68.
</P>

</P>
<P>
At the end of a volatile session marked by diminished liquidity
the Cac 40 blue-chip share index closed down 0.32 percent at
4052.32 in volume of 1.6bn euros.

<HEADLINE> Albright Sends Top Aides to Yugoslav With Stark Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has intervened directly in the Kosovo peace
effort by telling Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to meet a
U.S. mediator bringing him a stern warning to "come to terms now,"
the State Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Albright telephoned Milosevic earlier and explained that the
Kosovo Albanians appear ready to sign an American-backed peace
deal for the embattled Yugoslav province while the Serb side
remains the obstacle, according to U.S. State Department spokesman
James Rubin, who was with the secretary in France for negotiations
on Kosovo peace agreement between the Serbs and Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Albright told Milosevic that she dispatched her mediator
Christopher Hill to Belgrade to brief him on progress at the
Kosovo peace negotiations in Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
State Department Deputy spokesman James Foley in Washington
told reporters Milosevic agreed to receive ambassador Hill, who
carried a warning that Milosevic must compromise or face the
threat of NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"The basic thrust of the conversation (between Albright and
Milosevic) was that she wanted to send ambassador Hill. She wanted
(Milosevic) to hear directly from our senior negotiator, what the
stakes were, what the status of the negotiations was, what the
outstanding issues were and the need to come to terms now before
the deadline passes," Foley said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Foley said Hill would present Milosevic the stark choice
"between signing an interim political settlement, allowing a NATO
implementation force... or on the other hand, if he refuses to
agree to the interim settlement or to agree to a NATO peace
implementation force, to face the prospect, the very real
prospect, of NATO air strikes."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Albright told an interview with the ABC TV program
"Good Morning America," broadcast Tuesday, that the United States
would not set any timetable or deadline for U.S. peacekeeping
troops if they are sent to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We really learned a lesson in Bosnia that setting an
artificial deadline doesn't work" Albright said in an interview
with the ABC TV program "Good Morning America."
</P>
<P>
"What one needs to do is to put down benchmarks," she added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Bill Clinton, when announcing his
intention to dispatch some 4,000 troops to Kosovo, said the troops
would be brought back home in a year.
</P>
<P>
Albright has said a NATO peacekeeping force had to be part of
any settlement for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
If there is a settlement between the Serbs and ethnic Albanians
on Kosovo, some 4,000 U.S. troops would be part of a NATO force of
about 28,000. Once the NATO troops enter the province, Kosovo will
set the stage as NATO has planned for election to implement
self-rule. And that would mean control of the province by the
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeepers also would disarm Serb and Albanian forces and
clear the way for setting up a local police force.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. troops would stay in Kosovo as long as
it takes to deal with those "benchmarks."
</P>
<P>
"So we're not putting that down as a period of time," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has briefed Congress on its plan to
dispatch U.S. troops to Kosovo, but is not seeking authorization.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has a constitutional right to send the Americans to the
Serb province without Congress' approval.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Schedule Almost Back to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Operations at American
Airlines were nearly back on track Tuesday, a sharp contrast to
the past 10 days during which about 6,000 flights were canceled
due to a pilot sickout.
</P>
<P>
The Fort Worth-based airline has canceled 56 flights Tuesday,
according to information posted on the carrier's web site.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Tim Smith called operations "virtually normal as the
pilots' sick list continues to shrink."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, talks between American's parent company, AMR
Corporation, and the Allied Pilots Association over the
integration of the recently purchased Reno Air were scheduled to
pick up.
</P>
<P>
Talks broke down earlier this month as a dispute over how the
Reno pilots were being paid caused pilots to start calling in sick
and refused to work overtime.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 800 of American's 9,400 pilots were still listed as
sick Monday, compared to the nearly 2,500 who declared themselves
unfit to fly last Thursday and Friday, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to American, pilots have been taking themselves off
the sick list at a rapid rate since last Saturday after a federal
judge rule held the union and two top board members in contempt
and promised sizable fines against them.
</P>
<P>
Some 250 -- or roughly 11 percent -- of the 2,250 flights
scheduled were canceled Monday because some pilots weren't
immediately available for flying.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 6,000 flights have been canceled since the work action
began, costing American between 67 million and 90 million U.S.
dollars, according to the airlines.

</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who have been in a unknown place since he left Rome in
January, was seen most recently in Kenya.
</P>

ANKARA -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz Tuesday
expressed his hope that Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey will
not be used by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Aziz arrived in Ankara on Sunday for talks with Turkish Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit on the Incirlik base, the tense ties
between Turkey and Iraq and the latest developments in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The visit by Aziz was aimed at persuading Turkey to stop the
use of Incirlik base by the U.S. warplanes for the enforcement of
the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said in Baghdad on
Monday that Iraq will attack the U.S. air base in Incirlik as its
request for Ankara to prevent the use of the base for the
U.S.-British strikes in Iraq was rejected. (BC-Turkey-Iraq)

ANKARA -- Turkey Tuesday called for some countries to step up
security around its representative institutions in their states
against possible attacks to Turkish citizens.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21 foreign ambassadors in Ankara were summoned to
the Turkish Foreign Ministry Tuesday and were briefed on the
latest developments regarding the capture of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The call came after the Turkish rebel leader, Ocalan, was
arrested by Turkey, which triggered widespread demonstrations by
Kurds in many countries. (BC-Turkey-PKK)

JERUSALEM -- Israel denied Tuesday that it had played a role
in the capture of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan by Turkey, with
which it has close military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after a German news agency quoted western
intelligence officials as saying that Israel's foreign
intelligence agency, Mossad, had played a decisive role in
Ocalan's capture by delivering important message to Turkey.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Acts to Defend GM Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government has acted
to try to defend the genetically-modified (GM) food as the pressure
for a ban on GM foods intensifies.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair Tuesday gave his backing to Lord
Sainsbury, the Science Minister, who was revealed by a British
newspaper about his business connections to controversial GM food.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian reported that for 11 years Lord Sainsbury, former
chairman of one of Britain's biggest supermarket chains, had
indirectly owned the patent rights over a key gene used in the gene
modification process.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Blair told journalists that Sainsbury would not
resign from his job as junior minister at the Department of Trade and
Industry, was responsible for science policy.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street stepped into the GM food row Monday by saying
the Prime Minister ate it himself, insisting all products on
supermarket shelves were safe.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Minister for Food Safety Jeff Rooker told the
House of Commons the public could have "confidence" in GM foods,
despite growing concerns.
</P>
<P>
The public's safety was the government's first priority, he told
the MPs in a special Commons statement.
</P>
<P>
Rooker said all GM foods passed through "a process of very
thorough scrutiny by a committee of experts" before being released
for public consumption.
</P>
<P>
He added that GM foods were a development that could be a "huge
potential benefit to society" and may stop tons of chemicals being
dumped onto crops.
</P>
<P>
However, environmental and consumers groups meanwhile are
demanding a five year ban on the moratorium on GM food and crops.
</P>
<P>
Some 29 organizations, including Friends of the Earth,
Greenpeace, Tuesday launched a new campaign for a five-year ban on
the commercial growing of the GM foods and experiments with biotech
crops in the UK.
</P>
<P>
"A five year freeze would allow more detailed research on the
potential impacts", a spokesman from the campaign group said.
